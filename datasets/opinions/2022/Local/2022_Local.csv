suffolknewsherald_2022_177,"Published 5:28 pm Tuesday, February 8, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceI completed a child abuse recognition and prevention course recently. Those courses are always hard to view, but I’m grateful that organizations and the government strive to help those who work with children better understand and recognize all forms of abuse.All sane and moral people agree that child abuse is reprehensible. Child abuse is outlawed, offenses are taken seriously, and the government has plans to assist abused children. Likewise, many organizations aim to help children who are victims. It’s good that we take child abuse seriously. We should. It’s horrendous.However, there is a terrible trend in our country today that we don’t call abuse, but that is inflicting untold damage to children. It’s a trend that has been happening all around us, and it is largely overlooked. In many cases, it’s even become acceptable.This trend is parents who live with their children but place no effort into raising their children into responsible adults. Kids are treated as roommates more than young lives that need shaping.Parents who fall into this category often make sure their children have food to eat, clothes to wear, and a house in which to live. Therefore, it can seem like everything is OK, but a deeper look shows a sad and unfortunate reality.Kids who fall into this tragic category have food to eat, but no one to teach them about nutrition, make sure they are eating properly, teach them how to cook or sit around the table with them for a meal.They have clothes to wear, but no one to help them prepare for the day by considering the weather or the climate of the locations they will be visiting.They have a house, but there is no home in which they are surrounded by adults who guide them, teach them, protect them and discipline them.There are parents in the home, but the children are orphans. They grow up, but they are never raised. This tragedy appears to be growing exponentially, and it’s being largely ignored.There are many reasons this problem is growing, but a few stick out to me.Many view children as little adults who should be allowed to make every decision for themselves without the interference of others. This is wrong. Children are developing physically, emotionally and mentally. They need parental guidance, including rules, discipline, structure and love. Children are not yet capable of making every decision for themselves. It may sound like a kind and gentle gesture, but, in actuality, it’s abuse.Sometimes, like with other forms of abuse, adults place themselves above the wellbeing of their children. Free time, pleasure and entertainment for parents take priority over children.The most tragic of reasons for this type of abuse is that some parents, who themselves were orphans with parents, have no idea of what children need, causing this tragic cycle to continue.We, as a country, must recognize and help fix this problem, but we cannot take steps to help until we acknowledge the tragedy of children who are orphans with parents.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_3,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°The wake of an election in which millions of Americans in diverse districts nationwide made their voices heard is the perfect time to remember: While increasing numbers of Americans may spend ever more time online, whether on Twitter or YouTube or Facebook or even (ugh in the metaverse, in the ways that matter most, we continue to be rooted here in the real world.Our kids go to local schools; we worry about local crime trends (or don’t ; the local weather spoils our weekend plans; our laws are shaped by local officials. The work-from-home revolution notwithstanding, more often than not we work in jobs dependent on the local economy. We root for local sports teams and find inspiration in local culture. If we ever took any of this for granted, the COVID-19 pandemic and its painful dislocations should’ve set us straight.One of the most powerful forces that hold our communities together is local news. It is as essential as ever — but more threatened than ever.For decades now, Google, Facebook, Twitter and other online platforms have been clobbering outlets across the country that first and foremost serve their towns, suburbs and cities. Leveraging anticompetitive practices, they have profited off the journalism that reporters and editors work long hours to produce, in the process essentially cornering the market on online advertising, leaving those who get the news fighting over scraps.The math is grim. Over the last two decades, U.S. newspaper circulation has dropped by half. The vast majority of U.S. counties with no regular newspaper are in rural areas.After years spent lamenting the state of affairs, Congress finally, finally has a plan to bolster these outlets — print, broadcast and online alike. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act would create a six-year “safe harbor” from antitrust laws for media companies so that they can collectively negotiate the terms under which their content is distributed online.Reset the table. Shift the balance of power. Do it in this lame-duck Congress. Give local media a fighting chance.— New York Daily News"
suffolknewsherald_2022_17,"Published 1:13 am Saturday, August 6, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonColumnistNo one doubts we are today in an era of changing times.The 21st century dawned in 2001. The fast-moving past two decades are like a picture of the nearby ocean as it rolls in and out. The water left behind is soon swallowed up and only sand is left until the next wave overtakes it. A visual image can capture the scene.Such is our vague reminder of history, both as we daily experienced it in the past and as it was written down for us in the Bible. We do well when we remember that God has never lost control of what he planned from the beginning of creation. He set down laws but changes through the millennia often left the prophets and the people wondering what would happen next, just as we are left wondering in our day.Like Israel and Judah in the millennia before Christ, we have become a divided nation, politically and morally. Both they and we once believed God gave us the blessings of the land, but in time he became an unwanted guest. The desire for his just laws as found in Leviticus and Deuteronomy are no longer appreciated as authority for a better life. A younger generation is a changed generation politically and morally.Proposed changes in our Constitution along with changes in word usage and meanings, body and body language, civility and law are all proliferating. The words “transition” and “transitioning” are reminders our culture is changing and with it a change in language.Referring to a baby as a fetus when it is being destroyed tends to “soften” the reality until we realize more than 62 million of them die that painful death each year. If the emphasis was placed on the human “intervention” — how that baby came to be — it might bring on some changes in our thinking. God’s plan was love for babies. Even the non-human creation understands that and lovingly cares for its young.Biblical world history tells us what we can expect when we reject God. Almost 3 millennia ago Assyria captured the 10 tribes of Israel and took them out of their land. We know little of their scattered records. Judah and the remaining two tribes had a moment of repentance before they returned to sinful ways and were overtaken by Babylon. The land was decimated. The Medo-Persian empire was the home of Daniel when he wrote about future events and coming kingdoms.In the BC/BCE era between Malachi and Matthew, a conqueror named Alexander the Great led Greece into victory until his exhausted army was stopped in India, sometime around 300 BC. Rome was the next world ruler of prominence.Not all changes were bad, but with power and brutality came weapons of hatred, not peace. The world was still in turmoil, its leaders vying for political and religious control when Jesus was born.Jesus’ message told those who listened how to make changes. They had to give up the right to themselves. “You must be born again,” he said (John 3. It was his willingness to die for our sins that can bring the needed change, but there can be no drive-thru experience. Our trust in God for change must be a firm commitment to what he has planned.In God’s economy there is never a road for turning back. God will forgive our sins if we ask, bringing the change of eternal life.The aspirations and inspirations we had for this 21st century are now outdated. Future historians may regard the phenomenon that was America just a relic of the past. The illusion that we can battle anything without God is destined to fail.Our own BC (Before COVID-19 era — like the one before Jesus came — was changed by king COVID-19’s domination. We desperately need to turn our hearts and lives back to God for our salvation from the evil that seems determined to undo us.It will come only when we ask his forgiveness for our sinful ways.

minnpost_2022_118,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The large social and cultural shifts that began after the murder of George Floyd – and the lingering economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic – have some of Minnesota’s small businesses feeling left behind as economic recovery continues.Many small businesses still lack access to the support services they need to grow, hire and thrive in a changed economy. This limits opportunity and compounds the inequities that hold back small business owners.How we address income inequality depends on how well we support our small business communities. We know we must scale capital availability and provide small businesses with essential resources, particularly for BIPOC and historically underrepresented communities.We also know that Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs – nonprofit, mission-driven community lenders – are helping small business owners realize opportunities through community collaboration and partnership. These small business solutions – conceived and deployed by co-creation and community input – should foster inclusion for Minnesota’s communities and small businesses that have been historically under-resourced.Inclusion also means providing access and agency for these small business owners and communities. Entrepreneurs must be able to navigate the complexities of the small business support ecosystem and we must ensure we have the tools to help them succeed.That’s why we – as mission-driven, nonprofit organizations – have partnered to create a blueprint for changing the way capital and resources flow to Minnesota’s small business communities.The Minnesota Inclusive Growth Fund (MIGF or Fund is a new, collaborative small business financing initiative that provides small business loans and resources to for-profit businesses in the state of Minnesota.MIGF is the product of a unique collaboration between five leading Minnesota-based small business support organizations, collectively called the Catalyst Coalition. The Fund is designed to support long-term recovery, growth, and business resiliency in low-to-moderate income and underbanked communities.MIGF is designed to give Minnesota small business owners new opportunities for recovery and growth in the wake of transformative economic change. The Fund helps equip small businesses with the financing and technical assistance support required to meet the unique rebuilding and recovery needs of the communities they serve.The goal for MIGF is the near- and long-term success of the businesses that sustain communities and create economic impact in Minnesota. We want to see businesses remain open, creating good paying jobs and supporting their communities on a sustainable path toward greater resiliency.The Fund offers two types of loans for small businesses, one for businesses seeking working capital and another for growth-stage businesses seeking a loan for capital expenditures. To be eligible, small businesses must employ 20 or fewer full-time equivalent employees or have less than $3 million in revenue in 2019.In addition, businesses must have suffered a direct economic disruption because of COVID-19 or civil unrest in a way that has materially impacted operations, with an emphasis given to businesses located in low-to-moderate-income areas and under-resourced communities served by the participating mission-driven lenders.Small business owners can learn more about the fund athttp: www.mngrowthfund.com.This type of collaboration is an example of the transformational change we need to better support Minnesota’s small businesses. Without implementing collaborative, community-driven solutions like MIGF, persistent gaps in access and agency will continue to hold back Minnesota’s small business communities and make economic recovery more difficult.We have the opportunity and the will to do the hard work of improving access to both financial and non-financial resources in our small business communities. Together we can change the narrative and commit ourselves to helping increase economic mobility for all Minnesotans.Anisha Murphy, Esq. is vice president of Community Advancement, Community Reinvestment Fund, Gene Gelgelu is president & CEO of African Economic Development Solutions (AEDS ,Henry Jiménez, is the executive director of Latino Economic Development Center (LEDC ,Alfredo Martel is president & CEO of Metropolitan Economic Development Association (MEDA andWarren McLean is president of Northside Economic Opportunity Network (NEON ."
leoweekly_2022_49,"They cut taxes, big time. They agreed on the state’s basic policy document, the budget for the next two years, and much more And they did it a lot of it with little or no public scrutiny.That’s how the Kentucky General Assembly operates these days, in an era when Republicans rule unchallenged – and few journalists are on hand to witness the proceedings and ask the questions that can be the most important: How did this legislation get passed? And why?This column was started Tuesday night March 29 on the Senate floor, when your correspondent was the only journalist in the chamber, other than KET’s camera crew. You could watch it online, but you couldn’t walk around the floor and ask those questions like I could. In the House, reporters aren’t even allowed on the floor anymore.Democrats once had super-duper majorities, but they were more diverse philosophically, and there were enough potential conservative Democratic bolters on many issues to give hope to the Republican minorities. Today, party-line votes are more common, and Democrats have little leverage. The only major bill with close floor votes this year was the one to fund charter schools because many rural legislators see it as a threat to public education.The compromise208-page billto cut the income tax to 4% from 5%, and phase it out completely if revenues allow, hit the Senate floor Tuesday about two and a half hours after leaving the committee. Democratic Leader Morgan McGarvey of Louisville said during the floor debate that it still wasn’t available on the legislative website. “It deserves input and scrutiny from every member of the body from every part of the state,” he said, adding later that with tax bills, “every word in every line of every page matter, and we are rushing this to passage.”Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson, in her 24th year as a legislator, said she was “pretty comfortable with some of the work that’s been done, but this is not the way to do it.” She also voted no.Later, she told me that the pandemic gave the legislature “the perfect reason not to have the stakeholder input” that the process needs. “We don’t have much of a committee process anymore,” she said, adding that the shortage of journalists reduces “accountability and transparency … People get very comfortable in their solitude.”Senate President Robert Stivers, obligingly answering questions as usual during a recess, argued that the process is no different than it was when Democrats ruled and that the Senate is in some ways more transparent than it was under his predecessor, David Williams. But after more than 40 years of covering the General Assembly, I can say with a high level of confidence that it is different, and it’s not better.That being said, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has shown that he can practice the dark arts on a par with legislators, in a shabby episode in which both sides played politics with poor Kentuckians’ food benefits.Republicans passed a resolution to end the pandemic state of emergency about a month earlier than the April 14 date they had set in January, and politics appeared to be the clearest motive. The resolution’s sponsor was Sen. Donald Douglas of Nicholasville, who won a special election in December; he is in a primary with Andrew Cooperrider of Lexington, who was a prominent foe of Beshear’s pandemic restrictions and is not the sort of outspoken fire-breather Republicans want in their caucus. He has said the measure was designed to hurt him.Beshear vetoed the resolution, saying it would end the $100 extra monthly benefit that the emergency allowed 544,000 Kentuckians on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly food stamps. (The regular SNAP benefit is $243. In overriding the veto, Senate Republicans said federal law allowed Beshear to apply for an extra month after the end of the emergency. Asked if he had looked into that, Beshear didn’t respond directly and merely repeated his charge that the legislature was playing politics. A few days later, he quietly applied for the extra month of benefits.We can expect politics to be played in the Capitol.

suffolknewsherald_2022_40,"Published 6:18 pm Tuesday, July 12, 2022ByStaff ReportsBuzz is building about a possible 2024 presidential bid by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and for good reason. Or actually several good reasons.First, Virginia governors who are reasonably popular always make the presidential speculation lists because of the fact that they are limited to a single term and thus can’t be accused of job-hopping. By the time the 2024 race begins in earnest, Youngkin will be in the second half of his four-year term and itching for his next race.Second, Republicans nationally, as they become more open-minded to a 2024 nominee other than former President Donald Trump, have to be mighty tempted to pick a candidate who can win a purple state. Youngkin, in a speech over the weekend to party faithful in Nebraska, labeled Virginia “deep blue,” a slight exaggeration of his political acumen. But it’s true that Virginia had been getting steadily bluer for a decade or more, until Youngkin shocked pundits with his win over Terry McAuliffe last fall.Move Virginia to the GOP column in the Electoral College, as Youngkin would likely ensure, and the math gets a lot easier for Republicans. Youngkin, who is far less abrasive than Trump and even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the assumed alternative should Trump not be the nominee in 2024, is most likely among the three to put states like Arizona and Pennsylvania back in red on the national map.In beating McAuliffe, Youngkin proved masterful at making the Democrat pay for unpopular positions (i.e., marginalization of parents in public school decision-making and broad-brush condemnation of law enforcement while minimizing the impact of his own political liabilities (i.e., abortion restrictions and his tap-dance with Trump . It’s a style and playbook that could play well far beyond Virginia.“Gov. Youngkin showed the country what the future of the Republican Party can be,” Ray Washburne, a wealthy businessman and Republican donor in Dallas, told the Washington Examiner recently. “Youngkin is the fresh new voice the party, and country, needs.”The governor is doing little to dampen the speculation. He’s hitting the national speaking circuit (he spoke over the weekend at the Nebraska Republican Party’s state convention and raised $2.64 million for his political action committee during the first six months of the year. That’s more than double what his three immediate predecessors raised during their first six months in office.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_84,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Councilman’s responseCouncilman’s responseThis is to address a letter to the editor by Neal F. Herbert, the vice-chairperson of the county’s Cost of Government Commission, in which he criticized me for proposing two charter amendments (Your Views, Nov. 20 .Under our current charter, the director of Public Works is required to be a registered professional engineer, and the director of Environmental Management needs to have a degree in engineering or “a related field,” whatever that means. In a nutshell, the two amendments which I proposed would simply allow for a wider pool of candidates to qualify for those two positions, with a particular emphasis on those possessing administrative and managerial skills. Nothing in those two bills would preclude the selection of an engineer for those directorships, but it would also open the door for others with different skill sets to vie for those jobs as well.Mr. Herbert is a registered civil engineer, so I certainly understand his fierce defense of the status quo, but I really didn’t see any need for him to throw hurtful words such as “abhorrent,” “irresponsible,” “ludicrous,” “political” and “laughable,” my way (OK, I admit to using the word “irresponsible” when addressing Mr. Herbert and the chairperson of the Cost of Government Commission during a presentation they made to the council this past week, so that’s on me, but it was only after they had confessed, without any inkling of remorse, that their public declaration of a program of the county as being “wasteful” was based on information they had received from only one source and without allowing the program providers a fair opportunity to provide their perspective. That’s not how thoughtful deliberation is supposed to be carried out, in my opinion . In Mr. Herbert’s hyper-fixation to berate me, I think he may have lost sight of the point of the two proposals, and that’s unfortunate because they are both intended to help our community.Look, I love engineers. After all, where would the world be without them? But at the same time, we shouldn’t ignore that the engineering profession has a heavy gender-bias in favor of men. These proposals would enhance gender-equity in the hiring of some of our top county administrators. I don’t think that’s a bad thing or one worthy of ridicule.What Mr. Herbert found as being particularly objectionable was my inclusion within the list of qualified professions, a person with a law degree. I happen to be a lawyer and have a high regard for what people with legal training can bring to the table. However, if the council finds it abhorrent, irresponsible, ludicrous, laughable, as Mr. Herbert does, or perhaps just inadvisable to have a lawyer be considered for appointment to the position, it is well within their power to delete it from the proposal.Before they do that, though, I think it’s worth pointing out that over the past 10 years or so, one director and a deputy director of the Department of Environmental Management and two deputy directors of the Department of Public Works have been lawyers. All three deputies were pulled from the Corporation Counsel’s office, including the person that holds that position right now. All were and are capable individuals.There is one matter that Mr. Herbert and I seem to agree on: the problem with recruiting persons for those positions. There haven’t been a lot of persons busting down the door to apply for either the Public Works or Environmental Management directorships when they become open, and that’s a problem. Mr. Herbert attributes that to insufficient pay and the lack of tenure and job security, both of which are addressed in the Cost of Government Commission’s recommendations. I’m not going to disparage their ideas, but I just think that an inclusive approach, rather than an exclusive one, would be a better solution for our island’s people.Aaron ChungHawaii County Council memberBOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

I lived in a refugee camp in Kenya for four years before God blessed me with Philadelphia.Over the years, immigrants from all over the world have fled conflict, religious persecution, political discord, natural disasters, and other perils to build new lives for themselves in Philadelphia. Like the busloads of recent arrivalssent to us this month from the southern border, they left behind their former homes to create new ones in a place where William Penn prayed residents would bekept from the evil that would overwhelm thee.Here are a few of their stories.1 To Philly from Gaza: ‘When you’re a refugee, it feels like you don’t belong anywhere’2 To Philly from Ukraine: ‘My kids can’t get over how big the supermarkets are’3 To Philly from Afghanistan: ‘I miss everything’4 To Philly from Vietnam: ‘Immigrants should not be used as scapegoats’5 To Philly from Uganda: ‘Philadelphia is my sweet home’LGBTQ people in Uganda face discrimination,harassment by the government, and violence.

I was 28 when I entered the Kakuma refugee camp — a day’s bus ride away — in neighboring Kenya on Nov. 14, 2014.It wasn’t much better.Temperatures in the camp reached more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit and there were dust storms. The wind was so strong it would blow the tents down. Some people preferred to sleep outside, but that wasn’t easy — there are a lot of dark things in the desert, including spiders, snakes, and scorpions. Outbreaks of malaria, pneumonia, and cholera did not spare refugees.As LGBTQ people, we were not supposed to be mixed with other refugees, who also discriminated against us. But instead of putting us somewhere safe, we were placed at the end of the camp, where we would get randomly attacked by people from outside the camp. We provided our own security and took turns standing guard overnight. Still, it wasn’t enough to keep ourselves safe, andsome of us lost our lives.

suffolknewsherald_2022_209,"Published 4:30 pm Tuesday, January 11, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceThe last few years have been difficult, and the start of this year has many people throwing up their hands in despair. At the beginning of the year, a popular post on social media pointed out that 2022 can be pronounced as 2020, too. I guess hopes for a better year aren’t too high.The hesitation to embrace 2022 is understandable. It hasn’t even been two full weeks into the new year, but it doesn’t seem that things are getting much better. COVID numbers are high, inflation is growing, and businesses are still struggling to staff their locations. Many people seem on edge, fighting over nearly everything, and the political strife from the past few years certainly hasn’t calmed down.It has been challenging, and entering a new year with so much uncertainty can be difficult. It can be hard to enter this new year with a fresh hope, but I have a few ideas that might help.We can begin by grieving what was lost over the past few years. Things have been moving so quickly, and it doesn’t seem that many of us have stopped to process what has happened or allowed ourselves to grieve. It’s hard to move forward into a new phase of our own lives and of our nation if we haven’t processed and grieved what was lost. It’s OK to pause to allow ourselves to heal.Next, we can take the time to appreciate and focus on all that remains. It seems that the past few years have taken something from everyone, but they haven’t taken everything. It’s easy to stay focused on all that has been lost in the past two years, but shifting our minds to the good things that are still around us can help us move forward.Being grateful for the good things that are still in our lives doesn’t mean that we can’t be sad about what was lost. It’s possible to be grieving and grateful. A change of focus only means that we will not let what was lost keep us from appreciating and enjoying what remains.We can also be proud of ourselves for making it through these difficult times and of our work during these times. The last two years were extremely different than we anticipated, and many of us worked hard in uncharted territory. Those who have done their best to keep moving forward while helping others who were struggling should hold their heads up high.Lastly, we can continue the work to make the world a brighter place.

suffolknewsherald_2022_136,"Published 6:39 pm Tuesday, March 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsSpring is always a good time to tidy up, and the City of Suffolk is making it easy this year with several convenient ways to get rid of unsightly or unwanted clutter.Keep Suffolk Beautiful is hosting a Recycling Drive and Tire Amnesty Day for Suffolk residents from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. this Saturday at the Public Works Operations facility at 800 Carolina Road. This is a free event and a great chance for folks doing their spring cleaning to recycle and responsibly dispose of items around the house, garage, shed and backyard.The Suffolk Sheriff’s Office and Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office will be on site to manage free document shredding. Sheriff E.C. Harris reminds us that shredding has merit beyond decluttering.“We look forward to working with the public and reinforcing the importance of protecting themselves against identity theft and to encourage this opportunity for safe document disposal,” he said. “Identity theft is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the nation and we look forward to educating the public and helping out.”Deputies will be available to answer questions about identification protection. Please note that during busy times, residents will be limited to three grocery bags of documents.“Tire amnesty” is also part of the event. Residents are encouraged to bring unwanted rimless tires that are 22 inches or less. There are no limits on the number of tires a homeowner can bring, but you must show proof of Suffolk residency. Tires from commercial businesses will not be accepted.Other items that will be accepted for disposal or recycling electronics (except for tube TVs or TVs larger than 42 inches , gently used clothing, wares, batteries, plastic bottles and jugs No. 1 and No. 2, cardboard, paper, magazines, plastic bags, large appliances, scrap metal and glass containers.SPSA Waste Solutions will collect household hazardous waste from any resident with a Suffolk ID. This includes oil, gasoline, antifreeze, cleaners, propane tanks, paint, pesticides, CFL lightbulbs and more. The disposal of such items is limited to five gallons of liquid or 75 pounds of solid waste.We agree with Kathy Russell, chairman of Keep Suffolk Beautiful, who says that “recycling comes in so many forms – not just paper, bottles, and cans. Help us be a good steward of the Earth by recycling items over and above what can be put in your blue recycling cart.”For more information on Saturday’s events, visithttp: www.suffolkva.us/339/Recycling-Drives, call 757-514 7604 or email: ksb@suffolkva.usOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_92,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°It could be that America has finally inoculated itself against this dangerous virus. No, not the coronavirus — but election disinformation. An encouraging trend in last week’s midterms was that the predictable lies and conspiracy theories slung around by Donald Trump and his acolytes apparently weren’t able to get a foothold outside the right-wing base the way they did in 2020.Part of why Trump could sow such doubt about election integrity during the 2020 election was the sheer audacity of his phony claims. With zero evidence, he kept making the claims again and again, counting on the force of repetition and wishful thinking among Republicans to legitimize the lie. Perhaps because Americans had never before seen a president behave like this, too many made the mistake of assuming there must be something to it.There wasn’t, of course and, two years later, Trump’s act is apparently wearing thin.A key strategy Trump employed last time was to seize on the routine glitches that always happen in major elections — mechanical malfunctions, late reporting of the numbers, swings in the results as new batches of ballots arrive — and make it sound like something nefarious.So when a third of the ballot tabulators in Arizona’s Maricopa County malfunctioned last week, Trumpist gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and right-wing media talkers wasted no time connecting dots that weren’t there. “We need honest elections. … The system we have right now does not work,” Lake told supporters on election night, maligning hard-working election volunteers and democracy itself over what amounted to a technical problem with printer toner being too light.“Here we go again?” Trump himself wrote on his Truth Social media platform. “The people will not stand for it!!!”But this and other sound and fury ultimately signified nothing. The county’s top election official, a Republican, assured the public that the problem had been identified and all the votes would be counted — and the public moved on. Even Trump seemed to sense that the shtick wasn’t working this time. As The New York Times reported, he eventually dropped his online narratives about supposed fraud and instead turned his rhetorical guns on Republican candidates who’d lost.Meanwhile, Trump-endorsed election deniers running for state positions that oversee elections — the nightmare scenario — found their fraudulent messages falling on deaf ears again and again. Trumpist secretary of state candidates in Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona all lost. So did Republican Doug Mastriano, running for Pennsylvania governor, a job that includes appointing the secretary of state there. Mastriano had all but promised to fill the post with a fellow election denier.“Election deniers are losers tonight,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., one of the few congressional Republicans with the courage to defy Trump’s lies. If last week’s results put more of his GOP colleagues in that column, it’s a win for America.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
suffolknewsherald_2022_56,"Published 12:00 pm Wednesday, June 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Dylan WestEditor’s note:The Suffolk Public Library, in conjunction with its annual Iconicon fandom convention, sponsored a writing contest. Contestants were asked to write a short story under 1,000 words about what heroic fantasy characters do in their “downtime.” Here’s the winning entry.Knights shouldn’t climb trees. We ride horses and swing swords, of which I do plenty by day. But come evening, while the men carouse in taverns, I shimmy up these towering trees. Bartenders serve nothing so sweet as criffel nectar, and this is the only place to find it.From 90 feet up, I should see clear across Esenval, but neighboring trees fill my view in this dense forest. Perched in a tangle of branches, I reach for the red fruit that seldom falls. A pigeon swoops down and snatches it away. It settles on the tiny limbs above and scarfs it down. I groan. But then sunlight glints off its leg.A message canister.The other pigeons bear the same. I whistle, and the nearest flaps over and lands on my outstretched hand. I slip out the scroll from the thin metal tube and grin.It’s a sappy love letter from a Gromalti nobleman to an Esenvali seamstress. Romance between our rival kingdoms is forbidden, so they should’ve encoded this. I return the message and shoo the bird away. Their secret’s safe with me.My fruit lust forgotten, I call other birds and read more juicy secrets. Who knew those militant Gromalti cared about more than fighting? I expected battle plans, but these are only personal notes. Still, I can’t help myself.***“Lady Koriet, have you been climbing again?” Sir Vonerin looks up from his maps. “Recklessness is no way to win yourself an armor bearer. And you’ll need one to drag your broken bones back to the castle if you should fall.”Vonerin’s my mentor, not my father, so he can’t forbid me. “Climbing makes me strong,” I say.He swats away my words. “Go perform a deed of renown. Earn your armor bearer before the summer campaigns. I vouched for you. Show me you were worth it.”***I perch high in the forest again, this time deeper in where more birds gather. The familiar clink of metal draws my eyes downward. Two knights in chain mail lounge on fallen logs while two others spar in full plate. Their armor and guttural speech are distinctly Gromalti. I inch my way behind the tree trunk, praying they didn’t see me.The larger knight sends the smaller onto his back with a flurry of sword strokes. Their spectators clap.“That maneuver never gets old, Sir Jines!” one calls out.The other men cycle in to face this Jines, and he overwhelms each one. He even bests two at the same time. His technique is fast and clean, but I come to predict his moves. I could beat him.But let’s hope I never have to.This side of the tree has a fruit I overlooked earlier. I reach out, and a large, black bird lands beside me. Never saw one this big. I almost miss the leg canister because its dark finish blends in with the feathers. With a shaky hand, I fish out the scroll, unsure if this predator will peck my eyes out. Thankfully, it attacks the fruit instead.Like the others, this writing is Gromalti. But unlike the others, it’s encoded.***“Where’d you get this?” Spymaster Analof says.I tell him.His head snaps back. “But criffel trees have no branches until the very top!” He squints down at the parchment, eyes calculating. “The bird you describe has never carried messages before, so we never thought to check it. Clever.” His lips part in a smile. “I’ll set my men on this at once. Meanwhile, bring us more. That’ll help us break this new cipher. Our enemies are plotting something.”***A week passes, and I send the spymaster five more scrolls. Today will make six. The four who usually camp below are now gone. Odd. On my perch, I whistle for a black bird when an arrow thuds into the branch above me. I jerk my gaze down and freeze.The Gromalti have returned, and one holds a bow. He reaches back for another arrow as the other three swagger toward my tree, eyes squinting up. But then the archer collapses to the forest floor with a crossbow bolt stuck in his breastplate.The swordsmen turn and charge at a stranger who leaps from a thicket. The man drops his crossbow and draws a sword I recognize from way up here.Sir Vonerin.He slices down on one man’s helm so hard I think it breaks his neck. But the other two close in, and Vonerin stumbles.I slide down the tree in a panic, almost losing my grip. On the ground, I draw my poniard, sneak up behind the nearest foe, and ram the fine tip through a loop in his mail. While he sags to the dirt, I pull out my war hammer to face Jines, who knocked Vonerin down and bounds my way.“Run, Koriet!” Vonerin shouts.Jines lashes out with his usual lunging swipe, and I duck at the last instant. As momentum carries him past, I rise and slam my hammer down on the back of his helm. The metal dents into his skull with a crunch. He crumples flat, limbs splayed. I step over his body and lift my mentor. With his arm slung over my shoulder, I help him limp away.“How did you beat him?” Vonerin rasps.I shrug. “Climbing made me strong.”He laughs, which becomes a racking cough. “Made you clever, too.”“No. I endangered you,” I mutter. “I should’ve heeded your warnings.”“Bah! I was a fool. Your climbing saved us,” he says. “Analof decoded the messages. Gromalt marches on our capital next week. Because of you, we’ll be ready. You’ve earned your armor bearer and much more, and His Majesty knows of your work here. Today, He appoints you to His war council. Your unconventional thinking will aid us in the battles to come.”After a long pause, he adds, “You were worth vouching for, Lady Tree Climber.”Dylan West, a Chesapeake resident, is a web developer, video game developer, Navy veteran and self-described foreign language nut.

minnpost_2022_159,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The Importance of a quality transportation system cannot be overstated. Our highway system, railroads and airports are essential to economic growth and development and also to the simplistic purpose of moving people from place to place. As the next election approaches, it is important that we foster an effective dialogue with our public officials regarding the under-represented issue of transportation and those being left behind by the current system, particularly those with disabilities.While, more than a third of the country simply hails a car through a transportation network company (TNC such as Uber or Lyft with the push of a button to travel quickly and at minimal cost, many members of the disability community are stuck in the position of having to schedule rides days or even weeks in advance with little to no assurance of punctuality and a high cost if they require para-transit services.While we need to continue to move forward by finding innovative solutions that address transportation disparities, we shouldn’t settle for solutions that are leaving people behind. As it stands, the vehicles of a transportation network company and accommodating vehicles are not available and para-transit is expensive and hard to plan for. Partnerships with TNCs are probably not ideal long term answer but the technology and existing systems can be used in development of more sustainable answers.State, counties and municipalities basically have two viable options in providing ride share services to individuals with disabilities that meet accessibility regulations and are available via smart phone.The first choice is simply to develop regulations that mandate a certain percentage of a TNCs vehicle fleet meet federal accessibility standards. The second is for the state to leverage technologies similar to those used by Uber and Lyft to provide a comparable option.While TNCs and taxi companies differ in business structure, they both provide the same type of on-demand service from point A to point B. Many taxi companies have even rolled out GPS tracking to keep up with competition from companies like Lyft. Their vehicles are also much more likely to be accessible.It is the 21st century and now is the optimal time for public agencies to implement a smartphone app tracking and payment system coupled with on-demand service. The technology is already developed, and it is abundantly evident that there is a need for the service.Agencies could roll out the service in pieces, beginning with the ability to track your ride online, which would eliminate the long wait times associated with para-transit servicesNaturally, developing and providing this type of service will come at a cost.Most TNCs subsidize their trips to keep rides cheap enough to balance the need to maintain a solid customer base, while paying drivers enough to maintain a large fleet. These subsidies come straight out of the pockets of private companies.Each ride on public transit agency para-transit is subsidized by tax dollars, adding cost to the population as a whole. Even with the public subsidies, para-transit rides cost more than the typical bus fare.Public agencies would be able to fill more vehicles to higher capacity with carpooling models. By utilizing the existing fleet more efficiently they can provide faster service, thus improving service quality.Extra seats in vehicles could also be used to pick up carpool customers who do not require accessible vehicles, but who are traveling along similar routes.We live in an era of innovation where we have the potential to change systems and find real solutions to transportation disparities but before we move forward, we need to stop and contemplate how we are going to use modern day technology to improve access to transportation options.TNCs are a very plausible option with real-time information and mobile ride hailing and payment options, and that there is a demand for them. But effective policy is inclusive of everyone and it’s time to include the disability community be given a seat at the table in the development of such policiesNoah McCourt is an autistic self-advocate and the founder and executive director of the Minnesota Disability Justice Network.

philinquirer_2022_32,"Keeping Columbus and adding a statue of Chief Tamanend would place our national reckoning over race and history — including discrimination against Italian-Americans — in vivid display.According to Native American and progressive activists,Christopher Columbus was a genocidal warriorwho helped spark centuries of slavery, racism, and imperialism. To many Italian Americans, by contrast, he remains asymbol of bravery and pridein the face of oppression.Guess what? They’re both right.That’s why, instead ofremoving Columbus from Marconi Plaza, we should add a second statue. And we already have a great candidate, right here in Philadelphia: the statue of Lenni-Lenape chief Tamanend, which is currently languishing near the I-95 entrance at Front and Market Streets.Moving Tamanend to Marconi would put him front and center, where he belongs. And it would also place our national reckoning over race and history in vivid display.Moving Tamanend to Marconi would put him front and center, where he belongs.The termreckoninghas been part of our national lexiconsince the 2020 police murder of George Floyd, which triggered widespread demands to appraise racism in America and to hold the nation to account for it.It also led to the removal of many statues, which were suddenly judged too racist to remain. Across the country,dozens of Confederate memorials came down. Here in Philadelphia, officialsremoved a statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo— a notoriousracist and homophobe— from a plaza adjoining City Hall.That doesn’t sound like a reckoning to me. It sweepsour ugly historyunder the rug, where we don’t have to address it.Witness the fate of the Columbus statue in Marconi Plaza. Officialsencased it in a plywood boxwhile awaiting word from the Philadelphia Art Commission, whichvoted to remove it. Afteryearslong legal battles, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Courtordered the city to remove the boxearlier this month.» READ MORE:Philadelphia’s Christopher Columbus statue is out of its box, and so is the hard truth we still must addressSo there Columbus stands, out in the open again, in all of his (take your pick glory or perfidy. The city is reviewing the court decision about the box, which it might appeal. Meanwhile, it will explore “adding a plaque or signage . . . that recontextualizes Columbus’ complex history,”spokesperson Kevin Lessard said recently.That would be all for the good, of course. But it would be even better to add the statue of Chief Tamanend, whowelcomed William Penn to this region in 1682and supposedly entered into the famous “Treaty of Amity and Friendship” with him. (There isno paper record of the event. According to legend, Tamanend also declared that the Lenni-Lenape and their new neighbors would “live in peace as long as the waters run in the rivers and creeks and as long as the stars and moon endure.” Obviously, that didn’t happen. If Tamanend’s statue was set side by side with Columbus, visitors would have to grapple with the reality of Native American displacement and — yes — genocide, by Columbus and many others.But they would also learn about discrimination against Italian Americans, who invoked Columbus to rebut it. In New York, for example,the inscription on the 1892 statue in Columbus Circle— erected a year after 11 Italian Americans were lynched by a mob in New Orleans — noted that Italians were “scoffed at,” “menaced,” and “chained.”Like the New York memorial, Philadelphia’s Columbus statue wasfunded by Italian Americans. Its first home was Fairmount Park, where it was erected as part of the city’s 1876 centennial celebration. It was moved to Marconi Plaza 100 years later, during America’s bicentennial commemoration.Imagine how much more we would all learn — about all of these histories — if we moved the Tamanend statue there, too. We couldbuild an entirely new Native American memorial for the plaza, as several commentators have suggested. But why do that, when we already have one?That wouldn’tpreclude affixing Tamanend’s name to Penn Treaty Park, which should have happened long ago. But it would rescue his statue from Front Street, where visitors have to cross freeway-bound traffic to get a good look at him.So let’s put Tamanend next to Columbus in Marconi Plaza, where everyone can see both of them. And let the real reckoning begin.Jonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of “Whose America?

eugeneweekly_2022_6,"We ve got issues. The votes are in, and Claire Syrett’s days on the Eugene City Council may be over by the time you read this, but the misleading recall campaign against her raises important legal, political and moral issues about our local political landscape — especially because the leaders of the recall campaign have said publicly they want to recall other local officials as well. Oregon’s Corrupt Practices Act forbids any person to publish or circulate any statement “with knowledge or with reckless disregard” that the information contains “a false statement of material fact relating to any candidate, political committee or measure.” This is the law that Syrett relied on in the lawsuit she filed against the recall petitioners and some of their supporters. As of this writing, it appeared that Syrett may drop the suit because the defendants planned to file a motion that would make her responsible for their legal fees if she loses. That is unfortunate because the merits of the issues involved in the suit deserve more attention. Her court filing alleged that the recall petitioners and campaign included at least four separate lies in the official recall petition and statement that appeared on the ballot, and that at least some of the petition circulators also misrepresented the effect of the recall while collecting the signatures needed to trigger the special election. At the heart of the case is the fact that the recall proponents stated repeatedly, in their official paperwork filed with the city and in other public statements, that Syrett’s vote to advance the MovingAhead transportation project in March will result in removing two lanes of auto traffic from the current five lanes on River Road to make room for EmX. In fact, none of the projects included in MovingAhead has had final approval. That won’t happen until after the plans are further refined, and there will be numerous additional opportunities for public input before any final votes are taken by the Lane Transit District Board and City Council. And, by the way, only one member of City Council, Mike Clark, voted against taking the planning to the next stage. The recall petitioners also claimed that Syrett supported extending EmX service to River Road “despite the fact that taxes will need to increase to support operations and maintenance” for the system. In fact, adding EmX to River Road won’t happen unless state and federal funds are adequate to cover the vast majority of the construction costs. LTD’s operations and maintenance are funded through LTD’s payroll tax, and no one knows whether the current tax level will be adequate to cover those costs. At a time when Donald Trump’s “big lies” about the 2020 election and many other topics are repeated ad nauseam, it may seem naive to argue that in Oregon we should actually expect those trying to remove someone from local or state office to tell voters the truth. But at the federal level, there is no equivalent of Oregon’s Corrupt Practices Act, which was enacted more than a century ago. It is not a coincidence that Oregon elections have been relatively clean compared to just about anywhere else in the country — thanks to our Corrupt Practices Act. Sure, we often see hyperbolic attacks in closely fought elections here. However, at least until now, we’ve rarely seen campaigns built on lies. This may be the latest signal that Oregon’s politics are becoming just as dysfunctional as the federal election system. However, the Oregon Corrupt Practices Act still may have some life in it. Any person who knowingly includes a false statement in a recall petition commits a crime, which can be subject to prosecution by the attorney general or to a fine imposed by the secretary of state. Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, are you out there? Even if none of that happens in this case, it’s good to know those laws are still on the books if Oregon political campaigns get even worse. David Fidanque is not an attorney, but he worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon for 33 years before retiring in 2015. Note: Before joining the Eugene City Council 10 years ago, Claire Syrett also worked for the ACLU, where Fidanque was her boss during that time."

My 20 years of honorable service in the U.S. Navy has given me the rare opportunity to have participated in a wide variety of cultural events and programs. I have gained insights and increased my knowledge, in particular, about African Americans in the United States. I have come to know more about their stories and struggles, their continued fight for their rights and causes.Through the years, I have learned something about George Washington Carver, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Doris Miller, Carl Maxie Brashear, Thurgood Marshall, Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, Lawrence Douglas Wilder, Curtis Milteer Sr., Dr. L.D.

They have, indeed, achieved significant and valuable contributions that America can be proud of.They have lived and experienced racial discrimination, inequality, injustice, economic and political challenges that have impacted their lives tremendously. They continue to fight for what they believe in.Out of their struggles to shine, to be recognized and to live decent lives, they have become leaders and partners in nation-building.Chris A.

suffolknewsherald_2022_248,"Published 7:09 pm Friday, October 7, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAmerica’s judicial system has its share of critics, and their complaints have gotten louder as outside influences have attempted to politicize the courts. Still, we believe this nation’s jurisprudence, while imperfect, to be the best in the world at ascertaining the truth and dispensing justice accordingly.That takes time, of course. The wheels of justice indeed turn slowly, which can be dissatisfying in an age when loud mouths on social media have all of the answers and demand quick affirmation from our branches of government, including the judiciary.A good example continued playing out last week in a Suffolk courtroom, where a judge ruled that the state’s lawsuit against the town of Windsor for alleged misconduct by its police department should go to trial.Everything seems to be political these days, but the Windsor case is noteworthy for just how apolitical the key players have been in their handling of it.New Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, a staunchly conservative Republican, could have scored political points with his base by quickly dropping the lawsuit, which was filed by his predecessor, liberal Democrat Mark Herring, in his final days in office in December.Instead, Miyares allowed his staff to assess the merits of the case and carry it forward, albeit with a different focus than Herring’s. A revised complaint by Miyares’ team deemphasized racial discrimination as the motive for the Windsor Police Department’s alleged wrongdoing and instead focuses on troubling assertions of recklessness in its hiring practices and misconduct in its treatment of an Army reservist who was infamously pulled over, berated and ultimately pepper-sprayed.A police video of the incident went viral in the spring of 2021, unleashing a torrent of hot takes by politicians, activists and keyboard warriors on social media. Those responsible for getting to the bottom of the incident – and any underlying, systemic issues that fostered it – tuned out the noise and set out to do their jobs.A civil suit by the motorist, Army 2nd Lt. Caron Nazario, is progressing toward trial in federal court. The attorney general’s civil suit is moving on a parallel track in Isle of Wight Circuit Court, with retired Judge H. Thomas Padrick Jr. presiding after local judges wisely recused themselves. Isle of Wight Commonwealth’s Attorney Georgette Phillips also recused herself, allowing special prosecutor Anton Bell of Hampton to determine — correctly, in our view — that state criminal charges against the officers are not warranted but that the U.S. Department of Justice should review whether Nazario’s civil rights were violated. That investigation likely will commence soon.This is the way the system is supposed to work.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_71,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .A year ago, the deadly attack on our Capitol demonstrated how fragile our democracy is. The following year has shown us how close we are to losing it.After Minnesotans and Americans turned out in record numbers for the 2020 election, we witnessed then President Trump and his allies turn their backs on our democracy and incite a violent attack on our nation’s Capitol. Their goal was to overturn the will of voters.While the insurrection occurred on Jan. 6 last year, attacks on every aspect of our democracy continue. Political violence is increasing, disinformation is spreading rapidly, and extremism is dominating a major political party. We’ve also seen more attacks on free and fair elections and the people who administer them.After the insurrection, 111 members of the Minnesota House of Representatives came together to condemn attacks on democracy and affirm our commitment to free and fair elections and the rule of law by passing a bipartisan resolution. The Republican-led Senate refused to even consider taking a similar stand. As we recognize the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack, it’s notable how many Republicans have remained silent in the face of mounting evidence of a deliberate and nearly successful coup — and how few now condemn it.Others have deliberately spread lies that fueled the insurrection. In Minnesota and other states, Republicans used discredited conspiracy theories to push for an audit of the 2020 election. At a recent event, all six Republicans who are running for governor in Minnesota refused to acknowledge the legitimate results of the election.Their goal is to undermine faith in democracy, paving the way for unnecessary and unpopular policies that restrict the freedom to vote. In Minnesota, Senate Republicans tried to impose restrictive voter ID requirements and effectively end same-day registration. The majority of Minnesotans support same-day registration, and voters soundly rejected voter ID laws when they were on the ballot in 2012.While spreading disinformation and advocating for policies that restrict the freedom to vote are subtler than the attack on Jan. 6, they’re just as dangerous. Conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric have led to escalating threats and attacks targeting local election officials in Minnesota and other states. A small but growing percentage of Americans say violence against the government is sometimes justified.Above all, we need to work together to protect free and fair elections and make sure every Minnesotan can participate in our democracy, regardless of their race, age or background. Minnesotans sent us to the State Capitol to represent them, and we’re committed to protecting their voices and our state’s proud tradition of voter participation and trusted local elections. We call on all Minnesota public officials to stand up with us and to speak out against attempts to undermine our democracy and sabotage the will of the people.Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, represents District 63B in the state House of Representatives.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_51,"Since the start of the pandemic, Congress has provided public school districts with $190 billion in relief funds, roughly triple what the federal government spends on K-12 education in a typical year. This infusion has handed schools an opportunity to start repairing the damage caused by remote learning. Far too many are in danger of squandering it.The need for an intervention could hardly be clearer. Results from national assessments show that the pandemic wiped out two decades’ worth of student gains in math and reading. U.S. grade schoolers lost an average of half a year’s learning in math, with some in high-poverty districts behind by a year or more. Without urgent action to help students recover lost ground, those deficits will only continue to grow — likely driving up dropout rates, reducing students’ lifetime earnings, and slowing the country’s economic growth.Lawmakers offered schools three rounds of relief funds. The CARES Act of March 2020 included $13.2 billion to pay for technology and other material needed to support the temporary transition to remote learning. A second COVID relief bill passed at the end of 2020 authorized an additional $54 billion in aid. In March 2021, President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan included $122 billion for schools, the biggest-ever one-time federal investment in public K-12 education.The size of these programs hid basic flaws. The ARP required that school districts devote 20% of their relief funds to “addressing” learning loss, but didn’t specify benchmarks for measuring student progress or consequences if schools failed to meet them. In the absence of clear rules, districts have used the funds to repair buildings, pay staff salaries and upgrade sports facilities. Some districts have used their pandemic aid to make up for budget shortfalls caused by declining student enrollment in failing schools.Even more alarming is schools’ lack of urgency in putting available resources toward combating learning loss — despite evidence that poorly performing students have fallen further behind since returning to the classroom. According to one analysis, less than 15% of funds allocated in Biden’s 2021 relief bill have been spent, with many districts spending less than 5%. A McKinsey report this month found that one-third of pandemic funds have yet to even be budgeted. At that rate, schools could wind up with as much as $20 billion unspent by September 2024, the deadline for using the funds. While the next Congress may extend the deadline, there’s no guarantee it will.School officials need to recognize that this may be their only chance to reverse the harms imposed by the pandemic. First, districts should gather data to determine the scale of learning loss within schools and identify where students are furthest behind. Next, they should expand tutoring programs by enlisting parents, college students, retired teachers and others. Finally, they should extend the school year and ensure students spend more time in class — through after-school and Saturday academies, mandatory summer school for struggling pupils, and increased outreach to families to reduce chronic absenteeism.Policymakers also need to get serious. States should require that school districts publicize their spending plans and see to it that remaining relief funds are poured into classroom instruction, rather than non-academic priorities. Congress should hold regular hearings on how states and local school systems are spending relief funds and work with the Biden administration to create a publicly accessible scorecard to track districts’ progress and call attention to schools that underperform.The academic damage caused by the pandemic is immense. Failing to use all available resources to address it would be a tragic mistake.— Bloomberg OpinionRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2022_73,"The history of cannabis criminalization is rooted in racism and xenophobia.We cannot allow this fundamental fact to become lost in discussions about tax revenue and administrative frameworks to legalize a substance whose simple possession has resulted in over 6 million incarcerations over the last decade.Cannabis was not an illegal plant until the turn of the 20th century, and once we look at the reasons it was criminalized to begin with, we can clearly see the growing absurdity of trying to perpetuate a series of fundamentally and intentionally disingenuous laws that have targeted Black and brown communities for generations.If we really want to dismantle systems of racism, we must look to the history of how we got here and why.Today, nine out of 10 Kentuckians favor the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes and six out of 10 favor legalization for any purpose,according to a 2019 Kentucky Health Issues Poll.One in three Americans live in states when cannabis is legal for adult use.As of this writing, Kentucky is one of 14 states in our nation that has neither decriminalized cannabis nor approved its adult use for either medical or recreational reasons.We are currently in a period that favors the legalization of cannabis, but over the last 85 years, our laws and our attitudes towards cannabis have changed drastically.Beginning around 1910, Mexican immigration increased due to the Mexican Revolution, and it is here that we begin to see the criminalization of cannabis, primarily in border states, based less on the dangerous properties of the plant itself than the xenophobic sentiments prevailing at the time. This is also when we saw the terminology began to change from the botanical term, cannabis, to marijuana, in an attempt to associate the plant with dangerous and criminal behavior by immigrants.During the 1920s, this rhetoric was amplified through a steady stream of anti-cannabis stories published by the leading newspapers of the time. For example, in 1923, a Hearst paper reported that “Marihuana is a short cut to the insane asylum. Smoke marihuana cigarettes for a month and what was once your brain will be nothing but a storehouse for horrid specters.” In 1925, a New York Times headline went: “Mexican, Crazed by Marihuana, Runs Amuck With Butcher Knife.”During the 1930s, America was in the throes of the Great Depression, and it was not difficult to tap into deep cultural anxieties about minorities and immigrants.In 1930, as support for the prohibition of alcohol was waning (the 18th Amendment was repealed in 1933 , Harry Anslinger was appointed as the first Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, a precursor to the DEA, and is often thought of the architect of our original drug enforcement laws. He remained in this position until 1962, having done more than perhaps anyone in establishing our mindset of drug use as a moral failing and criminal issue that must be dealt with through harsh penalties.In 1937, Congress passed the Marihuana Tax Act, which effectively outlawed individual possession and sale of cannabis in the U.S., and imposed onerous fees and record keeping for medical use. This Act was understandably opposed by the American Medical Association because the tax was imposed on anyone who bought, sold, imported, distributed, cultivated or prescribed it as medicine, including physicians, pharmacists and manufacturers. The AMA did not believe the claims that cannabis cause insanity, addiction, and violence, and also objected to the unfamiliar term “marihuana” with which most medical professionals would not equate cannabis. In fact, in 1944, after a five year investigation, the New York Academy of Medicine issued a report that contradicted Anslinger’s opinion that cannabis caused violence, insanity, addiction or led to other drug use.During the 1950s, we saw an increase in laws that imposed mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. The Boggs Act marked the first time that cannabis and narcotics like heroin were treated the same in our criminal system, and imposed two to five year minimum sentences for first offenses, including simple possession. Second offenses carried prison terms of five to 10 years, and third offenses carried a sentence of 10 to 15 years. Five years later, the Narcotics Control Act of 1956 further escalated these penalties, imposing a five-year minimum for first offenses and a 10-year minimum for subsequent offenses.The 1960s confirmed that these mandatory minimum sentencing laws were not working. The Prettyman Commission in 1963 and the Katzenbach Commission in 1967 both found that longer prison sentences were not an effective deterrent to drug users, that rehabilitation should be a primary objective for the government, and that courts should have wide discretion to deal with drug offenders.In 1969, 32 years after it was enacted, the Supreme Court struck down the Marihuana Tax Act in Leary v. United States.In 1970, Congress repealed the Marihuana Tax Act along with mandatory minimums for drug offenses. Instead, it enacted the Controlled Substances Act (CSA , which created five schedules and temporarily classified cannabis under Schedule I, which was reserved for substances that have been determined to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, thereby prohibiting their use for any purpose. During the 1970s, several states decriminalized cannabis or greatly reduced penalties for possession.Crucially, the CSA also called for and funded a commission specifically to study whether cannabis belonged in Schedule I. In 1972, the Shafer Commission released a report that recommended decriminalizing simple possession of cannabis, finding that it was as safe as alcohol and did not belong under Schedule I. Nixon rejected the recommendation, and that is why cannabis remains a Schedule I today, despite no evidence to justify the classification.That was 50 years ago.Under Reagan, who called cannabis “probably the most dangerous drug in the United States,” the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses increased from 50,000 in 1980 to over 400,000 by 1997, as mandatory minimums were reinstated and further strengthened. This era of mass incarceration for low level drug offenses coincided with a crackdown of drug use in minority communities and contributed to the disparities in sentencing that we see today.Through the next decades, we saw a doubling down of the war on drugs and a militarization of law enforcement under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The consistent thread in the implementation of these laws has been disparate arrest rates and longer sentencing for Black and brown people.In 2010, arrests for cannabis possessionaccounted for over half of all drug arrests, and of the arrests made between 2001 and 2010, 88% were for simple possession. In 2020, the number of cannabis-related arrests has dropped to 43%, but nearly 90% of those arrests were for simple possession,according to a report from the ACLU.In addition, the rate of arrests for Black people is still almost four times higher than for white people nationwide, even though rates of cannabis use are roughly the same. In Kentucky, that number jumps to almost 10 times higher.These disparities exists despite 36 states having some authorized use of cannabis in statute. While some states have explicitly included provisions that address felony expungement, restoration of voting rights and equitable access to new cannabis industries, some have not.In Kentucky, we are at a turning point. With the data that we have from states that have decriminalized or legalized cannabis in some form, along with a disgraceful history we should seek to redress, we must adopt the basic provisions of decriminalization legislation, including defining and decriminalizing a personal use quantity of cannabis for possession and cultivation, amending the drug paraphernalia statute to exempt personal use cannabis accessories, and creating a process for automatic expungement of prior convictions relating to personal use amounts of cannabis or cannabis accessories.We cannot simply move forward with broad cannabis legalization and establishing a new cannabis industry in our Commonwealth without at the same time addressing the disparate and devastating impact that this succession of laws has had on our minority communities since the turn of the century.This is an opportunity to study our past and learn from it, finally moving away from harmful rhetoric towards rational and equitable policy. We are in a shrinking minority of states that do not have some form of authorized cannabis use on the books. When we move towards the majority of our neighbors in establishing this new industry, let’s make sure we do it right, for the right reasons, and with equal opportunity for everyone in our Commonwealth.Kentucky Rep. Nima Kulkarni (D-Louisville pre-filed two bills that address decriminalizing cannabis ahead of the current General Assembly session. To read more about those bills, gohere.. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_95,"Published 6:32 pm Friday, May 6, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy D.J. McGuireGuest columnistTo date, Virginia has managed to avoid the culture war’s latest kerfuffle. Call it the Battle of Don’t Say Gay, if you will.Florida and Alabama are going all in, making it unlikely that the commonwealth will permanently steer clear, especially once our own legislature comes up for election in new, unfamiliar districts next year. Some of the opponents are likely to use the arguments Kate Cohen provided in the Washington Post.Alabama’s H.B. 322 declares that teachers “shall not engage in classroom discussion … regarding sexual orientation or gender identity in a manner that is not age appropriate.”I don’t know what’s appropriate for what age — it’s not like I’m a trained educator or anything — so to avoid offending similarly inexpert parents, Alabama teachers should probably refrain from any allusion to heterosexuality, including references to their husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, upcoming weddings or — heaven forbid — expected babies.As for classroom books, well, you may wonder what exactly is the heterosexual equivalent of “Heather Has Two Mommies” or the cisgender counterpart of “Call Me Max”?The answer is, everything. These books are just tiny specks in the sea of cultural messaging that surrounds us, including every children’s book that features girls and boys, princes and princesses, moms and dads. I’m looking at you, Ma and Pa Ingalls; Marmee and Mr. March; Mr. and Mrs. Quimby, Darling and Banks.Whatever one thinks of these arguments (and I’ll admit I’m sympathetic , it’s clear that the first item up for discussion when any law like this is enacted becomes, “What is and what isn’t OK?” From there, questions of enforcement mechanisms and procedures for accused educators are sure to follow. Combine that with what I am sure will be loud insistence among proponents of this stuff that enforcement be vigorous and it’s pretty clear that local school districts will have only one way to respond to this – increase administrative staff.In other words, “Don’t Say Gay” is another unfunded mandate pushed on localities, while the cost of this bigotry-driven idea will likely go into the millions. To get an idea of how much, I’m using the example of my hometown of Suffolk.From the perspectives of population and student enrollment, Suffolk is somewhat above the median. We’re not compact, though; Suffolk consists of all of what was Nansemond County before the Great Hampton Roads Consolidation. In effect, Suffolk is an outer suburban – or exurban – jurisdiction.Suffolk has 11 elementary, five middle and three high schools. I’m assuming all of them will need at least one staffer fully dedicated to overseeing this. I’m calling them compliance officers, for lack of a better term. I’m also assuming a manager for each of the three levels and an overall supervisor. I’m also assuming these 23 staff members will be compensated on a level equal to a school counselor (which averages just under $73K in salary and over $40K in fringe benefits in Suffolk, based on school budget data .Add it all up and “Don’t Say Gay” would cost Suffolk taxpayers more than $2.3 million annually, and given the very rough estimate here, it could go as high as $4.7 million (or as low as $1.2 million . This would require an increase of 1%-3% in local property taxes here. If your county is more rural than Suffolk, you can probably expect a lower cost figure but a higher relative tax hike; the reverse is probably true for more urban jurisdictions.If one uses a per student cost measurement (Suffolk has just over 14,000 enrollees , the overall cost to the commonwealth would be anywhere from $105 million to $422 million.So if (when? this issue finally crashes into the Virginia political discourse, remember to ask yourselves: How much would you pay for “Don’t Say Gay”?D.J.

eugeneweekly_2022_20,"We ve got issues. On June 24, the Supreme Court struck downRoe v. Wade.In a 5-4 ruling, the court’s conservative majority ruled that the Constitution does not guarantee a right to an abortion. The decision will now be pushed to the states, 13 of which have “trigger laws” to immediately place draconian regulations on abortion, including heavy fines and long jail sentences for people who receive abortions and for those who assist them. The conservative movement is now, predictably, calling for a national ban on abortion. But not just abortion — in a concurring opinion to the ruling,Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Justice Clarence Thomasarguedthat the legal basis of past court decisions could also be invalidated, including rulings that established a right to privacy and contraception, sexual freedom, and same-sex marriage. In the face of this sweeping legal attack on our freedoms, how should liberals and progressives respond? Popular opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to the court’s hard-right turn. Eighty-five percent of American voters think abortion should be legal in some or all circumstances, 78 percent consider birth control to be a basic part of women’s health care, and 70 percent support the right of same-sex couples to get married, according tosurveysfromGallupandPower to Decide. But indifference to the public is nothing new for the Supreme Court. For most of American history, court justices have acted to inhibit democratic reforms and protect privilege. The Lochner Court of the early 20th century applied the 14th Amendment’s due process clause to invalidate state and federal laws to regulate child labor, limit the length of the workday, and establish a minimum wage. In the 1930s, the court acted to strike down or weaken key parts of FDR’s enormously popular New Deal agenda, until the president threatened to add five more justices to the bench. More recently, inBush v. Gore(2000 , the court stole the presidential election for George W. Bush by stopping a statewide recount of ballots in Florida, which (as later analysis indicated would have revealed a victory for Democratic candidate Al Gore. In the face of this reactionary judiciary, today’s Democrats tell us, yet again, to vote harder, so that maybe a Democratic president will get a chance to replace multiple justices and reestablish a liberal court majority. But if we have to wait for this generation of justices to die or retire, we may be stuck waiting for a long time. Venerating these institutions will get us nowhere. What is instead needed is a political attack on the court itself. What would that look like? As Princeton historian Matt Karp recentlyarguedinJacobinmagazine, we can learn something from the radicalism of Abraham Lincoln and the early Republican Party. The court’s infamous 1857 decision inDred Scott v. Sanfordheld that Black Americans “had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,” and that the federal government could do nothing to restrict the expansion of slavery into new states on the frontier. The antislavery Republicans immediately denounced, not only this decision but the very idea that judges could decide burning political questions in this way. As Abraham Lincoln put it in his 1860 inaugural address: I f the policy of the government, upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made . . . the people will have ceased, to be their own rulers, having, to that extent, practically resigned their government, into the hands of that eminent tribunal. The Republicans, once in power, moved quickly to reform the judiciary. But more importantly, perhaps, Lincoln and his party simply ignored the court. In 1862, the Republicans passed legislation to ban slavery in federal territories, and Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed slaves in secessionist Confederate states. Both directly repudiated theDred Scottdecision and left the court intimidated and politically weak through the era of emancipation and Reconstruction— ”the greatest democratic expansion in US political history,” as Karp notes. Today, we hear calls to donate to abortion funds, struggle in blue state legislatures for laws to protect abortion, and engage in civil disobedience to protect those seeking abortions in red states. All are necessary. But at the national level, our freedoms will continue to be endangered until we challenge the institutions that are eroding them. Voting isn’t enough. To protect abortion, and our democracy, we must confront the unaccountable power of the Supreme Court. David Purucker isa Ph.D. student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Oregon."

minnpost_2022_26,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It’s not that often that we get to peek into the future with a reasonable degree of probability to see what might happen.We have House minority leader, Rep. Kurt Daudt (R , to thank for this opportunity when it comes to elections in Minnesota. Of course, this involves some assumptions, like Daudt’s party gaining control of the legislature and governor’s office this fall. However, that possibility is a realistic one, given the redistricting results.On Jan. 31 Daudt dropped his Minnesota Elections Integrity Act into the hopper at the Capitol in St. Paul (H.F. 2732 . No matter that the 2020 election was conducted successfully with complete integrity. Yet the bill proposes dramatic changes in how we conduct our elections. On Feb. 3 the bill gained an additional 29 co-authors, all of Daudt’s political party. We can safely conclude that this is not a bipartisan bill, but a matter of great interest to one party.What might these legislators have in mind for Minnesota elections? Two of these ideas passed the Minnesota Senate in 2021. Voter I.D. and provisional balloting. No evidence of fraud in voting in Minnesota was presented to justify their passage. Under Daudt’s bill, an applicant for a voter I.D. card must provide proof of citizenship, a Social Security number, a current address, a description of the applicant and a photograph. Documentation of identity and residence is required. A duplicate card must be obtained if the holder changes his or her address. Of course, the voters of this state voted down Voter ID in 2012 in the form of a constitutional amendment. Not everyone got the message, apparently.Minnesota’s successful and nationally recognized same day voter registration would be canceled. Instead, an unregistered voter may cast a provisional ballot which is not counted unless the voter appears at the county auditor or municipal clerk during the week following the election and process and proves his, her or their eligibility to vote. Should the inability to register at the polls not discourage a potential voter, having to show up again within the next week should do the trick. This is an unnecessary hurdle, sure to limit voting. Minnesota was exempted from a federal law requiring provisional ballots because same day registration was deemed to be a superior process. By the way, these unnecessary changes come at a cost to taxpayers.These proposals fit comfortably in the nationwide undemocratic effort to suppress voting in our country. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of January, legislators in at least 27 states have introduced, pre-filed or carried more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions. Many of these bills also curtail access to mail voting and impose new or stricter voting requirements for in person voting or registration. Minnesota has joined this effort to limit voting, the crown jewel of our democracy.You may think that this is merely the effort of the House minority that has little chance of passage. That’s likely true this year. But, the margins in the House and Senate are narrow and many think they will change this fall. A recent poll in the governor’s race found DFL Gov. Tim Walz with 43 percent and GOP challenger Scott Jensen with 40 percent. This fall’s election will have a major impact on whether Minnesota continues to be a state with a full democracy, or assumes a lesser status.George A. Beck is a retired administrative law judge and former chair of the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board."
minnpost_2022_122,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’d like to take a moment to cheer the city of Minneapolis for requiring verified energy disclosure in four major areas that predict a home’s future energy use. It is one of the few cities in the country where this information is required before a house is listed for sale.Even if a house needs a lot of work, which most old homes do, buyers are often motivated to make upgrades that will save energy before they move-in. If they’re not, at least they deserve to know where they can save energy and cut costs.Back in 2009, a few months into the Barrack Obama presidency, I started a website for home energy efficiency for people in Pennsylvania. We’d purchased an old home three years earlier and were getting slammed with high heating bills. I figured the best way to learn about saving fuel for the home was by writing about it. I took a course and became a BPI certified building analyst.Before long, I learned of a software program created for the Department of Energy called the Home Energy Score. I can’t tell you my excitement at being invited to the White House and listening to a presentation from then Vice President Joe Biden who introduced the Home Energy Score program as part of the Middle-Class Task Force program he was leading.Later, I participated in the pilot of the software and learned just how bad most old homes are in regard to energy-efficiency. That was true of our home which was built in 1899 in what then was one of the wealthiest cities in the country, Pittsburgh.Based on the feedback received from our energy assessment, we sealed up the attic and fixed the rim joists that wrapped around the basement wall with spray foam. However, it wasn’t until five years later, a year before we moved out, that I discovered another one of the biggest culprits of energy loss: a hole the size of two bricks leading directly to the outdoors. The hole was behind the kitchen cabinets and hidden on the outside by a half-century-old planter; I discovered it only by chance. So much for working with professionals.Still, we have to keep trying. It’s a journey not a destination.Realtors especially could do more. They could take a class like I did. They could fill out the Residential Green and Energy Efficient Addendum form from the Appraisal Institute so that energy related information (efficiency, solar, location could be included in every listing.Kudos to Minneapolis for a great start setting an example for other cities to follow.

leoweekly_2022_24,"I had no idea we were making a life raft when we formed a small songwriting group in early March 2020. We met once in person and then the meetings went to screens, writing a song per week based on prompts we came up with together. We started the group not knowing the essential part it would play supporting our mental health during all that would happen in that first year. We processed the grief and isolation and political despair. We found something to make from the shattering pieces. Where lockdown took the wind from our sails, there seemed to be magic in asking something of each other.I had to leave the group when my morning sickness made it impossible to Zoom. I had a child; my first. I didn’t know that I would be a mother in this life. After the soft opening of the world, our group dissolved, everyone returning to their various circles and realms. I soaked up the smells and sounds of my newborn, completely immersed in the raw nerves, hers and mine.Then the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report came in saying it was almost too late. This was a crisis we could foresee, but if we got to the “wall” there would be no chance to give our children the world as we knew it: the pollinators, the butterflies, the migrating birds, the seasons. It seemed that we were a disaster-driven society, programmed to keep going with the status quo until we hit that wall. But if we let the disaster teach us, there would be no chance to learn this lesson, to adapt.It was keeping me up at night during an already sleepless time with a newborn. I kept wondering how to cope with this immense stress that made action seem impossible — the kind of action that might keep us from running off the cliff.I still worry for my daughter, that I have brought her to a corrupted place. I was haunted by a quote by Norwegian philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe: “To bear children into this world is like carrying wood to a burning house.” I want all my actions to show her the beauty here, all my actions to be water on the burning house of the world. She is so full of joy and wonder, beaming her smile at everyone she meets, not knowing that the people she beams at are running her off the cliff.Then I noticed that all of the like-minded people I knew couldn’t even bear to hear the news anymore. “I’m taking a break,” they said. While I deeply empathized, I was chilled at the realization: If all the sensitive people out there were doing the same thing… then who was steering the ship? What if all the kind people I knew were stuck in their grief and anger, paralyzed like me?So I thought: What if we could harness that special power that we found in the songwriting group? The asking. Something to help some of the soft-hearted people grieve and to vent anger; to turn that energy into something positive, something tangible? It didn’t have to be big; just an intimate group that would ask each other to show up together. To create things that would unfreeze and unparalyze. To make something beautiful, because it would matter to us that we tried.The idea for an intimate circle has since blossomed into something bigger and far more extroverted than I could have expected: a parade with puppets, music, and a lot to say… publicly. Honestly I don’t feel ready; my hands already full with my 1-year-old and her needs. I am hesitant to lay my hopes bare in a city where cynicism runs deep. A place where people have scoffed at the idea of a clean Ohio River. Impossible! Childish to even think of it! The fear that our parade, our expression of hope, would just be swatting the hornet’s nest — making people who don’t already agree with us more resentful and unwilling to help stop the exploitative actions that have been poisoning our soil, water, air, and community. Taking profit as the measure of what is “good,” what is “progress.”I still want that intimate group to process all that is painful and frustrating. But, on this occasion, I feel asked once again to open outward instead, to put energy towards a beautiful vision of what this city could be: healthy, just, and beautiful — something greater than “bourbonism” and fossil fuel-based industry and infrastructure, something beyond polluting ourselves and our place for profit. My hope is that this parade will help strengthen that vision and unfreeze a few more of us. Because this is the only thing worth working for.I look at my beaming daughter, on the verge of walking and overcome with delight as she stands up for the first time in a crowd; her father and I constantly scrambling after her to keep her from falling.

Surely persons expressed personal preferences when state and national elections were held, but local elections dealt primarily with local issues, not party partisanship.It now appears to me that some of our local candidates are bringing Washington divisions to our city. Suffolkians, in previous years have been fortunate to address local issues, not Washington-style behavior. Constitutional officers, city councilmembers, and school board members have all addressed local issues with this trend being advantageous to its citizens in my opinion.We have a beautiful city.

minnpost_2022_5,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It was inevitable that when brown-skinned Afghan refugees fleeing war wereturned awayfrom European borders over the past few years, the callous actions of these governments would come back to haunt them. A whopping1 million peoplehave fled Ukraine from Russia’s violent invasion in the span of only the first week. They are being welcomed — as refugees should be — into neighboring nations, inviting accusations of racist double standards.Polandoffers the most egregious example of national racism. Its government, whose nation borders Ukraine, has warmly welcomed traumatized Ukrainians, just months afterturning away Afghans. If these optics weren’t bad enough, Polish nationalists have sought out people of color who are among the refugees fleeing Ukraine and violently attacked them. According tothe Guardian, “three Indians were beaten up by a group of five men, leaving one of them hospitalized.” African nationals studying in Ukraine joined the exodus after Russia’s invasion, and have beenstopped at the Polish border. Poland might as well erect a giant sign on its border declaring, “whites only.”In elevating such disparate skin-tone-dependent attitudes toward refugees, Europe is giving its colonialist heritage a new lease on life. We see echoes today of the dehumanization that enabled European colonization of the Global South and the enslavement of generations.It’s not just Poland. The Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association hasdenouncedthe overtly racist language of many Western journalists, including American ones likeCharlie D’Agataof CBS who said of Ukraine that “this isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades.” (In fact, Ukraine has seenplenty of conflictin the past years. D’Agata’s insertion of “with all due respect” was perhaps his belated realization that he was veering into dangerous territory by contrasting Ukrainian civilization against the presupposed barbarity of the darker nations. But then, he continued, saying, “this is a relatively civilized, relatively European — I have to choose those words carefully, too — city where you wouldn’t expect that, or hope that it’s going to happen.”Again, D’Agata likely realized as the words were escaping his mouth just how racist he was sounding. He needed to choose his words carefully in order to avoid the appearance of bias. He clearly failed. Hislater apologywas not very convincing.D’Agata exposed his personal allegiance with the Global North when he expressed “hope” against war breaking out in a nation whose people look like he does. The implied flip side is that he harbors no such hope when the conflict-ridden nations of the Global South are embroiled in violence.Serena Parekh, professor of philosophy at Northeastern University in Boston,told mein a recent interview, “it is very human to feel connections to people that you perceive to be like you and to feel more remote from people you perceive as being not like you.” At the very least, this is a good reason why newsrooms across the United States need to diversify their staff.Parekh, who has written two books, includingNo Refuge: Ethics and the Global Refugee CrisisandRefugees and the Ethics of Forced Displacement, says that one “assumption” she has heard justifying favorable treatment of the latest wave of refugees in Europe is that “Ukrainians are not terrorists and they are not criminals, and so we can let them in safely, without having to worry about screening them.” She calls such views “racialized assumptions… largely unsustainable by any evidence.”Such assumptions are infectious. Social media platformsaboundwith images sporting the now-ubiquitous blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag. Ukraine’s PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhas emerged as a larger-than-life hero to the morally outraged. So invested are people in believing Zelenskyy’s heroism that many haveshared a photo(including several of my own Facebook friends of him in military fatigues as evidence of his courage in standing up to Russian militarism, when in fact the image was captured well before Russia’s invasion.Similar expressions of solidarity with brown-skinned resisters of Western militarism or victims of Western wars have been far less common.Pointing out the double standards of governments and the press at a time when Ukrainians are watching their nation getting utterly destroyed will inevitably spark accusations of insensitivity and of engaging irresponsibly in “whataboutism” to make a point.But now is the time to clearly call out what human rights groups and independent journalists have for years been saying: That the U.S. and NATO-led wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, and elsewhere are racist, and that the callous dismissals of the resulting humanitarian catastrophes are equally barbaric.There’s another reason why brown-skinned refugees are seen as undesirable. Welcoming those people fleeing wars that the West has fomented would be an admission of Western culpability. Not only do Ukrainian refugees offer palatable infusions of whiteness into European nations, but they also enable governments to express self-righteous outrage at Russia’s imperialist ambitions and violent militarism. If Ukrainian refugees are evidence of Russian brutality, then Afghan and Iraqi refugees are evidence of the same kind of brutality on the part of the U.S. and NATO.President Joe Biden, who campaigned on reversing Trump’s anti-refugee rules, initiallyfalteredon keeping his promise when he took office. But, even after the limits on allowing refugees into the U.S. were eventually lifted,few have been admittedinto the country. Last year, when U.S. troops left Afghanistan at the mercy of the Taliban, Afghans were, naturally, desperate to flee. While the Biden administration laudablyfast-trackedU.S. resettlement for Afghans, problems remain, with one refugee advocate calling the process, “kind of abysmal.”Parekh says that decisions by Poland and other nations to admit fleeing Ukrainians with open arms, “show that the European Unioncantake in large numbers of asylum seekers and can do so in a relatively efficient way.”In light of the sudden wellspring of compassion toward Ukrainian refugees emerging from Western nations, media, and the public, a simple thought experiment could protect governments, journalists, and us from further accusations of racist double standards: we could treat all refugees as though they were white-skinned Ukrainians, as though they were human.This article was produced byEconomy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute.Sonali Kolhatkar is the founder, host and executive producer of“Rising Up With Sonali,”a television and radio show that airs on Free Speech TV and Pacifica stations.

minnpost_2022_134,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the 2022 Minnesota election season arrives, voters can benefit from understanding the unusual nature of our state’s party system. At first glance, Minnesota elections seem to be contested by two big major parties, Democratic Farmer Labor and Republican, along with the occasional appearance on the ballot of smaller, less successful parties just like many other states.But that’s far from the complete story. Since 2000 at least, Minnesota elections have produced a peculiar “1 and 9/16” party system. It comprises one major party, the DFL, a half-major party, the Republicans and, among the smaller parties, the tiny but consequential pro-marijuana parties which together total about 1/16 of a major party — but together they can be a consequential small fraction.By any measure, the Minnesota DFL is a large, well resourced major party. Democrats have won all elections for statewide offices since 2006, kept control of four of eight U.S. House seats since 2000 and have often won control of the state House and state Senate. The state House came under DFL control in the elections of 2006, 2008, 2012, 2018 and 2020. DFLers won control of the state Senate in elections from 2000 through 2008 and in 2012 and 2014.In recent years, the party’s fundraising has been immense, raising a midterm cycle record $6.1 million in 2021 with currently $1.6 million cash on hand.The state Republican Party, however, ranks far behind the DFL in electoral success and resources. The state party has been in debt for years and has suffered from several staff controversies. The main fundraising arms for the Minnesota GOP are its state House and Senate caucuses.The GOP has held onto four U.S. House seats and has been competitive in state legislative races. Caucuses’ fundraising helped the GOP be fully competitive in state legislative contests since 2000. Republicans won control of the state House in the 2000-2004, 2010, 2014 and 2016 elections. The state Senate came under GOP control in 2012, 2016, 2018 and 2020, though in those last three elections by a margin of only one or two seats.Minnesota Republicans fall far short of major party status, however, in their performance in statewide elections in recent years. Their last statewide victory was Gov. Tim Pawlenty’s narrow 21,108 vote margin over DFL Attorney General Mike Hatch in 2006. Tom Emmer did come close in 2010 to winning the governorship for Republicans, losing to DFLer Mark Dayton by only 8,770 votes statewide.Since that time, the only somewhat close statewide race run by a GOP candidate was attorney general nominee Doug Wardlow’s loss by about 4% to Keith Ellison in 2018.The demise of the Independence Party helps to explain the poor Republican record in statewide races since 2014. In that year, no Independence Party candidate received the necessary 5% of the vote statewide necessary to retain that party’s status as a major party, which entitled it to easier ballot access and public funding from the Minnesota general state elections campaign account.How did this hurt the GOP? Pawlenty’s 2006 victory and Emmer’s narrow 2010 loss probably resulted from the substantial number of votes garnered by 2006 Independence Party nominee Peter Hutchinson and 2010 nominee Tom Horner. Hutchinson’s 6.4% and Horner’s 12% of the vote may well have deprived DFL candidates of the necessary votes for victory.So without the Independence Party potentially siphoning votes from the DFL, GOP competitiveness in statewide races has declined in recent election cycles.Democrats, however, have been bedeviled by two small pro-marijuana parties who have gained major party status, which provides better ballot access and public funding, in recent elections. In 2018, Michael Ford of the Legal Marijuana Now Party received 5.28% of the vote for state auditor and Noah N. Johnson of the Grassroots Legalize Cannabis Party received 5.71% of the vote for attorney general. As a result, both are now recognized as major parties in Minnesota.Democrats, who have endorsed legalization of marijuana, believe the presence of these two pot parties on the ballot hurts them in many election races. A notable example occurred in the 2020 election in the state’s second congressional district. Democrat Angie Craig narrowly defeated Republic Tyler Kistner by 9,280 votes — but Adam Charles Weeks of the Legal Marijuana Now party received 24,751 votes. Democrats believe Craig’s margin would have been larger without Weeks on the ballot. Ironically, the 38-year-old Weeks died in September but remained on the ballot for the November election. With Craig facing another competitive election against Kistner in 2022, a marijuana party candidate on the ballot could determine the outcome.2022 looms as a year when Minnesota Republicans might again become a fully competitive major party in Minnesota. President Joe Biden and DFL Gov. Tim Walz suffer from low approval ratings in the state. Inflation, crime and immigration issues work against Democrats at present. It’s far from clear, however, that Republicans have the candidates or resources to take advantage of this opportunity. If they can’t, Minnesota’s odd “1 and 9/16” party system will persist into the future.Steven Schier is the Emeritus Congdon Professor of Political Science at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota."

Their innovative thinking and brilliant ways of navigating problems are truly inspiring to experience every day. Their education, in many ways, is dependent on the work we do.We’re homework help, hallway staff, mentors, before and after school support, and so much more. Often we hear our students, parents, teachers, and administrators tell us they don’t know what they’d do without us, but many of us can’t afford to stay in these vital positions.As we have led our team through this bargaining process, representing more than 1,200 education support professionals, or ESP, Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS leaders are offering more of the same.The average special education assistants (SEA starts at $24,000 a year. Our ESP members are paying the same for health insurance as our administrators that make four times more than us. We know from our member survey that about two-thirds of our members work another job just to make ends meet. These poverty wages have led to high turnover and record vacancies across MPS.The reality is that educators like us who ensure students have what they need to succeed can’t afford to work in MPS even though our schools desperately need us.High vacancies mean students receive less support because of significant staffing shortages, this includes services that we are legally required to provide. We provide physical, emotional and mental support to our most vulnerable students, many of whom are still struggling from learning disruption caused by the pandemic and the police brutality that affects our communities. When critical staff are missing our students suffer and this is unacceptable.The district’s leadership team has a decision to make. They can continue business as usual, or they can transform our district and communities by using its new money to raise the compensation of its lowest-paid educators faster than the pay of higher employees. Many ESP live in Minneapolis, our children attend Minneapolis Public Schools and often we are the educators of color our students connect to. The relationships we have with our students are essential to their educational experience.This, and a multitude of other factors, is why our members voted to authorize a strike.A strike is always a last resort, but many of our members have said that they simply can’t afford to continue with the status quo.​​Ma-Riah Roberson Moody and Katrinka Zachery are education support professionals in the Minneapolis Public Schools.

That is Puerto Rico, which in spite of multiple largely ceremonial territorial votes in favor of a transition to statehood has never been given a real chance to determine its standing and future.A bill recently passed with bipartisan support in the House would finally correct this situation by creating a process for a binding referendum in which Puerto Ricans could pick between the options of statehood, full independence, and a free association arrangement similar to our deal with the Marshall Islands, among others. In a bit of political sleight of hand, keeping the current commonwealth status — which is certainly antiquated but some Puerto Ricans still prefer — is not an option.Nonetheless, the bill is a sensical step towards carrying out the ideals that this country purports to live by, which makes it unfortunate that the proposal has dismal chances of making it through the Senate given significant Republican opposition. Many reasons have been given, including a supposed lack of debate over the bill, but the real reason is clear as day: GOP senators don’t want to be joined by an additional two senators from Puerto Rico, who they assume would be Democrats.If these legislators could somehow ensure that Puerto Rican lawmakers were Republicans, they’d be singing a different tune.It’s unfortunate that this political consideration is stopping 3.6 million Americans from being able to decide their fate for themselves.

leoweekly_2022_32,"Tuesday’s primary elections in Kentucky reflected increasing polarization of the two political parties.The Republican Party kept moving right, with the victories of several candidates who campaigned primarily on cultural issues and against government overreach.The Democratic Party kept moving left, with the U.S. Senate primary victory of former state Rep. Charles Booker of Louisville, probably the most liberal nominee for major statewide office that Kentucky has ever produced.Booker vowed on election night, “We’re gonna blow Rand Paul out,” but defeat of the two-term libertarian Republican would be one of the greatest upsets in American political history, given the strong Republican trend in Kentucky.A more likely impact is that of the wins of seven or so Republican primary candidates who emphasized personal liberty (the major exception being a woman’s right to an abortion , showing that voters — GOP primary voters, at least — care less about the status and influence of their state legislators than the lawmakers would like to think.That was obvious inNorthern Kentucky, which saw three of its four state House committee chairs defeated: Reps. Sal Santoro (Transportation , Ed Massey (Judiciary and Adam Koenig (Business Organizations and Professions . Respectively, they lost to Marianne Proctor, Steve Rawlings and Steven Doan. One common theme was opposition to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s pandemic restrictions.In a region where legislative district lines cut across municipalities and even neighborhoods, the liberty candidates’ consistent cultural themes may have created a tide that lifted all their boats, former Kentucky secretary of state Trey Grayson of Northern Kentucky said on KET’s election-night show (where I was also a panelist .Northern Kentucky also drove the result in an open state Senate race, in which former senator Gex (“jay” Williams of Verona, endorsed by libertarian U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, defeated three more mainstream candidates: well-funded Phyllis Sparks, also of Boone County; and Calen Studler and Mike Templeman of Frankfort.Williams, who gave up a Senate seat to run for Congress in 1998, is now in an interesting match-up with Teresa Barton of Frankfort, who was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. After serving as Franklin County judge-executive, Barton ran the state Office of Drug Control Policy for Republican Gov. Ernie Fletcher and supported him for reelection but didn’t change parties. She may be Democrats’ only hope to pick up a state Senate seat, in a newly drawn district that is 5 to 4 Democratic in voter registration but seems clearly Republican in recent voter performance.Several liberty candidates lost. The biggest failure was Andrew Cooperrider of Lexington, who led protests against Beshear’s restrictions and petitioned the legislature to impeach him. He lost to Sen. Donald Douglas of Nicholasville, who was propped up financiallyand legislativelyby Republican leaders who didn’t want another liberty fire-breather like Sen. Adrienne Southworth of Lawrenceburg in the Senate. Two other impeachment petitioners also lost, to Reps. Samara Heavrin of Leitchfield and Kim King of Harrodsburg.Kentucky Republican leaders have tried to steer the state party away from the national party’s growing fever swamps of conspiracy theories and misinformation; they know that the hundreds of thousands of Kentucky Democrats who joined the GOP officially or unofficially because of Donald Trump may not want to go as far as the liberty candidates and culture warriors would go. Perhaps the best example of that is how the Republican-controlled General Assembly soft-pedaled the pseudo-issue of critical race theory in the last legislative session, passing a bill that only alluded to it.Still, candidates who campaigned against pandemic restrictions and other alleged government overreach had enough success Tuesday that they may lead Republican candidates for governor to double down on the issue as they run against Beshear next year, even though the governor built his strongly positive rating during the crisis period of the pandemic. The Williams-Barton race could be a strategic indicator of just how far right you can go and still win.Republicans are beginning a crowded and potentially fractious primary for governor, in which the nuances of cultural issues could be decisive. Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles are running partly on their active opposition to Beshear’s pandemic mandates, and former U.N. ambassador Kelly Craft has indicated that she will do likewise if she runs, as expected. The liberty candidates’ success will surely encourage like-minded Rep. Savannah Maddox of Dry Ridge to run.As the GOP sorts itself out, opposition to Beshear will be the glue that holds the party together in Kentucky through 2023, Republican consultant and commentator Scott Jennings said on KET’s primary coverage. (Jennings says he’s neutral in the governor’s race. But looking a year ahead, Beshear’s pandemic-driven approval ratings appear to be holding steady, and what works in Republican primaries will not necessarily work in general elections. Voters in November should give us a clearer picture.. ( ."

Holiday prices this year will be $1.83 per gallon lower than they were just six months ago, according to GasBuddy, a website that tracks fuel prices nationwide. The national average price of gas is forecast to be $2.98 on Christmas Day, likely to drop below the critical $3 per gallon mark on or before Christmas Eve for the first time in nearly 600 days.Since peaking at more than $5 per gallon in June, the national average price of gas has slowly come down from record-breaking levels, falling below its year-ago level on Dec. 9, GasBuddy reports. Since October, every one of the nation’s 50 states has seen gas prices plummet precipitously, with diesel starting to follow suit.“Finally, things are starting to feel a bit more normal with gas prices far more affordable. Americans are saving around $25 per fill-up compared to prices this summer,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. “While we’re closing out the year on a positive note, challenges remain that could drive prices up again next spring, so motorists might want to keep their expectations in check and enjoy the sub-$3 gasoline while they can.”Our friends at AAA estimate that more than 2.8 million Virginians will be driving to their destinations this holiday season.

minnpost_2022_67,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .What if in our world of growing international finance, global corporations, more and more profit for the less and less, what if all of our bankers, accountants, statisticians, efficiency engineers, those who are never responsible for cutting out the poor or destroying the environment, or even the poetic, what if they were reassigned to count what is truly wild.The state of Minnesota is not completely shameful, it does count the state’s loons. Though some technician has probably advised it would not be necessary to spend money for this kind of activity, so the state of Minnesota asks its citizens throughout the state — though a person employed by the state does compile the data collected for this endeavor — to donate their time, one day in the month of May, to try to count all the state’s loons.Usually each lake is occupied by a pair of loons who are mated for life. Each year they give birth and raise two hatchlings. Generally. This year on the lake my cabin is on, near Isabella, Minnesota, I have observed a group of five, possibly a family.The count, as accurate as it is, is all we know of the loon population in the state of Minnesota, as iconic as the loon is in that state. The loons know. The loons know, not only when, which lake they will return to. Then on the day of ice-out from that lake, they will call, in their reedy, Cajun drawl inspired from centuries of winters in Louisiana, call across the lake announcing that they have returned. The day of ice-out can vary from year to year, from lake to lake, from other variables. Thus the day of the count must be properly assigned. The loons know. The loons know how to choose their lake by an ancient system more complex than any online registration designed by modern technocrats. The lake must be long enough for their long and awkward takeoff as loons have solid bones unlike mallards, better to dive to the deep bottoms of lakes than to fly.Yet somehow they arrive at a lake or area of a large lake, and only that pair arrive at that lake or area of lake, always at the time of ice-out, usually in northern Minnesota about April 25 though that date can be even a month later. Somehow they know where and when to show. No missed connections. No territorial feuds. No apparent discussion. All preregistration based on a prehistoric connection in the relatively small mind (as measured by science of one of the oldest birds in the world. A system so remarkable even statisticians, analysts, computer programmers cannot fathom. This is wild. This is the wild.In 1990 the count in Minnesota was, however, 12,000 loons. Acid rain and acid snow melt have increased the mercury content in Minnesota lakes, diminishing the numbers of invertebrates, fish and thus the loons that depend on them. Another reason to count.Because what we do know about statisticians, market analysts, political pundits is, they are often wrong. Even scientists are not exempt from bias based on the more pressing needs of business and politics. Consider pharmaceutical researchers and climate change deniers as examples. Or trials without witnesses. Then add in technical procedure and human errors.Often our experts are watching the wrong data. Counting costs instead of loons.It should be obvious that the count of all animals — red fox, pine marten, river otter, black bear, moose and white-tailed deer, to name only a few — should be included. The birds, the trees too should be counted by people so that they know they are not just names listed on a page in a textbook and easily dismissed. I have counted my trees. I have 12 northern white cedars, nine by the lake and three on the slope. I have 72 white pines and 69 red pines, all over 100 feet tall. I haven’t counted the pines in my third of an acre across the road because the property lines are unmarked. I would guess there are 30 more tall pines.The count is not only the numbers, the numbers sent to those who want the degrees of facts, it is how we begin to see.James Johnson is a former poet laureate of Duluth. His work has featured the people as well as the plants and animals of northern Minnesota.

minnpost_2022_163,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Several years ago, I was doing some work for the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center. Taking a break in the cafeteria, I fell into talking with a quite thoughtful yet entertaining group of Korean War veterans. It was near Christmas, and one of them asked if I was a fan of the film “It’s a Wonderful Life.” I don’t much trust those who don’t like the movie, so I said it was something I made sure I watched each holiday season.My response was unanimously approved by the vets. One then forcefully said Jimmy Stewart was the film’s best actor. His opinion was based not just on Stewart’s acknowledged thespian prowess but because, “he was one celebrity who had a real education (Stewart was a Princeton University graduate , enlisted early for World War II and did serious military service and not just forced photo shoots to sell war bonds.” This veteran then added he couldn’t believe how much “people have come to prize so many movie stars and professional athletes and not average people like us who fought in real wars or helped build this country.” His friends agreed by displaying some of the saddest facial expressions I’ve ever seen on humans.I thought of these vets and their admiration of Jimmy Stewart despite his massive Hollywood stardomwhen the latest Kim Kardashian outrage recently gurgled up from the celebrity news swamp; that being Kardashian’s view (this is the cleansed version that ordinary women can succeed if they only arise from their posteriors and develop a taste for hard work. Of course, commentators wise and foolish alike remarked in large numbers upon the insensitivity and general inaccuracy of Kardashian’s remarks. That would include the idea that the U.S. employment market isn’t in trouble so much because huge groups of people are bone lazy butbecause (among many other factors , a whole lot of people over 55 have chosen or been forced to leave the work force.It’s probably fair to say that more people than should be permitted in an allegedly advanced society spend too much of their days and nights worrying about keeping up with people such as the vastly privileged Kardashians. I’m not one of those people. But this most recent outburst has me wondering why the hell so many of us continue to put so much precious effort and value into the ill-thought musings and often highly questionable actions of so many we have elevated to the level of celebrity.My concern with society’s decades-long celebrity worship isn’t often something that ruffles me up enough into writing a column. But given the fact that at present, innocents are being slaughtered in Ukraine, millions of people worldwide have died of a virus that has played the mutation game for two years, and a lot of men and women do indeed get off their asses (as Kardashian impolitely said they should and work their not highly compensated or appreciated butts off during a pandemic as custodial staff, healthcare workers, truck drivers, teachers and more, such idolatry seems naïve at best and nearly immoral at worst. Especially at a time when the world may be in as much danger and trouble as it has been since the days of World War II. Especially when learned experts and ordinary folk alike are not casually discussing the possibility of World War III.If the world manages to find a way out of its current peril without a war the horror of which almost none of us alive can imagine (much less World War II-style rationing , it mostly will be through the blood, sweat, tears and sacrifices of ordinary people who won’t have much time to keep up with celebrity follies.Ordinary people who might once again want to say they are happy to say it’s a wonderful life.Mary Stanik,a writer and public-relations professional, recently moved from St. Paul to Arizona.

After losing our house to the lender, my parents moved our family of six to the only available place we could afford — a two-bedroom unit in a fourplex on a major thoroughfare less than a mile from a 24-acre landfill. Our neighborhood had significantly more sites contaminated with industrial pollutants and significantly more People of Color and very-low-income families (like mine than Portland’s more restrictively zoned neighborhoods. I didn’t know it then, but the single-family-only zoning designed to racially and economically segregate American cities was keeping neighborhoods with cleaner air, better-resourced schools, less congestion and more trees out of our reach. These regulations achieved their intended segregationist purposes when adopted nearly a century ago, and they continue to do so today. I have since immersed my life in housing and climate justice work. As a law professor, I focus my research and teaching on housing and climate justice. I supervise the Sustainable Land Use Project of University of Oregon School of Law’s Environmental & Natural Resources Law Center. I serve on the board of Housing Land Advocates, which works to ensure all Oregonians can obtain adequate and affordable housing. I currently serve on a committee advising on how Oregon can reduce climate pollution in cities in a way that is equitable. And, in 2020, I advised on the implementation of Oregon’s Middle housing laws. This is why I was so concerned to receive a four-page flyer promoting a “Housing and Climate Justice” petition and urging me to oppose the Planning Commission’s recommendation to reform strict single-family zoning to allow “middle housing” such as duplexes and triplexes, and to provide incentives to create more affordable housing in all Eugene neighborhoods. Three things make this petition particularly misleading, in my assessment. First, the petition asks the City Council to reject a unanimous recommendation to adopt the most pro-affordable housing and racial justice zoning reform in Eugene’s history — urging the council to instead adopt a code based on the minimum compliance allowed by law. Second, the petition’s author claims that delaying this long-overdue reform is needed because feedback from housing or climate justice organizations or the public has not been provided. Exactly the opposite is true. Third, the petition’s website includes misleading and erroneous material. What will be lost if the City Council adopts the minimum middle housing code allowable under state law — as the petition demands? Incentives to create more affordable housing, climate-responsive housing and small housing. Fundamental to justice is genuine and fair participation. But the petition uses justice language to essentially erase the engagement of social and environmental justice organizations and thousands of Eugene citizens who participated in the most diverse and robust public participation process in Eugene’s history. The commission hosted Facebook Live discussions on affordable housing, exclusionary zoning, the state middle housing law and other topics. Meetings were accessible by Zoom and YouTube, and recorded. Economic consultants provided analysis. An Equity Roundtable advised on the work. There were stakeholder groups, surveys, info sessions and presentations. In a truly unique step, 29 Eugene residents were selected by lottery to join a demographically representative review panel that developed guiding principles, reviewed code concepts and vetted draft proposals. The product of this 18-month process is a middle housing code with broad and diverse support. No single policy action can solve our housing crisis or remedy a century of exclusionary zoning and environmental racism, but the Planning Commission’s recommendation takes a long overdue step in the right direction. We find ourselves in a time when many people aren’t sure who to trust. If your concerns are housing and climate justice, I recommend engaging with local and state organizations that have fair and affordable housing, racial justice, or climate justice in their missions — organizations like Better Housing Together, Beyond Toxics, DevNW, Fair Housing Council of Oregon, Housing Land Advocates, Huerto de Familia, Lane Independent Living Alliance, NAACP Eugene/Springfield, Oregon Law Center, Pacific Northwest Just Futures Institute for Racial and Climate Justice, and Springfield Eugene Tenants Association.

suffolknewsherald_2022_83,"Published 7:06 pm Friday, May 20, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonGuest columnistThe decade of 2010 began in a seemingly mild manner. Most of us were just “doing our thing,” paying only casual attention to the news, but nature was having a heyday.We heard about two very large earthquakes, one in Haiti that decimated important buildings and left 220,000 dead, one in Chile with a death toll of 525 people and, later, a mining accident left 29 miners trapped underground, no way to be rescued. A huge volcano eruption in Iceland sent black smoke 33,000 feet into the air.There was other news — about sports figures and the “doings of royalty,” the queen with her grandson Prince William and Kate’s engagement — and even the debut of the Downton Abbey drama. Unless we have some serious interests or are a part of what is happening, our interest wanes and the past loses much of its significance.The 2020 decade challenged and changed us and our country forever. We were moved almost breathlessly into what I call the “BC” era of modern history — “Before COVID.” Breaking news was sometimes new hourly. Greatly touted were political concerns. Almost everything in our lives was in some way affected.Think again about “BC” and wander back into what was happening when the new decade began spawning so much that would be new to most of us. In addition to COVID, there were politically disputed and vilified protests and horribly ugly words and actions. There was little or no sign of any understanding of the differences in opinion each of us might have, just strongly motivated people, many determined to put everyone under their control.The Sunday School class I teach had just begun to study the Bible book of Psalms. I doubt we could have imagined the relevance it would have as we faced the 2020 decade. The first psalm was comforting.Psalm 2 provides a clear understanding of the Creator God Who is in control of the world. The psalm writer makes fun of those who think they are in power.A more modern translation of Psalm 2 makes the point for today’s emerging understanding of language. The “nations” are really those who rule us.Why are the nations so angry? Why do they waste their time on such futile plans?The kings of the earth prepare for battle, the rulers plot together against the Lordand against His anointed One. “Let us break their chains” they cry and freeourselves from slavery to God. But the One who sits in Heaven laughs, the Lordscoffs at them. Then in anger He rebukes them…Only ask and I will give you the nations as your inheritance…(NLT Version What we need today is an understanding of the One Who rules in the affairs of man. We may think we can do as we please, but there will be judgment when we defy God and the laws He established for the people and earth He created. We need an awakening and prayers of repentance. When Israel left God out of their lives. or tried to change His laws, God judged them. Finally, they lost their land and all they possessed. America is not Israel, but Israel’s God is the Creator Who allowed us to have and live in our country and He will have the last word.The recent Leadership Prayer Breakfast in Suffolk was a reminder for all of us to bow the knee and heart to the only One Who can bring us the peace and stability we need for today and the future of ourselves and our children.Myrle V.

leoweekly_2022_65,"Dear Joe:I have a book coming out on March 8, and I need a favor. The publisher has pricedmy bookat $30. It turns out that a lot of people don’t have 30 extra bucks to spend on a book right now. So I’d like you to cancel the student loan debt of all my potential readers. Since the book is intended for general audiences, that means you’d have to cancel student debt for everyone.I know this is a big ask. But there are good reasons to forgive student loan debt apart from my naked desire to have penned a bestseller. Here are a few.I won’t insult you with the whole “you said you would do it” routine, though during the 2020 campaign you did say you’d “Forgive all undergraduate tuition-related federal student debt from two- and four-year public colleges and universities and private HBCUs and MSIs for debt-holders earning up to $125,000.” No one put much stock in that. Most of us who have been around a while understand that during a presidential campaign, words just sort of happen. Whether or not those words mean anything is the province of historians and art critics, not go-getting people of the world like us, right? Semantics is boring, and we’ve got business to tend to.The business of bookselling, for example. But other business, too. On my public Facebook page, I asked: “What would you do with the extra money if you didn’t have to pay your student loans?” Almost all responses can be grouped into three major categories: 1 buying or renovating a home; 2 investing in a retirement account; 3 charitable giving or other leisure spending (example: “We might go out to eat as a family, or have a date night. Do things people do when they aren’t accounting for every dollar.” .To be candid, not a single person said they’d use some of the extra money to buy my book. But I think that was implied. Anyway, my point is that no one said they’d stick the extra cash under their mattress, burn it or stuff it in time capsules. All that money — nearly $2 trillion — would go right back into the economy. Many of the people who responded, ordinary folks in the Middle West and thereabouts, will have an extra thousand bucks or more every month. They’ll spend it. Think of how happy you’ll make the construction industry! Real estate agents! Financial advisors! Retail booksellers!Lots of people said they would use the extra money to pay off other existing debts, especially medical bills. This course of action is less exciting than buying a tangible thing like a home or a crisp, new hardback book with riveting true-crime stories and incredible cover art. But even that money won’t be wasted. After all, hospital administrators, insurance company CEOs, and their ilk need to make ends meet too. If they can’t, who will finance astonishingly expensive political campaigns?Speaking of campaigns, I’m sure you know about the elections happening later this year. I’m sure you also know that it is widely assumed Democrats are going to be pestled into red goo if the Senate can’t pass something big, and it can’t just be medium big, it’s got to be big big, so big that it’s noticed by folks who are normally too apathetic to vote in a midterm. I’m sure you also also know that it isn’t going to happen. But you can fix that singlehandedly by canceling debt gnawing at 40 million American adults. Prominent members of your own party say you can do it “with the stroke of a pen.” Do it. Please. It will help me sell my book. A collateral consequence is that you might retain control of Congress and maybe even get a second term as president.This letter is meant to be a practical appeal, not a moral one. But given that so many borrowersnow report owing two to three times the amount of their original loansdespite years of regular payments, there are moral points to be made, too. When you were senator, and then vice president, you and nearly everyone else in Washington supported a bailout package totaling over $1 trillion for the biggest financial institutions. A great vulture’s claw descended from the heavens and clutched America’s banks tightly in its grasp, so that they would remain a solid mass and not crumble into grit and gravel. What I’m asking is a little extra food for the worker ants who provide the stable earth beneath that mass. It’s only fair.There may be drawbacks. Some people who are already very, very wealthy may get mad because they aren’t getting even more wealthy. Perhaps there is a powerful lobby of sour-faced Wall Street Journal readers who, having paid off their own loans, believe that there is a deeper life lesson to be learned from eternal peonage. And many of the same fat hogs who fund your campaigns also fund your opponents, so chances are good that the money you kick back to ordinary folks will pay the tab for more than a few GOP blood orgies.These drawbacks are more than offset by the aforementioned factors: Economic boosts, political power, fairness and the fact that you said you would do it. Also — and this is critically important — people will have a little extra scratch to buy my book. I hope you’ll consider this favor. It would help me out a lot.Very Truly Yours,Daniel J. Canon, Esq.P.S.: As an alternative, please consider banning my book. That sort of thing can really drive sales.Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor. His book “Pleading Out: How Plea Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class” is available for preorder wherever you get your books. ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_47,"Donald Trump often blames the messenger for his own words, but he’s got nowhere to look but the mirror for his weekend screed about terminating the Constitution, posted to Truth Social, which the former president created after being kicked off Twitter.So the message was purely Trump’s: “A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great ‘Founders’ did not want, and would not condone, False &Fraudulent Elections!”Trump was focusing on how Twitter had blocked the New York Post’s story about Hunter Biden laptop in the heat of the 2020 election. We said at the time that Twitter was wrong to censor our competitor and now Elon Musk’s newly purchased company is coming clean.But “termination” and “Constitution” don’t mix well and after rightly getting pummeled from all sides, Trump tried to clarify himself yesterday, again on Truth Social. From the horse’s fingers: “The Fake News is actually trying to convince the American People that I said I wanted to ‘terminate’ the Constitution. This is simply more DISINFORMATION &LIES, just like RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, and all of their other HOAXES &SCAMS,” as he continued to complain that the 2020 election was rigged and that he was the true winner, not Joe Biden.His firm belief, despite all evidence, that the 2020 vote wasn’t fair and that he didn’t lose in a popular vote landslide and a solid drubbing in the Electoral College, should disqualify Trump from running for a third time. Unfortunately, the only way to prevent that would have been if the Senate had convicted him in his second impeachment trial and barred him from any future public office.After all the damage Trump has done to the party, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and other non-crazies in the GOP conference probably would like a mulligan on their impeachment votes. If 10 more senators had joined their seven colleagues in voting to convict, Trump would have been history.— New York Daily News"
suffolknewsherald_2022_225,"Published 7:03 pm Friday, November 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceYounger children are known for their brutal honesty. Sometimes it’s sharing good things, such as expressing their love and affection to others. Other times, it can cause awkward moments as children ask about personal or sensitive matters. Young children can also be very expressive. Huge smiles and loud cries let you easily know how they are feeling.Their honesty and expressiveness can bring joy to the adults around them. Is there anything better than the huge grin of a small child running towards you with arms open wide for a hug? Perhaps an excited “Daddy!” or “Mommy!” lets you know that you were missed. They can be quick to say that they love you, but their joyful expressions tell you even if they don’t verbalize those feelings.They are often excited to tell you about their day, share every detail of their life with you, and verbalize and demonstrate their love for you.It’s not usually the same when they hit the teenage years. They don’t say, “I love you,” as frequently, and details of their day or life are often left unshared, even if you ask. Detailed explanations of their day are replaced with teenage grunts when you ask how everything is going. You’re stuck trying to dig for information, and there are times when it seems impossible to determine what they are thinking or feeling.It can be tempting to pull back on expressing our feelings to them because the joyful smile you once received when you told them you loved them has been replaced with an expressionless face and an unenthusiastic, “uh huh,” or another brief phrase.However, parents and other caring adults in the lives of teenagers must not stop speaking to teens about their lives, asking how they are doing, or telling them that they love them. It is just as important now as it was when they were little.Their rapidly changing minds and bodies may cause them to struggle to share their feelings, but they still need your love and support. They will never admit it, but their minds and hearts need to know that you’re still there, you still care, and you still love them.They may act annoyed while you are around, and teenagers need some personal space, but you must continue talking to them about life. Talk to them, ask them questions, and dig for the information that they may be bottling up inside.Speaking to them about the day’s events lets them know you’re there and care, even if they don’t return much in the conversation. What they do share can provide insight into what is going on in their lives and what they need from you. It may come out in clues or riddles, but you can often read between the lines of their words.Tell them you love them even when it’s met with a grunt. Ask how they are doing even when “fine” is all that is given in return. Remain a steadfast presence in their lives even if it seems like they want to be left alone. They need you.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

suffolknewsherald_2022_8,"Published 7:30 pm Friday, August 12, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAnother economic development “get” for Suffolk – a lawn and garden products plant announced, coincidentally, in the run-up to perhaps the most scrutinized vote Suffolk City Council members have or will ever cast – reminds us of the need for a new mindset in elected leadership.That is, Suffolk has so much momentum economically that it can now afford to be picky about what projects it recruits, considers and lets happen. And it might just be time, as a community, to set our sights higher than warehousing and distribution.Mayor Mike Duman and his council colleagues should take considerable pride in Suffolk’s enviable position. They helped create it. There was a time, not so long ago, when the city and those responsible for its economic vitality couldn’t afford to be so choosy. Veteran job hunters like Kevin Hughes, the current deputy city manager, have slowly but surely transformed Suffolk from Hampton Roads’ neglected stepchild to a vibrant, progressive place where companies want to set up shop.To be clear, the warehousing and distribution sector was a catalyst for the economic transformation, and elected and appointed leaders were wise to embrace it as a means to an end. The 18-wheeler frenzy on present-day Holland Road, especially after a current widening project is complete, strikes us as a tolerable annoyance to the extent that it jump-started a bigger and better economy. And no serious observer can quibble with the city’s hosting the massive Amazon hub that will open soon in North Suffolk. It is rare in the distribution sector as a major jobs creator.But elected leadership now has an opportunity to focus on “better” jobs and flex the city’s muscle as a regional economic player. So, when the Port of Virginia and its emissaries, every time they need more warehouse space, tell Suffolk to jump, the response no longer has to be “how high?”We’re not naïve about Suffolk’s reliance on a strong regional economy. Nor do we advocate an isolationist approach with our Hampton Roads neighbors. But Suffolk’s value in regional economic development should no longer be defined strictly by its vast farmland for future warehouses. In fact, what’s left of that farmland should be cherished, and sacrificed less often.As City Council members look angry citizens in the face in coming days and cast their vote on the controversial Port 460 project, perceived duty to the region should not be their overriding consideration. Suffolk is on the verge of big things with or without Port 460. Elected leadership must embrace our city’s new prominence, lead with confidence and set a higher standard of excellence than warehouses and distribution centers.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_252,"Published 5:29 pm Friday, September 30, 2022ByStaff ReportsKnowing how the “other half” of America lives is made real for us by pictures on the TV, but the devastation Ian wreaked on Florida was as hard to believe as some pseudo-science stories.The weather was brutal. How do we in lovely, sunny Suffolk respond to the devastation they have experienced?Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis asked for prayer. Hurricane weather has sometimes made a stop in Virginia, but nothing like this.It almost seemed like an omen. Initial projections about high winds and water may have sounded unreal but the forecasters were right on target. The TV pictures told the story of the mangled mess caused by the heavy winds. The body count may never be known. Some who perished may have been “unbelievers,” not paying attention to the newscasts, while others thought they could “tough it out.”Still others could do nothing and had to remain where they were, hoping for rescue. Now, just one day later we understand how helpless all of us are in an event of this magnitude.A TV commentator is asking, “What do you need right now?” The governor’s answer to that was a website for contributions. It was just another of the fine-tuned details and the concern he and the First Lady have for their people. Now it is up to the public to respond.Jesus often used stories of what he saw around him to teach spiritual lessons. He once fed 5,000. There is something about helping others that lifts us spiritually. That is because it is a biblical truth, often called “The Golden Rule.” Jesus said: “As you would that others do unto you, so do you also unto them.” The response has been welcomed. TheDeSantis said they have a good supply of food and water trucks moving into the affected areas.I thought of the disciples in the terrible storm on the Sea of Galilee. Jesus brought calm. I asked God for protection for my children who live in the Tampa area. They were kept safe, I thanked him for his protection.Some in the media want to politicize this and place blame where there is none. I suggest they read the biblical account about a great flood many millennia ago. The world had become very sinful and was about to be destroyed.God chose Noah, a man of faith. He told him to build an ark of safety. It took 120 years during which time he also warned the people who no doubt helped with the building of this great ship but did not believe Noah’s message.I would be remiss to say anything prophetically about this hurricane but I can say I believe God has some kind of lesson in this for all of us. Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man.” His return is promised to us in John 14.We need to seek him with all our heart, ask his forgiveness and search out what he wants of us so we are not lost in the flood of ideas and winds of change which are currently battering us. The Bible is full of wisdom and truth. God’s love is shown along with his mercy. He waits to rescue us when we call out to him. For that, we can sing praises to him. Psalm 148.Myrtle V.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_30,"Did you hear the latest knee-slapper from Marjorie Taylor Greene? The Georgia congresswoman quipped that if she had “organized” the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, “we would have won,” and that she would have brought weapons. Greene later insisted that she was kidding — just a little joke, about a melee that cost lives and has done incalculable damage to America’s democratic norms.It’s another reminder of the kinds of devils Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy is cutting deals with in his all-consuming quest to become House speaker. Because the Republican House majority taking office on Jan. 3 is narrower than McCarthy expected, he can’t win with just his mainstream caucus members. He must reach into the GOP’s extremist fringe.And no one is fringier than Greene. Her litany of crazy predates her election to the House in 2020 and includes suggestions that California wildfires were caused by space lasers controlled by prominent Jews, and that Hillary Clinton was linked to child-sex ring. While in office, Greene spoke at an event organized by notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes. Early last year, House members (including 11 Republicans voted to strip Greene of her committee assignments for endorsing political violence.It’s a measure of McCarthy’s cravenness that he has vowed to restore Greene’s committee assignments in exchange for her support for his bid to become speaker. This provides McCarthy with needed credibility among the extremists in his caucus — while giving considerable political leverage to a person who belongs nowhere near public office.Greene demonstrated her unfitness yet again on Saturday, during remarks at a New York Young Republicans Club event. Referring to the aftermath of Jan. 6, Greene said: “Next thing you know, I organized the whole thing, along with Steve Bannon here. And I will tell you something, if Steve Bannon and I had organized that, we would have won. Not to mention, it would’ve been armed.”In context, it was clearly a sarcastic dig at her critics. But the crowd’s eruption of cheers and applause at “we would have won” wasn’t an expression of humor at a punchline — it sounded more like camaraderie with an insurrection, and a clear indication that many in the room considered themselves connected to the “we.” Greene’s triumphant follow-up about weaponry did nothing to dispel that sense. Utterly absent from the exchange was any suggestion that what happened that day was tragic or even wrong.McCarthy, of course, has continued steeping in the shameful silence to which he retreats every time one of the extremists he needs to reach his goal says something horrific. If, as expected, he ascends to the speakership, it will be on the shoulders of some of the worst people ever to sully the halls of Congress — and the new House leader will be in their debt.— St. Louis Post-DispatchWho knew that studying espionage history is a thing?

leoweekly_2022_12,"As Charles Booker enters the homestretch of an uphill battle to defeat Rand Paul for a seat in the U.S. Senate, it’s obvious that the Louisville challenger’s path to victory is a razor-thin one, where anything short of bottling lightning over the next two months will probably result in a loss.Most signs and analysts point to Paul — a well-funded libertarian Republican in a red state — cruising to reelection. He won’t campaign much. He won’t unveil new problem-solving ideas. He won’t pitch the public. He likely won’t stand on a debate stage. He’ll just rely on name recognition, major network ad buys and a bet that Kentucky is allergic to change.But, let’s say, hypothetically, Booker — a progressive, grassroots Democratic who runs on an optimistic, electric, clear-eyed vision — pulls off the upset.Not only would that have a tremendous impact on a tightly-contested U.S. Senate, where both parties are scrambling to get an edge in what seems like a chamber that could be bent in either direction, but a Booker victory could also easily update, influence and inspire the quality of future candidates who come from Kentucky’s Democratic Party.Too many Dems in previous state-wide elections have walked on eggshells around political ideology, mincing words about their stances on big issues, and borderline apologizing for being slightly left of center.(In an embarrassing pander while running for U.S. senate in 2020, Democratic candidate Amy McGrath ran an ad featuring a Trump voter who said he was voting for McGrath to “drain the swamp” and get rid of Mitch McConnell. Booker has a kind demeanor, but he is unapologetic and transparent about his belief system. He’s not afraid to talk about universal healthcare, universal basic income, reparations, strong unions and pumping money into other federal programs. He has used his campaign slogan “From The Hood To The Holler” to symbolize the potential of state unity. He wants people to feel seen. He also wants to lay out everything he stands for as he campaigns, instead of the old elect-me-and-find-out model.We need more of that.The insincere, stand-for-nothing Democrat in Kentucky has to be a paradigm of the past.Booker could be a catalyst for the future. Paul, who is a robotic budget hawk who loves to dip into conspiracy, voted against the COVID-relief-focused American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, two major pieces of federal legislation passed in 2021.He spent a lot of the pandemic screaming nonsense at Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Elections are either won on hope or fear.Paul leans into fear, continuously framing the government that he’s lingered in as a corrupt, irredeemable force that needs to be slowly chipped away at and disempowered. He believes fierce cowboy capitalism is the only way. He wants to rip away government funding from every sector of American life and frame it as freedom from an oppressor.Booker radiates hope. He believes in directing money toward programs that will combat poverty, changing a brutal healthcare system, fighting impending climate doom and other crushingly large issues that impact almost every average American.If Booker catches fi re on the campaign trail and pulls it off, it would be pretty earth shattering to the political landscape, both on a state and national scale. Over the past few years, we’ve seen the national rise of a new generation of bold, forward-thinking Democrats who lean further left than their predecessors, but those politicians are mostly contained to dark blue parts of the map. Kentucky electing Booker would catch a ton of attention, and move the needle for progressive candidates everywhere. It would help dispel the myth that Democrats need to play it safe in certain areas. And it would prove that big ideas, empathy and connecting with people can win anywhere.The odds are long, but the ripple effects would be profound.While Booker likely needs a bit of a meltdown from Paul, and several memorable moments himself, I keep thinking back to what the progressive candidate told me during an interview shortly after his campaign launched.And that’s that Paul doesn’t often have Kentucky on his mind, because he’s too busy playing the game in Washington.“The main reason why not only is he susceptible to losing, he will lose, is he doesn’t see the people of Kentucky,” Booker told me. “Nor does he care about the people of Kentucky. And it’s very obvious. The people of Kentucky see it. Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, everyone sees he is a joke. All we ever needed — and all we need — to meet this moment in our politics are folks that have there courage to speak the truth, and to show love, and to go to those places that have been ignored and left behind.”.

In a 1926 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote, “Very often the apartment house is a mere parasite constructed in order to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district.” A few weeks ago, when another letter to our City Council compared renters to rats, it was hard not to see the direct parallel in thinking about who deserves a place in our neighborhoods and who should be excluded. At its core, single-unit zoning is exclusionary, and it hasn’t changed. It leaves us ill-prepared as a community for a future that requires equity and inclusion. The housing diversity made possible by Eugene’s customized implementation of House Bill 2001 will begin to undo decades of discriminatory local laws. Middle housing is also a critical component of our climate-responsive future. Heating and cooling energy account for 80 percent of the total energy a house uses in its lifetime. According to the analysis of a DEQ report on small housing, Sightline Institute found that just one unit of middle housing per block could reduce that block’s carbon emissions by 20 percent. Incremental change matters — it adds up when we are looking at 90 percent of our residential areas. An even larger climate factor is transportation, and middle housing and sustainable mobility go hand in hand. We need to provide more housing in locations that can offer easy access to transit, robust bikeways, parks and safe sidewalks. By nature, single-unit zoning creates a development fabric that distributes a few people over a very large area. Everyone is far from what they need. This makes walking near-impossible, biking unlikely and transit infeasible. Middle housing’s influence on this fabric will be slow and incremental — but when 40 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation, we should be organizing our community in a way that lets people choose not to drive. Syrett and Yeh are thinking about all of these issues, as we need them to be. We need our policy work to accomplish more than one thing at a time. We certainly need to take every opportunity to provide new diverse housing options when all reputable research and our own expansive local process supports it, and a state law requires it by summer. The same loud voices blaming developers for unaffordable housing are watching their own homes’ grow in value by 15 to 20 percent each year. According to the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, homeowners earn 40 times the profit builders earn. The problem we have is supply; our soaring housing prices reflect a staggering unmet demand. As a housing advocate for 1000 Friends of Oregon who also engages in communities across the state, my daily work is to protect our farms and forests while fighting for housing policies that serve the whole community. I’ve seen firsthand how Oregon’s cities are implementing HB 2001, and the public engagement in Eugene is among the most inclusive and thoughtful public processes in the state. 1000 Friends of Oregon is excited to see Eugene take bold action to increase housing access and to address critical equity and climate issues. The proposed Middle Housing Code Amendments will help."
minnpost_2022_114,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Reports that the US Supreme Court will overturn the 1973Roe v. Wadedecision that created a right to abortion under the U.S. Constitution has led to a flurry of commentary and speculation about that likely decision’s effect on the 2022 elections. A new survey, however, raises doubts that it will be a transformative issue.A recentSurveyUSA pollconducted for KSTP television sheds some light on the role of abortion in Minnesota’s 2022 electoral politics. The survey queried 725 state adults about their abortion opinions and how those opinions might affect their votes in November’s state elections. The May 5 – May 10 survey, weighted by gender, age, education and home ownership to reflect the state population, has a margin of error 4.4 percent.Fifty-one percent of Minnesota adults opted for keepingRoe v. Wadeas the law of the land. The survey did not, however, ask respondents if they knew the actual content of that court decision. The key divide in the survey concerned respondents’ differing views of the proper availability of abortion procedures. Thirty percent wanted abortion always legal, 25 percent wanted abortion “permitted with some limitations,” 26 percent wanted it available only for cases of rape, incest and saving the life of the mother and 12 percent wanted it always illegal.The major ideological and partisan divide was between those wanting abortion to be always legal and those wanting it mostly or always illegal. Fifty-two percent of Democrats and 58 percent of liberals opted for abortion being always legal. In contrast, 56 percent of Republicans and conservatives wanted it mostly or totally illegal.What was the presence of this “great divide” among key voter groups? A gender gap of about 7 percent existed between men and women, with men more in favor of restrictions than women.The crucial “swing groups” in the Minnesota electorate are suburban residents and political independents. Among suburbanites, 27 percent wanted abortion always legal, the same level of support evident among rural poll respondents. Thirty-eight percent of those residing in the suburbs wanted abortion to be usually illegal. Similar percentages obtained among independents, with 27 percent opting for no limits on abortion and 42 percent preferring it to be usually illegal.One crucial question for 2022 is how important the abortion issue looms in Minnesotans’ voting decisions. Those advocating no limits to abortion clearly have intensity on their side, with 54 percent saying the issue would be very important in their voting choices. Those who supported making abortion illegal under many or all circumstances were about 20 points less likely to say it would be very important in their 2022 voting.The major political opportunity for Minnesota Democrats and liberals, then, lies with stoking intensity among their base supporters about the abortion issue. Fifty-one percent of Democrats, 49 percent of liberals and an impressive 77 percent of those very liberal indicated that a candidate’s abortion position would very likely influence their vote for that candidate.This part of the electorate, however, is always likely to turn out in considerable numbers, so it is far from clear that many additional votes will come from them in 2022 because of the abortion issue. What can come from this segment of the electorate, however, is additional volunteer activism and financial support for campaigns. Expect the state DFL to spur that activity among their intense abortion supporters.In other parts of the Minnesota electorate, however, it is not very evident from this survey that abortion will transform the state’s 2022 electoral landscape. Countering liberal activism on this issue, 51 percent of very conservative respondents also indicate that a candidate’s position on abortion is very likely to influence their vote. The 9 percent of the sample who are very conservative adults comprise a group half again larger than the 6 percent of respondents who are very liberal.The issue also is far less important for those who are political independents or who reside in the suburbs – who often determine the direction of state politics. As Julie Roginsky, a national Democratic consultant recently noted about 2022 voters’ thinking about abortion, “Is this something they lose sleep over every night? No. What they do lose sleep over is, ‘I can’t fill up my gas tank, it’s really expensive. I can’t afford to send my kid to college, it’s really expensive.’ … Any voter who will vote purely based on (Roe is an incredibly committed voter who will be coming out in the midterms, anyway.”Roginsky’s point applies to Minnesota voters. Given the many issues besetting Minnesotans, abortion seems be just one in a large crowd of concerns. It may help Democrats’ turnout at the margins, but its influence on the overall state results, as evident in the survey’s findings, may well not extend beyond that limited effect.Steven Schier is the Emeritus Congdon professor of Political Science at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota."

With reason, prudence and reliance on God!Preparedness is always a good practice in any crisis. Having basic supplies and essential items at home, such as nonperishable foods, paper products and prescription medications, and cleaning items like soap and disinfectants, is a common sense practice.Practice prudence. To be prudent means to act or show good, careful decision or judgment for the future or when handling practical matters or crises, such as how to deal with the pandemic.With the lingering COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing normal flu season, precautions, policies and recommendations (from health authorities and agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are important tasks for everyone, for the common good. They are designed to decrease or prevent the spread of illness or disease.Washing hands frequently with soap and water and using hand sanitizers are simple tasks for everyone. Wearing masks and social distancing are a must, especially when in public and closed space gatherings. And of course, getting vaccinations and booster shots, especially for the seniors who are vulnerable to any type of diseases.Other important considerations for everyone to take: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home when you’re sick, except to get medical care. If you feel your illness is getting worse or believe you’re not getting better, go see your doctor.Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily — tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, cabinet handles — with alcohol wipes or a regular household detergent and water. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent and water prior to disinfection. Always follow manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products.Choose a room and bathroom in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy.Trust in and pray to God. Fear and anxiety may overwhelm us, while dealing with the pandemic, seasonal flu, common colds and other crises beyond our understanding, intelligence and knowledge. Our complete trust in God, through his Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is all we have to do, after all the actions, efforts, prudence, precautions and recommendations we’ve taken to fight off the COVID-19 pandemic that has been lingering globally for more than two years.Our prayers can do wonders, not only for yourself but also for others. We have to pray to God for others. After all, we are one big human family. In our prayer, we ask for the intercession of all saints, who were once sinners, like us, so our prayers become meaningful and effective. Pour out our heartaches and pains, sacrifices and sufferings to our loving God.In his letter to the Philippians, chapter 4, verse 6, St. Paul instructed us to “Have no anxiety about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition (or supplication , with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.”With our faith or trust in, and prayer, and thanksgiving to our Lord Jesus Christ, we can experience healing and peace, mercy and love, comfort and compassion with others. Our faith and common sense practices are, henceforth, crucial to our survival in dealing with the pandemic and other crises befalling us all.Let us pray…and give thanks to God.

minnpost_2022_10,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Two years ago, the memehongkong YouTube channel posted avideoin Chinese explaining how Biden rigged the 2020 presidential election. The video on supposed rigged voting machines in Michigan has 320,000 views and zero misinformation disclaimers on YouTube. Yet the problem of misinformation affects more than the Chinese community.Misinformation disproportionately affects Asian, African, and Latin American diaspora communities in the United States. False information on the 2020 election and COVID-19 targets susceptible immigrant communities. It endangers both democracy and public health. The United States must pursue a federal program that helps diaspora community leaders and organizations teach members about misinformation.Current policy efforts focus on English language misinformation on major social media platforms. They are important, but insufficient. Social media platforms currently lack the ability to flag misinformation in other languages. Diaspora communities also use different communication apps based outside of the United States to chat with loved ones abroad. These communication apps do not face the same policy attention on misinformation that Facebook and Instagram do.Holes in current policy allow for foreign interference. Misinformation campaigns from abroad spread extremism within the United States. False information has already affected America’s fight for representation and health for all. TheStar Tribunefound in May that 22 percent of the Minnesota Department of Health’s interviews with people who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases required an interpreter. That is more than five times the proportion of the state’s population lacking fluency in English. The government must act now before more lives are needlessly lost.A federal program combatting misinformation will provide educational resources to leaders and civil society organizations that communities trust.Misinformation creates anxiety towards government action in diaspora communities. Known leaders and groups promoting the program give legitimacy to a government action that some members may be skeptical of at first. Putting trust in local actors identified by the Office of Migrant Education will immediately pay off. Showing commitment to all citizens will increase diaspora members’ trust in government. Trust is not something that is easily found; it must be earned.A federal program combatting misinformation should reflect our nation’s diversity. It should make initial investments to understand the variety of cultures and languages of susceptible communities. Creating a flexible program that accounts for these differences can benefit the United States past the realm of misinformation. Understanding Mexican Americans’ fear of one-party rule can improve the government’s messaging on the importance of civic responsibility. Knowing that Korean diasporas across the country continue to use the social app KakaoTalk to communicate can improve the United States’ communication with these citizens.A federal program combatting misinformation will have an immediate impact on educated communities. Its impact will not stop there. Immigrants have connections beyond their immediate diaspora community. Educated citizens are more likely to spread their knowledge on misinformation to loved ones across the country and around the world. Keeping people safe is not just a priority of the United States government. Health and mental wellbeing are important to everyone. The program may not directly educate all members, but will have its impact on everyone through our collective need as Americans to help one another.There are concerns about the costs and scope of such a program. A $100 million program would provide more funding than the Office of Migrant Education’s High School Equivalency Program. This funding would account for the research of cultural differences between diaspora communities, program development, and distribution to selected community leaders and organizations. This would be a large investment. Sadly, the $13.8 billion cost of vaccine-preventable COVID-19 hospitalizations from June to November of 2021 is far larger. Higher vaccinations, greater diaspora confidence in the government, and fewer COVID-19 hospitalizations will demonstrate the cost savings and progress of the program. Fifty-five million Americans identify as members of target diaspora communities. A federal program that demonstrates commitment to these citizens through direct and indirect education benefits everyone. It benefits democracy and public health for all Americans.Two years ago, memehongkong posted a video in Chinese explaining how Biden rigged the 2020 presidential election. Today, the United States has the opportunity to ensure that all of its citizens are protected from misinformation on COVID-19 and election security. No citizen should be more vulnerable to misinformation because of their ethnicity, culture or language that they speak. A federal program will increase trust in government, invest in understanding our cultural differences, and impact people beyond its initial reach. Now is the time to avoid unnecessary damage to democracy and public health. Now is the time to ensure that Americans do not view memehongkong’s video as fact, but as a crucial lesson in fighting misinformation.Samuel Lee is a graduate student from Minnesota studying international law and organizations at George Washington University."

On Jan. 6, 2022, I join 30 faith leaders across the nation on a hunger strike for voting rights. I joined these dedicated faith leaders because I believe in freedom and democracy. Likewise, I’m praying that my grandchildren and their peers do not have to deal with voting rights issues.As a United States Marine, I served my country in support of freedom and democracy across the globe. As Americans, we deserve no less here at home. There is no freedom and democracy without voting rights. There is no freedom and democracy without free and fair elections. Free and fair elections are not just hallmarks of democracy but sacred trusts that must be protected.Unfortunately, state legislatures across our nation have passed laws that are negating these sacred trusts. Passing nationwide voting reforms is one of the single greatest ways we can stave off undemocratic attempts to overturn fair election results on the national, state and local level. The freedom to vote early and voting by mail are safe, convenient and useful means to avoid long voting lines that can last hours. Election workers should be free and able to serve without fear. As a nation, we cannot allow voter suppression and election subversion to determine who gets to vote, whether a person’s vote is counted, and who counts it.I pray that the Congress will hear our cries and prayers for the passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act on Jan. 17, 2022.

philinquirer_2022_28,"Democrats alone can t fend off the dark forces that put Doug Mastriano on the Republican ticket, writes State Rep. Dan Frankel. The threat arose from within the GOP, and that’s who must extinguish it.On Election Day, Democrats were nervous.As I moved through my very progressive district in Southwestern Pennsylvania, I saw anxiety on every face, if not outright despondency.Facing historic headwinds during this midterm election, my party was expected to fall short nationwide, and the consequences would be dire in Pennsylvania. Doug Mastriano, the Republican candidate for governor, had spent the last six monthscozying up to white Christian nationalistsandsowing doubt in our electoral system. Hehad a close relationship with the founder of Gab, a social media platform that hosts antisemitic content.Mastriano was down in the polls, but even if he lost, there were still Republicans on the ballot in Pennsylvania who refused to call out his explicit turn toward hatred.» READ MORE:How Mastriano sank deeper into antisemitism | Will Bunch NewsletterOf course, Mastriano did lose his bid for governor, andhe lost big. Pennsylvania voters resoundingly rejected extremism. Our next governor will be a Democrat and a Jewish man, Josh Shapiro. Not only did we elect back-to-back Democratic governors forthe first time since the 1950s, but we alsoflipped a Republican Senate seatand likelyflipped the Republican-controlled state House(results arestill being tallied for the first time in more than a decade.But even as we enjoy the exhilaration of having protected our democracy and stood up for the values of tolerance and multiculturalism, I know that Democrats alone cannot fend off the dark forces that propelled Mastriano to the top of the Republican ticket.This threat arose from within the GOP, and it must also be extinguished from within.The dangers of antisemitism are not theoretical. My district includes the Tree of Life building, the site of an antisemitic attack almost exactly four years ago thatleft 11 of my friends and neighbors dead.“This threat arose from within the GOP, and it must also be extinguished from within.”There was a moment after the attack when it appeared that Pennsylvania’s lawmakers could unite to fight the scourge of antisemitismtogether.At a specialjoint session of the General Assemblymonths after the attack, with survivors and family members of those killed looking on, I told the story of Squirrel Hill, the neighborhood where I grew up and the heart of Jewish life in Western Pennsylvania. I shared the stories of the 11 souls taken from us as they gathered to worship, and I called on my colleagues to take action to address the clear, growing threat of hate-fueled violence.Democrats and Republicans got to their feet and applauded.But that warmth and enthusiasm did not extend to any action.Despite the assurances of support that day,my legislation to address hate crimes for the first time in decadeshas gathered dust as the Republican majorityblocked consideration or even hearings. I worked closely with the Pennsylvania Catholic Conference and gained itsendorsementfor the legislation, I scheduled meetings with Republicans that included Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, and I reached out to individual GOP members, but all I got back was silence. Out of the 113 Republican members of the Pennsylvania House, only one signed on to mybill— and she’s retiring.When Mastriano’s shoestring campaignpaid $5,000 to Gab, the site that hosted antisemitic content from the Tree of Life shooter, Republicans said nothing. PayPal, GoDaddy, Medium, Stripe, and Visaall terminated their relationships with Gab.Pennsylvania Republicans’ silence spoke volumes.When Mastrianoaccepted a $500 contribution from Gab founder Andrew Torba, the man whobragged about spikes in Gab traffic after the killings in my district, I heard still not a word from my Republicancolleagues who professed a unified stand against hate.When I spoke out about the dangers of Mastriano’s hate-normalizing campaign,I became a target myself of vile antisemitic threats and slurson Gab.Through it all, my Republican colleagues in the Pennsylvania General Assembly resisted calls to even make a disapproving statement.As much as we would all like to think that absurd, unaddressed conspiracy theories about Jews or Black people or elections will simply fizzle out on their own, we can see quite clearly that the opposite is true: These lies fester and multiply, and they inspire violence.The commonwealth has seena dramatic increase in hate crimes, with 255 reported last year, according to data maintained by the Pennsylvania State Police. That’s more than any other year since cases began being tracked in 1997, and almost as many as the previous three years combined.The forces of intolerance don’t rest between elections, and neither can we. My hope is that electoral defeat can accomplish what violence against my community could not: a decisive separation of the Pennsylvania Republican Party from dangerous extremists.Voters made their voices heard on Tuesday. Will the GOP finally join the table and unify against intolerance, or continue to fan the flames of hatred?Dan Frankel, a Democrat, represents the 23rd District in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives."
eugeneweekly_2022_16,"We ve got issues. What if Eugene’s new City Hall not only served as the center for Eugene’s civic life and agenda for decades to come, but also powered essential government buildings and services, providing clean, renewable energy capable of being stored onsite while greatly bolstering community resilience in the face of ever-increasing disasters caused by climate change? I propose that Eugene look to the future when making generational investments like constructing a new City Hall and think about how this critical project can best serve current and future community members. Why not build a City Hall that generates massive amounts of clean renewable energy by optimizing it for solar, micro wind turbines and other forms of feasible renewable energy? Why not incorporate a massive battery storage feature in the design — perhaps with Oregon’s own long-duration battery storage company ESS Inc. —that could act as a clean power plant for essential city functions and the people of Eugene when disaster strikes (which it inevitably will as climate change makes once in a generation weather events commonplace ? The new City Hall would serve as a clean microgrid capable of powering Eugene through blackouts and brownouts — many of which are now preemptive during periods of treacherous summer heat and windstorms in an effort to limit the number of mega-wildfires that have become the new norm in Oregon and much of the Western U.S. Why not include a large electric vehicle charging station that will allow the city to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles while also serving as a tourist attraction and boon for small businesses in the Market District for people driving EVs who would otherwise drive right past Eugene on the highway? Why not construct a beautiful and sustainable building using locally sourced materials designed by a leading green building company, many of which are located in the Willamette Valley, and create hundreds of good paying jobs? Like it or not, we’re living in the climate crisis right now, and things will only get more challenging in the years and decades to come. By thinking outside of the box, however — and making smart, strategic investments in critical infrastructure — we can help prepare this beautiful city and its community members for the future we all know is coming. Let’s be bold. Let’s pass down a new City Hall that shows that our generation understood this critical moment in human history and made big, bold investments that will benefit this community for decades to come, serving as a model for other communities around the country. Let’s build a new City Hall that will power Eugene into the future, both figuratively and literally. Let’s make it a living embodiment of what this community values and represents. A place we can point to and be proud of as we do our part to accelerate the transition from dirty, polluting fossil fuels to a clean energy economy. I can think of few better opportunities in the near future for this community to show young people — and all future generations — that a better world is indeed possible. For the past few years, young people have literally been walking out of school and “striking for the climate,” demanding bold leadership and climate action. Well, here’s a chance to show them we’re listening. Important disclaimer from the author: Nothing contained in this guest-viewpoint should delay the long overdue project of establishing a permanent City Hall in Eugene as soon as possible. For a community that prides itself on civic engagement, not having a permanent City Hall for going on a decade is simply unacceptable. Zach Klonoski recently moved from Portland back to Eugene with his partner and their 3-year-old child, Quentin. He is a lawyer and dedicated climate and political activist."
leoweekly_2022_45,"This year’s Earth Day celebration falls on Friday, April 22. Earth Day took shape when U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson realized that to correct the environmental devastation he witnessed in this country, it would take a groundswell of citizens aware of the need to protect the environment and ready to come together to express their admiration and love of nature. On the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970, 20 million Americans participated in organized rallies in parks, auditoriums, college and university campuses and on the streets, making it the “biggest secular gathering in American history.”This led to laws protecting water, air and endangered species, and eventually to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. Earth Day spread internationally in 1990, and in 2016 the Paris accord protecting the global environment was signed on Earth Day. For the 50th anniversary in 2020, over 100 million people participated in the “largest online mass mobilization in history.” These are highlights of a now-extensive history, but every other year, it is usual, in some communities to celebrate for one day; in others, programs and actions are planned for the whole week.While the back story of the development of Earth Day celebrations is replete with competing principles and complex characters, the guiding spirit for Earth Day activities remains the benevolent celebration of the planet. Children are central to the activities as they are encouraged to engage with nature. They are the future, of course.This year, Earth Day is in a shadow cast by therecent report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC in which 278 scientists from 65 countries examined 18,000 sources. Their conclusion is that immediate and large carbon reductions are necessary to keep the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Already, at a rise of 1.1 degree Celsius, we have had increased floods, hurricanes, wild fires and drought, and we may be approaching tipping points where the damage will be beyond repair. The two key factors driving all of this are our current lifestyles that warm the atmosphere, ocean and land, and runaway emissions from industrial agriculture, oil and gas production and abandoned coal mines.You might ask, what can I do? First realize that your personal actions actually have an effect. Recycle glass, paper, aluminum, cardboard and plastic. Learn what those numbers in the triangle indicate, because some plastic cannot be recycled and it is harmful when it slips into the environment. Reduce your digital footprint; turn off your power strip and lights when you aren’t using them.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_67,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Nine months into Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, the damage done to the world’s 11th-largest economy is extensive. Leading Russian banks have been cut out of the global financial system, some $300 billion of central bank reserves are frozen, and hundreds of foreign companies have departed. Parts shortages have hobbled the auto industry and threaten commercial aviation. In the wake of Putin’s mobilization order, tens of thousands of young workers have fled the country. An OECD forecast released last week projects Russia’s economy will contract by 5.6% in 2023.The economic punishment inflicted on Russia hasn’t stopped the pummeling of Ukraine. But sanctions have weakened Russia’s standing as a world power, dissuaded ostensibly impartial nations from aligning with its government and sowed doubts about Putin’s leadership among Russian elites. Convincing them to press for an end to the war will require the U.S. and Europe to tighten the squeeze even more.Since February, sanctions have raised the costs of the war, by reducing Moscow’s ability to buy what it needs, while making the market perilous for outsiders.China, India and Turkey are importing Russian crude, but at a steep discount, and Russia has struggled to redirect gas exports once bound for Europe.Russia’s imports of technology it needs to sustain its war machine — let alone spark future innovation — have been effectively cut off for months. Never mind that what it can buy, when it comes to electronics components, is now often faulty. Moscow will adapt, but not swiftly.Even so, for now the direct impact on the war remains limited. Squeezing the world’s largest hydrocarbon exporter, one with a hefty current account surplus, requires targeting those exports, a process that is beginning in earnest only now. Moreover, Russians had already suffered a grim decade, with real household disposable incomes peaking around 2012. So while the economy is expected to contract this year by 3.9%, there is less distance to fall. There’s also the inescapable fact that Putin is more than willing to sacrifice future economic growth for his personal aims and can easily silence dissent.Sanctions rarely produce swift political change or an instant end to conflict. With Russia’s forces in retreat, it’s critical that the West ratchet up the pressure. Most obviously, the U.S. and its allies should continue to arm and financially support Ukraine. They should also encourage Russia’s worsening brain drain.At least 350,000 people have already fled Putin’s ill-advised mobilization order, causing consumer confidence to plunge. Western governments can accelerate the process by offering more humanitarian visas, added support for Russian students, and incentives for scientists and tech professionals to move abroad.Not only would Western economies benefit, but Russia’s labor and skills shortages would intensify.Europe should further work to close sanctions loopholes. To cite one example, there’s evidence that the Russian military is importing home appliances to neighboring countries and using their microchips to make up for the loss of access to Western semiconductors. (Armenia has imported more washing machines from the European Union during the first eight months of 2022 than the past two years combined. Rigorous action will also be needed to enforce EU crude sanctions and a U.S.-led price cap on Russian oil, which would extend a ban on selling insurance and other services to ships that fail to comply.Above all, Western governments and their partners need to stick together. Russia’s economy is hollowing out, and the war is not going Moscow’s way. Putin still thinks Ukraine’s supporters will crack first.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_88,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°‘So many mansions’‘So many mansions’Ever wonder why so many mansions are being built on Hawaii Island? It’s because they don’t involve a lot of red tape or public opposition.The catch is they are being built on agricultural lands, where regulations allow one house per acre. This is why so many agricultural parcels are being sold as luxury real estate. Homebuilders who want to build single-family neighborhoods or low-rise apartments on ag lands must apply for a district boundary amendment, which typically triggers public hearings, public opposition and legal battles.The point is not to subject mansions to the same red tape as other types of housing. Rather, the laws should be changed so more homes can be built “by right.” That is, if they meet all the existing requirements, they can be built without politics getting in the way — as it is for many of the island’s mansions.To be clear, those who own mansions contribute to the county’s property tax base, and their philanthropy can prove vital to the community, such as when Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff donated $3 million to provide classroom resources for Hawaii’s teachers last year.But it is ironic that Hawaii Island’s high housing regulations benefit the rich at the expense of the county’s general workforce, many of whom are struggling to meet their housing needs.Hawaii County needs new homes to attract critical health care workers and teachers, stop the island’s brain drain and house future generations. A few affordable housing projects are making their way through the bureaucratic process, such as Ku‘u Papaikou on the Hamakua Coast and a Parker Ranch development in Waimea, but their success isn’t guaranteed.If they fail, the landowners and homebuilders won’t be the only losers. The community will lose out on more affordably priced housing, while the wealthy keep building mansions.Joe KentExecutive vice president,Grassroot Institute of HawaiiIll-advised billWith reference to (the Nov.13 Tribune-Herald front-page article, Councilman Aaron Chung’s last-minute attempt to revert back to political, nonprofessional engineering appointments of Public Works and Environmental Management department heads is abhorrent and irresponsible.This proposal was introduced by the 2018-2020 Charter Commission chairman, citing the same rationale as Mr. Chung is now using to justify his new bill.After significant testimony by many professional engineers, the suggestion was voted down on third reading by the commission and, rightfully so, did not make it as a charter amendment. Mr. Chung most certainly knew, or should have known, about this decision, yet decided to dig it up again.His statement insinuating that lawyers may be more suitable (the only ones? for such critical positions because they are “trained to think” is both ludicrous and laughable.The county’s hiring process is not crippled by lack of qualified professionals, but the combination of insufficient pay and the lack of tenure and job security as incoming mayors can easily replace competent incumbents without cause.This situation is addressed with recommendations in the recent Cost of Government Commission report.It’s truly sad that Mr. Chung would end and tarnish his otherwise productive tour as councilman in this manner. I trust the incoming council will carefully research and scrutinize this ill-advised, swan song legislation and, again, say no.Neal F. HerbertHilo"
minnpost_2022_47,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesota is experiencing three related crises — a serious child care shortage, an inadequatesupply of workers and some of the nation’s worst achievement gaps.All three crises pose a serious threat to Minnesota’s present and future. The common thread running through them is a need to quickly and dramatically improve our early care and education (ECE infrastructure.Gov. Tim Walz deserves a lot of credit for proposing a historically large investment in earlychildhood programs to address those crises. Now, the House and Senate need to work on a bipartisan basis to pass legislation that gets the details right.Over recent months a diverse group of organizations ranging from Minnesota’s business groupsto children’s advocacy groups formed an ECE Crisis Work Group focused on the specifics ofwhat is needed. These are groups who experience the three crises in different ways, so theirconsensus report is a key contribution to this debate.The work group’s first recommendation is to fund Early Learning Scholarships for 31,000 low income Minnesota children who currently can’t afford quality early learning programs.These scholarships will give an early learning lifeline to the children who are at greatest risk offalling into achievement gaps that open as early as age one. At the same time, those 31,000scholarships will create an influx of new consumer demand, which will incentivize child careprograms to stay open and expand. And the scholarships also will empower thousands ofparents to get back to work to address Minnesota’s acute labor shortage.The Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP is another funding stream that has been used to help low income children. But policymakers need to reform CCAP so that it is ensuring our mostvulnerable children are benefiting from research-based kindergarten-readiness best practices. If resources are available after serving all low income children, we recommend the Legislatureextend such subsidies to middle class families as well. Doing so will help families that arestruggling to afford child care. It also will create additional consumer demand to encouragechild care programs to say open and expand in communities experiencing shortages.Many policymakers are interested in funding direct grants to help child care programs expand.The work group also supports those efforts, as long as the assistance is tied to adoption of thebest practices that our young children need to thrive.References to quality improvement are woven throughout the group’s recommendations. For example, scholarships are preferred, because they demand the use of quality programs. Why does quality improvement matter so much?First, economists have found that quality programs are necessary to achieve a high return-on-investment (ROI for taxpayers. For a public investment this large, maximizing ROI ought to bea foremost consideration for good stewards of tax dollars.Borrowing from the medical sector, the first rule for our ECE investment strategy should be to “first, do no harm.”By the way, this focus on ECE quality improvement is something that both the Trump and Bidenadministrations have promoted, so it is a relatively rare area of bipartisan agreement.Business and technology innovator Steve Jobs frequently stressed that, “Details matter, it’sworth waiting to get it right.” Facing three related crises that threaten all Minnesotans, statepolicymakers don’t have time to wait. But this work group’s recommendations will help themquickly get the all-important details of ECE investment and reform right.Jan Kruchoski is retired managing principal at CliftonLarsonAllen, and a former president of theMinnesota Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors.

minnpost_2022_143,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We are getting older. Not just individually, but as a population. We’re in the midst of a demographic shift that will see the number of older people (age 65-plus in the U.S. grow larger than the number of children (under 18 for the first time in our nation’s history by the year 2030.Although, you could never tell this shift is happening just by looking at the ways our society spends its public and philanthropic dollars. Even as the aging population grows, we continue to see a decline in funding dedicated to meet the needs of this growing group. In Minnesota, less than 1% of philanthropic dollars go to aging services.So where does this inverse relationship between the number of seniors and the support for them come from?As a nonprofit focused on helping people safely remain in and keep their own homes, we’ve confronted our fair share of justifications.Out of sight, out of mindThe reality is most of us have an issue with the fact that we’re growing older. The negative ways we talk to each other and ourselves about aging is laced with deep-seated ageism that suggests simply the act of growing older is synonymous with becoming less useful, less desirable and less healthy.And so, we do our best to ignore it. But often, an unintentional byproduct of viewing our own aging so negatively is projecting those same feelings onto others. As a result, we end up ignoring the unique needs of the older adults around us.There is no easy solution here. Securing services tailored for aging adults is a start, but all the funding in the world won’t undo cultural programming. We must reframe what it means to age and challenge the way talk about it to ourselves and one another.Charitable funding should be an investment. Why invest in something old?When investing in something, either financially or emotionally, there’s a somewhat natural inclination to want to see a long-term return on that investment. When it comes to the way we fund public services, it’s easier for many to see support services for younger demographics as a wiser investment because it’s the next generation. Over time you may see decades of impact on a single life and feel that your charitable investment has generated a healthy return. The perception is investing in services for someone in the later acts of their life won’t yield that same return.The overwhelming majority of us want to remain in our own homes as we age and we will all need some level of support to do so safely and comfortably, in a home we’re proud of. The more we work to secure accessible aging services now, the more options we will all have as we grow older ourselves.They had time to financially plan for getting older, why should I have to support them now?There’s undeniably a stigma around needing a little extra support as an older adult. The implication is the individual didn’t prepare well enough or made the wrong decisions as they grew older.We hear some version of this reasoning too often, and it’s harder to respond to because it often boils down to an oversimplification and a lack of empathy. We all know life is beyond unpredictable. No one can “prepare” for life-changing illness, tragedy, freak accidents, systemic marginalization or any number of unpredictable circumstances that can decimate even the best laid financial plans.Aging better togetherIf we are lucky, wewillgrow older. It’s one of the only experiences every single one of us has in common with one another.Instead of constantly thinking of aging as a shameful secret that makes us less than we were, we should strive to recognize it for what it is; a natural process of change and growth, where we become more ourselves.Our growing aging population doesn’t have to be viewed as a burden or a scary demographic shift.If we are truly committed to becoming a more inclusive society that celebrates our differences and looks out for one another, that must include equity for people of all ages. No one should be forced to age out of their community. We all deserve choices in how and where we age; in the places we love.Because isn’t that how we’d all like to grow old?Deb Taylor is the CEO of Senior Community Services, a local nonprofit that helps older adults and caregivers navigate aging to maintain independence and quality of life.

suffolknewsherald_2022_213,"Published 5:26 pm Tuesday, January 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsReaction has been swift to outgoing Attorney General Mark Herring’s lawsuit alleging a pattern of racial discrimination by the Windsor Police Department in the way it enforces the law.Amid the hot takes by both critics and defenders of the town, we prefer the approach of incoming Attorney General Jason Miyares, who says he will take his time and assess the facts when he takes office in a couple of weeks.The allegations, on their face, are serious: that Black motorists are more likely to be stopped and have their vehicles searched than white motorists driving through town in central Isle of Wight County. The suit asserts that Army Lt. Caron Nazario, a Black and Latino man whose treatment during a 2020 traffic stop went viral and caused an officer’s termination, was the rule rather than the exception in Windsor. The town in central Isle of Wight has long had a reputation as a speed trap along heavily traveled Route 460, but lawsuits by Nazario, and now Herring, allege something far more sinister.The timing of Herring’s suit — in the final weeks of his tenure as attorney general — immediately drew criticism from the town and supporters of its police department. What else but political opportunism, they wonder, would drive Herring, who was defeated by Miyares in November’s election, to take such action on his way out the door?The timing does raise eyebrows. On the other hand, there’s an old saying that it’s never too late to do the right thing. An investigation as thorough as Herring purports to have conducted takes time, and less than a year has passed since video of Nazario’s mistreatment became public. If Herring’s motivations were entirely political, he will be exposed soon enough by the courts, where the lawsuit now resides. If the allegations prove to have merit, citizens should be grateful that Herring took action, regardless of the political optics.We appreciated the initial reaction by Miyares, whose spokesperson told the Suffolk News-Herald last week that he would review the “facts and applicable law” after taking office later this month. Miyares, of course, could simply drop the lawsuit. And an immediate announcement that he would do so surely would have been popular with many who voted for him and gave Herring the boot in November.Instead, Miyares is doing what he should: Assess the suit independently on its merits. He should then either let the suit proceed in Isle of Wight Circuit Court or give a detailed accounting of why it should not. Until then, all stakeholders would be wise to avoid knee-jerk reactions.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_71,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°What do Elizabeth Holmes, Sam Bankman-Fried and Al Capone have in common? No, they are not all convicted felons. Capone did serve time for tax evasion, and Holmes was recently sentenced to 11 years in prison for defrauding the public through her blood-testing company Theranos. But Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has not yet been charged with anything, although regulators and investigators are sorting through the financial carnage.The answer to what they have in common is that each one employed a time-honored strategy to win public approval — the “virtue narrative” — even while they were boldly picking pockets.During the Great Depression, the Tribune reported that a mysterious benefactor opened up a soup kitchen in the Loop and was doling out three free meals every day to more than 2,000 hungry people. A bit of investigative work revealed that the good Samaritan was none other than crime boss Capone, who could easily afford such generosity, given that the annual income from his criminal empire derived from booze, gambling and vice was north of $100 million a year.Whatever sympathy Big Al may have had for the hungry, part of the image he cultivated as a public benefactor was to create a virtue narrative. “I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time,” he said. Feeding the hungry went along with that, and his efforts were not unsuccessful, given that many people regarded him as a hero before he ran afoul of the Internal Revenue Service.Holmes founded Theranos, the blood-testing company that couldn’t learn much from testing blood. But it was an effective vehicle to raise money. Her story was that she wanted to revolutionize health care by eliminating the torture of the blood draw. Who wouldn’t want that? All that was necessary was a finger stick that was capable of a detailed blood analysis, which would revolutionize diagnostics. A ubiquitous figure in the media who constantly described her desire to change the world for the better, the Silicon Valley wunderkind crafted a $9 billion company out of virtue.Holmes quickly became a darling of the media and Wall Street. She recruited an impressive cast to the board of Theranos, including former U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, a U.S. senator, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and two former U.S. secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Shultz, in particular, was so enamored of what Holmes was saying that he ignored warnings from his own grandson who worked at Theranos. He told his grandfather that the company’s blood-testing machine did not work, and to Schultz’s subsequent embarrassment, his grandson was right.The virtue narrative caused experienced people to exercise egregiously bad judgment. Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of News Corp. and owner of The Wall Street Journal, was an investor in Theranos: “Of course it was fraud. But I only have myself to blame for not asking a lot more questions. One of a bunch of old men taken in by a seemingly great young woman! Total embarrassment.”In terms of money, Bankman-Fried outperformed Holmes and Capone. He was CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange company FTX and the related company Alameda Research. The value of FTX was in the neighborhood of $32 billion. His virtue narrative was “effective altruism”: making huge sums of money and donating it to worthy causes such as efforts to address global warming, pandemic preparedness and animal welfare. He and his partners started a project called the Future Fund, designed to make investments in “socially impactful companies,” according to their website. It sounds so wholesome.Savvy venture capitalists and those who didn’t know cryptocurrency from cryptography flocked to invest. Bankman-Fried secured naming rights to the field at the University of California, Berkeley stadium. He sat on stage next to Bill Clinton and Tony Blair touting the future of cryptocurrency. FTX commercials featured, among others, Larry David, Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen and Steph Curry.The whole thing appears to have been a giant Ponzi scheme and collapsed earlier this month. Bankman-Fried’s wealth, estimated in billions, has largely vanished as FTX filed for bankruptcy reorganization, along with 130 associated entities. Investors are likely to be left out in the cold; those prominent commercial pitchmen are now being sued presumably by those who think they have been bilked.The practice of proclaiming virtue while amassing wealth and power, often unethically or illegally, is not new. It is reminiscent of the indulgences the Catholic Church sold in the Middle Ages. As a means of expiating their sins, the wealthy would purchase indulgences from the church. This was basically a medieval virtue narrative: The church amassed wealth to finance ornate cathedrals, while individuals were free to continue sinning with the tacit approval of the clergyWhen I was a young man, I visited the legendary Chicago writer and cynic Nelson Algren in his Wicker Park home before he decamped to New Jersey. He told me, “When you examine why prominent people and corporations do things, there are two reasons — the reason they give publicly and the real reason.”In this case, the public reason is the virtue narrative, and too many people including investors, politicians and journalists want to believe the virtue narrative at the expense of the real reason.Dr. Cory Franklin is a retired intensive care physician."
leoweekly_2022_53,"Let mestart this note by saying that not everyone in jail is guilty. In fact, according to Louisvillejail policy committeedata from Oct. 2021, about 75% of inmates at that time were awaiting trial, and the presumption is innocent until proven guilty.Why do I say this? Because people are dying in local jails and, to me, it feels like we’re just not mad enough about it, and I think it’s because, as a society, we think those in jail are throwaway people.I’m not sure what is happening at Metro Corrections but the number of inmate deaths is frightening. As of this writing,eight inmates have died since late November.Being arrested and detained in Metro Corrections should not be the judge, jury and sentence of death. What on earth is happening in our local jail system? We should all be asking this question and we should be getting answers instead of more excuses or radio silence.Metro Corrections has claimed a shortage of staffing has contributed to the deaths.Sure, short staffing creates dangerous situations, but we’re talking about eight people in such a short period of time; it’s really fucking weird. Does Metro have a serial killer?I’m only half-joking, because this situation is both odd and really frightening. At any time, caught in the wrong moment, any citizen in Metro Louisville could find themselves on the wrong side of the jailhouse. Is this what we face? We need to be concerned and vocal about getting the solution.The causes of jail deaths have beenblamed on drugs, on overcrowding, understaffing, underpaying, on medical issues, on… blah, blah, blah. Yes, all of these things are true and yet, the mystery of why this many people have died in such a small span of time remains a mystery.Metro Corrections Director Dwayne Clarkis retiringthis coming month with Lt. Col. Jerry Collinsreplacing himas the new director. Collins is familiar to Metro Corrections, having retired from there in 2021 to work as jail commander in the Clark County Sheriff’s Office in Indiana.The FBI is investigating at least one death, while Mayor Greg Fischer has been his usual flat, and dispassionate self, but he has hired new people to deal with the issue. He has hired Amy Hess and Ron Heady to serve as Public Services assistant chiefs, and Gary Raney, a jail death expert (whatever that means .Despite these actions, the city isn’t moving quickly enough, and inmate deaths keep happening. Clark has been named in a class-action lawsuit about the length of time inmates are being held after their supposed release dates. This lawsuit was affirmed in a Nov. 24 ruling by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Even the Metro Corrections FOP Lodge 77 president has pointed fingers at Clark over mismanagement of the jail. But, of course, the FOP loves a scapegoat.On Tuesday, Metro Corrections announcednew drug-searching security measures, but these don’t seem to realistically address what is happening. The new measures include open and copied non-confidential mail, opened confidential correspondence in the presence of an inmate, no magazines or books from third parties allowed, new body scanners, increased frisk and search (surely this will go well , more K-9 sweeps and new schedules for inmate work aides. Meh, OK, but how do these measures address a problem that really has yet to be named directly? Not all of the deaths are drug related. At least three have been called suicides.Can all of these deaths be the fault of management? Yes, management has a lot to do with the behavior of their staff, but there seems to be something more happening beyond poor management. Gross negligence is definitely a part of it.Fischer’s new Public Services assistant chiefs, Hess and Heady, will focus on six areas of concern. According to the city those are:I guess, for the general public and those at risk in the jail system, the game of wait and see continues. There isn’t much for the general public to do, but we do deserve answers as to why these people continue to die in the care of those who are supposed to preserve and protect them either during, before or after their trials and potential sentencing.The mayoral candidates have weighed in on the topic and called it “unacceptable,” “a crisis of inaction” and have asked for greater transparency, new leadership, and one candidate even asked for the creation of a Citizens Commission. Bottom line, something needs to change immediately.As a city, we have to be mad about this. We have to get answers, and while we’re waiting, please return to the refrain, “We’re all innocent until proven guilty.” I want that statement to be true again instead of the opposite. When we believe that innocence is first, before proof of guilt, then we will hopefully and should have more compassion toward those caught in the system who are at real risk of poor outcomes and possible death. It could be any one of us.At a time when the citizenry has little faith in its police and its justice system, these deaths don’t bode well. A root change is long overdue.. ( ."

minnpost_2022_51,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As a lifelong northern Minnesotan, I have never experienced a holiday season without snow.It always arrives just in the nick of time to blanket the land in sparkling brilliant white that offsets the reds and greens of twinkling holiday lights. On Dec. 15 we saw a stark contrast.An unprecedented storm carrying lightning, thunder, rain and damaging winds whipped through the state. Southern Minnesota experienced tornado warnings — a first in recorded weather history for such a late calendar date. While this storm was a shock to many, those of us who recognize the reality of the climate emergency saw it as a warning for what is to come if we do not literally clean up our act.The earth is in crisis. While we have been steadily marching down a long road of progress toward decarbonization and a clean energy future, this march has proven too slow and has taken too many detours. Since the collapse of the 2009 Waxman-Markey Climate Bill, Congress has had a dismal track record for supporting broad climate legislation. In the absence of federal directives, many states have led the way by instituting clean energy standards and goals. In Minnesota, utilities have surpassed the 25 percent by 2025 standard that is currently on the books. While this progress is commendable, it is evident that the current standard, and the current pace of change, are not enough to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of climate change.Case in point: Xcel Energy’s Integrated Resource Plan, which is currently being considered before the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. There’s no question that Xcel has taken some positive steps — most notably, by abandoning plans to build the gas-fired Sherco plant. The plan still does not go nearly far enough in decarbonizing our state and building a thriving, clean energy economy. Instead of going all-in on renewable energy, Xcel is taking half-measures and undermining its own progress. Its proposed addition of two gas-powered peaker plants would do untold harm to our climate action and Minnesota communities already overburdened by pollution.I worked in the utility energy policy sphere for more than a decade. As a person who believes fully in climate change, and the value of not only renewable energy but distributed and equitable clean energy, I viewed my role as an agent of change within a flawed system. I spent a decade advocating for progressive policies within the utility, to little avail. The unfortunate reality of a corporate institution is that it bends to the will of outdated regulations, status quo and wealth. The pace of change is often slow and the benefits to the institution need to be guaranteed before any movement is made.Right now, Minnesota’s investor-owned utilities have an opportunity to rise to this make-or-break moment by making bold investments in distributed and equitable clean energy. I know from experience that there are forward-thinking changemakers currently employed by Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power, poised to bring these utilities into the future. However, their critical voices will continue to be stifled without a fundamental shift in values and culture, and a willingness to be clear-eyed about what we’re facing and what it will require of us.Utility companies, and their regulators, urgently need to shift their mindset from fighting to protect their market share in traditional ways to facilitating a model where they are stewards of communities and ensure the benefits of clean energy are distributed equitably. Continuing to grasp at power and wealth by clinging to models of the past will ensure a certain demise — for both the companies and the planet.Jenna Warmuth is the Midwest regional director at Vote Solar, a national nonprofit advocating for a 100 percent clean energy future.

If you ask my 8-year-old son, it’s the Suffolk Peanut Fest. That is exactly what we did this last Saturday, along with thousands of others from Suffolk and the surrounding areas.Theresa Earles, publicity coordinator for the event and the city’s tourism development manager, estimated that at least 100,000 people attended the four-day event, including about 40,000 just on Saturday.40,000 people, that is a lot of funnel cakes and fries. My son is learning about “Never giving up” in his Bible study group. So when I asked for the 50th time, “hey bud, how about we just turn around and go someplace else,” his response was “no way, we can’t give up.”We spent the time singing to the radio, watching the hot air balloons go up and the sky divers come down. We may have missed the famous peanut butter sculpting contest. We even missed the loud crashing of the demolition derby. But in the end we made it to the festival.

Sherry Bird, as well as Capt. Thomas Shopay (who’s not a candidate for chief wasn’t mentioned in the article on Tuesday, Dec. 13. Instead, it came out on your Wednesday, Dec. 14, issue. It appears that the commission waited until the West Hawaii public meeting to surface the matter.Also, like Mr. Prentiss Moreno in his letter published on Thursday, Dec. 15, I find in interesting that Chairman John Bertsch recused himself only after the finalists were announced. From the get-go, it was the aim of the commission to be transparent in its process of finding a new police chief for the Big Island.However, I think this has not been accomplished, given the fact that two candidates have a connection to the chairman of the commission.Given this, the commission may find itself having to make a choice from two finalists (Moszkowicz or Applegate or revisit the process used and return to square one.Don’t get me wrong, these four finalists are qualified. However, the next Big Island police chief will have the opportunity to develop a strategic plan for the department that brings about organizational transformation, which is a key element of the community policing philosophy.Having a vision and mission statement, along with core values, isn’t sufficient without a plan that moves the department in a positive direction. The commission needs to select the candidate most suited to undertake transforming our police department.James SanbornHiloA health hazardMahalo to Mayor Roth and county officials for sending a dumpster truck to assist in the cleanup at Ala Kupuna (Maunakea Access Road area on Friday, Dec. 9.Along with the Royal Order of Kamehameha and many volunteers, a lot of items were removed as Tutu Pele was moving in the direction of Saddle Road from Mauna Loa.During the cleanup, it became clear that the sanitation facility which was removed from the Pu‘uhuluhulu hunters’ check-in station needs to be restored. As the eruption has attracted thousands of visitors, and (despite the pause in the eruption many of those visitors continue to climb Pu‘uhuluhulu, especially at night, without proper sanitation facilities, they are forced to relieve themselves all over Pu‘uhuluhulu and elsewhere.While the kia‘i have graciously opened and maintained three relief stations along Ala Kupuna for use by visitors, there is no facility on the Pu‘uhuluhulu side.This is a health hazard that could be easily remedied by placing a relief station in the parking lot or other appropriate area.Kini BurkeHiloRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2022_182,"Published 6:51 pm Friday, February 4, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:I am writing you this letter to add on to the article titled “Mask requirement still stands for SPS” that was published on Jan. 23. I am one of many who fervently oppose the executive order Governor Youngkin has provided, and I wish to put my voice as well as those who agree with me out there in this letter. Suffolk Public Schools is completely in the right to disobey Youngkin’s orders, because COVID is still ongoing and more severe than how it started.COVID has not disappeared but instead has gotten worse since it began in 2020. The Omicron variant is still running rampant through the entirety of Hampton Roads. The New York Times’ COVID-19 graph shows we are in a current peak nearly double the size of 2021’s peak. I believe those who oppose the mask mandate and the governor himself do not understand how devastating the new variant is. Omicron affects us not because of its symptoms, but by ruining the natural pace of our daily lives. I have seen many of my family members and close family friends catch Omicron and be set back on their productive work by weeks. First, my mother had her paycheck cut in half, and I was unable to assist in paying bills for quarantine reasons. We barely would have made any bills this month if it was not for my father’s help. Second, Omicron even affected my own schoolwork, going far as to nearly cause me to fail in one of my classes. Lastly, my sister-in-law is currently suffering from “long covid,” and feels sluggish after being negative for two weeks.The current mask mandate in school is one of the most effective obstacles blocking the virus from spreading even more than it already has. Public schools in Suffolk often have thousands of students switch classes in crowded hallways four times a day. Schools are very vulnerable and hazardous settings because of this, so if Governor’s Youngkin’s order were accepted by Suffolk Public Schools, it would expose thousands of students to the virus, and therefore tens of thousands of people through their families. Not to mention, schools are already struggling with absent teachers and bus drivers. They would only further suffer without the current restrictions put in place.My family, friends, and I are all glad that Suffolk Public Schools are refusing to listen to Youngkin’s orders. If you decide to publish this, I hope my anecdotes convince the readers to continue to follow CDC guidelines. I can relate to how tired we all are of COVID, but it is not to be taken lightly. Please, continue to wear masks, get vaccinated, and keep our small corner of Virginia safe.Taha BilalSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_102,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There is no more important, nor more urgent, environmental issue facing humanity than the climate crisis. If we don’t address it with far more urgency than we have, nothing else will matter to our children’s children. Nothing.Proponents of new nuclear power generation claim that advanced nuclear power can be part of the solution to addressing climate. However, nuclear proponents may once again be promising more than they can deliver.Supposing there is a new nuclear technology that addresses the incredibly high costs of new nuclear generation, addresses the radioactive waste problem and that avoids risks from terrorism and potential meltdowns. Supposing there is a breakthrough, and that technology became available tomorrow morning, how quickly would they start generating power?Given the history of nuclear plant construction, it’s hard to believe any reactor could be permitted, constructed, and in operation in less than 15 years. In climate mitigation, that’s too late.Decades ago, proponents claimed nuclear power would deliver electricity “too cheap to meter.” That never happened. Nuclear power has becomemoreexpensive and next generation nuclear plants have been consistently cancelled. Over 40 planned reactors have been cancelled in the U.S. in the past 50 years, almost always because of cost, despite the federal government’s huge subsidy in underwriting insurance for catastrophic meltdowns in the Price-Anderson Act.In 2017, South Carolina Gas & Electric’s residential customers were paying 18 percent of their electric bills to finance two new reactors, when the project was cancelled – after$9billionhad already been spent, due to delays and rising costs. Minnesota electric ratepayers were among the first in the country to end up paying for a never-finished nuclear plant – a long-forgotten project in Wisconsin that cost $103 million before it was abandoned in 1974.New technologies might bring down the costs and speed up construction, but after decades of nuclear promises that didn’t pan out, the old adage, “I’ll believe it when I see it,” might be appropriate here. Nuclear power is gettingmoreexpensive, not less, over time.Addressing the climate crisis requires enormous, extremely challenging, changes in our economy. We need to build out renewable energy sources that work – like wind and solar (which have become less expensive over time – coupled with energy storage technologies. We need to electrify transportation, heating and cooling, and industrial sectors of the economy. Also, energy efficiency, including retrofitting residential housing and all buildings, and converting our agricultural system to store carbon in the soil instead of adding to greenhouse gas emissions. These are concrete steps we must make.During the transition, prematurely shutting down existing nuclear plants instead of coal and other fossil fuel generation – something Germany did several years ago – is not a good trade-off. Continued operation of existing nuclear reactors is better for climate than coal or gas power plants.Contrary to claims of nuclear moratorium opponents, the moratorium does not hinder discussion of new nuclear technologies. In Minnesota, the people who talk the most about nuclear power repeatedly claim that the moratorium prevents them “from even discussing it.” Their own words belie their claim.Xcel Energy, the one Minnesota utility with experience operating nuclear reactors has expressed interest in continuing operation of its Monticello reactor but has not proposed any new ones. Xcel has plenty of political clout at the Capitol but has not made a significant attempt to repeal the moratorium. They are phasing out coal and gas plants but recognize that new reactors couldn’t be constructed fast enough to speed up the phase-out of fossil fuels.This year, in response to an attempt to repeal the moratorium, I offered an amendment to require any new nuclear plants be financed the way other power plants are – by the utilities, who are compensated by ratepayers when they are completed and generating electricity. My rate-payer protection amendment was defeated. Nuclear proponents don’t want to admit it, but nuclear reactors are so expensive and so prone to massive cost-overruns, that utility investors are not willing to take the risk.When investors are willing to bear the risk of nuclear power, perhaps we can believe their statements about how new reactors are part of the climate solution. Until then, we would be wise to use existing reactors until we are able to eliminate all fossil fuel plants and complete the transition to renewable power. Minnesota’s nuclear moratorium doesn’t interfere with any of that.Viewing some long promised, but not yet viable, nuclear technology as a panacea, gives people an excuse to avoid taking real action to address climate. If 30 years from now they develop some new nuclear technology that makes sense, that’s great. But if we count on new reactors to help address climate – the earth is cooked by then.Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville is former chair of the Senate Energy and Environment Committee and an author of Minnesota’s nuclear moratorium."
philinquirer_2022_12,"Divestment from Philadelphia’s public school system negatively impacts the health of students, teachers, and staff.Philadelphia’s universities provide some of the best educational opportunities in the world, yet they coexist in a city with underresourced public schools. The School District of Philadelphia is in a dire public health and budget crisis while the University of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson University, and Drexel University build on their existingenterprises.In order to remedy this inequity, incoming Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. must make identifying sources of sustained funding his highest priority. City officialsshould compel universities, hospitals, and other nonprofits to make PILOTs, or payments in lieu of taxes.These problems are not new. Philadelphia bore the brunt ofGov. Tom Corbett’s school funding cuts in 2013, leaving students and staff to deal with increasingly hazardous school conditions. In May 2018, The Inquirer reviewed five years of internal maintenance logs and building records and found thatschool staff members had identified more than 9,000 environmental problems, including mold, asbestos, and classrooms with flaking and peeling lead paint.The consequences of these toxic conditions are already felt. Asthma prevalence in school-age children in Philadelphia isdouble the national average, teachers in Philadelphia have beendiagnosed with mesothelioma, andlead exposure threatens students’ cognitive development. The School District’s newFacilities Planning Processis a step toward addressing these problems, but it stillfalls short.In the face of increasing urban inequality as well as the massive land development and financial growth of universities, wealth redistribution is a much-needed first step to addressing our unsafe school conditions. Around 17% of Philadelphia’s total real estate value isowned by nonprofits and thus not taxed. Meanwhile,over 23% of Philadelphians live in povertyand suffer from the most brutal consequences of inequality, such as a crumbling public education system.While PILOTs are voluntary, the superintendent and others are empowered to make an appeal to these institutions to ask them to voluntarily contribute. The practice of nonprofits making PILOTs to their municipal governments is not a new one. During Mayor Ed Rendell’s administration in the 1990s,Philadelphia nonprofits paid PILOTs to the city annually. Boston’s major institutionsmake PILOTs contributions to the city in the millions of dollars.As the wealthiest private institution in Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania should be well-positioned to contribute to the School District. Amid the breakneck speed andmassive scaleof its property development, Penn hasgrown its endowment by over $5 billionover the course of the pandemic. M. Elizabeth Magill started her term as the university’s president in July, making this a critical moment to demand Penn pay its fair share.“Under new leadership, there is potential for change.”Jefferson University is also in the middle of turnover amid massive growth. Jefferson recently expanded its enterprise through a series ofpurchases, such as acquiring Einstein Healthcare NetworkandHealth Partners Plans Inc., and throughnew construction. Jefferson has persisted in its development of buildings despite COVID-related financial setbacks. It announced plans in September 2020 to build its$762 million Specialty Care Pavilion, which is currently under construction. In addition, Jefferson opened the$184 million Silvestri Towerlast September and plans to build a12-story research building, projected to cost between $300 million and $350 million. The university also finds itself at a crucial juncture as it searches for a new school president. Under new leadership, there is potential for change.Drexel University also benefits disproportionately from the city’s property tax exemptions. Huge real estate developmentssuch as the ongoing Schuylkill Yards Projectdrive up the cost of housing in West Philadelphia,further leading to the displacement of long-term residents. Meanwhile, Drexel reaps the rewards of not paying its fair share of property taxes. While Drexel “gives back” to the local community by engaging in select services, such as theDornsife Center for Neighborhood Partnerships, the university falls short of addressing the systemic conditions of inequity that push residents to need nonprofit services in the first place. It’s time for Drexel to cede the privilege it wields through its tax-exempt status and invest in the futures of our school communities.» READ MORE:A broken education system requires more than one-off investments from billion-dollar institutions | OpinionThe School District of Philadelphia needs long-term, sustainable funding to ensure that students and staff are supported, and to decrease the prevalence of health disparities caused by chronic underfunding. Schools in Philadelphia deserve justice through the removal of barriers to work and learning, not merely equity through community services typically given by wealthy nonprofits like Penn, Jefferson, and Drexel.Building relationships with the new university presidents and supporting progressive campaigns that call for wealth redistribution, like PILOTs, can provide the funding needed to enable the removal of harmful environmental toxins in schools, and serve as excellent first steps in working toward a vision of justice that prioritizes the safety of students, teachers, and staff.Akira Rodriguez is an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

We share in the heartbreak we are feeling for the families who have lost a loved one and extend our sympathy to the students, parents, staff and entire Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District community.We understand that a tragedy close to home can cause our community to feel fear or anxiety. As added precautions, our school resource officers (SROs will be more visible and vigilant throughout our buildings. Our safety monitors will continue to regulate the check-in/check-out process to ensure that all building entry points are secure.We have also been in contact with the Suffolk Police Department to increase police presence in the vicinity of our schools. We know that children and teens will process this news in different ways. Therefore, counselors are available at each school building to assist students who may need some extra support.Since children often look to parents and educators for understanding and guidance, we have provided a compilation of strategies and important points to consider when discussing a tragedy or crisis with children.Keeping our students and staff safe is our top priority. Our strong partnership with the Suffolk Police Department and Suffolk Fire & Rescue allows school administrators and community leaders to work together quickly and efficiently on threat assessments, investigations and other safety concerns.In addition, every Suffolk school has a crisis management plan approved by the Virginia Department of Education. All students, staff and administrators regularly participate in safety and lockdown drills to test their preparedness and understand their roles and responsibilities in the event of a crisis.School should and must be a place where students feel completely safe and secure.

minnpost_2022_92,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial from theMankato Free Press.Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over the state prosecutions of the former Minneapolis police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd more than two years ago, this week put off the last of those trials to next January. His stated reason for doing so has nothing to do with public access to the trial, but his order does buy time for the court system to get this aspect right.Jury selection was to begin next week for Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng, who are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the Memorial Day 2020 death of Floyd, who expired with the knee of Derek Chauvin on his neck. Chauvin has already been convicted of murder. Another officer, Thomas Lane, pleaded guilty last month.Cahill’s ruling, released Monday, said Lane’s plea deal — and federal convictions of all four on charges of violating Floyd’s civil rights — created “a reasonable likelihood of an unfair trial” were it to begin next week. Hence the six-month delay.Cahill also refused to reconsider his ruling in April prohibiting live audiovisual coverage of the trial. The trial of Chauvin — and that of former Brooklyn Center officer Kim Potter, convicted of manslaughter in the shooting death of Daunte Wright — were livestreamed and frequently carried on metro television stations. But Cahill and fellow Hennepin District Court Judge Regina Chu held those trials during the pandemic, and ruled that livestreaming was the only way to provide the public access to the proceedings.Cahill ruled in April that the receding of the pandemic takes away his discretion to permit the coverage. We disagreed then. We believe that the wider the public access to these high-profile trials, the more confident the public will be in the outcome.The state court system is ponderously revisiting the issue of livestreamed trial coverage, and Cahill on Monday said that if the rules are changed by Jan. 4 he will revisit his April ruling. If that happens — and it should — livestreamed coverage of this important trial will be a feature, not a bug, of this delay."
suffolknewsherald_2022_116,"Published 5:32 pm Wednesday, April 13, 2022ByStaff ReportsThese are heady times for Suffolk’s economy and those responsible for its vitality.No longer just the talk of the region, the city is getting national attention for its industrial growth.As reported by our Jimmy LaRoue in last Wednesday’s edition, Commercial Search’s Industrial Pipeline Report, a respected trade publication among economic developers, declared the 3.8-million-square-foot Amazon robotics fulfillment center soon to open in Northgate Commerce Park as the third-largest industrial “completion” in the entire country so far in 2022.Deputy City Manager and veteran economic developer Kevin Hughes gave credit where it was due when asked about the recognition.“In order to support this substantial facility in Suffolk, a tremendous amount of visioning and planning has taken place over the years by City Council members, Economic Development Authority members and city staff,” he said. “I can’t say that we anticipated a 90-foot tall and 3,800,000-square-foot facility being built during our years of planning and preparation, but it is rewarding to know that the efforts by many allowed us to be able (to accommodate it.”The $230 million Amazon facility will employ about 1,000 people, will be the second-largest building in Virginia after the Pentagon, and the largest industrial building in the state. Right here in “Surprising Suffolk,” where economic success stories aren’t so surprising anymore.LaRoue reports that the city is also in the running for a 1.5-million-square-foot distribution center being sited by a Fortune 50 (yes 50, not 500 retailer. It would be located off Enterprise Drive along Route 58 in the Virginia Port Logistics Park.Known for now as “Project Coastal” in its confidential stage, the facility would “provide for new private capital investment in land, building and distribution equipment which will provide substantial employment,” City Council members were told at a recent meeting.The city would be asked to pony up $150,000 in matching funds for a new access road that would be required to accommodate the project.That strikes us as a small price to pay for continued economic progress in Suffolk.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_268,"Published 5:49 pm Tuesday, September 13, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:I have lived in Suffolk and Nansemond County all my life. I am writing to voice my concerns against the rezoning of 500 acres of farmland to heavy industrial for the Port 460 Logistics Center.Recently, Suffolk has been overwhelmed with logistic warehouse projects. The large multi-modal logistics park on U.S. 58 East has caused many traffic accidents and delays on a daily basis. I fear the proposed Port 460 project will escalate traffic congestion and accidents to an intolerable situation for Suffolk residents.Suffolk already has a large area of land zoned heavy industrial that will support the Port of Virginia. I question the need for this project in this location. VDOT has previously published data on the high congestion, crash, and fatality rates of U.S. 460 versus other similar roads in Virginia. How much worse will an additional 9,000 vehicle trips per day cause?If this permeable farmland is replaced with concrete and asphalt, I am concerned that it will result in highway and road flooding due to drainage problems.I am also concerned about how the Port 460 industrial site and run-off will affect the water of Lake Meade and the water supply and its quality. Many homes in this rural area have wells to supply water to their homes, including mine.Lastly, I am concerned with how this huge industrial warehouse and distribution center will affect the surrounding rural nature of residential property owners. I believe it will have a negative effect on surrounding home and property values.There are other uses that fit this site in a more positive ways than another warehouse project. Also, if you rezone this site heavy industrial and things go wrong for the Port 460 project, then many other industrial activities could wind up on the farm. This is just not a good idea.The citizens of Suffolk elected our city councilmen to represent our citizens best interests, not those of “out of state” developers, the Port of Virginia or their own best interests.I believe there is the appearance of potential conflict of interest by a councilmen who is with a regional commercial real estate firm in the region. Be assured, the citizens of Suffolk are aware of it and are watching.City Council has not faced this type of opposition for any other proposed zoning. I request that they deny this rezoning request.Nancy WhiteSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_287,"Published 5:39 pm Friday, August 26, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:The debate about whether to approve the U.S. 460 warehouse complex raises a conundrum. Both sides have passions and facts that counter each other.We can talk about new tax revenue but wonder if that means the citizens will see their taxes decrease. We can talk about new jobs but note that there are not many Suffolkians in need of a job and ask whether the wages will be sufficient to allow them to rent or buy any of the new apartments and townhouses springing up all around the city. We can talk about improved roads but reject the cost and inconvenience of their construction, or the nature of the increased traffic on them. Some say the trucks are coming anyway, the other says they don’t need to stop here.One side says this development is growth the other says this is not sustainable progress. One side says this will help Suffolk, the other asks how the life of the citizen is actually improved by this. Point, counterpoint, how does the City Council decide? We elected them to represent us in questions such as this and this is, therefore, their job. Maybe.In May 1787 delegates met in Philadelphia and over the next few months crafted and then signed the Constitution of the United States. It is the foundational document of our country. It established our democracy. And it’s first three words are “We the people” written in very large letters.So here’s the conundrum: what do the representatives do when “we the people” give them clear guidance on our wishes in a particular matter? The issue arose at the recent public meeting where the issue of the complex was raised.On Aug. 17, “we the people” came to a public meeting in order to debate the question of developing an area of land within our city in a particular manner. A citizen petitioned City Council to change the law in order to sell the land – changing the law requires council approval. Hundreds of “we the people” showed an interest this matter by attending the meeting to debate it. And what is clear from the debate is that we told our representatives, “no” we do not want you to change the law in this matter. There can be no doubt that was the message sent to the council. The people’s stance was clearly shown when virtually all of “we the people” raised our hand when asked during the debate who opposed the measure. Indeed, as noted in theNews-Herald,the only attendees in favor of the petition was the gentleman making it and his team.So what should the City Council do? The power they wield is ours, we cede it to their office, not to them personally, in order to use it on our behalf. In this matter, “we the people” have told them we want to make this decision ourselves and are telling them what we consider to be on our behalf.Council members may think we are wrong, and maybe by some criteria we are. But that is their personal opinion. By other criteria we are right.Almost all the time we have to compromise with our fellow citizens to get there. And in those cases, City Council is tasked to be the umpire. But not this time in this matter. At a public meeting to debate the issue “we the people” spoke with one voice. We gave our representatives direct and unequivocal direction. So to me the real question council has to decide is not whether to approve a zoning change, but rather whether they are representatives of the people or their rulers.S.

minnpost_2022_9,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesotans know that our country was founded on a free and fair public education for all and it is fundamental to a just and democratic society.Unfortunately, many of our schools today are not meeting this vision for what we as Minnesotans want for our children. Why? Republicans will say that the public school system is failing and vouchers are the answer. I say that this does not align with Minnesotans’ values. We believe all students deserve a free and fair education. The real solution is a shift back to funding education the way it was before 2003.As a public school teacher with a career that began in 1999, I have seen over the last two decades the devastation this has caused many school districts. I witnessed a shift from education support professionals being able to work one-on-one with our kids with the highest need to trying to assist up to 15 high needs students at a time. I have seen counselors with over 850 students assigned to them. I have seen classrooms packed with over 40 students. This is a crisis mode of operation, and sadly, it has become the norm.In Minnesota, we value raising responsible and knowledgeable citizens that not only have twenty first century skills in technology, medicine, and science, but also have a deep understanding of our history, how our government works, and appreciation of the arts. We value education as a basic human right, and we know our kids need schools where they can unleash their creativity and practice the problem-solving and collaboration to be ready for the future.Wecanachieve our vision for our schools. By fully funding schools at the State Capitol, every student in Minnesota can get the education that they rightfully deserve.Kari Rehrauer is an educator and a member of the Coon Rapids City Council. She is candidate for the Minnesota Senate in District 35.Editor’s note:While the statement that charter schools “do not take all students” is correct, Minnesota law also states that a charter school cannot “limit admission to pupils on the basis of intellectual ability, measures of achievement or aptitude, or athletic ability,” or “establish any criteria or requirements for admission” inconsistent with the law.According to the Minnesota Department of Education, charter schools are also required to comply with the Minnesota Human Rights Act, which prohibits educational institutions from discriminating against students based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, sexual orientation or disability."

Everyone has the opportunity to share the lessons they have learned with others. Whether it’s offering advice to someone going through something similar to what you have experienced or sharing with children in your circle of influence, helping others learn what you know shouldn’t be restricted to those who appear in the paper.We can all encourage others who may be going through a difficult time by listening to them, sharing our stories, telling them what helped or hurt us, and what we learned along the way.At the very least, we should use our experiences to help those younger than us learn from what we have gone through. A quick story about what we have learned may help others who are entering an experience similar to ours.You may not wish to share as many details as I have or put it out in a public forum, but it is important to share with those around you.

philinquirer_2022_1,"As Black students in law school, we’re concerned that SCOTUS could dismantle affirmative action at a time when students of color remain at significant disadvantage.As Black students in law school — a field that remainsone of the least diverse in the country— the role of race in higher-education admissions is never far from our minds. This reality is why we are particularly concerned about the latest Supreme Court term.In the next few months, the court is set to take another wrecking ball to its legal precedent. This time, the court is poised to undermine its rulings that have helped level the playing field for Black students and other students of color.On Oct. 31, the court will hear arguments for two cases that challenge the constitutionality of using affirmative action in the admissions process at colleges and universities. The cases,Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard CollegeandStudents for Fair Admissions Inc. v. University of North Carolina,could fundamentally reshape the landscape of higher education and limit social mobility for students from marginalized communities.They could also unravel years of legal precedent.» READ MORE:Supreme Court affirmative action case pretends we haven’t already wrecked Black college access | Will BunchIn 2003, the court determined that the U.S. Constitution allows affirmative action in college admissions, permitting schools to consider race while assessing students’ applications. The court, however, observed that schools are only allowed to use race as one of many factors colleges and universities consider when evaluating a student’s application.In early 2022, the court agreed to hear the potentially paradigm-shifting challenge brought byStudents for Fair Admissions, an organization with (in our opinion a misleading name and vision. The group’s efforts, if successful, would eradicate race-conscious college admissions processes that seek to increase access to higher education for Black students and other students of color.Affirmative action is not a panacea for remedying systemic racism. But its goal is to help level the playing field for marginalized students. Despite all the nation’s efforts, Black students remain at a significant disadvantage when it comes to college admissions.Black students remain at a significant disadvantage when it comes to college admissions.Just consider Philadelphia, where Black students make up themajority of the studentsin the School District of Philadelphia. The district, however, is, according to some education advocates, underfunded relative to other school systems in the stateby more than $1.1 billion— or more than $5,500 per student. That disparity can make it harder for its students to succeed in the classroom — and, ultimately, while applying to colleges. The typical student from nearly any another Pennsylvania district — who ismost likely white— has almost certainly received a better high school education than a Philadelphia student, and thus has an advantage when applying to college.This reality is on display in school districts nationwide, and has vast ramifications for our society.Without affirmative action, generational wealth, familial ties, and legacy preferences would play an even greater role in college admissions than they already do. This would put the most selective schools out of reach of many Philadelphia residents of color who areliving below the poverty line, lack resources, and are unable to access the kind of networks and connections that can give them a leg up in admissions. The Supreme Court’s prohibiting race-conscious admissions would, in effect, hinder the success of students from school districts that are severely underfunded and have yet to adequately reckon with thelasting consequences of racial and economic school segregation.It goes without saying that affirmative action also affects graduate and professional degree programs, including law schools, and we don’t want to see our classrooms become less inclusive than they already are.If the Supreme Court declared affirmative action unconstitutional, it would tear at the very foundation of our society. Such a decision would make it more difficult for Black students and other students of color to enter their preferred professions. And the white students who will likely continue to occupy disproportionate space in those fields could have an even harder time understanding the lives of people who do not look like them — arguably, a requisite qualification for good leaders in any field.With the Supreme Court dominated by an ultraconservative supermajority that includes Justice Clarence Thomas — a notedopponent of race-conscious admission policies— the future of affirmative action, and our society, is dire.The crusade to end affirmative action is both misguided and dangerous. If the Supreme Court is truly guided by the principles of justice and equity, it will uphold the legitimacy of affirmative action. Anything else would be a travesty.Devontae Torriente and Ty Parks are students at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and the advocacy cochairs for the Penn Black Law Students Association."
leoweekly_2022_28,"After the volatile arguments about restrictions and mandates that dominated the pandemic, Kentucky Republicans were always going to make the 2023 gubernatorial race one big messy and emotional tirade against Gov. Andy Beshear.But, when state Rep. Savannah Maddox from Dry Ridge officially entered the race on Monday, it became pretty clear a dominant Republican strategy is going to be straight-up crashing and burning every issue directly into fearmongering, buzzwords and opportunistic, divisive culture wars.“We remember Beshear’s lockdowns and mandates,” Maddox says in her first campaign ad. “We wonder how this could have happened in America. It’s not leadership, it’s tyranny.”The ad accuses the governor of damaging the economy, keeping kids away from classrooms and infringing “on the right to practice our Christian faith.”There’s no mention of the deadly virus that led to the shutdowns. Not one. Because, for her purpose, there’s no sense in making people remember reason — it’s just more effective to capitalize on fear, because that’s the playbook.Maddox, who sits at the far-right wing of state Republicans, groups herself into the “liberty” movement, one of the newest sprouts of the Tea Party tree that recently caused a few upsets of longterm Republican incumbents during the primary election in May in Northern Kentucky.The “liberty” sect of the Republicans came into the limelight during the COVID shutdown, the same time when Maddox was at her most controversial. In May of 2020, Kentucky Democrats called on Republican leaders to censure Maddox after she riled up a crowd — which included 3 Percenters — who were angry with the governor in front of the Capitol. Democrats argued that Maddox’s actions intensified the actions of the protesters, who, on a later day, hung an effigy of Beshear from a tree. She also caught some heat after posing with a man who flashed a white supremacist hand gesture in their photo.Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, the other high-profile candidate on the early Republican ticket for governor, is set to bring the same sort of battle to Beshear, although in a more subtle way. In 2020, Cameron sued Beshear over COVID-19 measures and whether or not the governor overstepped his executive authority.“Andy Beshear is not uniting Kentucky,” Cameron said in his first campaign ad. “This governor does not reflect our values.”Cameron, a Mitch McConnell protege, comes from the school of being careful with your words and aggressive with your power plays.It’s an interesting juxtaposition, Cameron and Maddox, because it seems like the GOP is hedging its bets. The plan is to clearly paint Beshear as a power-hungry extremist, but they’re going to beta test in the primary who they want their artist to be, an unpredictable mad-dog candidate in Maddox that can inflame and distort, or a more smooth and manipulative candidate in Cameron, who has more poise and charm.Either way, the attacks are incoming, but their information war is going to be uphill.According to a Morning Consult poll in April, Beshear is the most popular Democratic governor in America, with 59% of registered voters in Kentucky approve of Beshear’s job performance while 36% disapprove.Plus, it’s hard to think back on the early stages of the pandemic or the aftermath of the tornado damage in Western Kentucky, and not recall Beshear’s sincerity and dedication. On the economic front, there’s the historic battery park investments and wildly low unemployment rate. And anyone calling a Beshear a “radical liberal” doesn’t have their finger on the pulse of the political spectrum.At this point, they’re just seeing what faulty narratives can stick.. ( ."

Additionally, most served a one-year tour in Vietnam during the period of that conflict, 1955 to 1973.The country was highly divided in its support of the war, which was promoted by several presidents and Congresses. In fact, the opposition to our involvement in Vietnam was at times violently demonstrated in major cities throughout the U.S. during the period 1968-1972.Frustration with U.S. political leadership by that opposition was transferred to disdain and disrespect for the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Coast Guard personnel who served in that theater. Returning servicemen and servicewomen were shouted at, insulted and physically assaulted upon their return to the U.S. This occurred even in a military heavy area such as Hampton Roads, for example at the Norfolk airport and other locations.These men and women were not responsible for the political decisions made that led to U.S. involvement, but they often shouldered much of the blame in the minds of those opposed to that involvement.A movement to change the narrative and publicly recognize the arduous service of those who served in Vietnam per se, and in any military unit during this period, began in the late 1990s. This movement culminated in official recognition of all Vietnam-era veterans and a show of public appreciation for their service; President Barack Obama proclaimed March 29, 2012, as Vietnam Veterans Day, a time to conduct programs, ceremonies and activities to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of the Vietnam War.A congressional act was signed by President Donald Trump on March 28, 2017. The Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017 act officially recognizes March 29 as National Vietnam War Veterans Day and designates it as a day on which the US flag should be displayed.Smithfield, through its American Legion post and VFW chapter, has recognized local men and women who served during the Vietnam-era with events at the Legion post in 2018 and a regionwide lunch and program for over 100 veterans in 2019 at the Smithfield Center. Due to COVID, there were no public events in 2020 and 2021.This year the Legion post is hosting a dinner on Saturday, March 26, at the post, and the Isle of Wight County Museum will host a program at 12:30 p.m. on March 29.Local Vietnam-era Veterans are invited to sign up for the dinner by calling the American Legion at 757-357-9239 and leaving your name, number in your party and call-back phone number.

leoweekly_2022_7,"Down the home stretch of this election cycle, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul is likely going to continue to rely on his campaign’s robotic, effective and glacial plan: use his large monetary lead to continue to carefully market, brand and sometimes scare the populace across the state of Kentucky. It will be the opposite of grassroots. It will be mostly boring and controlled. There will be no big splashes. No new ideas. There will most likely be subtly-sinister, slyly-worded, somewhat-nonsensical commercials that play on basic human fears. He’ll give a few advantageous soundbites to cameras, attacking from a distance.It will be a safe and calculated campaign.And there will almost certainly be no debate between him and his opponent, Democratic candidate Charles Booker.According to the Lexington Herald Leader, KET — the state’s PBS affiliate — offered both candidates the opportunity for a forum appearance on Oct. 3. Booker’s team told LEO that they accepted, but also said they were informed that Paul has declined to appear.On Sept. 24, Booker wrote on Twitter: “Yesterday, we learned that Rand Paul declined a debate with me. He doesn’t want to face the people of Kentucky, and he is terrified to face me. Pitiful.”Two days before, WNKY 40 out of Bowling Green asked Paul about the possibility of a debate with Booker, during which he took a quick shot at his opponent before being much more ambiguous about the idea of sharing a stage with him.“It’s alarming his advocacy for defunding the police,” Paul told WNKY. “I think defunding the police would be a terrible idea and very dangerous to our community. We’re still thinking about the debate and haven’t made up our mind.”For most of the summer, Booker has been calling for a debate, and Paul has been seemingly dodging it.While there is still time for it to happen — Election Day is Nov. 8 — I would be pretty surprised to see the two politicians share a stage at this point.Hopefully I’m wrong.Either way, I’ve got a quick pitch to stop making debate season a convoluted mess where we keep wondering if these exchanges are going to happen until it’s too late: National and state-wide candidates leading in the polls should be required to step onstage in a forum with their opponents at least one time during the general election cycle.If they refuse, a heavy fine should follow. The candidates who decline would not only get hit in the pocketbook, they would also attract some negative press, and it would be completely clear who decided against transparency on current issues.It’s not perfect — the majority of voters probably don’t care — but if we make it harder for the deep-pocketed candidates to avoid an exchange of ideas of how to make our state or nation better, then the people win.We deserve better from our politicians.Using buzzwords and scattered attacks isn’t enough.We need longform answers to important questions. •.

After all, every vote, whether in Virginia or Vermont, is cast in a local precinct and tabulated by local people. A conspiracy to alter the outcome of a statewide or national race would require so many participants as to be impossible to pull off, in our view.Local elections officials here and elsewhere are democracy’s unsung heroes and worthy of commendation rather than scorn. We were reminded this week when the Suffolk Electoral Board booted from the ballot a City Council candidate whose qualifying petition clearly benefited from bogus signatures.Reversing a vote less than a week earlier, the Electoral Board decided unanimously during a special meeting Monday to remove Art Bredemeyer from the Suffolk Borough ballot. It absolutely was the right decision, even though it means that voters in that area won’t have a choice on this fall’s ballot.As our Jimmy LaRoue has reported, Bredemeyer initially was certified as a candidate for the Suffolk Borough council election after submitting a petition with 222 signatures, well over the 125 needed.General Registrar Burdette Lawrence’s office received a report in early July that the petition contained forged signatures and turned the case over to the commonwealth’s attorney.After a 2-1 vote last week to leave Bredemeyer on the ballot, the registrar continued investigating and, by Aug. 16, had confirmed 84 invalid signatures.With such overwhelming evidence, the board reconvened Monday to reconsider. This time, board Chairman Brent Rowlands, who cast the lone vote for removal last week, was joined by Vice Chairman Edward Roettger and Secretary Issac Baker in a unanimous vote.Bredemeyer has said he was unaware of the fraudulent signatures and blamed it on a consultant for his campaign. Whether the candidate himself knew about it doesn’t matter, in our view. His petition didn’t follow the rules and would have left a permanent cloud over his City Council service had he been elected in November.Though he’ll technically still have to get at least one vote to be elected, we congratulate John Rector, a current planning commissioner, for his victory in the Suffolk Borough.We commend Lawrence for her thorough investigation and Rowlands, Roettger and Baker for acting wisely after receiving the results.

suffolknewsherald_2022_37,"Published 7:09 pm Friday, July 15, 2022ByStaff ReportsToday’s editorial is courtesy of our friend and newspaper colleague Brett Wesner, chair of the National Newspaper Association. We couldn’t agree more with his sentiments, which follow.Google and Facebook have enormous economic and political power in society – especially over the news industry. Many ask if they have played a role in the misinformation that erodes our free press and plagues our democracy.Google and Facebook have a duopoly of the distribution of digital news content, which drives people to their platforms where they make money. The platforms hoard critical data and use clever tactics, like reframing stories in rich previews, to keep users on their sites – siphoning off the advertising revenue that small and local publishers need and weakening their ability to be rewarded for their own content.Google and Facebook generated $4 million in U.S. advertising revenue every15 minutesduring the first quarter of 2022. That amount could fund hundreds of local journalists in every state in the country.It’s no wonder that, despite record news consumption, local newspapers across the country have seen diminished revenues – leading many to lay off journalists or go out of business. Local newspapers simply can’t compete with these national platforms, Google and Facebook. The imbalance of power between these platforms and local newspapers – let alone any single local paper – is so vast that newspapers cannot negotiate the exploitation of news. But antitrust laws shield Google and Facebook from the possibility of news publishers working together to demand better terms.No company should have this much control over the news. Congress must take action to curb undue influence of Big Tech on the news media industry – and the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA aims to do just that.The JCPA is specifically designed to address Google’s and Facebook’s anticompetitive practices. The proposed legislation would provide a temporary, limited antitrust safe harbor for small and local news publishers to collectively negotiate with Facebook and Google for fair compensation for the use of their content. The policy also incentivizes and rewards publishers who invest in their journalists and newsroom personnel, awarding outlets with demonstrated investments in their staff a larger portion of the funds that result from the negotiations.By addressing Google’s and Facebook’s monopoly power and ensuring more subscription and advertising dollars flow back to publishers, the JCPA not only protects and promotes quality news, but also encourages competition.In today’s partisan political climate, it is rare for Democrats and Republicans to agree on anything, but the JCPA is one important exception. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle agree: We need to pass the JCPA to ensure that publishers – especially small and local publishers – are treated fairly and can serve their communities.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_138,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Businesses have been grateful for bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress and Minnesota state government for programs such as COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL , the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP and the Minnesota Main Street Grant program, and industry specific programs like Save Our Stages and the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. These have been vital to keeping businesses open, and the Minneapolis Regional Chamber strongly advocated for their value and need.For many small businesses in our region, those funds provided them with the breathing room necessary to keep their doors open and keep their employees working during difficult circumstances over the past two years.While many industries and sectors had access to one or more programs with dollars specific to meet their needs, the nonprofit sector has had no designated relief dollars for recovery. At the same time, thedata from the Minnesota Council of Nonprofitsshow that 44% of nonprofits are still seeing an increase in demand for services, and 47% of nonprofits said they could only operate for 12 months or less before exhibiting financial distress. This is not sustainable.Over the past two years many nonprofits faced exploding demand, a decimated volunteer force, and had to made quick (and often expensive operational and safety changes during the pandemic. It’s time to recognize the extraordinarily vital role these partners have played above and beyond the state funds nonprofits receive to provide current services.To continue delivering the support our communities need and to accelerate a more equitable recovery, Minnesota must invest in our nonprofits. That’s why the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, with key partners, has proposed the creation of a Nonprofit Relief Fund, leveraging $200 million in federal relief dollars for nonprofits statewide.Nonprofits serve as economic multipliers by providing services, like after-school programs, elder care, and job training, which allow others to find employment and work outside the home. Nonprofits also stimulate economic activity – museums, cultural centers and similar nonprofits attract visitors who spend money at other nearby business.With nonprofits employing 14% of Minnesota’s workforce and providing critical services like homeless shelters, food shelves, mental health supports and more, it is clear our region benefits from their great work. Utilizing a portion of the federal funds that have come to Minnesota to support our nonprofit partners is a smart investment that will benefit us all.

suffolknewsherald_2022_157,"Published 8:05 pm Tuesday, November 29, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Ivy MainVirginia MercuryAfter years of wrangling, Virginia finally allows certain customers of Dominion Energy Virginia to buy solar energy from independent providers of shared solar, also known as community solar.Don’t applaud yet, though. Dominion has used the rulemaking process and its control over project interconnection to create hurdles for shared solar that lawmakers never anticipated. High minimum bills, prolonged interconnection study requirements and expensive equipment demands are stalling projects and could drive away all but the most tenacious developers.The blow that received the most attention came during the rulemaking process. The State Corporation Commission decided Dominion could impose a minimum bill averaging $55 per month on most customers. The minimum bill is added to the cost of the electricity itself, making shared solar so expensive that the program simply won’t be offered to the general public.However, lawmakers had included a provision exempting low- to moderate-income (LMI participants from the minimum bill requirement. In effect, then, the SCC’s order turned the shared solar program into a program just for LMI residents.Indeed, the first shared solar project for LMI Virginians launched on Nov. 9 in Dumfries as a partnership between community solar developer Dimension Renewable Energy and low-income housing provider Community Housing Partners. Subscribers are told to expect savings of 10% on their electricity bills. The partners are signing up participants now but have not broken ground on a solar facility to serve them.Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, the author of the law creating the shared solar program, attended the launch of Dimension’s project to share in the celebration. But he still believes the program should be available to everyone. He confirmed to me he is working with the community solar industry to develop legislation addressing the minimum bill problem.Surovell says he continues to think a minimum bill is necessary; the question is what fee is “commercially feasible to community solar programs” while still capturing “a fair amount of system costs and legacy expenses” borne by Dominion in providing service to participants when the solar facility isn’t generating electricity.Interconnection woes: delays, high costs and ‘dark fiber’Even if Surovell can thread that needle, the minimum bill is only the most visible problem facing shared solar in Dominion’s territory. The solar facilities have to connect to the grid, which puts Dominion in charge of the interconnection process. Developers say they are encountering long delays, high costs and unreasonable equipment requirements.Earlier this year, the State Corporation Commission opened a docket to solicit feedback on the interconnection process — and the result was an outpouring of complaints.As described in comments from the solar industry, Dominion requires cost-prohibitive “dark fiber” for grid protection in place of a much less expensive industry-standard approach. Dominion also lags in conducting the studies that every new project proposal must undergo at the developer’s cost, resulting in timelines that stretch 16 months or more. Additional facilities that would use the same substation aren’t considered until the study process for the first one is complete, creating further delays.Developers also aren’t told until the final stage how much Dominion expects to charge them to interconnect their array — and even then, Dominion adds a disclaimer that its estimate is not binding. That uncertainty, says the industry, makes projects hard to finance and risky for developers.These inefficiencies and unnecessary expenses drive up project costs and make distributed solar more expensive for customers, when it is possible at all. Tony Smith, president of solar developer Secure Futures, told me his company wanted to build a 1 megawatt shared solar facility to serve LMI customers in Augusta County. They secured the site and permits before learning that Dominion would require dark fiber and planned to charge them $1 million for the interconnection, an amount so high as to scuttle the project.(For context, solar industry estimates put the entire cost of developing community-scale solar at an average of $1.4 million per megawatt. Smith says larger projects may be able to absorb exorbitant interconnection fees, but smaller projects cannot. In any case, high interconnection costs inevitably mean higher costs for customers.Industry comments note areas where Dominion has tried to resolve issues, in particular to speed up the study timelines. But regarding other requirements, particularly those that impose the highest costs, the utility shows little willingness to budge. In some instances, the company even seems to be using its interconnection power to make private developers shoulder its own grid upgrade costs. It’s hard not to suspect that Dominion is perfectly happy making other people’s solar projects more expensive.The solar industry’s brief describes steps taken in other states to make the process fairer, faster and less expensive. But if the staff report of the Division of Public Utility Regulation is any indication, the SCC is more likely to take a slower approach involving working groups, pilot studies and a multistep process. Smith says all this will take many years, by which time shared solar developers will have given up on Virginia and taken their business to friendlier states. He’d like to see the General Assembly address the worst problems.Surovell says he has “heard about” the interconnection issues but “ha(s n’t focused on it yet.” Charlie Coggeshall, mid-Atlantic director of the Coalition for Community Solar Access, told me that “interconnection is a hurdle for shared solar in Virginia and absolutely in need of improvements,” but said his organization is focused on the SCC process and for now has no plans to pursue a legislative fix.Dominion serves about two-thirds of Virginia customers, so solving the minimum bill and interconnection problems would open shared solar to a broad swath of residents across the state. That still leaves out the other third. Advocates hope to expand the availability of shared solar into Appalachian Power territory and that of Virginia’s electric cooperatives.A few co-ops launched their own community solar programs pre-pandemic, but most don’t offer one and apparently don’t want to. As for Appalachian Power, it has consistently opposed community solar, saying it can’t afford to lose customers. (On the other hand, Appalachian Power does not require installation of dark fiber as a condition of interconnection, in that respect making it friendlier to distributed generation — just not shared solar projects. Multifamily shared solar scores a win, regardless of income levelWhile shared solar faces an uphill battle, some good news came in a second case implementing a related program, this one authorized by 2020’s Solar Freedom legislation and designed for onsite solar at apartment buildings and condominiums. The multifamily shared solar (MFSS program makes it possible for a landlord or condo association to install a solar facility to serve just its own residents. This program occupies a middle ground between community solar and net metering, and the enabling legislation allows Dominion to impose an administrative fee but not a minimum bill or any other charges.Early on, the SCC had indicated a willingness to allow Dominion to shoehorn the components of the shared solar law’s minimum bill into the MFSS administrative fee. That would have certainly been the end of the program right there. In its final order, however, a common-sense definition of “administrative fee” prevailed, and the SCC ruled that Dominion could not stuff its costs of doing business into the fee.The SCC still set the MFSS administrative fee at a curiously high $13.40 per month, accepting Dominion’s argument that it would have to do all this billing manually. The SCC also decided customers should pay certain “non-bypassable charges” amounting to an average of about $3 per month. The law doesn’t authorize these charges, but the SCC reasoned that it doesn’t prohibit them, either.Even with Dominion taking $16 or so, the economics would not seem prohibitive. Developers caution, however, that the limited subscriber base for any MFSS project makes this program difficult to work with, even if the building is large and the property can accommodate a fair-sized solar facility. And even onsite solar arrays aren’t necessarily immune to interconnection woes.Still, there is plenty of customer interest in the multifamily program, especially from condominium associations that may be able to finance the projects themselves.

suffolknewsherald_2022_4,"Published 5:56 pm Tuesday, August 16, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:For the past month, a single topic has dominated conversation in and around the sleepy town of Suffolk. Proposed rezoning plans, that would see large swathes of farmland around U.S. 58 near downtown Suffolk converted to warehouses, have been met with protest from Suffolk residents.Proponents of the rezoning scheme argue that the new warehouses will provide jobs for local residents as well as a source of tax revenue for the city. All of that is well and good, and I will leave it to persons with the relevant experience (that I myself lack to contest those details. However, even if the rezoning is inevitable, at the very least I think it proper for the opponents of the plan to have their word.I am not here to argue over economics or logistics. My concerns — as well as the concerns of most other citizens I’ve had the opportunity to discuss the plans with — are existential in nature. The city council must realize that other opportunities for economic growth and jobs will arise in the future. If the proposed rezoning goes through, the scenic countryside and idyllic farmland from Murphy’s Mill to U.S. 58 will be consigned to history — with absolutely no possibility of their recovery.As somebody who has spent all 20 of my years in Suffolk, I am forced to ask what this rezoning will do to our city and our home.Suffolk is first a community. Rarely have I encountered such an atmosphere elsewhere — a small, lazy country town where everybody seems to know everybody. But a community is not just a collection of people, rather, a community is bound together by something that those people share in common.In the case of Suffolk, our community is bound together by the land we live on, and our parents lived on, and our grandparents lived on. My mother tells stories of running cross-country races when she was in high school behind the campus of Nansemond-Suffolk Academy, running past the waving rows of crops in the fields next to her — the same fields I ran past in my own cross-country races 30 years later, and the same fields that will be reduced to parking lots and warehouses should this rezoning be approved.To quote the great English philosopher, Edmund Burke: “Society is a partnership between the dead, the living, and the unborn.” In Suffolk, the bond that makes that partnership a reality — the thread that connects our generations — is this little patch of the earth that we inhabit. Suffolk itself is that bond.In philosophy, there’s a famous thought experiment drawn from Greek mythology called “The Ship of Theseus.” For those readers unfamiliar with the concept, the argument runs thus: Suppose you take a wooden ship, and year after year replace each plank of the ship with a new plank of wood. At what point does the ship cease to be the same ship you set out with in the beginning? I would like to finish this essay by asking the City Council to vote on Wednesday with a similar thought in mind.How much of Suffolk, Virginia can you plaster over with asphalt parking lots and industrial warehouses before it ceases to be Suffolk?Jacob J.

suffolknewsherald_2022_229,"Published 6:26 pm Tuesday, November 1, 2022ByLetters to the EditorEditor:On Sept. 28, 2022 the Suffolk Chapter of Virginia Organizing partnered with Professional Touch Barbershop in Suffolk to host a hybrid barbershop listening session via Facebook Live with the Second Congressional District incumbent Elaine Luria.The Suffolk Chapter has hosted this series virtually by interviewing community partners to make them aware of what’s transpiring in their community, state and nationally. Virginia Organizing is a non-partisan statewide grassroots organization dedicated to challenging injustice by empowering people in local communities to address issues that affect the quality of their lives. (virginia-organizing.org On this particular Saturday, we interviewed the Congresswoman and asked unscripted questions in front of barbershop patrons and a live virtual audience. Please note, the moderator extended an invitation live on air to the candidate/ challenger Jennifer A. Kiggans. The community would like to hear Jenn Kiggans’s stance on the issues as well.Rep. Luria began the discussion by describing the role of a congressional leader and how that differs from that of a mayor, house delegate, state or U.S. Senator. This was in response to the question from the moderator. It’s interesting that many people don’t know the role of elected leaders. Next, the conversation ventured into the Inflation Reduction Act and how Suffolkians would benefit. She talked about lowering prescription drugs, relying on wind, solar energy and climate change. We also discussed oil and gas prices but didn’t have enough time to fully discuss the broad depth of those areas. Meanwhile, oil prices continue to have consumers seeing fluctuating prices at the pump.Luria discussed the pending Student Loan Relief Act and how student debt is a problem for many. We had an interesting dialogue concerning the interest on student loans and I interjected my thoughts about the FAFSA and how tax returns determine the tuition parents pay for their child’s education without considering extenuating circumstances.The Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs Wade was a hot topic with both women and men in the barbershop. Community advocate Vonita Williams shared her personal testimony about her abduction and rape that caused trauma to her unborn child and to her own body. Mrs. Williams had to abort her child due to the physical abuse and trauma she suffered at the hands of her abductor/abuser. She wants women to hear her story; but more importantly people to know that if it were not for abortion laws, she would’ve delivered a severely deformed child that may have not survived to full term and she may not have survived either. She wants to do her part to make certain that Virginia does not lose its reproductive rights. No one can govern a woman’s body or what happens to her body; that must be between that woman and her physician. Mrs. Williams wanted the congresswoman to hear her story so the next time any politician in Washington, D.C. speaks about taking the rights of bodily autonomy from a woman, she will remember and use her story for women in our country.Robin WhitleyLeader for Virginia OrganizingSuffolk ChapterOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_60,"Published 5:23 pm Tuesday, June 14, 2022ByStaff Reports“When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.”That quote has been attributed, almost certainly in error, to Mark Twain over the years, but it speaks aptly to the begrudging respect earned by fathers, who get their annual day in the spotlight this weekend.If anything, fatherhood has fallen even further out of fashion in this age of society’s hyperfocus on gender identity, “personhood” and other symbols of modern enlightenment. Call us old-fashioned, but we’re still big believers in the importance of a father’s role in the nuclear family and the benefits to a child of having a dad who takes his responsibilities seriously.Dr. Glenn Mollette, one of our favorite newspaper columnists, wrote eloquently this week about the impact of fathers and the challenges of being a good one.“Fathers, like most all people, have good days and bad days,” he wrote. “They have great seasons of life and some that are more difficult. Few fathers will look back over their lives and say, ‘Every day I was a perfect dad.’ Some days were better than others.“Even in a home filled with love and patience the average dad lives a juggling life. He is pulled between work, kids’ ballgames, meeting the needs of his wife and housework. Add to this school meetings, homework, fishing, piano lessons, family events, all while trying to maintain and add to his career.“The only season of being a father that you have is this one. No future is guaranteed and yesterday is gone. You do have today. Have a loving and forgiving heart. Extend grace and a second, third or fourth chance. Try to spend time with those you love. You are probably finding out now that your grown children are too busy for you. They have lives of their own and you may not be a priority. It hurts some, but they probably are being like you used to be. Don’t lose sleep over this, but be available and reach out as you are able.“Finally, you have to be more than the human ATM machine. You can’t buy your children’s affection for the rest of your life. Every parent wants to help their children but the best thing you can do for them is work with them to help them care for themselves. You can either teach them to fish or spend the rest of your life fishing for them and this ends up being a hard life for you and cripples them.“Today is another opportunity to be a good father. This is also a good day for you to reciprocate love and affection to your dad. A father and a child working together can make a great family.”To the many dads of Suffolk who are making a difference in the lives of their children, we tip our hats this Father’s Day.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_69,"We’re back to NTI, homeschooling and early pandemic life in many ways. For a lot of parents in Jefferson County and parts of Indiana, the back and forth with the school system is putting a strain on their levels of stress and work life. The kids don’t know what the hell is going on from day to day and educators are fresh out of fucking ideas on how to deal with educating kids when consistency is nowhere to be found. There is no easy remedy, no one to really point fingers at anymore. We’re all complicit and all casualties of the COVID life.As far as educating our kids, it’s time that we stop fighting the inevitable and realize that while we are not all qualified to be educators with our kids and that some of us have so little time, we have to help both our schools and our kids.Currently, my son’s Montessori school is on break due to COVID and while I was almost ready for him to return to full-time school,this latest wave of COVID infectionshas put the brakes on that and forced me to make a choice.Luckily, I work at home much of the time but I had to find a way, with the work I do have to perform, to give my son some one-on-one instruction time. I have a bit of instructional background so I can give him that. Considering my skills gave me an idea. So I suggested to his school that, if necessary, they might use my skills to help boost the at-home educational content the kids have available. I can read a book or tell kids how to write sentences. It’s not a big deal and offering to read for 15 or 20 minutes might actually help me, too.“Good for you, Erica.” Yeah, yeah, but hear me out. This isn’t as tree-hugging or privileged an idea as it might seem. It’s just about collectivism and moving our kids along in a big ass village that is thinking about them more than the risk or inconvenience.Sure, I can offer some small help, but my thought is that lots of parents, probably more than realize it, have a skill or an ability that they could share digitally or even via a phone call for their kids, for the school and for the sake of all the parents who really don’t have the time or capacity. My idea is only a question: What can we do to make this mess work for the kids?There is still a true digital divide where many homes are not equipped to deal with fully online classrooms and schools. Insert that this might be a really good time for Gov. Beshear — and those bloviating right-wing legislators concerned aboutabortions and gerrymandering— to focus some attention and solutions on a real issue. Even if you’re a Republican, you know that these priorities seem a little off, so I’m asking for your help in redirecting your legislators.Employers, you’re just going to have to fucking deal with it and help your employees with children in school. Maybe offer an adjusted schedule or help fund internet access for employees or offer Chromebooks (the inexpensive wizard of online learning .The bottom line is that this mess is a collective one and the only solution is all hands on deck taking some part in helping as we continue to navigate the new world.If you have a smartphone or computer with a camera, record a short video of you reading a book or telling your kid about something newsworthy or historial. When you know that your time is short, offer that to them, via email or on a flash drive. If you don’t have that capacity, ask other parents if they have ideas or even lessons to help your children with a school issue.Call your school, offer to record some content, to make copies, or pack lunches for food insecure families. Many schools are already employing these tactics, so I’m in no way an innovator here, but what I want to see is a region of people who just don’t give up due to frustration.NTI might not be the answer but your help and even just five minutes of your time might be. Our kids are watching us. If you’re working at home, put your kid in your office and let them work side-by-side with you. There is always a second when you can look over to their work and lift them up with a kind word or get them through a minor tough spot.For the parents who are laughing at all of these suggestions because COVID has left you zero time or delirious, call those of us who have some time and are willing. We gotta make it through COVID and if one of us with a little time or skill can help you, reach out. It’s for the kids.. ( ."

They carried some historic news: Legal slavery had ended some two and a half years ago with President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation. And so some of the last enslaved people left in America were freed.Yet more than 150 years after slavery, black wealth still lags centuries behind white wealth.A reportby the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS found that it would take 228 years for black families to amass the amount of wealth white families already own today.In fact,the racial wealth divide is greater todaythan it was decades ago, and still widening. That divide won’t close without bold, structural reform to match the structural injustices that created it — from slavery itself to Jim Crow, redlining and mass incarceration.A more recent IPS report offered a number of promising solutions, including these ideas, to close the gap.All of these are bold ideas. But none is so bold as the news that greeted Galveston in 1865: Slavery was over.

suffolknewsherald_2022_61,"Published 5:22 pm Tuesday, June 14, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceColumnistI don’t think he was expecting to have the conversation that I was about to start, but I knew that I needed to check in with him about some things.“I want to talk a little bit about what we discussed a while ago,” I said. “I know that when we first discussed anatomy, puberty and sex that we talked about when it was OK to have sex, but now that you’re older, it’s something that I want to make sure you understand fully.”It didn’t seem that it was that long ago that we had “the talk,” but time moves quickly. He did well during those initial discussions, and I was confident that he knew the facts of life. However, he’s 13 years old now and has moved from childhood into adolescence.I made sure to cover the “when” as well as the “how” during those initial discussions, but I knew it was a lot for him to take in at that time. Now that he’s older, it was important to discuss the “when” once again.The facts of life shouldn’t be a one-time discussion. Children continue to grow after the first “talk,” and we owe it to them to be prepared to address things that they might not have thought about previously. We should keep our ears open to what they are saying for clues that they may be wondering about something. The chances are that they won’t ask us directly, so it’s up to us to watch and listen to ensure that we are continually providing the guidance they need.Just like the first conversations regarding sex and sexuality, we must move past any trepidation that we have about discussing this topic. Discussions about this topic should continue with them as they grow and mature. We cannot allow a fear about discussing the topic of sex keep us from having additional conversations as they are needed.When we continue the conversation with them, it’s important to ask them if they have any questions or if there is anything that they don’t understand. A simple question of “What questions do you have about what we just discussed?” provides them the opportunity to get clarity on something that they may not have understood or were too embarrassed to ask earlier. They might be hesitant to ask, so asking them for questions may help them feel more comfortable bringing something up.Continuing the talk also allows them to see that you’re willing to discuss these things with them, and that you care about them in this area of their life. Helping explain things about which they may be confused, clarifying your beliefs about when it is acceptable to engage in sex, and continuing the conversation helps them know that they don’t have to feel awkward about discussing sex and sexuality with you.I am glad that I continued the talk with him. I know now that he is fully aware of my beliefs about sex and sexuality and that I am always available to discuss this further with him.

leoweekly_2022_68,"What ifthe loss of our labor force in the hospitality industry is more skewed than we think it is? What if we have lost more women in the industry than men? We know that sitting at home finally getting a break from one of the most physically exhausting and mentally degrading jobs in the country will make you reevaluate your life and where you want to spend your time. But I imagine for women, that evaluation was even more intense.Women are the underdogs of most industries; we get paid less, we get fewer benefits, we don’t get allowances for choices we make or the choices our bodies make for us because we are women, i.e., menstruation-related issues, pregnancy and motherhood. Why would we want to reenter an industry wrought with misogyny, physical, sexual and verbal abuse, all to make less money with a fraction of the respect our male counterparts get? Surely this industry isn’t still sexist, you must be thinking to yourself. Isn’t it 2022? The future? Equal pay for equal work, isn’t that fair? Isn’t that what is happening? Maybe this is what you imagine is happening. Well, it just isn’t. Even though I myself am a woman, in the hospitality industry, who owns a bar and a cafe, and I have children and have plenty of opinions and stories about my own experiences, I decided I wanted to hear from other women in the industry. I created a survey of 10 questions and sent it off into the digital ether, and within 48 hours had responses that frankly left me feeling angry, flabbergasted, tearful, and also, hopeful.All of the women who took the survey have been or had been in hospitality between 10-35 years: 100% of the women have experienced sexual harassment by managers or coworkers as well as patrons; some answered casually that sexual harassment is just part of the job, whereas others had to endure stalking, had to make up fake boyfriends and even continued to take more damaging sexual and physical abuse just to keep their jobs. A resounding theme that arose from the survey (that I did not even have a specific question for was that a majority of them have been expected to do more or do better than their male counterparts. While they may be getting paid the same, the expectations of the individuals are different. One woman responded that often women will take up more responsibilities and be given pet names like “bar mom” instead of actually just getting compensated for the extra work.Almost all of the women said they have been promoted at least once (which is not surprising given my own track record of promoting almost every woman I have hired in the past four years , but the promotion either didn’t come with a pay increase, or the pay increase did not match the responsibility increase.All of the women have never been offered paid maternity leave or child care assistance; one woman said that because child care is so expensive, every time she had a child she would stay home until they were old enough for school, which left big gaps in her employment history, and thus each time made it harder for her to get a job.Here’s the biggest problem: with all of these terrible job conditions, 100% of the surveyed women have not felt comfortable openly communicating with their managers or owners (majority being male for fear of losing their jobs, losing good shifts or even being physically assaulted. No wonder it feels like the hospitality industry is still stuck in a pre-women’s rights era. How can anything change if women feel like their voices won’t be heard, or in their own words “swept under a rug,”and they just never complained because it was “part of the industry?” Male managers want people who “won’t cause waves” or “get hysterical.” A lot of these women wish there was a mediator, or HR department, but in some cases that isn’t always a good enough solution.A lot of these women have left the industry now, they’ve stopped serving or bartending or cooking to move to a field where women are respected more, not abused, and are generally viewed as better than men in those fields: namely real estate, nursing, corporate management, social media and even picking purchases at an Amazon warehouse. All of these careers offer women much more than the hospitality industry without slugging it out against their glorified male counterparts.Where does this leave us? As a bar and cafe owner flailing amongst the ruin the pandemic has brought upon us, I and many other owners and managers, need more staff. And not just anyone — we need reliable, trained, good people who are loyal and who will stick with us. And guess what: in my entire track record of running my two businesses, the people who are most loyal, most reliable, most capable of management, and best at multitasking, are women.We need to be hiring more women in positions of power in the industry and giving them exactly what they are asking for and deserve: more money, more benefits, paid sick and family leave and paid vacation time. Do you know what most women want in a hospitality work environment even more than all of those things? They want to work around other women, NOT men, because they are sick of being talked down to, mansplained. They are tired of hearing the disgusting jokes and gross giggles of line cooks and chefs. They are exhausted by customers buying them shots and drinks and getting some kind of leeway to “acceptably” make advances, both verbal and physical.Women know in their hearts they are not dispensable yet get treated as such by their male managers and owners. And if you’re a guy, and your immediate response is, “But not me!” “I’m not like that,”it’s also likely you might not be part of actively solving these problems, changing the dialogue, and changing the culture, because you are in the position of power and these issues are still rampant. Women are so exhausted of being looked over for the promotion to beverage director or hospitality director or head chef.They often like consistency and they like order, they like staying with a place they love and are loyal to, and will stay longer than they should without the pay or position they want and deserve. Most of them weren’t initially in it for the money, but if they land the right position, the golden handcuffs chain them to a hostile and toxic work environment that drags down their mental and physical health.This must not continue. This is our plea, especially to the men who own and manage: Seek out and hire women in your restaurants and bars and cafes. If they need training or teaching, teach them or train them over hiring a man whose resume will most likely be more robust. And take it a step further: seek out and hire women of color to front of house positions. Teach them and train them without mansplaining. Women are the heart of the home. I guarantee from personal experience, all of the strong women I have ever hired have become the glow of the fire that is the business. Customers gravitate to them and come back.Women develop the most loyal following of people because they come in and feel at home. Do the work. Be better. Hire better, hire harder. Don’t take the easy route.Create diversity in your workplace. Make your workplace safer and more accepting. Create a culture centered around open communication. If you make this space, then you will automatically expand your customer base to people who previously didn’t feel comfortable ordering and interacting with your all-white male staff, namely, women and women of color. One woman responded to my survey that she was looked over as beverage director even though she had been somewhere for three years because she felt she was discriminated against because she was Black. Her ask of future employers: racial equality in leadership positions. Invest in your female employees: pay for them to learn and travel and grow. It will come back to you tenfold, if not in revenue, then in peace of mind.We need to attract new people to our industry, and in my opinion we need to attract women back to it, and in order to do that, we need to make it worth it, and build a picture of a future in hospitality that appeals to the very people who have been most downtrodden by it. The top things that these women are asking for in this industry: better hourly and equal pay proportional to the amount of work and responsibility, paid maternity leave and child care support, health insurance, leadership positions and zero tolerance for bullying, sexual or physical harassment. These are things that should be basic human rights. These are things that should have been given over when we first demanded them so vocally in the 1920s. These are still things that most of these women don’t have currently, in 2022!A small handful of the women I surveyed are now the owners of their own businesses. They gave me hope. They are individually within their own workplace culture changing the standards of the hospitality industry for women.Sara Wood, owner ofGirlsgirlsgirls Burritosin Lexington, wrote, “I now provide PTO (sick or vacation to my current hospitality employees. We provide vegetarian shift meals, kids meals /elderly meals for any employee responsible for child / elderly care.” This right here, this is the future. All of the responses have made me evaluate what more I can do to create an even more supportive environment for my female employees. It will ultimately be us, the female owners and managers, who will start the clear-cut cultural shifts and environmental and monetary improvements to the hospitality industry for women. We must start this trend, and I believe, and know from experience, that it can be done even on the smallest budgets. Money can be shifted and rethought. Budgets can shrink in some departments and grow in order to help provide a better quality of life for the best assets you have in your restaurant: your employees. Food coming from the heart to connect with other human beings is what most of these women said they love about working in this industry. This starts with women, and it needs to get better, and better fast, starting with female owners and managers and the men will, eventually, follow suit. The better future of hospitality is female.Olivia Rose Griffin is the owner of The Limbo, Riot Cafe and The Mysterious Rack.. ( ."

minnpost_2022_85,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’ve dedicated three decades to law enforcement. One lesson I’ve learned during that time is that the most effective way to strengthen public safety is to stop crime before it happens.With its significant budget surplus this year, Minnesota has a unique opportunity to address some of the root causes of crime. So it’s disappointing this week to learn that lawmakers are again at an impasse.Our state can boost public safety by investing in high-quality early childhood care and learning (ECL programs. Many Minnesota children, especially those from low-income families, start school behind their peers and may never catch up.This is an urgent problem, as too many young people in Minnesota are not doing well in school. In fact, more than half (56 percent of Minnesota eighth-graders are not proficient in math, nearly two-thirds are not proficient in reading, and 16 percent of students are not graduating high school on time.ECL also matters from a public safety perspective, which is one reason why I care so much about these programs. Some studies have found direct links between quality preschool programs and crime reduction.The most recent example was a study of the Boston preschool program conducted by MIT. There, researchers found that enrollees in the program were less likely than nonenrollees to have been incarcerated in a juvenile facility during high school. This finding is consistent with other studies that have shown that high-quality preschool programs can lead to positive results for kids when it comes to incarceration and involvement with crime.High-quality ECL programs work with parents to give children a good start in life, helping to shrink or erase educational gaps and prepare children for success at higher grade levels. These programs impact young children during a unique stage of brain development that can lay the groundwork for academic and career achievement.Unfortunately, many parents struggle to find affordable, accessible and high-quality ECL programs. Over one-quarter of Minnesota youngsters can’t meet the overall school readiness benchmark at kindergarten entry, and children from low-income families are only half as likely to meet the benchmark as children from families with higher incomes.Kids who arrive in kindergarten already behind and unready to learn may never recover academically. Research indicates that these kids are more likely to underperform in third-grade reading and math, more likely to be held back in school, and less likely to graduate from high school on time. These poor academic outcomes can also increase the chances of involvement in crime.Minnesota’s Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP and preschool programs can help close these gaps and pave a path to a brighter future for our state’s kids. CCAP provides financial assistance to parents with low incomes that allows them to access high-quality child care while they are working or attending school.However, CCAP doesn’t serve all eligible children, and reimbursement rates for providers remain inadequate. Meanwhile, Minnesota’s publicly funded preschool programs currently reach just 25% of 4-year-olds and 10% of 3-year-olds, and funding for Early Learning Scholarships falls short of need.More funding would strengthen CCAP and provide more families with ECL access. As a law enforcement leader, I believe that investing some of our state’s budget surplus to improve access to high-quality ECL programs would put children — and the state — on a path toward greater safety and prosperity.For the sake of our state’s future, we can’t afford to miss out on this crucial opportunity to strengthen the next generation of Minnesotans.Steve Soyka is sheriff of Stearns County and a member ofFight Crime: Invest in Kids."

According to the Alzheimer’s Association 2022 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures report, Blacks are about twice as likely, and Hispanic/Latinos are about one and one-half times as likely, to have Alzheimer’s or other dementias.It also further emphasizes the need to ensure that Alzheimer’s and dementia research reflects the diversity of the population.

suffolknewsherald_2022_228,"Published 7:38 pm Friday, December 23, 2022ByStaff ReportsNewspapers are often accused of ignoring good news. On this special day, we’re devoting this space to the news delivered more than 2,000 years ago by an angelic choir, the news of the coming of Emmanuel, God with us. Jesus was God’s gift to the world on that first Christmas, the gift of a Creator willing to take on the flesh of His created beings in order to show them the Way to a relationship with Him. That’s good news, indeed.…Luke 1:26Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,27to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.28And coming in, he said to her, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”29But she was very perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation this was.30The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with God.31“And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus.32“He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;33and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.”34Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”35The angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.”…Luke 2:1Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of all the inhabited earth.2This was the first census taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.3And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own city.4Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,5in order to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child.6While they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.7And she gave birth to her firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.8In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.10But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy which will be for all the people;11for today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.12“This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”13And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,14“Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”15When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”16So they came in a hurry and found their way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger.17When they had seen this, they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child.18And all who heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds.19But Mary treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart.20The shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told them.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_36,"Published 7:10 pm Friday, July 15, 2022BySteve StewartA delightful performance by the Flatland Bluegrass Band at a recent installment of the Downtown Smithfield Summer Concert Series took me back to the church revivals of my childhood as Southern gospel hymns like “Just Over in the Gloryland” and “When the Roll is Called Up Yonder” had hands clapping and toes tapping.I dearly miss the old classic hymns in this modern age of praise and worship, when “choruses” whose lyrics are displayed on big screens have pushed hymnals from the backs of pews, what few of them are left with padded chairs now the seat of choice in many churches.This preacher’s kid understands fully the reason for the evolution of church music. The worship experience must stay fresh and current to attract new and younger congregants. Yet, as membership and attendance continue their steady decline, I wonder sometimes if churches have outsmarted themselves with their drums and sound machines and more “contemporary” services.Just give me a piano, a songbook and a choir that can belt in four-part harmony.***Speaking of music, the Elvis Presley biopic currently playing in theaters has the memory bank, well, all shook up for those of us of a certain age. Carrollton resident Tom Allen recalls the King’s handful of visits to the Peninsula, including a little-known, or perhaps simply forgotten, piece of spaceship (Hampton Coliseum trivia.Legend has it that Elvis believed the walk from his limo to his dressing room to be far too long, so in preparation for a return visit to Hampton, coliseum officials had a special door cut in the well fortified structure. Known affectionately going forward as the “Elvis Door,” it gave him quick access to his dressing room – and a quick getaway from crazed fans.Andy Greenwell, who managed the facility for many years, told journalists that the legend of the Elvis Door had nuggets of truth. Yes, Elvis was among the superstars who complained and would benefit, but the door wasn’t installed at his command. Surely it would have been had the command been given.***Elvis would be 87 this year and, like me, underwhelmed by today’s church music. He counted as influential the Southern gospel sounds he heard as a kid attending the First Assembly of God in East Tupelo, Mississippi. It was a lifetime love affair. Even after achieving stardom in rock ‘n’ roll, he still preferred gospel quartets as his backup singers.Another Elvis tidbit that might surprise you: His only Grammy awards were for gospel songs.“We do two shows a night for five weeks,” he once told a reporter. “A lotta times we’ll go upstairs and sing until daylight – gospel songs. We grew up with it … . It more or less puts your mind at ease. It does mine.”Steve Stewart, a former Suffolk News-Herald publisher, is publisher of The Smithfield Times.

minnpost_2022_139,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The best thing the Legislature can do with a portion of its $9 billion surplus is to fully fund special education for all schools.The annual report from the Minnesota Department of Education shows that school districts in 2020 spent $673 million from general education funds to pay for the gap, or unfunded special education mandates. If the state finally met its obligation to fund this gap, it would benefit all students and every school district in the state.For more than a decade, schools have asked the state to fully fund special education, but rarely has there been a year where the budget had a surplus. Well, if there is any year that the state has enough money to fulfill its obligation to our public school districts, it isthisyear.How would paying the special education bill help all kids? Right now, money to cover the programs is taken from a school’s general fund – the money to pay for classroom instruction. With special education fully funded, that money could stay in a school district’s classroom, resulting in smaller class sizes, more teachers and student support personnel.If the Legislature were to use a small part of the surplus and fully fund special education, Anoka-Hennepin would receive $844 per student. A regional Greater Minnesota district like St. Cloud would receive $1,045 per student. A smaller district like Milroy would receive $1,307 per student. This full funding would improve education in all classrooms across all school districts in the state and provide stability as schools plan their budgets to help students achieve.As legislators who support fully funding special education have said, “It’s time to put our money where our mandates are.”Most people realize that the federal government’s promise to pay 40 percent of special education costs results really results in 15 percent, shorting school districts across the nation. Let’s not forget the state of Minnesota also needs to fund its fair share. The state has the $673 million to close this funding gap. Now is the time the public should ask their Legislature to finally pay the full amount of its bill.It’s the right thing to do for the state, for our schools and for our children.Kirk Schneidawind is the executive director of the Minnesota School Boards Association."

suffolknewsherald_2022_290,"Published 4:51 pm Tuesday, August 23, 2022ByStaff ReportsHe was sitting with his back to the wall crying as the other kids played one of the numerous games set up for them in the gym. He wanted to catch a snake that had been spotted outside, but I didn’t allow his quest, and he took it hard. I hoped he would forget about the snake and join in a game with his fellow campers, but he refused to be consoled or join in any of the activities offered.I talked with him about the reasons that our group of campers couldn’t go looking for that snake, but the tears kept coming. I will admit that there were two times that I almost relented. Camp is supposed to be a fun week, and I didn’t like seeing any children in my care unhappy. I was tempted to change my decision. Next, he pulled on my heartstrings when he explained how much he likes snakes and that he had never seen a snake in the wild. I was tempted again to change my decision, but I knew that I had to stand firm.I had to stand firm for two reasons. First, the decision I made was one that was best for him and all the campers. The rocky crevice where the snake was supposedly seen could hide additional slithering creatures, and there was a chance they could be poisonous. I knew I couldn’t keep a close eye on all the campers to ensure they were staying away from all the areas where a snake may appear. It was an issue of safety.Secondly, I needed him to know that my no meant no. Changing a decision because he chose to cry instead of playing a game would teach him that all he had to do to get what he wanted, regardless of my initial decision, was to cry or throw a fit.It can be tempting to change your decision when children cry, have a tantrum, or throw a fit because you had to say no, but it’s important to stand your ground. Children need to know that your no means no. Children must understand that you are in charge. They may not like all your decisions, but they must learn that you are the one with the final say. Giving in to a child’s fit, tantrum or tears sets a bad precedent. It gives them control of decisions or situations that should not be theirs to make.This doesn’t mean that you can never change your mind. It’s okay to change course if you realize that your decision wasn’t the right one or if something has changed. It’s okay to say, “I’ve thought about it, and I’ve changed my mind,” but the reason we change our mind shouldn’t be because they threw a fit.Standing your ground doesn’t mean that you have to be mean. You can say no, explain the reason, and refuse to relent while being kind and loving.I hope that young man gets to see a snake in the wild one day, but it wasn’t safe to do so on that day, so I had to stand my ground and keep my no as no.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_20,"Published 5:36 pm Tuesday, August 2, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:I have recently read a couple of editorials by you in the Suffolk News-Herald dealing with the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA . I wish to briefly mention two issues regarding gaining support from the public to actively support your legislative efforts.One: As I see it, getting citizens to write to their congressperson will be hindered by the negative image too many have of the journalism establishment. Many people have abandoned being news customers because of “political correctness” in how important social issues are covered, particularly those having to do with the failures of governments’ “wars on poverty and inequality” efforts.Some legal progress has been made with inequality, but most of the poverty efforts have resulted in the violent crime that has developed during the last 50 years. This type of crime, which continues to worsen, did not exist in our society before Lyndon Johnson initiated his socialistic programs. There are direct relationships between where the most welfare money is spent and where the greatest rates of violent crime exist. It is impossible to get the mainstream media to directly address these issues.Two: Some concepts regarding the journalism business establishment seem to be missing. Why do news publishers have to negotiate with news distributors such as Facebook and Google? For example, in the music industry a recording is produced. A radio or television music distributor plays a recording on the air or includes one in a movie. So far as I know no negotiation is involved; the recording company charges a set fee for each one-time use by a music distributor. If the music distributor fails to pay the set fee it can be sued under the federal copyright law. That is to say, each time I read a copyrighted article by the Suffolk News-Herald in Google News, Google News should pay Suffolk News-Herald the set fee each time a person like me reads an article. Google News gets its money for paying the fee comes from their advertising income.If Google News only values low-quality news, someone should develop a news distribution service that does. I suspect there are a lot of people who have abandoned the current mainstream news that will go to a website publishing quality journalism.I hope this is helpful.

philinquirer_2022_0,"I’ve had water thrown at me, tables tossed while I’ve been in the room; a gentleman raised his cane claiming he would strike me if I didn’t leave his room.When you think of dangerous jobs where workers can get injured, most people probably imagine construction, firefighting, or police work. You should add nursing to that list.Of course, it was dangerous to be a nurse during COVID-19, whenthousands of health-care workers fell sick — and died. But the profession poses threats besides infectious disease.The threats are from our own patients, who have become more violent toward us in recent years. During the pandemic, 44% of nursessaid they experienced physical violence, while 68% reported verbal abuse.It’s not just hard to be a nurse during a pandemic. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2018,73% of all nonfatal on-the-job injuriesand illnesses were sustained by health-care workers. Health-care workers were also five times as likely to be physically assaulted while working than all other types of workers. And the rate of workplace violence experienced by nurseshas only been increasing.I’ve had water thrown at me, tables tossed while I’ve been in the room; a gentleman raised his cane claiming he would strike me if I didn’t leave his room. Once, a patient told me he’d call his people to jump me after work. (Thankfully, that didn’t happen. But I was concerned. Still, I’ve been lucky. I know many nurses who have had much worse experiences.Once, a patient told me he’d call his people to jump me after work.Emergency department nurses are especially at risk. One 2009 study of thousands of nurses working in U.S. emergency rooms found thatone-quarter said they had experienced physical violence more than 20 times in the last three years. During the same period, one-fifth said they had been verbally abused at least 200 times. Many said they hesitated to report incidents of workplace violence, however, out of “fear of retaliation and lack of support from hospital administration.”What other profession is required toaccept being assaulted with the perpetrators facing no consequences? If a person so much as verbally abuses a bank teller, security will at the very least escort that person from the bank. Someone physically assaults an employee at Home Depot? The police will be called and the assailant may be charged. Attack an RN? Not only will that person not be charged, they can be discharged and return to that hospital. And the nurse who was assaulted may have to accept the attacker being on their floor.» READ MORE:Violence against health-care workers was rising. Then the pandemic hit, and made things worse.Many facilities throughout the country have provided de-escalation training for nurses and other health-care workers, in which they learn how to defuse the situation. While these techniques can be helpful, why does it fall onto nurses to protect themselves from aggressive, dangerous patients and family members? At my hospital, and many others,nurses wear panic buttons. What does this suggest about the frequency of assaults committed against nurses? Why are we responsible for our own safety?Prosecuting assailants — that is what violent patients and family members are — is the only way to effectively increase the workplace safety for nurses and other health-care staff. A process should be in place for immediate filing of charges against perpetrators of violence, if the RN chooses to do so.In 2020, Pennsylvaniamade violence against nurses a felonywith the passage of Act 51. While this is welcomed news, it won’t have any impact unless aggressive patients and family members are charged. (There should be exceptions, of course; patients with dementia or a traumatic brain injurycan become violent but should not be held responsible for their actions. There is progress being made in the health-care industry. For example, the University of California, Davis Medical Center recently implemented a program calledthe Behavioral Escalation Support Team, known as BEST. This team is composed of staff trained in mental health care and de-escalation tactics and can step in when a staff member calls them to intervene. But the purpose of the team is merely to calm the aggressive patient. The patient faces no consequences.Whenever the topic of prosecuting violent patients or family members arises, I typically hear two rebuttals: Patients and family members in hospitals are experiencing great stress and therefore deserve some leeway, and prosecuting patients and families could damage a hospital’s reputation and cause it to lose patients and, therefore, revenue.I reject both of those arguments.Those who engage in violence against others are criminals. Period. That violence against nurses is somehow unique is ridiculous.We deserve to feel safe at work like anyone else. And we don’t.Timothy Cragg is a nurse in West Philadelphia."
leoweekly_2022_29,"On March 27, the world witnessed a man’s trauma cup finally fill to the brim and overflow when Will Smith took the Academy Awards stage and slapped comedian Chris Rock for making a joke about Smith’s wife. The media was swift with their takes on the matter, with talking heads like Stephen A. Smith and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar condemning Smith. The social media reactions ranged from sharing “humorous” memes about the incident to calling Will Smith, of all people, a thug, and for the Oscar he’d win later in the night for Best Actor to be revoked. While many had an opinion on Smith’s outburst, Power 105.1 radio host, Charlamagne tha God, began a conversation few others were having, saying:“Listen, I love Will Smith and I love Chris Rock and I said this earlier, but I’ll say it again, I’ve gone to enough therapy to know that slap he gave Chris Rock, that joke was a very, very, very small part of the reason. I don’t know what the ‘why’ is but for Will to react like that, there is something way deeper going on inside of him that we don’t know about.”Smith’s reaction, while shocking, is not uncommon. We see scores of men in the legal system who have mishandled trauma, anxiety and stress. In many cases, this emotional malpractice can be traced back to formative lessons learned.“Young boys are given a small box to choose emotions from,” says Dr. Michael Day, the director of counseling and psychological services at Indiana University Southeast. “When society structures anger, aggression, excitement and happiness as the ‘acceptable’ emotions for men, boys grow to view emotions like fear and sadness as weak or ‘girly,’” Day continues.Henry Lucas from Louisville Health & Healing, also speaks of the box young boys are placed in. “We are put in a box at a very early age by the messages such as ‘Suck it up,’ ‘Don’t be a sissy’ and ‘Don’t be a girl,’” Lucas says. “So we grow in this box that not only contributes to how we conceptualize what it means to be a male, but also teaches that to be outside of the box is to be equal to the opposite sex.”As the man box only teaches men a limited range of feelings, it becomes easy to understand how men can mishandle emotions they don’t understand. “When you see men act out later in life be it through a violence or some other method, it’s all a way of coping with what we don’t understand and what we can’t explain about ourselves,” Lucas said.Day agrees with Shah’s statement and points to perceptions we have of the mind and body.“The mind has a reputation as something we should be in complete control of and that isn’t ‘corruptible’ like the body,” Day says. “So, if the mind has a problem, some men view that as a moral failing. As such, going to therapy is to admit that moral failing.”Participating in therapy also requires a level of vulnerability that can serve as a barrier based on how vulnerability has been taught. Day says, “If the man box teaches vulnerability as a weakness, men will avoid anything that makes them vulnerable, such as therapy which can be a helpful emotion management tool.”Lucas feels this culture change can also be accomplished by creating opportunities for men to check on each other. “There is nothing wrong with having the fellas over to play cards and using that as a distraction to segue that into having some conversation,” Henry says. Even communication as simple as a text message can open the door for healing. “It can be a simple ‘Hey, how are you?’ or a ‘I know you are going through this thing, I just wanted to say I’m thinking of you,’” Henry continues.“Part of my responsibilities as a man is ‘I got to check on my guys.’” •James J.

I could hear the frustration, sadness and distress in his voice.He had misplaced his cellphone a few days prior, and he couldn’t find it anywhere. A lost cellphone would upset most of us, but at 13 years of age, this misplaced item was of great concern. The emotions from this missing item added to his hormones and rapidly changing mind and body to create a perfect storm.We talked on the phone for a little while, and I did my best to think of all the right things to say. I shared empathy for his lost item, offered hope that it could still be found, told him that we all lose stuff at times, and discussed how he could be grateful for all he still had.None of it seemed to work, so I kept trying as we talked. I began to run out of words when I asked, “Would it help if we went out to dinner for a little bit?” He replied with a sad, “Yeah.”Soon we were at a restaurant. We talked about many things, and he enjoyed his favorite meal of chicken strips and fries. The phone was a topic of discussion, and I tried to work in a few words of wisdom, but it wasn’t the main thing we discussed.We paused when we went outside to talk more, and we stopped to enjoy the weather. Our conversation paused for a moment, and all was quiet. Then he reached out and hugged me. It was unexpected. At 13, hugs are less frequent as he is now a full-fledged teenager. I returned the hug, and he held on for a few moments. He let go, and we went back to looking at the scenery around us. He said nothing, and I said nothing. At that moment, I realized what he needed most that evening wasn’t my words.I was trying so hard to find the perfect words of wisdom and encouragement. I think my words were good, but that wasn’t what he needed most at the moment. What he needed was my presence. Our time together and one hug seemed to do more than all the words I had tried so diligently to ensure were perfect.I am not downplaying the importance of words, and I am not suggesting that we shouldn’t try our best to offer wisdom, encouragement and guidance. Words are important. Sometimes, however, what kids need most isn’t our words. It is us. It’s being there. It’s a hug. It’s our presence.He would eventually find his phone, but I think what I found was more important. I found out that it’s OK if I don’t always have the words to make everything better.We should always try our hardest to share our best guidance with our kids, but sometimes what they need most isn’t our words.

leoweekly_2022_6,"You didn’t take the bar exam. That’s probably because you didn’t go to law school. Good for you. Law school is hard. Your first year is an elaborate hazing ritual in which we law professors pull out your brain and put it back in upside down. We make you read hundreds of pages every week while looking for summer jobs and shoring up extracurriculars for your résumé. Most classes base your grade on one all-or-nothing exam at the end of the semester. By the end of the third year, you are a different person: You have learned a new language, new ways to shake hands, new ways to dress, new methods of killing and being killed.But you did all that, and you didn’t crack. You made it through high school with good enough grades in your classes and on the SAT to get into college. You made it through college with good enough grades in your classes and on the LSAT to get into law school. You made it through law school with good enough grades on exam after exam to graduate. And you paid for it all.All that was even harder to do if you had to work a full-time job between classes during the day, put your kids to bed, and then spend all night parsing 2,000-word paragraphs written by Englishmen in the 19th century. Or if you were a first generation college graduate, stuck with the additional homework of learning the culture and habits of the professional class.Now you must take what will be the final standardized test before beginning your lifelong campaign to accumulate capital: The bar exam. Or you would, if you had gone to law school, which you didn’t. Again, probably a good choice.Then again, maybe you didn’t have much choice in the matter. Ours is an exclusive club, after all. For much of American history, legal education was not open to women, people of color or the offspring of wage laborers. As the demographics of those seeking to practice law changed, the requirements for becoming a full-fl edged lawyer got more difficult. For decades, most students automatically became lawyers upon graduation from law school. But in 1921, three years after the first women were admitted to the American Bar Association, written bar examinations started to become the new norm. That same year, the profession began to “regulate” law schools — that is to say, to make it tougher to get in. Today only one state (Wisconsin allows graduates to practice law without taking a bar exam.American lawyers are expected to uphold tradition and precedent; that is to say, to preserve as much as we can of a judicial system founded on white supremacy and naked class warfare, even as social and cultural changes gradually render that system obsolete. As such, the vetting process to ensure that we will be guardians of the system as it is (and as it was is a vigorous one. There are a lot of genuinely good-hearted lawyers out there, but one might say the entire legal system itself is geared toward protecting the interests of the wealthy, to the extent that it has a natural disdain for those who set out to do anything to the contrary. Gatekeepers charged with making sure that lawyers end up faithful dogs for the right masters are thus ever present, following closely behind earnest students from the first day of their formal education right up till the last day of law school. There’s an academic timeline that every idealistic law graduate knows well:In your first year of law school, you want to help people.By your second year, you want to help people, as long as you can make some money doing it.By your third year, you just want to get the hell out and make a living, already.The few clear-eyed “radicals” who manage to make it into law school have had their vision so obfuscated by the time they graduate that they often end up using their licenses at big fi rms, helping corporations do all the despicable things they swore they’d never be a part of. In fact, it is a blessed miracle when they do anything other than that; less than two percent of America’s 1.3 million lawyers work on legal problems of the poor.The bar exam is the final boss, the ultimate flaming hoop, the last chance to stop altruists in their tracks. If you don’t have an extra $2,000 to pay for a prep course, or if you don’t have several hours a day to study for a couple of months, or if you are just not that great at regurgitating obscure factoids that you will never have to use again, you are more likely to fail.Around this time of year, recent graduates begin posting about whether they passed the bar exam. Over the years, I have noticed an unmistakable overlap in the Venn diagram of 1 those who fail and 2 those who really want to change the system by challenging power, those who remained radical for three long years of brutal reprogramming and financial hardship, those who remember why they came to law school in the first place.I don’t have any statistical proof that do-gooders do worse. But what I can say for sure is: Students who are the most capable of taking on the whole damn world fail this thing sometimes. Every one of these beautiful souls who does not end up practicing law represents a serious loss. Not just for that person, but for the whole community.And that brings me to the subject of this column: Why should you, who never took the bar exam, care about who fails it? You should care if you are poor, because there will be no one to represent you. You should care if you are watching the courts, because you only get empathetic judges from empathetic lawyers. And you should care if you are interested in your society at all, because — like it or not — lawyers tend to make the rules. Who would you rather have in positions of power? People who are good at taking tests? Or people who are good?Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor.

The sign reads: “One of America’s 100 Best Small Cities to Live — CNN Money Magazine 2010 — Suffolk, Virginia.”How did Suffolk qualify for this distinction? What were the criteria for selection?Twelve years have gone by from the date on the sign. Suffolk has grown economically, industrially and inpopulation. Does the Small City characterization still apply? Should the sign be removed? Are there new criteria to be applied?The answer may be found in the statement at the heading of the City of Suffolk Comprehensive Plan 2035: A Vision for the Future.This statement asserts that “Suffolk is a nationally renowned, vibrant community committed to the health and vitality of its citizens, which offers strategic growth and diverse opportunities while preserving local character.”A few years ago the state of Virginia offered a specialized license plate that recognized the farming/agricultural heritage of Virginia. The year 2014 celebrated 400 years of Virginia farming. While agriculture contributes strongly to the Virginia and Suffolk economies, growth has moved into other sectors, including warehousing.Consider the proposed Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460 and Pitchkettle Road rezoning to heavy industrial to allow warehouses. I suggest a drive on U.S. 460 toward Windsor, turn around at the Isle of Wight line anddrive back toward Suffolk. At the Suffolk City line look for the small city sign. Along the way, take in the landscape, the businesses and other activities, noting especially the section between Kings Fork Road and U.S. 58.Then try to picture in your mind what this section might look like in the future with the area filled in with fortress-like, colorless concrete warehouse walls.

minnpost_2022_8,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .If you’ve been slammed lately by higher prices on everything from groceries to rental cars and gas prices, you’re probably wondering what on earth is behind these skyrocketing costs.Corporations are quick to blame this new reality on the pandemic, but another major culprit is hiding in plain sight: Their own profiteering.Four times a year, corporations are required by law to update their investors on how they’re doing in terms of sales and profits. These are called “earnings reports,” and the companies will usually hold calls with the investors to walk them through the latest report.My organization,Groundwork Collaborative, recently got our hands on the transcripts from hundreds of these earnings calls. And you won’t believe what CEOs are boasting about.Knowing that the current inflation frenzy is a convenient scapegoat, these companies are charging customers even more to pad their profit margins. They are just admitting it — they’re openly bragging to investors about how well it’s working.“I think we’ve done a great job with our pricing,” boasted the CFO of Hormel, a maker of popular grocery brands. “I think it’s been very effective.” As prices went up, the companyimprovedits operating income by 19 percent in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021.And now, the conflict in Ukraine is providing yet anotheropportunityfor oil and gas companies to pad their bottom lines. “It’s tragic what’s going on in Eastern Europe,” said one oil executive in late February. “But if anything, these high prices, the volatility, drive even more energy security and long-term contracting.”This pandemic profiteering is taking a massive toll on consumers, workers, and small businesses.Low-income Americans arepinching penniesto feed their families and pay their bills. And while mega-companies can use their market power to raise prices and generate record profits,small businesses and independent retailersare struggling to keep their doors open.But make no mistake: next time you experience sticker shock in the checkout line, it’s a safe bet that corporate executives and shareholders are reaping the rewards.People are catching on. Anew pollfrom Data for Progress and Groundwork finds that 63 percent of voters believe that “large corporations are taking advantage of the pandemic to raise prices unfairly on consumers and increase profits.”Policy makers are taking notice, too. The New York Attorney General’s office justannouncednew price gouging rules, paving the way for other states to follow suit.And days after President Biden promised action on pandemic price gouging, congressional oversight panels opened investigations into the three major ocean shipping alliances. These outfits control about 80 percent of seaborne cargo and haveseen their profits increase seven-foldfrom the previous year.Finally, a recently-introduced bill, theCOVID-19 Price Gouging Prevention Act, would help the Federal Trade Commission and State Attorneys General protect people across the country from pandemic profiteering.Without competition androbust regulationto keep them in check, big corporations have gotten away with using the pandemic to push up prices and fatten their profit margins — and if they aren’t reined in, high prices could be here to stay.Lindsay Owens, PhD, is the Executive Director of Groundwork Collaborative.

suffolknewsherald_2022_286,"Published 5:40 pm Friday, August 26, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAs another Labor Day approaches, it’s an appropriate time to note, and lament, perhaps the worst labor economy of our lifetimes.The primary problem of more jobs than workers to fill them was unthinkable even a decade ago, when economists worried more about the opposite prospect – that technology would eliminate so many jobs that even those who wanted to work wouldn’t be able to do so.Now, state officials say that Virginia employers can’t fill some 300,000 jobs.Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in a speech to several hundred business and civic leaders Thursday in Newport News, talked about the need to totally rethink Virginia’s approach to workforce development in response to two new realities: more people leaving the state than moving in, and record numbers of able adults choosing not to work.The governor said he’ll have a plan ready when the General Assembly convenes again in January.“We have got to get people to work,” Youngkin told the audience at Christopher Newport University. “That is one of the biggest challenges coming out of the pandemic.”The state’s labor force participation rate has fallen to 64%, despite the aforementioned hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs.In addition to streamlining the estimated 800 programs currently involved in workforce development, Youngkin sees apprenticeships and internships as a key part of the solution. We agree.Youngkin’s vision isn’t limited to preparing high schoolers to work with their hands. He emphasized the importance of training older adults for new careers, especially high-tech jobs for which prospective workers have the brains but not the skills.Two announcements this week are models for cooperation among state and local governments, businesses and nonprofit organizations.One is the Partnership for Petersburg community development campaign targeting the long-depressed southside city. The other is a $27 million expansion by Virginia Beach-based DroneUp for a drone operator training center housed at Richard Bland College in Dinwiddie. The program, which will include a new credential for drone operators, is expected to create 655 jobs.The current labor economy won’t be fixed overnight, but Youngkin and others are pressing the right buttons for a long-term correction.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_77,"Published 8:25 pm Friday, May 27, 2022ByStaff ReportsMemorial Day is a solemn national holiday that, like many other days of remembrance, and for reasons both seasonal and societal, has had its meaning largely subsumed.Don’t let it be.We cast an eye toward both the somber ceremonies taking place and the ongoing commitment of many of our fellow citizens. We have our share of important symbols to their sacrifices made here in Suffolk and encourage you to visit one.We heartily recommend the annual ceremony at Albert G. Horton Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery at 10 a.m. Monday. David Buchy, commander of American Legion Post 88, will serve as master of ceremonies, and the keynote speaker will be U.S. Army Command Sgt. Maj. Scott A. Beeson. Members of the Horton Wreath Society will continue their tradition of placing American flags on all graves prior to the ceremony. Even if you can’t attend the ceremony, take a ride out to the cemetery this holiday weekend, soak in one of the most beautiful scenes you’ll see in Suffolk, and take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices of those whose graves are marked.Also at 11 a.m., American Legion Norman R. Matthews Post 57 will conduct its annual Memorial Day observation of placing memorial wreaths at the war memorial markers at 11 a.m. in Cedar Hill Cemetery. Visitors are encouraged to use the entrance on Mahan Street.Whatever you do on Monday, we urge you to guard against the inertia and blissful ignorance afforded us by having our all-volunteer armed forces and a modern style of warfare that sometimes conceals the magnitude of their challenge. Don’t allow Monday to be entirely about the finishing of school years, opening of pools and shopping for bargains. Take more than a cursory pause between bites of barbecue and leaps off the diving board.Memorial Day was actually initiated as a way to honor those who died fighting the Civil War, but it was rightfully expanded to encompass all American casualties.As we increasingly stand divided, a time to honor those who gave their lives to defend our freedom and the principles of our democracy is even more meaningful.

minnpost_2022_93,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The appointment comes amid skyrocketing gas prices, just weeks after the most devastating Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report yet and just months after President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Her appointment also comes as MnDOT prepares to finalize 20-year policy and funding plans.The Minnesota Department of Transportation can deliver huge progress on climate sustainability and economic stability, and can do so quickly. But making these strides will require that Daubenberger and the Walz administration meet this moment with strong and decisive leadership.First, Daubenberger should set expectations that MnDOT will only build future-facing infrastructure — i.e., that infrastructure that Minnesota will need in a sustainable and just future 50 years from now. These expectations should be the backbone of all short- and long-term plans at the agency, including those currently being developed by MnDOT staff.This direction would be well-supported by MnDOT’s statutorily established goals, which direct the agency to “maximize the long-term benefits received for each state transportation investment,” to “reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the state’s transportation sector” and to impose “minimal impact on the environment.” And although MnDOT’s statutory goals do not mention race or class equity, the long-term health of the state — and achieving the governor’s vision of “One Minnesota” — clearly requires racial and economic justice.Second, Daubenberger should leverage federal infrastructure dollars to deliver on these long-term climate and equity goals. Using the dollars in this way would be consistent with the direction of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT , which issued guidance requesting that state DOTs invest in projects that are “accessible for all users,” are “more sustainable and resilient to a changing climate” and are “more equitable” — specifically, projects that expand transit and non-motorized modes.Federal guidance further — and relatedly — asks state DOTs to avoid “projects that expand the general purpose capacity of roads and highways.” Why avoid highway expansion? Because doubling down on car-based infrastructure will raise emissions (transportation is Minnesota’s largest source of climate pollution and elevate economic disparities (transportation was the second highest household expense for American families — higher than education or health care — even before gas prices doubled .But critical, here, is that the federal Department of Transportation’s guidance is just that — guidance. That means MnDOT has the flexibility, but not the obligation, to align with the USDOT. Therefore, the future is in Daubenberger’s hands; she has the opportunity for action and no excuse for inaction. (As a side note, Minnesota will likely receive more federal dollars if the agency aligns its funding plans with federal guidance. A future-focused and ambitious MnDOT would excite voters (yes, transportation can be exciting! . It could establish the governor as serious about climate, and could establish a firm path toward greater economic and racial justice. And it’s not just about the Democratic base: Climate- and community-focused transportation infrastructure is popular across the board. A strong majority of Minnesotans and U.S. residents support better transit, biking, walking and rolling options, according to polling and engagement by MnDOT and Transportation for America.Transportation touches everything. It determines how, when or even if we can get to our jobs. It influences where we live, whether we can get to school or activities, and which of our friends we see. It impacts our health, environment and climate. Its costs govern our ability to save or pay rent.Daubenberger’s job is not about asphalt and concrete — it’s about the future of our state. She should embrace and guide MnDOT’s potential, for the present and future of all Minnesotans.Sam Rockwell is executive director of a transportation nonprofit and lectures on land use and transportation at the University of Minnesota."

suffolknewsherald_2022_98,"Published 6:40 pm Tuesday, May 3, 2022ByStaff ReportsTwo special groups of people — moms and teachers — get their turn in the spotlight this week. They deserve it more than once a year.Mother’s Day is Sunday. Teachers Appreciation Week started Monday and continues through Friday.Regardless of your status in life, you likely owe a debt of gratitude to a mom or a teacher for whatever you’ve accomplished. For most of us, the debt is to both. Many teachers are also moms, serving faithfully both the children in their classrooms and their own children at home.No disrespect to fathers, who are important in their own right, but we’re especially appreciative of mothers and their irreplaceable role in the lives of their children.Whether a skinned knee as a child or a bruised ego as an adult, there’s no one like Mom to ease one’s pain. For those who have lost their mom, especially recently, Mother’s Day can be a sad time filled with grief and even some regret. For those whose moms are still living, make sure to honor her beyond flowers and Sunday lunch this weekend.Give her a break from household chores this week. Weed her flowerbed or trim some shrubs in the yard. Surprise her with a handwritten letter that recounts a specific memory or two of a time when she was there for you as only a mother can be. If you live away and can’t be with her in person, make the normal 15-minute phone call with her 30 this weekend and tell her why she’s important to you.She’ll appreciate it, and you’ll be better for the experience.Another group who can’t get too much of our appreciation is schoolteachers, who, regardless of our age, get credit alongside moms for their profound impact on our lives.These are especially stressful times for teachers. According to a recent poll by the National Education Association, 55% of teachers say they plan on leaving the profession sooner than they originally planned.Respect for teachers isn’t what it once was, sadly, from either children or their parents. Verbal abuse in the classroom is common, and even physical abuse is happening more frequently. Not so long ago, parents were quick to defend teachers, and even mete out some extra punishment at home when their kid misbehaved at school. Now, students get the benefit of the doubt more often than teachers.It’s no wonder that teachers are finding the profession more demanding and less rewarding.During this Teacher Appreciation Week, we hope everyone, whether a current student or one whose days in the classroom are long gone, will take a minute to honor a schoolteacher. Their work matters more than ever. They deserve our deepest gratitude.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_13,"The higher prices that stem from these tax increases on energy will ultimately decrease the amount of goods and services that consumers can afford.The so-called Inflation Reduction Act is one of the greatest examples of deceptive marketing around today. Not only will the legislation fail to reduce inflation, it willfurther increase prices.Inflation is fundamentally a problem of too much money chasing too few goods and services. It was hardly a surprise: In the last two years, the government has spent, borrowed, and printed trillions of dollars while also hamstringing production in the economy. As just one example, people were frequently paid more tostay home on government welfare than to go to work, infusing cash while reducing economic output. Even after the trillions spent on COVID-19, the federal government spent trillions more, including President Joe Biden’sAmerican Rescue Plan.The result was a vast increase in the amount of money in circulation without comparable growth in the size of the real economy. All that extra money bids up the price of goods and services, a phenomenon we call inflation.Unfortunately, this latest piece of legislation in Washington does nothing to solve the problem. It does not reduce the amount of money in circulation. Worse, it reduces the quantity of goods and services through measures likehigher energy taxes and excessive regulation.People often underestimate just how much energy affects the price of services that we receive and the goods that we buy. Before an item can be placed on a store shelf, it had to be transported there, whether on a train, a ship, a plane, a truck, or even all of these. Energy is used not just in transportation and manufacturing but also in supplying services.More than 60%of electricity in the U.S. comes from coal, oil, and natural gas. Additional taxes on those fuel sources under this new legislation will drive up electricity prices, which will trickle down into higher prices elsewhere in the economy. Yet this legislation is marketed as providing relief to consumers — a bald-faced lie.Meanwhile, natural gas is not only a widely used fuel for both energy production and home use but it is also used in the manufacturing of countless chemicals that go into making other products. Additional taxes on natural gas will make all these more expensive. Once again, the marketing around this legislation is not merely misleading, but exactly opposite its actual effects.The higher prices that stem from these tax increases on energy will ultimately decrease the goods and services that consumers can afford. As fewer goods and services are traded, the economy contracts. In June, sky-high energy prices proved a surefire way to decrease consumer purchases. Gasoline consumption in July fell tolevels below where it was two years prior— during the pandemic when there were mandatory lockdowns, causing people to drastically cut back their driving.As if the energy taxes were not bad enough, the legislation provides for 87,000 new IRS agents. We’re told they’re intended to hound tax-cheating billionaires, but this is just more deceptive marketing. There are fewer than3,000 billionairesin the country, and theyalready face high audit rates. The new army of agents will allow the IRS to perform anadditional 1.2 million audits a year, far exceeding the number of billionaires supposedly in the crosshairs. The claims about only going after those making more than $400,000 a year are also dubious because when Congress had the chance to enshrine that into the statute, it was voted down by Democrats strictly on party lines.» READ MORE:The Inflation Reduction Act won’t reduce inflationThe expansion of the IRS will target the middle class. Unlike the claims of going after tax cheats, the massively expanded IRS will prey upon people who are overwhelmed by a 10 million-word tax code. In one experiment, when 46 different tax professionals were given the same family’s tax return to file, theyproduced 46 different estimatesfor what the family either owed or was entitled to in a refund.Even if the IRS expansion is successful in raising billions of dollars from the already squeezed middle and working classes, that money does not magically disappear from the economy; the government will simply spend it. The amount of currency in circulation has not been reduced, it has merely changed hands. In other words, there is still no reduction in inflation.The more one digs into the Inflation Reduction Act, the bigger the lies become. Perhaps a single line from the 1940s filmPinocchiobest sums up the marketing of this tax-and-spend boondoggle: “A lie keeps growing and growing until it’s as plain as the nose on your face.”E.J.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_27,"For all the acrimony surrounding immigration politics, a majority of Americans have long supported two goals: giving undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children a pathway to legal status, and securing the country’s southern border. With only days remaining in the current Congress, lawmakers have an opportunity to deliver major breakthroughs on both priorities.A proposal by Sens. Thom Tillis and Kyrsten Sinema would reportedly provide a 10-year path to citizenship for some 2 million undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, who were brought to the US as children and who’ve lived in the country for much of their lives. It would also extend Title 42 — a public-health rule that allows for the expedited removal of border crossers — for at least a year. This would give officials a much-needed tool to ease pressure on the border, which saw a record 2.4 million attempted crossings in the year to October.Just as important, the proposal addresses flaws in the asylum system that cause lengthy delays and encourage migrants to take ever-bigger risks in hopes of being released into the country. It would help clear the current backlog of claims by funding more asylum officers and judges. It would also authorize new processing centers for asylum-seekers. And additional funds would go toward hiring more Border Patrol officers and raising the pay of current employees. All told, the plan would reportedly cost up to $40 billion.Though countless efforts to forge an immigration compromise have failed in the past, there’s reason to believe this time is different. That’s because lawmakers have rarely faced more urgency to act.For one thing, the absence of a legislative solution for the Dreamers has left them at the mercy of legal battles over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects some 600,000 people from deportation but could still be struck down by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a federal judge has ordered the government to halt the use of Title 42 by Dec. 21. With no viable replacement policy on the table, the crisis at the border is likely to worsen unless lawmakers finally take some responsibility for managing it.Of course, plenty of obstacles could still obstruct such a deal. Tillis and Sinema need to line up at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a potential filibuster. Nor is support for the proposal guaranteed among the lame-duck Democratic majority in the House. By design, the Sinema-Tillis framework aims to reduce strain on the asylum system by discouraging migrants from attempting to cross the border and expelling more of those who do. This has angered immigration advocates and progressives in Congress, some of whom have already announced their opposition.That’s all the more reason to move quickly. The framework produces solid wins for each party: Democrats can envision as many as 2 million unauthorized immigrants finally getting their status resolved and Republicans can expect to see a serious effort made to control the border. At the same time, neither side gets everything it wants. That’s the sign of a good compromise.— Bloomberg OpinionHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

Wadewas my safeguard. The recentleak of the first draft of Supreme Court Judge Alito’s opinion, is sure to seal the fate of a federal safety net that has protected females since 1973, when the (then Supreme Court ruled for a pregnant woman’s liberty and right to privacy. The current (political & religious turn of events will have devastating consequences to the human rights of females in America, abetrayal of the 14th Amendment.My abortion story does not containsexual violence,incest,date rape, or amedical catastrophe– the horrific scenarios where anyone with decent moral compass should be able to comprehend why abortion must remaina human right: safe and legal. I was in a steady live-in relationship with a man I loved. I had been training for months for a physical agility test – part of a series of tests to become a firefighter. My monthly cycle had been erratic from the intense training.My partner and I practiced three types of birth control conjunctively:the rhythm method,the Billings methodand condoms. Birth control choices were limited andthe pill, with its side effects, made me terribly sick. One month of breast tenderness alerted me that something was off. AnEPT kitconfirmed my greatest fear. Our birth control had failed. I was in tears. He was out of state on a work contract, my family was in Minnesota, and there I sat in Texas; feeling very much alone. We did not want this pregnancy – resolutely – neither of us.My boyfriend made arrangements on his end to get me out to him, and safely, to a women’s clinic. I called my parents, each of them offered comfort and support, solidly backing my (our decision to terminate. I told my (male boss I needed an immediate time-off, which was granted graciously, as I explained the full urgency. I also withdrew my application from the firefighting pool and told the captain, who had been my mentor and supporter, why. He hugged me and said he understood. Like my father, he was a father to daughters.Today, in Texas, the men who comforted and reassured me that everything would be OK, are the same compassionate men that could be sued today underthe current Texas abortion banfor “aiding” me in our decision to abort. Private citizens with no knowledge of circumstances or no connection to the people involved can report others, creating anabortion police state, offering a bounty of up to $10,000 for each abortion that is stopped.I arrived in California, my boyfriend at my side. The women’s clinic physician talked us through every step of thefirst trimester process. The procedure was short and done. I often feel the “abortion narrative” needs to be changed. Abortion is a safe medical procedure,the trauma lies in the pregnancy– yet our society has created shame, stigma, and a secret, that lays the burden of guilt to the female impregnated. Forced pregnancy is a violation of international human rights and canlikely lead to mental health harm. In the cases of medical catastrophe, add in the physical threat of harm or death to the living female.It’s time. Time for the men, like the ones who stood beside me, the impregnators, the fathers, the employers, the mentors to stand up and fight for the safe and legal reproductive rights of their daughters, sisters, friends, employees, lovers, cousins, wives and mothers. It’s time for progressive states likeMinnesota to stand as strong, with more governor’s like Tim Walz declaring:“There will not be a ban on abortion as long as I’m governor of Minnesota.”Minnesota must work against red state fractions to protect legal abortions services, safe havens,support teams, travel agents and transport drivers.Reproductive freedom is under fireandHulu’s; “The Handmaid’s Tale”is eerily in play by the conservative and politically-driven imbalance of the current U.S. Supreme Court.Action not reaction.

suffolknewsherald_2022_183,"Published 6:49 pm Friday, February 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsIf you are eligible to give blood, we urge you to make a blood donation appointment soon.The Red Cross is experiencing the worst blood shortage in over a decade. The dangerously low blood supply levels have forced some hospitals to defer patients from major surgery, including organ transplants, according to the American Red Cross.Why is the blood supply so low? Well, according to the Red Cross, there are several reasons. There has been a 10% decline in the overall blood donations since March 2020. That’s due to fewer blood drives at colleges and high schools, which typically bring in about 25% of donations. Ongoing blood drive cancellations are happening due to illness, staffing limitations and even weather-related closures. A surge of COVID-19 cases as well as an active flu season have compounded the bad situation.The Red Cross, which supplies 40% of the nation’s blood supply, has had to limit blood product distributions to hospitals as a result of the shortage. In fact, some hospitals may not receive 1 in 4 blood products they need, the Red Cross stated on its websiteBlood cannot be manufactured or stockpiled, and can only be made available through the kindness of volunteer donors. In recent weeks, there has been less than a one-day supply of critical blood types.Quite a few blood drives are coming up soon in Suffolk and surrounding locales. Here are just a few of them:If those dates and locations don’t work for you, you can always visit redcrossblood.org to find more opportunities and information about how you can sign up.The Red Cross also urges those willing and able to donate more often to please consider booking additional appointments further out due to the fact that while availability of drives may be impacted, the need for blood remains constant.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_245,"Published 6:21 pm Tuesday, October 11, 2022ByStaff ReportsThink back over your life for a moment. Have you ever had a neighbor you liked so much that you didn’t want to disappoint them? Stories of the troublesome neighbor are all too easy to come by. It’s tough sometimes to share a property border with someone else, especially if they don’t share your same values. Or if they don’t care about anyone other than themselves.Phil was a different sort of dude. He and his wife were our backyard neighbors in another city. The neighborhood was full of rumors that Phil stayed about half-lit all the time. Turns out, it wasn’t just rumor.I’m not going to kid you. We did encounter Phil a time or so and could tell that he was working on a good buzz. Here’s the thing though: he never caused us any trouble. Not one bit that I can recall.He was an extremely nice guy. We learned over time that he would offer to help you with anything you could need help with. We even learned that Phil was so handy, I’m pretty sure there was nothing around the house he didn’t know how to do.If they had stayed long, I would’ve done just about anything in the world for them. They were likable. But one day, he and his wife listed their house for sale. It sold quickly and some noisy college girls moved in.They partied like young girls who had a wealthy suburban Dad who bought them a house in the city and turned them loose. One particularly troublesome night, I remarked to my wife, “I sure do miss Phil and his wife. He stayed drunk, but they were great neighbors!”So, I want you to get in your mind the person you have loved as much as you do yourself. The truth about being faithful to God is that it’s all about caring for someone other than yourself. If that’s a problem for you or me, we’re really going to struggle with everything that comes next.Our scripture this week was from Exodus 20. The much revered Ten Commandments are found there. Amy Erickson in her writing notices that these beloved Ten Commandments are framed like this. God begins by saying, “I am Yahweh your god…” and ends by talking about, “…your neighbor”That is, God starts by telling us to worship, remember and to revere God. Then ends by telling us to respect and care for our neighbor. If you don’t remember anything else I say here, then please just take with you this one thing. When the driving force in my life or yours is our inner voice that screams “I want…!,” then the driving force in our lives is not God. It’s us.God said to us, “I am the Lord your God.” That’s the truth about being faithful. This will probably be engraved as the epitaph on my tombstone one day because I’ve said it a million times. “The best news is that God is God, and you’re not. Which means you don’t have to be.”We live in a world where millions of people profess a loyalty and a love for the Ten Commandments. But I’m not sure a whole lot of them have actually read them lately. I’m glad that morals or ethics are important to believers. They should be.But wielding God’s words against other people wasn’t the central intent behind the Ten Commandments. Faithfulness was. God wanted us to be faithful.Let me ask you this. In your company, your family or in your community, who stands out as being faithful? I mean, you know who is faithful and who isn’t. In a healthy relationship, the parties are faithful. They care about and give for each other. In an unhealthy relationship, they aren’t. God wanted, and still does, for us to live, love and serve in faithful ways.A truth about faithfulness just might be this. That in God’s commandments, the thing we learn the most about is God. They tell us what’s important to God. They show us the heart of God. Their goal is to help us be faithful.God knows when we are faithful, because it shows. Not that we live out our beliefs for show. It just does show when we do. Or, when we don’t. Another truth is that others know when we are faithful, too. Because like the neighbors, they are on the receiving end of whatever we do. Faithful or not.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_70,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°With Donald Trump’s announcement of his new presidential campaign comes a timely reminder of what kind of a man is asking Americans to put him in charge again: Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, now confirms that Trump, while in office, routinely sought to use and abuse the powers of government agencies against perceived enemies in clearly illegal ways.Among Trump’s demands as president, Kelly says, were that two former FBI leaders he hated should face audits by the Internal Revenue Service.And lo and behold, both did.Kelly’s comments, reported by The New York Times, bring new context to previous revelations that former FBI Director James Comey and acting Director Andrew McCabe both faced an especially intense form of personal tax audit under a Trump-appointed IRS director, after what the agency continues to maintain were random selections.That claim, which sounded statistically unlikely from the start, completely strains credulity now, in light of Kelly’s confirmation that Trump specifically pressed him to launch audits against the two.“I would say: It’s inappropriate, it’s illegal, it’s against their integrity and the IRS knows what it’s doing and it’s not a good idea,” Kelly said he told Trump.He quoted Trump as responding, “Yeah, but they’re writing bad things about me.”Does that or does that not sound like the aspiring autocrat who America got to know so well during his first term?Kelly said he never carried out Trump’s illegal orders, but that doesn’t mean someone else at the White House didn’t. Add it to the list of potential crimes by Trump that Congress or the Justice Department should be investigating.Kelly said Trump’s vendettas against Comey and McCabe were part of a broader pattern in which he routinely told underlings he wanted federal criminal investigations or IRS audits against perceived enemies.These included Hillary Clinton, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, and FBI agents involved in the agency’s probe of Trump’s Russia ties.Trump’s strained denials can be summarily dismissed, and not just because his status as a pathological liar has been so thoroughly established.His behind-the-scenes attempts to abuse his power mesh with his public statements throughout his presidency.How many times did Trump publicly call for Clinton and other critics to be arrested, or worse?Consider that, after the Nov. 8 election, Trump was claiming credit for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ rise by saying he sent in the Justice Department to meddle in the 2018 state election on behalf of his fellow Republican.The claim is apparently a lie, but how telling that even in fabricating stories to publicly brag about, Trump concocts one in which he describes himself as illegally abusing his power.It’s who he always was and still is — and will be again, in spades, if he’s allowed to return to the Oval Office.— St. Louis Post-DispatchRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track. Contractor Nan Inc. began construction on the project in Dec. 2023, following a design and planning process that started in 2017."
leoweekly_2022_52,"These columns are part of LEO s package on the 2022 mayoral election in Louisville.James Baldwinsaid it best: “I do not know you personally, but I know you historically.”When I hear your name, it reminds me that wealthy white liberal men in this city get away with being cowards. How dare you claim to fight for Black lives when your staff and volunteerstell Black women to shut up? Like when organizer Jessica Bellamy was told by Lacy Smith (a white man, husband to your campaign chairwoman to shut up when she expressed concerns of your gentrification practices.You didn’t seem that forthcoming in our initial conversation about theTIF districtat a 2021 community conversation panel that many West End residents (especially Black and housing insecure neighbors didn’t want. My takeaway was that you were totally willing to ignore the 61% of West End residents who have no protection under your policies and practices. Your tone-deaf TIF allows wealthy developers to remake the West End in their image and ignores the eviction crisis. Under a Greenberg administration, most of my family and half of my neighbors would be at risk for eviction. It was even more alarming to read through some of your history after I learned you were running for mayor:When you were CEO of the 21c Museum Hotels, Black womenwere treated poorlywhile the company profited from Black art. In your Durham location, Black women are paid substantially less than their white counterparts for the same work. There are reports of racism and sexual harassment.YourWhiskey Rowand urban revitalization does not feature Black-owned companies. Speakeasies were historically created andpopularized by Black folkswho couldn’t get into segregated clubs. The speakeasyHell or High Wateris a watered-down version of what could have been a historically significant business. Hannah Drake’s recent (UN Known project demonstrates the erasure of Black enslaved folks who walked what is now downtown as they were sold into slavery. Your initiatives ignore that history and this willful ignorance is unforgivable. (It is also the main reason I know your calls for equity are just efforts to pander to Black folks rather than support us with concrete action. According toWFPL, you said that you “would build 15,000 new affordable housing units in your first term.” You didn’t specify a target rent, though, so the claim holds no weight. While you refused to disclose your net worth to me when we met, you’ve been a multi-million-dollar developer for decades. So why haven’t you started an affordable housing development in the city already? I’d guess that your net worth is more than 10 times greater than mine, but even I as a single mom have an affordable housing unit rental. My tenant pays less than $800/month for a 4BR 2BA home. The market rate on the property is closer to $1,300. What’s your excuse? My suspicion is that affordable housing has never been a priority for you and anyone who believes in your baseless promise on this issue will be disappointed, the same way people who believed Fischer on his climate justice initiatives were disappointed.I don’t want to leave out yourcampaign chairBarbara Sexton-Smith. She was elected as District 4 council-person in 2016. In a wildly inappropriate declaration, shefamously proclaimed, “When we talk about Blackness … there is Black color, there is Black culture, and there is Black consciousness...I’m obviously not of Black color, I’m obviously not of Black culture. I am Black consciousness, yes I am.” No she’s not. She may have awkwardly done the electric slide at cookouts in the West End, but under her reign as District 4 councilwoman, slumlords in her district neglected and terrorized tenants to the tune of tens of thousands. (Try saying that ten times fast. Under her watch, the median income for Russell dropped from$20,400 in 2017to about$15,000 in 2020. By comparison, the city’s overall median income was $53,436 according to the 2019 Census. Hundreds of Beecher Terrace residents were removed from their homes when the city demolished 800 units and only guaranteed that 52 on-site units would be set aside for low-incomeBeecher Terraceresidents to return. Today, many of the displaced tenants are still unhoused. So forgive me if I am not swayed when she emulates a Southern Black Baptist preacher for the sake of our vote. Her version of Black consciousness is symbolic at best. At worst – it is the same okie doke that white Democrats have used to secure the Black vote before abandoning us.Being a Democrat and shouting hallelujah in the hood are not enough of a reason to vote for you or believe in Sexton-Smith.Graig, (not a typo , this is now part of your legacy, too.Black people, immigrants, poor people, white people, middle-income families and basically everyone who is not a developer or the police or a six-figure income influencer will lose a lot with you as the democratic nominee for mayor.Your history indicates that you would happily sacrifice the livelihood of our most vulnerable Louisvillians — renters and housing insecure residents.Segregated citieslike Louisville yield lower revenue. Under your tenure, we will remain segregated because you have never made a significant investment in critical race theory or dismantling structural inequity — in fact, you design systems that fuel discrimination. Diverse companies produce19% more revenue, but you don’t have the vision to integrate this city.Anyone in the East End who ever had a Black Lives Matter sign in their yard or window should refrain from giving you their vote. Your non-stance on police brutality and state violence is indicative of the same color blind gentrification policies that led to Breonna Taylor’s death.At any point, did you ever stop to think, “Am I the right person for this? Should I instead help elect the first woman mayor or the first Black mayor or the first Latinx mayor or the first mayor with a median income below $20,000?” You told me to my face that you “Support a Black woman being mayor,” but there is a Black woman running and you…chose to continue your campaign. You volunteered Black Market as an example of food justice initiatives you support, but you’ve never even shopped there (though to be fair, when I brought that up, you promised to shop there the following weekend . Here’s my question, though — why are you taking up space in a city where wealthy white men like yourself are already silencing Black and disadvantaged people?This is important to me because my son has had to live through Greg Fischer’s Louisville. Breonna Taylor didn’t survive Greg’s Louisville. Some housing insecure residents likely won’t survive your administration. I’m just a mother who understands how your behavior hurts our children. I wish you would do the right thing, but I can already tell that money matters more to you than justice.Marinate on these words from poetHannah Drake:“The architecture and atmosphere is constructed in such a way that I know, and we know that these are not our spaces.”Raising the most money doesn’t impress me — it’s not surprising that a millionaire has rich friends and allies. We see you following the same path as Fischer, and in this city that has worked well for white politicians. Nice, non-confrontational rich white guys get away with so much in Louisville. That stops now. We will have our first Black mayor in Louisville. We will not praise you for the bare minimum. We will win.Shauntrice Martin is an activist, community organizer, lobbyist, founder of Feed the West and founder of the Black Market, KY.Last summer,when I announced my support of Craig Greenberg to be our next mayor, I got a lot of questions. Why was I endorsing so early? Why Craig? Did I think Craig was capable of bringing the kind of change I thought the city needed?My answer to everyone who asked was pretty much the same. I told them for me this was an easy choice.I’ve known Craig for many years, and I’m happy to call him a friend. He’s honest, smart, creative and one of the most energetic people I know. He listens. I truly believe he wants what is best for everyone in our city. And, most importantly, when our city faces tough times, I trust him to do the right thing.Right now our city is facing what I believe to be a crisis of inaction. We know what many of our problems are and what’s causing them but, for too long, we’ve had some who seem content to just study problems, make promises and then fail to move forward. I think it’s past time we had someone in the mayor’s office who can change the worn out pattern of watching and waiting as our problems grow. I think Craig is the person who can get it done.What makes an individual successful at public service is a willingness to listen to every voice and concern, collaborate with those ready to do the hard work and put together a plan of action to get things done. From what I have seen so far from Craig is that he has what it takes to be a successful leader and not even for a minute have I questioned my decision to endorse him.I’ve worked with Craig as he has held dozens and dozens of public meetings in every neighborhood of Louisville listening to citizens who are worried and scared about our city’s future and for the safety of their loved ones and neighbors. Together he and I have met with community leaders, clergy, law enforcement, physician and mental health professionals and so many others who all want the same thing — a safer city, more opportunity and a good place to raise their families.From these meetings Craig has pulled together a real plan I think is not only actionable, but what our community needs. I don’t say this lightly. As a former police officer and longtime member of the Metro Council, I think I’ve got a pretty good understanding of when someone is just telling me what I want to hear. I believe in Craig’s plan to help our city thrive and, when I read it, I saw in it the concerns of hundreds of Louisville residents that he and I have met with.When Craig says he’s going to build 15,000 new affordable housing units, I believe him because I know he’s met with advocates from across the city and understands our city’s housing crisis.When Craig says he’s going to start a program to make universal pre-K a reality for every child in Louisville and give them a jumpstart on educational achievement and school readiness, I believe him because I know he’s met with educational leaders and put together a plan that finances the program.When Craig says that he will do what’s right for working families, I believe him because he has earned the trust and endorsement of eight of our city’s largest organized labor unions representing tens of thousands of working men and women.And, most importantly, when Craig says that we can help solve our violent crime crisis, I believe him because I know he is committed to and understands the effect that violence is having on too many of our streets and in too many of our homes.Louisville is in a tough spot right now, and no one person can secure our city’s future by themself. It’s going to take a leader who is ready to make it work by working together, and I believe Craig Greenberg is that leader.David James is the president of Louisville Metro Council. ( ."
minnpost_2022_154,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The most significant antimonopoly reforms offered up a couple of weeks ago by a Minnesotan did not come from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, but rather the Minnesota House.The legislation would overhaul Minnesota’s antimonopoly laws and provide new tools for reclaiming economic power from massive corporations. During the Gilded Age, the Minnesota Legislaturelead the wayin taking on the railroad and grain monopolists; now policymakers have a chance to lead the fight against Big Tech and others in our new “Gilded Age.”The effort to curb monopoly power is often viewed as one reserved for the federal government. It is true that enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, among others, have significant authority to reduce corporate concentration. However, the effectiveness of those agencies is highly dependent on who occupies the White House, and even more vigorous enforcement is not enough to overcome four decades ofbad judicial precedentthat has eroded our nation’s protections from economic concentration. We need reform and while Congress is gridlocked, our state legislators have an opportunity to play a meaningful role; and Minnesotans need them to.Families across the state are suffering under the weight of record inflation that has caused wages to fall back to theirpre-pandemic levels. Profiteering from corporate giants like3MandCargillis to blame as pricing power is estimated to account for asmuch as 70 percentof the past year’s price hikes. Consumers are not the only ones feeling the squeeze from monopoly power, Minnesota workers and small businesses are also being crushed, with Amazon offering a particularly powerful example.The Center for Rural Policy and Development, in astudy on Amazon’s impactin rural communities, found the number of retail firms in rural Minnesota has declined by nearly 23 percent since 2000. Meanwhile the fees Amazon charges many sellers on its platform have risen to 34 percent. For workers, areportfrom the National Employment Law Project and the Awood Center found the rate of injury at Amazon’s Shakopee warehouse was higher than any other industry in Minnesota and five times higher than the statewide rate for private-sector workers. Amazon has also dragged down monthly average wages for the entire warehousing sector – from $4,362 to $3,956 – since 2015.It could not be clearer how important it is for policymakers to challenge monopoly power in Minnesota. Three bills from DFL Reps. Steve Elkins and Zack Stephenson would do exactly that. Collectively the legislation would update Minnesota’s antitrust laws with key definitions, create a new abuse of dominance standard that would return our antitrust laws to their original intent, and enshrine the Robinson-Patman Act into state law, a key protection for local retailers.Currently Minnesota’s antitrust laws do not include a definition of monopoly, nor does it include any mention of monopsony, which is a buy side monopoly.HF4143would fix that and would also increase the civil and criminal penalties for violating the state’s antitrust laws. The inclusion of monopsony will help address the rise of corporate power over labor markets. The U.S. Treasury Department recently completedan extensive analysisof the impact concentration has on workers and concluded wages are at least 20 percent lower nationwide than they would be if labor markets were more competitive.While these definitional upgrades are impactful, the core failure of antitrust law to protect Minnesotans from monopoly power has been the courts adoption of the consumer welfare standard in recent decades. This doctrine is a warped interpretation of antitrust law that relies on a narrow focus on prices that strips away how powerful corporations harm small businesses and workers.HF4144would reinvigorate Minnesota’s antitrust laws by creating new guidelines focused on powerful firms. The legislation would establish what constitutes a dominant firm and prohibit such companies from using their dominant power to engage in abusive and anticompetitive tactics such as creating barriers to entry or by forcing workers to accept restrictive contracts.Withincreasing inequality, stagnant wages,declines in entrepreneurship,rising inflationand the hollowing out of communities, it is clear that monopolists are eroding economic opportunity. Minnesota, for a second time, has a chance to lead the battle against concentrated power. We must seize that chance.Justin Stofferahn lives in White Bear Township and is a public affairs professional who has worked on a variety of tax and economic development issues and is a member of the Minnesota Main Street Alliance leadership team."
minnpost_2022_50,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .A vacancy sign hangs above the Supreme Court bench following reports this week that long-serving liberal justice Stephen Breyer will retire.Names arealready being thrown around in the mediaas to who will replace him, aided by helpfulhints from President Joe Bidenhimself. But whoever it is can, depending on their age, expect a lengthy spell on the bench of the highest court in the land.Precedent shows us that justices tend to grow old in the position. Breyer is one such example. When hejoined the Supreme Court in 1994, he was an already very accomplished 55-year-old former law professor and appeals court judge. Now, at age 83, he is set to retire from the court at the end of the current term in June.Supreme Court justices in the U.S. enjoy life tenure. UnderArticle 3 of the Constitution, justices cannot be forced out of office against their will, barring impeachment. This provision, which followed theprecedent of Great Britain, is meant to ensure judicial independence, allowing judges to render decisions based on their best understandings of the law — free from political, social and electoral influences.Our extensive research on the Supreme Court shows life tenure, while well-intended, has had unforeseen consequences. It skews how theconfirmation processandjudicialdecision-makingwork, and causes justices who want to retire tobehave like political operatives.Life tenure has motivated presidents to pickyounger and youngerjustices.In the post-World War II era, presidents generally forgo appointing jurists in their 60s, who would bringa great deal of experience, and instead nominate judges in their 40s or 50s, who could serve on the court for many decades.Andthey do. JusticeClarence Thomas was appointedby President George H.W. Bush at age 43 in 1991 andfamously saidhe would serve for 43 years. There’s another 12 years until his promise is met.The court’s newest member, Donald Trump’s nominee Amy Coney Barrett, was48 when she took her seatin late 2020 after the death of 87-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Ginsburg, a Clinton appointee who joined the court at age 60 in 1993, refused to retire. When liberals pressed her to step down during the presidency of Democrat Barack Obama to ensure a like-minded replacement,she protested, “So tell me who the president could have nominated this spring that you would rather see on the court than me?”Justices change during their decades on the bench,research shows.Justices who at the time of their confirmation espoused views that reflected the general public, the Senate and the president who appointed them tend tomove awayfrom those preferences overtime. They becomemore ideological, focused on putting their ownpolicy preferencesinto law.For example, Ginsburg grew more liberal over time, while Thomas has become more conservative.Other Americans’political preferencestend to be stable throughout their lives.The consequence is that Supreme Court justices may no longer reflect the America they preside over. This can be problematic. If the court were to routinely stray too far from the public’s values,the public could rejectits dictates. The Supreme Court relies on public confidence tomaintain its legitimacy.Life tenure has also turned staffing the Supreme Court into an increasinglypartisan process, politicizing one of thenation’s most powerful institutions.In the 1980s and 1990s, Supreme Court nominees could generally expect large, bipartisansupport in the Senate. Today, judicial confirmation votes are almoststrictly down party lines. Public support for judicial nominees also showslarge differencesbetween Democrats and Republicans.Life tenure can turn supposedly independent judges intopolitical playerswhoattempt to time their departuresto secure theirpreferred successors, as Justice Anthony Kennedy did in 2018. Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh, one of Kennedy’sformer clerks, to replace him. A similar turn of events may occur if President Biden nominates JudgeKetanji Brown Jackson, a former Breyer clerk, to the current vacancy on the court.ManySupreme Courtexpertshave coalesced around asolutionto these problems:staggered, 18-year termswith avacancy automatically occurringevery two yearsin nonelection years.This system would promotejudicial legitimacy, they argue, by taking departure decisionsout of the justices’ hands. It would help insulate the court from becoming acampaign issuebecausevacancies would no longer ariseduring election years. And it wouldpreserve judicial independenceby shielding the court from political calls to fundamentally alter the institution.Partisanship would still tinge the selection and confirmation of judges by the president and Senate, however, and ideological extremists could still reach the Supreme Court. But they would be limited to 18-year terms.Even England — the country on which the U.S. model is based — no longer grants its Supreme Court justices life tenure. Theymust now retireat 70.Similarly, although many U.S. states initially granted their supreme court judges life tenure,this changedduring the Jacksonian era of the 1810s to 1840s when states sought to increase the accountability of the judicial branch. Today, only supreme court judges inRhode Islandhave life tenure. All other states either havemandatory retirement agesor let voters choose when judges leave the bench throughjudicial elections.In December 2021, thePresidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United Statesreleased itsreporton Supreme Court reform, which examined term limits for the justices. Although the commission did not take a position on the merits of term limits, it did outline a variety of means by which they could be imposed, including through the constitutional amendment process and by congressional statute.Ultimately, Congress, the states and the public they represent will decide whether the country’s centuries-old lifetime tenure system still serves the needs of the American people.Paul M.

suffolknewsherald_2022_212,"Published 4:15 pm Tuesday, November 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsYounger children are known for their brutal honesty.Sometimes it’s sharing good things, such as expressing their love and affection to others. Other times, it can cause awkward moments as children ask about personal or sensitive matters. Young children can also be very expressive. Huge smiles and loud cries let you easily know how they are feeling.Their honesty and expressiveness can bring joy to the adults around them. Is there anything better than the huge grin of a small child running towards you with arms open wide for a hug?Perhaps an excited “Daddy!” or “Mommy!” lets you know that you were missed. They can be quick to say that they love you, but their joyful expressions tell you even if they don’t verbalize those feelings.They are often excited to tell you about their day, share every detail of their life with you, and verbalize and demonstrate their love for you.It’s not usually the same when they hit the teenage years. They don’t say “I love you” as frequently, and details of their day or life are often left unshared, even if you ask. Detailed explanations of their day are replaced with teenage grunts when you ask how everything is going. You’re stuck trying to dig for information, and there are times when it seems impossible to determine what they are thinking or feeling.It can be tempting to pull back on expressing our feelings to them because the joyful smile you once received when you told them you loved them has been replaced with an expressionless face and an unenthusiastic “Uh huh” or another brief phrase.However, parents and other caring adults in the lives of teenagers must not stop speaking to teens about their lives, asking how they are doing, or telling them that they love them. It is just as important now as it was when they were little.Their rapidly changing minds and bodies may cause them to struggle to share their feelings, but they still need your love and support. They will never admit it, but their minds and hearts need to know that you’re still there, you still care, and you still love them.They may act annoyed while you are around, and teenagers need some personal space, but you must continue talking to them about life.

eugeneweekly_2022_17,"We ve got issues. I’ll never forget the first sounds of relentless, booming gunshots. The bright strobe lights bouncing across the dark room. The smell of blood and smoke that filled the air. On a June night in 2016, a gunman opened fire at Pulse Nightclub, a safe space for my friends and me. And a refuge for other LBGTQ people in Orlando, Florida. As gunfire rang out, I sprinted for an exit. I remember the feeling of relief when an emergency exit door swung open and I emerged into the night unscathed. And I’ll never forget the way my heart shattered when I realized my friends hadn’t made it off the dancefloor. Since that night six years ago, I have dedicated my life to activism. I’ve dedicated my life to standing up for the LGBTQ+ community in the face of hatred and intolerance, and to speaking out against gun violence. And so, as an Oregon native, I just can’t sit by in the wake of another tragedy in Texas and even stand witness to historic gun safety legislation finally passing in the U.S. Senate, just to watch so many of my home state’s political leaders continue to spout the talking points of the NRA. Let’s be clear: common-sense gun violence prevention is on the ballot. And in the race for the highest office in Oregon, there are two candidates who have long records of siding with the gun lobby instead of taking real action to save lives. Betsy Johnson and Christine Drazan have both voted against widely supported, bipartisan, common-sense legislation to prevent gun violence in our communities. In fact, then-senator Johnson was a chief opponent, preventing life-saving gun policies from passing or even getting a vote in the legislature. It’s not political to see our nation’s gun deaths climb and demand that we do something different. It’s not political to take action to prevent the senseless murders of innocent children. Itispolitical to stand in the way of life-saving policies and toe the NRA line. Gun violence is preventable. But only if our leaders have the courage to stand up and do what’s right. Here in Oregon, out of the three candidates running for governor, only one has had the courage to take real action to prevent senseless gun violence — Tina Kotek. While Johnson was blocking common-sense gun violence prevention legislation in the Senate, Kotek was leading the way to get it passed through the House. Under Kotek’s leadership, Oregon passed legislation to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, allow school districts to prohibit concealed weapons on school property and prohibit individuals convicted of domestic violence and stalking from purchasing a firearm. And each time, Johnson voted no. And when Drazan, a Republican, began serving in the Oregon House of Representatives in 2018, she followed suit, earning an A rating from the NRA. This is personal for me. Oregon will always be my home state. I want my family — all our families — to be safe. And more than anything, I want Oregon to be the beacon of hope, the leader, for the rest of the country we know it can be. Oregon can be that leader. But it’ll take the right leadership; it’ll take electing a governor who isn’t afraid to stand up to the gun lobby, a leader who is brave enough to fight for what’s right. That’s why I’m proud to stand with Tina Kotek, the only candidate running for governor who I trust to fight for safer communities. Because she always has. I hope you’ll join me.

leoweekly_2022_44,"The terms “toxic masculinity” and “healthy masculinity” are in reference to a set of behaviors that any man can exhibit on any given day. Throughthe behaviorist approach, we learn that all behavior is learned. As such, if we are to foster an environment where healthy masculinity is our factory setting, these lessons must be taught to young boys in their formative years. As we continue to observeSexual Assault Awareness Month, we take a look at several Louisville parents who are teaching their sons healthy masculinity practices.Sean and Chanelle also realize they are fighting against a tide when it comes to utilizing therapy as a tool of healing.The American Psychological Association statesthat only 26.4% of Black men ages 18 to 44 who experience mental health challenges actually seek treatment, citing structural racism and the unique Black American experience as roadblocks. As such, Sean and Chanelle prioritize breaking down this wall to mental health with Victor. “It is important for us to teach him that therapy is okay and that you can learn many helpful coping mechanisms to handle your anger,” says Sean. “Our goal is to teach our son that there is nothing wrong with feelings and it’s OK to be angry or sad. You just need to take a moment to process and talk.”Another layer of respect Nick teaches young Sebastian is the art of the apology. “Owning up to our mistakes and taking accountability is big in our house,” Nick says. “I teach Sebastian that our mistakes don’t define us, nor does apologizing when you are wrong make you any less of a man. Instead, it is an admission that we all still have room to grow.”Early childhoodexperts like those at Healthlinerecommend starting consent lessons by teaching children the correct vocabulary for body parts early. Lindsey says she adopts this approach with Mason to tear down the taboos that surround sex in hopes of important conversations later in life. And while some may struggle teaching consent to younger children, Lindsey emphasizes that teaching this lesson doesn’t have to be difficult. “It doesn’t have to be a super in-depth conversation nor is it ever too early to start teaching our sons these valuable lessons that will grow them into great men,” says Lindsey. “If we aren’t teaching them, then who is?”James J.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_66,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°For a six-month period last year, something life-changing happened for tens of millions of American families: They started receiving automatic monthly payments of as much as $300 per child to use for whatever they needed.But Congress allowed the payments to expire in January, ending an expanded child tax credit that slashed child poverty and could have been a source of financial stability as inflation makes almost everything more expensive.Lawmakers now have the opportunity to correct that mistake.The effects of these benefits, which began in July 2021, were swift and dramatic. The child poverty rate fell nearly in half, from 9.7% in 2020 to 5.2% in 2021, and food insecurity plummeted, as families used the money to cover essentials such as groceries, rent, utility bills and child care.But those gains faded quickly once the payments ended and families felt the hit of financial hardship almost immediately. There were 3.7 million more children in poverty in January 2022 than in December 2021. By February, more households with children reported having difficulty covering their expenses. By July, food insecurity had jumped back up too.Democrats in Congress are pushing to include the enhanced child tax credit in an end-of-the-year package of legislation, and it’s important that they act now, before the GOP takes control of the House. When the child tax credit was expanded in 2021, it was part of the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill that passed without a single Republican vote.Keeping families with children out of poverty should not be a partisan issue. Republicans have supported expanding the child tax credit in the past, and some, including Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah , have proposed their own plans for monthly payments. The idea should be even easier to sell now because it is no longer theoretical. It’s a proven policy that made life better for more than 60 million children, if only for a few months.Democratic lawmakers have proposed pairing the enhanced child tax credit with a corporate tax break that would undo a provision of the 2017 tax law signed by President Trump restricting the use of credits for research and development expenses that has been a focus of complaints from business leaders. One group of Democrats opposes the inclusion of any corporate tax breaks unless the child tax credit is reinstated. This is a righteous demand, and it should be at the top of both parties’ agenda for the lame-duck session.It’s likely that any bipartisan deal that emerges will include changes to restrict eligibility to target mostly low-income families or add a work requirement. But there is value in keeping the credit as expansive as possible, as a near-universal benefit to families with children. Children shouldn’t be the victims of their families’ financial circumstances.There may also be debate over how to offset the roughly $100 billion annual cost of expanding the child tax credit. But it should be stressed that investing in our children pays dividends, generating about eight times as much in benefits to society, through improved health, increased future earnings and reduced reliance on other government benefits such as food stamps.Predictable monthly payments are so powerful because they leave it to families to decide how the money would best be spent. Families know best and Congress should empower them to make those decisions once again.— Los Angeles Times"

In these encounters I lead with humility, as my cousin who is a butcher and store owner is every bit as essential to his community as I am to mine.Many of my cousins did not have the opportunity to attend college, though they are making sure their children do. When I am with them, some are in awe of my job. Being the chancellor of a university is a big deal in their minds. In these encounters I lead with humility, as my cousin who is a butcher and store owner is every bit as essential to his community as I am to mine.When they ask me what my job is like, I usually answer that most of the time “I go to meetings and I sign stuff.” The details of the heavy responsibility behind those signatures are hard to describe outside the university. My job also has many privileges, however, like the pleasure of attending events such as student presentations, visiting faculty lectures or sporting events. Every time I attend one of these, I am grateful for the journey that brought me to UH-Hilo.Last month, I was honored to attend our “annual” (first one we have had in a few years, due to COVID scholarship celebration. As I looked out over all the smiling faces in the room, I was overwhelmed with gratitude. I was grateful that so many students were in attendance, despite the fact that the event was held around midterm time. I was grateful that so many donors attended, given that some are still avoiding large gatherings. I was grateful for our hard working staff and faculty, who make not only events like that but also everything we do on campus successful.When I greeted some donors before the event started and thanked them for coming, they replied that the pleasure was theirs and that they had missed the event the last few years. “It’s like Christmas for us!” they insisted. The deep pleasure one gets from being able to contribute to the success of our students, whether it be helping with tuition or helping them study abroad, was on full display in the room as donors happily chatted with students, and students were able to express their gratitude for those who are supporting their journeys. Many of our friends in the room give to other projects at the university as well. Some are friends of ‘Imiloa; others may have adopted a beehive at our Panaewa Farm. Seeing the warm community support and the rewards of that support is certainly one of the highlights of my year.Last week, I got to attend a presentation by the architects who are working with the State Historic Preservation Division to design their new home that we hope will be located on the UH-Hilo campus, and the next day I presented to the UH Board of Regents seeking their approval for the United State Geological Survey to build their regional offices on the UH-Hilo campus. I am grateful not only for the promise that both these projects bring, but also for the long partnerships we have had with both state and federal agencies. These agencies partner with our faculty on important research and service and they provide professional opportunities for our students and alumni. The partnerships contribute greatly to our success.Another event in our year that inspires immense gratitude is commencement, and this fall we will celebrate with two ceremonies: one an alumni commencement for those graduates who missed out on an in-person commencement because of the pandemic, and the other, our traditional fall ceremony.Commencement is by far the happiest day of the academic year. Relieved parents, proud families, happy students, happy faculty and staff. I am always grateful on those days for the many families who entrusted their students to us for their educational journeys. I am also grateful for the students who have chosen service professions; our community needs nurses and teachers, natural resource managers, and business professionals. These new professionals will build the future of our community, improve the world, and safeguard our citizens and our ‘aina.As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, events like these allow those of us at UH-Hilo to reflect on the many people for whom we are grateful. We are honored to serve our community and always grateful for the opportunity.Bonnie D. Irwin is chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Hilo.

We relish walking around Lake Harriet, rolling along the Mississippi River, playing in our many city parks. But the roads, streets, and sidewalks throughout our city still have a long way to go to being people-friendly.Highways impose intimidating and polluted barriers, busy avenues are hostile to families on bikes and crosswalks may be few and far between for folks not able or willing to dash through traffic.In contrast, annual Open Streets events encourage people to imagine a different world, where our thoroughfares are shared peacefully and safely, even joyfully. Organized by Our Streets Minneapolis, Open Streets events close down lengths of major Minneapolis streets on different days throughout the summer to allow people on foot, bikes, scooters, wheelchairs, walkers, skateboards and rollerblades to fully occupy the streets, taking in their city and one another at under 25 miles per hour.Last year, volunteering at Lyndale Open Streets, I witnessed universal curiosity on the faces of so many of my neighbors who were happily taking in their cityscape, unencumbered by the otherwise omnipresent danger of large motorized vehicles. The Open Streets concept originated fromcicloviaevents organized in Colombia in 1974, and has since morphed into a worldwide movement, which allows people to envision a future where our metropolises are not held hostage by cars. This vision is consistent with Minneapolis’ own development goals towards greater density, increased usage of bikes, transit and non-car means of getting around and vibrant, people-first spaces.Our Streets Minneapolis, an independent non-profit with a small staff, has been the sole organizer of Open Streets since its inception more than a decade ago in 2011. From its start with 5,000 attendees, it has grown to multiple events per year, and was attended by 103,500 people in 2019 – a quarter of the city’s population.The event engages 700 volunteers and over 150 community partners each season.This amounts to $.25 for every Minneapolis resident to support one of the city’s flagship events, an event embraced by the city on its own officialwebsiteas one of its “programs and efforts to improve our City.”Many Minneapolitans look forward to these welcoming and inclusive events as the high point of the warm weather season, even more so than the State Fair. But the lack of city funding has constrained the route selection process and puts Our Streets Minneapolis in a position to charge a registration fee that creates a financial barrier for disadvantaged vendors and participants or forces the organization to altogether exclude a community in the route selection process. In order for Our Streets to continue to offer these events and make them fully accessible and equitable to all, financial support from the City of Minneapolis is essential.Nina Clark is a board member of Our Streets Minneapolis, a Minneapolis resident and professional in the field of arts and culture."
suffolknewsherald_2022_204,"Published 2:13 pm Saturday, January 15, 2022ByStaff ReportsThe first month of this new year is not even half over, and already there are some big changes in Suffolk, particularly in the realm of public safety.Suffolk Police Department Chief Alfred Chandler was announced as the selection to fill the role permanently after having been there on an interim basis since June 2020. And new Commonwealth’s Attorney Narendra Pleas was sworn in as the city’s top prosecutor after winning an open race occasioned by the retirement of longtime prosecutor Phil Ferguson.We wish Chandler and Pleas the best in their new roles. But we also want to remind folks that one vital thing about public safety in Suffolk hasn’t changed, and that’s the importance of community involvement.Both the Suffolk Police Department and the Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office have a long history of ensuring that citizens know they are one of the most important crime-fighting tools available and actively building partnerships with those citizens. They have done this through a variety of programs, such as National Night Out participation and the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office’s annual Citizens Academy, which enabled folks who signed up to get a close look at the inner workings of the prosecutors’ office and learn about how they personally can help stop crime. This program was particularly championed by Ferguson, who was adamant in his belief that a more educated, involved and connected citizenry can help stop and deter crime.We couldn’t agree more, and we hope to see these initiatives and others like them continue when it’s once again safe to gather. In the meantime, we urge Suffolk residents to keep in mind that if they have any information on potential criminal activity or if they simply see something that’s out of the ordinary, the best thing to do would be to report it to the police.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_29,"As members of the agency that enforces campaign finance rules, our eyes will be on the crowded mayoral field, as well as the candidates running for other important offices in the coming year.In 2023, Philadelphians willvote for a new mayor. They will also choose candidates to fill other important city offices. Millions of dollars will be spent by hundreds of political committees to influence who we vote for in each of these races — but the largest amount of money willlikely be spent on the mayor’s race.As the chair and executive director of thePhiladelphia Board of Ethics, which enforces campaign finance rules, we want to send a message to all candidates and political committees: We are watching.The city hascontribution limits enforced by the Philadelphia Board of Ethicsthat are designed to restrain the influence of large donors on city contracts and policies. Specifically, campaigns cannot acceptmore than $12,600 in contributionsfrom an organization.However, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision inCitizens United v. FECissued in 2010significantly deregulated money in politics and strengthened the influence of large donors, especially at the federal level.What didCitizens Unitedmean for Philadelphia? It meant that “independent expenditure committees” — as they are now known under Pennsylvania law — can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money, including money from corporations and unions, but only if they refrain from making direct or indirect contributions to candidates or “coordinating” with candidates. In other words, organizations can throw as much money at the 2023 mayoral candidates as they want, but they have to play by the rules.This ability to raise unlimited amounts of money is why these independent committeesare often called “super PACs.”In order to ensure super PACs remain truly independent, courts and regulatory agencies like the board enforce rules against “coordination” between candidates and super PACs. Coordination can include activity where a candidate helps a super PAC plan how the PAC spends money, gives the PAC materials to use for “republication” (which could include using campaign materials in political ads by the PAC , or helps the PAC raise money, even up to a year before the election.When super PACs coordinate with candidates, they are no longer acting “independently” and are breaking the rules. Coordination is a way to circumvent the city’s contribution limits, which is not fair to other candidates who follow these rules.“Coordination with super PACs is not fair to other candidates who follow these rules.”If a super PAC spends money in coordination with a Philadelphia candidate, that activity is no longer considered an independent expenditure — and if that money exceeds the city’s contribution limit, it would be considered unlawful. For example, if a super PAC works with a candidate on a $500,000 TV ad buy, the board can ask a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas judge to order the super PAC to stop its advertising plan and levy financial penalties against the super PAC for any related campaign finance violations, because such a coordinated ad buy would be a contribution that exceeds the city’s $12,600 limit.While there may or may not be violations for the candidate, people running for public office in Philadelphia should think carefully before agreeing to have their campaign financially boosted by such a rule-breaking scheme.Unlike federal elections, where the rules and enforcement have struggled to keep pace with the emerging ways candidates and super PACs coordinate, Philadelphia has tracked the latest super PAC trends around the country sinceCitizens Unitedand has amended and refined its campaign finance rules — as recently as this summer.Our latest update over the summer addresses the newer trend of “redboxing,” where candidates place instructions in red boxes on their campaign websites. Super PACs interpret these instructions as directions on what information the candidates want super PACs to include. The instructions are often thinly veiled – for instance, a campaign may say a message should reach voters “on the go,” which means it should be part of a mobile ad. So make no mistake: Redboxing is a means of circumventing the rules against super PACs directly coordinating with the campaigns they support.» READ MORE:Philly’s Board of Ethics voted to close a loophole that super PACs use to get instructions from campaignsIn September, Philadelphia became the only jurisdiction in the country that we know of to address redboxing, when the Board of Ethicsunanimously voted to regulate the strategy. Redboxing has been used in federal campaigns around the country, but complaints to the Federal Election Commissionhave mostly gone unheeded.We hope this sends a message to Philadelphia candidates that running for office in this city is not like running for federal office. That message is:Philadelphia has different rules. And they will be enforced.Michael H. Reed and J. Shane Creamer Jr. are the chair and executive director, respectively, of the Philadelphia Board of Ethics, a five-member volunteer city agency that is independent of the administration."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_31,"Questionable processQuestionable processI find it very interesting and have some concerns that Police Commission Chairman John Bertsch recused himself now from the police chief selection process only after it was whittled down to four prospective finalists.According to media sources, 40-plus applicants submitted their resumes, identified by numbers only, in the beginning for the police commissioners to view their background information and credentials.I think that when Commissioner Bertsch first read and scrutinized the application for potential police chief Edward Ignacio, even though he did not know the identity of the individual he was reviewing, he should have caught on then and realized that he knew this person very well and disqualify himself immediately from the start of the elimination process in order for it to be fair and impartial.But, then again, openness and transparency were not done from the start by the police commissioners. Don’t get me wrong — this is not a knock on Edward Ignacio, because I had the privilege and opportunity to work alongside with Eddie and his dad in the police department, both fine people.Prentiss MorenoHiloDirect path to HiloThe original Saddle Road was bulldozed by the military directlyon topof a narrow 1935 lava flow that snaked toward Hilo from virtually the same spot threatened by the recent eruption.

leoweekly_2022_13,"ON. AUG. 22, I learned about the suicide of Chris Wells, a leader in the Breonna Taylor Protests. I would rarely be at Injustice Square Park and not see Chris. He could not be missed — tall, slender, well-dressed, often donning sunglasses. He towered above others in the crowd, often with a megaphone in his hand. Some people ask to be leaders. Others simply emerge as leaders. When I got the message that Chris had died, all I could think about were the shadows that linger in this city. Kentucky and I have a love, hate relationship. For all the slivers of light that I see, this is a city of shadows.2020 only made it darker.There are days I wish I could go back in time knowing everything I know now and alter things. 2020 is a year I wish never happened. A year I wish I could erase from my memory. But the memories are there taunting me, haunting me, reminding me. Always reminding me.When I think of the death of Chris Wells, I am reminded of the Butterfly Effect, a phrase coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines, the Butterfly Effect as, “a property of chaotic systems (such as the atmosphere by which small changes in initial conditions can lead to large-scale and unpredictable variation in the future state of the system.” Essentially, it seeks to demonstrate how one small, simple event can cause a cascade of events.One lie told by Officer Joshua Jaynes spun a typhoon within our city, creating violent winds that have torn entire lives apart. We had no time to prepare for the storm that was coming.Breonna Taylor. Dead. Tyler Gerth. Dead. Kris Smith. Dead. David McAtee. Dead. Travis Nagdy. Dead. Scoota. Dead. And now Chris Wells. Dead.The thread that is woven through all their deaths, creating a tapestry of pain and heartache, is the one lie that Officer Joshua Jaynes told to secure a no-knock warrant and enter the home of Breonna Taylor and Kenneth Walker. How different would life be if Officer Jaynes did not make the reckless decision to lie? His one lie impacted so many lives. His one lie set off a chain of events in this city, and we still feel the aftershocks almost three years later. How many more people must die because one officer chose to lie?Even beyond those who have passed away, I think about all the people that have been affected by Officer Jaynes’s lie. While not physically dead, the emotional toll his lie has taken on all of us feels like we are slowly bleeding out. We try to cover our deep wounds with temporary BandAids, not knowing the slow bleed will be fatal.I don’t think Louisville understands what it means for everyday citizens to have the city declare war on them. To come to the understanding that the city you live in, the city you love, was willing to kill you to protect a building. I don’t think this city understands what it means to have rifles aimed at you, to be teargassed, shot at with rubber bullets, fl ash banged and threatened. We were declared an enemy in our own state. Life doesn’t just go back to “normal.” Even with all the good that people like Chris have done in the community, I am reminded that this city was willing to kill him because he was a Black man demanding justice for an innocent Black woman murdered in her home. I am saddened he had to post on Facebook and remind this city, who treated him as if he was a nobody, “I am somebody. I am a Black man.”But on that day, this city disregarded him, disregarded his dignity. It is always acceptable in this city for Black people to be collateral damage.It all takes a toll.We have been to war in this city, and everyone looks the other way. Where are the free mental health services for a community you sent into war? Every day it is a challenge to find any peace. We exist between two crosses — fight and flight. Years later, many of us are just going through the motions. Silently fighting a war inside. Trying to recover from the storm of one lie.When I think about Chris and others impacted by Officer Jaynes’ lie, I am reminded of a quote by Harriet Tubman, “In my dreams and visions, I seemed to see a line, and on the other side of that line were green fields, and lovely flowers, and beautiful white ladies, who stretched out their arms to me over the line, but I couldn’t reach them no-how. I always fell before I got to the line.”I see that fi eld too. I daydream about that fi eld constantly. A beautiful, lush green meadow where Black people can finally be free. A fi eld with a sea of flowers as far as the eye can see. Sunflowers, roses, calla lilies, daises, orchids, marigolds, buttercups, daffodils…And in the fi eld, Black people are dancing, laughing and smiling. There are no weapons of war there. No violence.

eugeneweekly_2022_40,"We ve got issues. In 1970, Congress tackled the nation’s organized crime problem by enacting the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO or Racketeering Act . While primarily motivated by the illegal activities of mafia “families” and such syndicates as featured in Hollywood’sGodfatherclassic, the RICO statute was aimed at a wide swath of methodical and organized criminal activity which was notable for its pattern of repetitive violations of a host of specific criminal statutes. This legislation is codified at 18 U.S. Code Sections 1961-1968. Prosecution under RICO is triggered by two or more acts of listed criminal activity, referenced as “predicate acts,” and/or conspiring to commit such acts. The predicate acts do not have to be the same, and any combination of delineated crimes may be considered. Among the proscribed crimes which qualify as predicate acts are: any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, robbery, bribery, extortion,mail fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, tampering with a witness,retaliating against a witness or informant, obstruction of State or local lawenforcement, drug trafficking (and others The RICO act also defines an “enterprise” subject to certain provisions of the statute to include any individual, partnership, association or other legal entity, and any… group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity (which engages in or affects interstate commerce . In short, within the contours of this historic legislation, Congress defined the elements of organized crime and its core DNA, while dedicating powerful national resources to eradicate it through the criminal justice system with severe penal sanctions. With RICO as background, consider the following recent events reported by the media: 1 The Trump-Ukraine scandal: Did the action of Donald Trump in withholding military aid, which had been appropriated by Congress for the defense of Ukraine, and condition providing the aid only if the Ukrainian government initiated and publicly announced a criminal investigation of a domestic political rival of Trump, constitute an act involving extortion, and did he conspire with others to accomplish this objective? 2 Was Alexander Vindman, a witness in the Ukrainian incident who cooperated with a Congressional subpoena and testified before a House impeachment inquiry regarding the matter, retaliated against because of his cooperation and role as a witness? 3 Did a “group of individuals associated in fact” conspire to and act to obstruct state, local and federal law enforcement by threatening election officials with bodily harm and death for performing their duty in counting and returning ballots cast during the 2020 presidential election? 4 Did Trump conspire to and engage in obstruction of state law enforcement by contacting the Georgia Secretary of State and demanding he change the election tally and transfer approximately 11,800 votes that were cast for Biden to himself in order for Trump to carry Georgia and its electoral votes.? 5 Did Trump and others conspire to obstruct justice and state, local and federal law enforcement by falsely claiming that the U.S. Department of Justice had found evidence of fraud in the 2020 election returns in connection with a plan to prevent the certification of the Electoral College ballots by the vice president and Congress? 6 Did Trump and others conspire to obstruct justice and impede an official proceeding in Congress by inciting and causing a “group of individuals associated in fact” to storm the Capitol building to forcibly and violently prevent the certification of the Electoral College ballots by the vice president of the United. States? 7 Did Trump obstruct justice, tamper with and intimidate witnesses, and interfere with criminal investigations after the attack on the Capitol when he subsequently urged his supporters at a rally in Texas to stage “the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere” should any charges be brought (against him based on the investigations in those jurisdictions , or by promising to grant pardons to those being prosecuted for crimes committed in the attack if re-elected? I raise these issues not to advocate for or against the merits of potential charges arising out of the incidents — such decisions are wholly within the purview of others who are tasked with the duty to investigate and determine whether the evidence justifies seeking accountability through legal proceedings. But regardless of the outcome of pending investigations, the issues present fair and important questions implicating the gravest concerns for our political system. These actions, as well as others well known to those who keep up with current events impacting our complex societal structure, reflect a dangerously unhealthy political system in a country once touted as a model of Democracy. We have witnessed one of the major political parties not only adopting a platform at its 2020 convention, which consisted of complying with the will of its nominee for president (which frankly translates into the submissiveness accorded dictators , but also promulgating a resolution that endorses the violent Capitol riot/insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021 as “legitimate political discourse.” When a nation’s political playbook reads like a Cosa Nostra manual and includes a Putinesque loyalty oath, its claim of democratic governance is feeble and teetering on life support. When it also includes approval of bloody overthrow of that form of governance, it is hypocrisy. Please wake up, America. Put aside your differences, affirm your principles and protect your freedoms. The alternative is the equivalent of the 9th Circle of Dante’s Hell, and once lost, again finding Democracy and the rule of law might well prove to be mission impossible. The enemies of Democracy are formidable and determined, and our Constitution may be an imperfect document, but it is at its best when it is inclusive of all the People, not a narrow slice of just a few members of a powerful “group of individuals associated in fact” to compel their agenda on the rest of us. Crawl over broken glass in your bare feet if you have to, but turn out in record numbers and vote despite the barriers being constructed to keep you from voting. Don’t let them pull off a “hit” on your right to vote and send Democracy to “sleep with the fishes”. Thomas Coffin is a retired United States magistrate judge.

suffolknewsherald_2022_195,"Published 10:06 pm Wednesday, January 26, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonFor most of us, waiting sometimes has ill effects, like stress. We are in a hurry to get something done or to get somewhere. We have schedules to keep. We want to “get on with it,” whatever “it” is. Waiting has a longtime kinship with stress. We all want what we want when we want it or when we are expecting it. Waiting on something or for someone is not easy.I was surprised to find waiting for the snow to fall was just one of those foolish times when I was impatient. We were promised snow, several inches. When I went to bed, there was only a very light covering on the sidewalk. A moderately strong wind was blowing on that, bringing on small drifts. I was awake at 1:30 and could not resist checking at the front door. There it was, the anticipated beauty of snow! My waiting was satisfied. I went happily back to bed. Now, this Saturday morning as January closes its doors on the first month of 2022, I am joyful.January has not been a happy month. The news has been a tangled mess. Anyone listening to the media portrayals cannot help but have concerns about what is happening, not only in our own country but all over the world. Thousands, if not millions of people are on the move, looking for some kind of change or security. There are shortages in the grocery stores, some apparently due to imposed regulations because of concerns we may not understand.We try to regulate our lives with plans that do not always work out, and we often find once again we are playing the waiting game. We anticipate the next move we make will bring a measure of satisfaction. Sometimes it does; sometimes, we find more disappointments. Life on planet earth has never found complete fulfillment since our first fathers sinned thousands of years ago. Why is it that way? That seed of sin from our first fathers entered into our DNA and remains there, causing us to mistrust the Creator God.Is there nothing we can do about our condition? Yes, there is, and the snow is the reminder.We can have a change and a new relationship with God when we ask for His cleansing from sin. The Scriptures continually affirm that with confession of sins and submission to God’s will, we can have the peace that passes all understanding (Philippians 4:7 . It is God’s will for us and His creation. Isaiah reminded the people of his day, “Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow.” (1:18 Yes, the snow will require a cleaning up, but so does the sin in our lives. The earth is renewed when the snow has melted. The obedience in doing the cleanup is another lesson. Our lives are renewed when we get into a right relationship with the God Who first planned for His creation.Let the beautiful white snow of God’s creation be a reminder to fill our lives with His Word as we await what February will bring us.Myrtle Thompson, 93, is a local author, Bible lover and teacher.

minnpost_2022_115,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .At the beginning of the pandemic, we all said repeatedly we were living in unprecedented times. The classroom shifted to our homes, and nothing has been the same since.Families, students, and school staff are all under more stress. They’ve gone through three years of a global pandemic disrupting education, shifting between in-person, hybrid, and distance learning, creating new ways of teaching, and learning on the fly. Student mental health is frayed, along with staff. Stressed staff are trying to teach and support stressed students. All while conservatives have again decided to wage a culture war to silence discussions of race and inequality, isolate LGBT students, politicize school curriculum, and drive a wedge between parents and their child’s teachers.House DFLers know this is the most critical moment to act. We are choosing to invest over a billion dollars in our students each year for the next three years because we know this is a choice about the direction of our state’s future; it’s a values blueprint, and we are ready to deliver the support students, families and school staff need to ensure that Minnesota can thrive in the future.Schools are dealing with all of this while the state fails to fund what we require them to do. Statewide the difference between what it costs to provide special education services and what the state pays for those services is over $700 million. The deficit in English Language Learner services is $147 million. So, while we ask schools to do more to catch our children up, we cannot stand idly by without solutions.We can and should do better and that is why the House DFL is proposing funding over $500 million each year to significantly reduce this cost burden that impacts every school in the state.Minnesota ranks 49thin the nation in the ratio of school counselors to students, while students’ and teachers’ mental health is declining in every corner of the state. House DFLers will utilize the budget surplus to address shortages of school support personnel services that benefit students’ social, emotional, and physical health. The House DFL education proposal provides enough funding for schools to hire more than 1,000 additional counselors, social workers, school psychologists, school nurses, and chemical dependency specialists. Teachers and students are asking for this, and the House DFL is fighting for this because it couldn’t be clearer this is where our priority needs to be.To close the opportunity gap, we need to invest in our youngest Minnesotans. Since the earliest years of a child’s life are the foundation for everything that follows, expanding access to early education is one of the most effective ways to reduce disparities. Our proposal establishes a statewide voluntary prekindergarten program made available through private day care providers, Head Start programs, and school-based opportunities for children who are least likely to have access to early learning. It will deliver educational opportunities to thousands of children and give them the tools to succeed in kindergarten and later in life.Black, Indigenous and teachers of color make up only five percent of full and part-time teachers in Minnesota. Thanks to a coalition of educators and community organizations, last year’s budget agreement included new investments to help recruit and retain more teachers of color with the overall goal of providing all kids with equitable access to educators who look like them. While we’ve made some progress, there’s more we must act on to ensure all students can learn in a welcoming environment which reflects the true diversity of our state.With a $9.3 billion surplus, the idea that our resources are scarce or limited is not only inaccurate, but also a misleading notion that has trickled down since the Reagan Administration. As Minnesota lawmakers and leaders in education, we have a historic, once in a lifetime opportunity in our state to correct the ongoing underinvestment in our students to move our students and families forward. We invite Senate Republicans to join us in delivering clear, innovative solutions that get our students on the fast track to recovery. Our kids and families deserve no less.Rep. Jim Davnie (DFL-Minneapolis chairs the House Education Finance Committee."
minnpost_2022_11,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Justice?There is no such thing. It’s elusive and subjective. What’s considered just or fair has changed over time and depends on the society or culture you live in. Plaintiffs and defendants have very different opinions on how justice should be served. If you are the victim of a violent crime, chances are you and the perpetrator will also violently disagree on what constitutes just punishment. Before legal systems and courts existed, victims and their relatives were in charge of delivering justice – mostly by feud and pretty much on an eye-for-an eye basis. These tribal customs fell out of fashion with the advent of kingdoms and kings who didn’t want their underlings to massacre each other and decided, for the sake of progress and predictability, to strip them of their power to prosecute crimes and make it a state business instead. Today, the state’s prosecutor is the defendant’s only official adversary in the courtroom while the victim’s status has been reduced to witness – as such being more object than acting subject during the trial procedure.All that’s left to do is for the victim’s supporters to wave signs outside the courtroom that claim “Justice for X” or, if the victim was killed, for relatives to make a victim impact statement. Which may or may not have an impact on the judge. Also, the value of these statements has been questioned. Should a murderer serve more time in jail when its victim had a large, loving family and less time when there is no vocal fan base? If all human beings are supposed to be equal before the law, shouldn’t that include the murdered ones?Here is another model where victims or their relatives play a more active – and potentially less frustrating – role in the courtroom asNebenklägeror “co-plaintiffs.” Co-plaintiffs are part of German trial law which, for example, allowed family members of 9/11 victims to join the Hamburg prosecutor’s case against Mounir El Motassadeq. He was on trial for supporting the Hamburg cell of Al-Qaeda that played a central role in the 9/11 hijackings. The law gives victims’ relatives the right to question the defendant directly if he or she testifies in court. Co-plaintiffs or their lawyers can call witnesses, introduce evidence, and participate in discovery of evidence collected by the prosecution and defense. They can also appeal if they feel the sentence is too low or too high (the latter doesn’t happen too often . El Motassadeq received the maximum sentence and spent 15 years in prison.Because everyone defines it differently, German trial law doesn’t even claim that it creates justice – it sticks with the notion ofRechtsfriedenas the desired outcome, best translated as legal peace. This means that all legal means have been exhausted to solve the conflict, and the parties have (more or less accepted the verdict. I imagine that having a role as co-plaintiff makes acceptance easier for victims or their family members. In interviews after the 9/11 trial in Hamburg, the American co-plaintiffs sounded exhausted, yet relieved and one called it “a day to smile again.” They didn’t make impact statements but clearly had an impact on the trial procedure and outcome.Henning Schroeder is a professor at the University of Minnesota and currently teaches in the Department of German, Nordic, Slavic & Dutch.

suffolknewsherald_2022_224,"Published 7:06 pm Friday, November 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle V. ThompsonWhile listening to the news and reading my Bible this morning I was reminded “there is nothing new.” Psalm 2 and many others deal with the anger, hatred and contempt of people everywhere, how whole nations have been affected, plagued with the same things which were problems for people in the past.There were many ways in which Israel handled them but seemed always to encounter hopeless situations. None of their plans kept them at peace for very long.They found they had to look to their creator and confess their sins. When they failed to turn to him there were serious consequences. Is there an example today for us in our country?The coming election and candidates has filled the hours and days on the TV screen.I am reminded of how the world so often has wanted “change.” Who will become our national leaders and how will they handle the global concerns confronting us? Our country seems to be divided on what kind of leadership we want. There are complaints of every kind, yet no other country in the whole world has been so blessed.We have easy access to the two major necessities of life — water and food. In my mission ministry overseas, I lived in countries where water is a very precious commodity. In one village it is brought in a sewn-up goatskin from a spring that is a short distance away from our home. Food was very simple, mostly the necessities, nothing like what we find in the simplest nearby grocery stores around us today.More than bread and water, until recently we have had freedom with little or no fear for the future — freedom of speech, freedom and the means to travel by car, boat or plane, to move around as we pleased, to stay at home and have subsidies from the government or other help, to study and learn — in every way to live as we pleased and make our own choices, sometimes the wrong ones. If we did not like the outcome, there was recourse available.Has all that freedom left us happy? It has not seemed to be the elixir we needed so now different ideas are proposed and our election results may change the way we are living. We do not know if nor how God will respond in this special time.We do know the whole world has often been at odds with God’s plans for his creation. The arch enemy of God, Lucifer, has wanted, planned and tried to take control “to set his throne above the throne of God.” In Luke 10:18 Jesus makes only one cryptic statement, “I saw Satan fall from heaven,” removed because he had sinned against God. That battle has continued. The Psalms help to tell us about the “royal” battles which confront us and how to face them. We see some of the destruction caused by evil actions- murders, disregard for law, and power that can dominate.How do we view this uproar? Hundreds of years ago the psalmist had a similar question. He asked, “Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?” (Psalm 2, KJV. Other Bible translations put the words in a slightly different way, “Why are the nations in an uproar and the peoples devising a vain thing?”The next verse is a picture of what was happening, “The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed, (saying “let us tear their fetters apart and cast away their cords from us.” What is the psalmist talking about? He’s talking about power, the rulers who wanted power and control of the world the creator founded.My personal response? We need to be “prayed up” so we can face anything God allows in our future. We must not forget he is still the one in control of the whole of the universe he created. His love is still abundant. He is all powerful, able to hear and answer when we call on him, asking him to meet with us. I am now 94-plus and since I first put my trust in him at age 16 I have found him faithful.Myrtle V.

suffolknewsherald_2022_9,"Published 7:29 pm Friday, August 12, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:My husband and I are not “born and bred” Suffolkians. We are from rural areas outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and moved our young family to Virginia in 1986 when the steel mills failed causing catastrophic loss of work in our cities.Businesses closed and school censuses fell as people moved from the area to support their families, and we found ourselves in that position, as well. Much of the area has still not recovered.After several interviews and offers of teaching positions for Rick, we decided he would accept the one from Suffolk Public Schools, and move our family to Virginia. We knew we wanted to live in Suffolk, as it reminded us of where we grew up, and wanted our children to have that same experience of rural life and community. Initially, we could not find housing in Suffolk, so we rented an apartment in Churchland. We moved to downtown Suffolk in 1989, where we lived until we were offered rental of a farm house on Mockingbird Lane in 1992.We absolutely loved being able to move to the country, and by that time we had made many good friends, found a marvelous church family, become an active part of the community and considered Suffolk our home away from home.In 1999, we built our home on Cherokee Drive in Russell Point, and have lived there since that time. A wonderful neighborhood with great neighbors, it has been everything we wanted. My parents moved from Pennsylvania and in with us in 2002 due to declining health, and are interred in the Albert G. Horton, Jr. Veterans Cemetery.Rick retired from Suffolk Public Schools in 2015 after teaching art education at Robertson, Holland, and Southwestern elementaries, and Nansemond River High School. All three of our children graduated from NRHS. We worship here. We support local businesses, organizations, museums and what little entertainment opportunities that become available.We have seen many changes in Suffolk during the years we have lived here. Some good, some not so good, and now the citizens of Suffolk are looking at an expansion of unsightly warehouses at major entries into Suffolk, of which some are unoccupied. I was unable to attend the City Council Meeting on Aug. 3, but I did listen to all of the comments regarding the Port 460 proposal on YouTube. Rick and I also attended the Matan meeting on Aug. 4 where many valid comments and concerns were voiced by Suffolk citizens, but the most recurring concern seemed to be regarding the effects on traffic in our city. I would like to add our concerns to those expressed.It is no secret that U.S. 58 and U.S. 460 are dangerous roads to travel. A trip down U.S. 460 has become a “white knuckle” drive if traveled for any distance.Summer traffic is even heavier as people travel through our area on their way to and from vacationing in the Outer Banks in order to avoid our congested bridge tunnels. We also have families from many areas in Virginia and North Carolina traveling here to bury their loved ones at the Veterans Cemetery, and returning to pay respects. Add to all of that tractor trailers that are notorious for running lights on U.S. 460, and it is definitely a recipe for disasters of monstrous proportions.I have lost count of the number of times I would have been hit going through the intersection of Lake Prince and U.S. 460 if I had not hesitated a few moments after my light turned green, due to trucks running the light. This has happened to every member of my family, and I am sure we are not the only ones that have experienced that frightening situation. And now we are asked to accept a significant increase in the number of trucks that travel our roads. Unconscionable!It is our hope that Suffolk citizens do not have to “take one for the state,” and have this rezoning pushed on us against our wishes. Surely there are more useful, attractive and practical ways to be found to develop this beautiful property which would be beneficial to our city and its citizens. I ask that you do not betray the faith and trust that was placed in you when you were elected to City Council. Your decision will speak volumes to the citizens.

minnpost_2022_66,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I am 72 years old. When I was in kindergarten my best friend, “Mark,” moved away. At age 16 or 17, he and an accomplice shot and killed two police officers in an eastern city. The officers were at their hotel room to investigate the stolen credit card they had used to pay for the room. Mark and his accomplice were subsequently killed in a shootout with the police after a high-speed chase. These juvenile offenders were, of course, just children, right?Newspapers of the day referred to them as teenage “hit men,” who were part of a Murder Incorporated-style criminal organization that groomed and paid juveniles to kill off their enemies. To this day, adult criminal gang members use juveniles to do things for them like carry their weapons. They do this because they know that if juveniles get caught, they will likely just get released, or will only serve a short sentence in a juvenile correctional facility. (Unlike a convicted felon who could do years in prison for possession of a firearm .There is a well intended but misguided movement to close juvenile correctional institutions, based on the belief that community-based correctional efforts are better for “children” than incarceration. The 2019 closing of Boys Totem Town in St. Paul is an example of this effort, although that closing clearly had complicated mitigating factors. If I remember correctly, my friend Mark was on escape status from that facility when he was shot by the police. Everyone, including Mark, would have been better off if he had been incarcerated at the time.Have you ever seen a parent tell a child “no,” over and over again, and then they finally say, “I’m not going to tell you again, and this time I really, really mean it!” Well, prison is the place where society says “No!” and this time it really, really, means it. Seriously, one time in federal prison I saw a man in his late 50s get down on the floor and cry and kick and scream like a toddler having a temper tantrum. Why? Because for the first time in this man’s life, someone told him “no” and actually carried through with the sanction, and there was nothing he could do about it.Decades ago I worked for two years at Boys Totem Town. Many a time I saw the lives of juveniles turn around when they hit that wall of “no,” when someone (like me finally set the limits for them. For these boys, incarceration was an uncomfortable blessing that benefitted both them and society for the rest of their lives.But for others, incarceration made them more angry, defiant and determined not to let that wall of “no” win. Proponents for closing juvenile correctional facilities use the fact that some boys come out of the facility more angry and defiant, to make the case that incarceration turns troubled teenagers into hardened criminals.It should not be presumed that the institution is responsible for this happening. Nor should it be presumed that angry, predatory, troubled teenagers who make the free will decision to continue with their harmful ways are themselves not responsible for their own bad behaviors. Good juvenile correctional facilities, just like properly run prisons, are in the really messy business of saying “no,” in a controlled environment that keeps the public safe. The mission of a good correctional facility is to attempt to turn wayward lives around, with public safety coming first as a higher priority.I have seen juveniles who are relieved to be incarcerated so as to escape horrible, abusive home life situations. Clearly, there have to be better community-based solutions than incarceration. I have seen juveniles in correctional facilities who fell so far behind in school that they were just plain lost, and being lost is a hopeless, terrible place to be.The specialized schooling they received at Totem Town brought many boys back up to grade level, and sent them forward into their lives with reason to believe that their future would be OK. No doubt for many juveniles this could and should be happening in community-based correctional efforts, with one important caveat. Without incarceration that essentially forces them to stay on track, not all juveniles have the self-discipline necessary to do the hard work of “catching up,” in the presence of more interesting temptations, distractions and peer pressures found in the community.The increase in carjackings is sending the public a message. Teenagers can be very dangerous people who are capable of doing great harm in so many ways, and on so many levels. At some point, the protection of society has to become more important than what is best for the child. Society needs a place where it can safely tell these offenders (children “no,” and this time, really, really mean it. And that place, for teenagers who are a threat to society, is not in the community.John A.

minnpost_2022_162,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We recognize the impassioned opposition, but aren’t convinced by arguments of ruination, cost effectiveness, or subterfuge by the Metropolitan Council. As the region grows, our infrastructure has to grow with it, and rational, long-term planning and investments are the best way forward.Local support and opposition appear about equal. Almost all city council votes have been 3-2, in both directions. The swing council vote switched from pro to con in the most recent city election, decided by 77 votes out of more 1,300 cast, with a 35 percent voter turnout. As with many local issues, ambivalence and/or disinterest wins, with about one-sixth against and a similar number for BRT.We don’t believe claims BRT will add congestion. Upwards of 25,000 cars and 1,000 larger trucks and buses pass through White Bear Lake on the proposed route each day. Ninety additional buses is less than one percent of current traffic. People in buses and out of cars will reduce congestion, or keep it from going up as fast as it has been over the past decades.We don’t expect, as some opponents predict, higher crime, drug use, vandalism and litter. There won’t be “syringes at the bus stop,” or “thugs on the bus,” to quote two of the more vivid online predictions. This hasn’t occurred in Burnsville or Roseville with the opening of their BRT lines. The impacts of transit on neighborhoods have been amply studied. The University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation studies is a good starting point. It found property values have been unaffected on Roseville’s A Line BRT; the Green Line light railboosted nearby property valuesin St. Paul.We realize the project is expensive, but think it is better than doing nothing, and that adding more general use auto lanes would be substantially more expensive and shorter-lived than transit. Growth in the corridor continues at a rapid pace, and we’ll need to add transport capacity to avoid daily gridlock. Adding two car lanes to highway 61 may be impossible, given current buildings, lakes, and wetlands that constrain highway expansion. If adding lanes is feasible, it would likely be towards the higher end of urban freeway construction as per general U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines and seen in recent north Metro highway projects, in the neighborhood of $25 – $50 million a lane-mile. This translates up to $50 to $100 million per highway mile, or up to $1.5 billion for additional lanes along the length. Car lanes have lower capacity than bus lanes, and have a short-lived impact on congestion because of induced demand. The U.S. is rife with examples of metro areas that first tried to build themselves out of clogged freeways, to little avail. New Jersey, Houston, Atlanta or L.A., anyone?We believe a traffic engineers’ estimates of ridership over opponents’ feelings or hunches. Predicting demand decades in the future is hard, and the planners and engineers have shot above and below targets. Ridership on the light rail Blue Line was 30 percent higher than predicted, A Line estimates on target, and the Northstar estimates too high. “Because I won’t ride it” isn’t a general analysis, so isn’t convincing. Ridership estimates are scrutinized by transportation engineers from MNDOT and Met Council, and the Federal Transportation Administration evaluating it.We know BRT won’t ruin the Bruce Vento Trail in White Bear Lake, because the trail ends near the southern border of town, with no parking and dangerous pedestrian access. A companion project would extend the Bruce Vento Trail to downtown White Bear Lake, giving kids and families in south White Bear safe bike access to downtown, and all town residents a safe connection to the Bruce Vento Trail.Buses are less convenient than cars, until congestion makes them more convenient. Then some drivers switch to become riders. Likely users aren’t retirees that can avoid peak times, rich folks that can afford a car for each kid, or folks that work at or near home. But unless the northeast Metro stops growing, which isn’t likely, users will include commuters to good jobs in St Paul, families of modest means, seniors past driving age for travel to clinics or outings downtown, teens that can’t drive to their first job, and service workers along the corridor. Our town will be at an economic disadvantage to those with better transportation networks, including transit.Paul Bolstad is a30-year resident of White Bear Lake."
eugeneweekly_2022_37,"We ve got issues. Facebook has been renamed Meta and is poised to roll out the metaverse. Simply put, this is where digital and virtual come together, aiming at the exclusion of all else. “Technoverse” would have been a more truthful term, but a bit too brutal sounding. The metaverse universe would be a technological reality with nothing outside of it. We would basically only exist on computer screens, having shed the confines of actual, physical life worlds, as fantastic as that sounds. The metaverse is us — at base a perfection and extension of virtual reality; the very name pretty much says it all. Virtual reality, VR, peddles a “sense” of reality, with its goal of “producing a high-grade feeling of presence.” (Not presence, but simulated presence. Oliver Grau, German art historian and media theorist, wrote that statement in 2003, a reminder that the components of the metaverse have been in the works for a while. Think of cybersex or haptic technology, a techno substitute for the sense of touch. Or “untact,” a South Korean government policy that seeks to remove layers of human interaction in the service of economic expansion. The metaverse will combine all such synthetic “advances” in a qualitative Great Leap Forward into estrangement from one another and our Mother Earth. There will be no more distinction between real and virtual. The term IRL (in real life will fall from the lexicon as obsolete. “Meta” was a stand-out Super Bowl commercial. It featured an outmoded and discarded robotic dog, given renewal in the metaverse. The ad is presented in a nostalgic vein, promoting the metaverse as, in effect, a return to the good old days. Deleting, of course, the fact that Facebook has played an important role in bringing on the ruin it now promises to rescue us from. Marketed as imagination unleashed and experience without limits, the metaverse represents the opposite of those dimensions –– the techno-evacuation of direct experience. We’ve already come a ways down this road, but I predict that the metaverse will not be realized. Not yet, anyway. I have some faith that we will resist this further surrender to simulation.

minnpost_2022_89,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .U.S. Rep. Pete Stauber has demonstrated yet again that he is wrong for Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District, just as sulfide-ore copper mining is wrong for the headwaters of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.On May 24, the U.S. House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources held a hearing on HR 2794, a bill that would permanently protect 234,328 acres of Superior National Forest lands in the headwaters of the Boundary Waters and Voyageurs National Park from sulfide-ore copper mining. Stauber was in attack mode, wrongly accusing three witnesses, including a prominent business owner in his district, of disinformation, misleading statements and half-truths. As a recentStar Tribune editorialobserved, the disinformation, misleading statements and half-truths came from Stauber and his Republican allies, not from the witnesses speaking in support of the bill.The canoe country of northeastern Minnesota is priceless; our state and federal governments have worked to protect this magnificent public land since 1902. The work continues to this day, informed by sound science and unyielding to reckless plans such as that of Antofagasta’s Twin Metals, which wants to mine upstream from the heart of the Boundary Waters. Nearly 70% of Minnesotans support legislation to permanently protect the Boundary Waters from sulfide-ore mining in its watershed. Of Stauber’s constituents, 57% oppose this type of mining in this place because with sulfide-ore copper mining the risks are high, and no risk to the Boundary Waters is acceptable.Stauber attacks citizens testifying in support of the bill, but it is his favorite Chilean mining company, Antofagasta, that has trouble getting its story straight. Julie Padilla, a representative of Antofagasta and an officer of Twin Metals, testified on May 24 to oppose protecting the Boundary Waters and Voyageurs. In 2019, in response to a Star Tribune writer who asked if Twin Metals could say there was zero risk to the Boundary Waters, Padilla answered “That’s not a fair question.” This past March, Padilla testified at a U.S. Senate Committee hearing and said “everything has a risk.” On May 24, she flipflopped to “there is no risk.”In fact, the risk is enormous.Twin Metals cynically claims that its proposed storage technique for toxic tailings dry stacking is perfect and will never leach. At the May 24 hearing, Padilla omitted that in 2018 the dry stacking technique was rejected by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources for a Polymet mine. The DNR found that in a wet climate such as northern Minnesota, dry stacking has major environmental disadvantages, including the potential to leach heavy metals and other pollutants into surface and ground water. Padilla failed to admit that the two mines in the United States that Twin Metals holds out as perfect examples of dry stacking are failures. An April 2022 report documented that these two mines, together with three others in Alaska, experienced more than 8,000 spills among them. She also failed to inform the subcommittee that the site Twin Metals proposed for storage — on state land — was rejected by the DNR in February 2022 because storage of these toxic tailings on state land “would pose an unacceptable financial risk to the State.”Padilla testified that a Twin Metals mine won’t leach acid mine drainage. But Padilla failed to tell the subcommittee that the DNR determined that the claim by Twin Metals that its tailings pile would not generate acid mine drainage was unsubstantiated.Instead of accepting the self-interested statements of a foreign mining company that wants to mine on public land, let’s make decisions based on facts and science. Let’s recognize what is at stake: Minnesota’s greatest natural area, with the cleanest water in America, and a major reason that people live, work and play in Stauber’s district.The Forest Service is now diligently completing the analysis. More than 270,000 citizens provided new comments. Stauber’s constituents want decisions based on facts and science — and values. Stauber’s derogatory comments and false allegations won’t overcome facts and science. The Forest Service analysis will provide a solid framework for judging HR 2794. Let’s use it.Becky Rom is the national chair of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters and a resident of Ely, Minn."
suffolknewsherald_2022_82,"Published 7:07 pm Friday, May 20, 2022ByStaff ReportsLaw enforcement is expected – unfairly, in our view – to have quick solutions when violent crime flares as it has in Suffolk in recent months.As much as we appreciate the resolve of the police chief and mayor to get it under control, we also acknowledge the complexity of the problem they are addressing, and urge patience from the citizenry.The truth is that the causes of street violence are mostly systemic and more effectively addressed on the front end than by police after a tragedy has occurred.Post-pandemic stress – compounded now by soaring inflation that has many families wondering whether they’ll make it to the next paycheck – surely is a factor in the recent crime wave. Two years of lockdowns and other disruptions to daily routines frayed nerves and fractured relationships. A sense of community – already under assault in a society that values technology over personal relationships – eroded further during COVID-19 as church and community activities ground to a halt. In many ways, we forgot how to get along.While we won’t second guess in this space the federal monetary assistance for families and businesses during the pandemic, most economists agree that the influx of cash was a major contributor to the highest inflation America has seen in a half-century. The cost of groceries and other essentials has strained household budgets to the point that many low-income people are looking for a way out – whether drugs or alcohol to ease their anguish or to make a quick buck. As has been the case for a long time, the illicit drug trade is a major driver of violence.That’s a lot for a community – and especially a police force – to get its arms around. We commend Police Chief Al Chandler for steps taken already, such as increased patrols in neighborhoods like East Washington Street, where much of the recent spate of homicides and other shootings has occurred. And Mayor Mike Duman, to his credit, has vowed that Chandler’s force will have the resources it needs to do its job, even if City Council must tap cash reserves.Still, taxpayers could never provide enough money to stop violence with officers on every street around the clock. The problem is far too deep. Our hope and prayer is for a collective healing of hardened hearts and a realization by its perpetrators that violence is never the answer to life’s problems.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_64,"For far too long, homelessness in Louisville has been a crisis, with an uneven government response — and, as a result, underfunded nonprofits — struggling to adequately address a serious and incredibly complex problem.Through the years, several pivotal nonprofits, too many to name, have been on the ground, working diligently to do everything possible. The government has provided some ideas, sprinkles of empathy and limited money to the problem, but it has also been incredibly volatile, coldly bulldozing numerous homeless camps, especially near tourist districts. Of course, government, like most things, isn’t a monolith, and there are people in office with dramatically varying intentions — some that truly care, some that are completely indifferent — which also makes galvanizing a big-splash, unified response very difficult, especially when budget money is tight.But,with the influx of American Rescue Plan funds, money isn’t that tight this year — and that big splash is happening, with a lot riding on it.The Hope Village — a government-funded safe outdoor space for homeless people that will house 40-50 people in tents — is scheduled to open before March 1.It will be run by the nonprofit The Hope Buss, and, other than shelter, Hope Village will provide food and resources to individuals in need at its location at 212 E. College St. in Old Louisville.But, the city’s $3 million investment in the safe outdoor space, which aims to meet people where they are, and offer an alternative to indoor shelters, is only the beginning of a planned city response to homelessness. Not only is the safe outdoor space important because it could help change people’s lives immediately, but it’s also the first piece of a multi-pronged solution — it could be a gleaming example about how significant investment, innovative solutions and a multi-year plan are the way forward.Inan end-of-the-year interview with Mayor Greg Fischer, he and I spoke about the city’s longterm response to homelessness in the city.“So, safe outdoor space is the first, and then transitional housing is the second and then permanent supportive housing and then more investment in affordable housing,” Fischer said. “So, that’s a big story from this past year. The significant amount of money that we’re able to dedicate to that area.”This is the opportunity the city has been looking for. Instead of the standarddo-what-we-can, sweep-the-rest-under-the-rug, rinse-and-repeat cycle, the city government has an incredible opportunity to make a real difference instead of what’s been a largely stagnant reaction.The safe outdoor space has already run into some issues. The mayor told me that closing while purchasing the property was difficult and there were some supply chain issues that resulted in delays on items like tents. He said that pushed back the original goal for an opening date by six to eight weeks.Those things are likely out of everyone’s control. But, now, as the The Hope Village eyes that March 1 goal, it’s important that this becomes smooth and efficient, helping people as soon as possible, and establishing a program we can be proud of as a city.If these initiatives work, and the money is followed by success, Louisville could be viewed as a leader in the nation. If they crumble, a lot of people are going to be left in the cold.Anything the city — and we as individuals — can do to help The Hope Buss and The Hope Village, we should.. ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_46,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Passengers are missing flights, unable to rebook passage to visit with friends and loved ones. Thousands of pieces of luggage remain strewn about airport lobbies. Airline and airport employees still struggle with the anger and frustration of customers.Thousands of flights, particularly those connected with Southwest Airlines, have been canceled. Southwest is the biggest carrier by far at Kansas City International Airport, and it has faced its share of chaos.If a flight is canceled, travelers are entitled to refunds. However, delays — even long ones — are a different issue. “Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers waiting at the airport; there are no federal requirements,” the U.S. Department of Transportation says on its website. “Airlines have a lot of discretion in how they respond to problems,” DOT says. “While you do have certain rights as a passenger, your demands for compensation will probably be subject to negotiation.”That compensation should, in part, be a full apology for the debacle, and a complete investigation into what went wrong.The Christmas weekend is a naturally heavy-travel period, which provides a partial explanation. At the same time, the airlines could not have been unaware of travel demand: Almost all tickets are purchased in advance. If flights were deliberately overbooked, the public should know.Analysts say Southwest may be particularly vulnerable to disruptions. The airline’s apparent reluctance to reschedule fliers on competing airlines may have played a part as well.The Department of Transportation said Monday it will look into Southwest’s decision-making. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan,” the department said in a tweet.Anyone who had to rent a hotel room, or car, because of any airline’s poor planning or response should be fully compensated.There are a few caveats. The cost to travelers over the past week is critical, but it’s less important than safety. No lives should ever be risked in order to meet a travel schedule. It’s possible some problems were caused by prudence.At the same time, airlines should show their plans for such contingencies. Did Southwest’s aggressive scheduling contribute to the debacle? Should the airline have intervened sooner? Are backup plans adequate? Has the airline failed to modernize, as its unions have alleged?Do airlines need to improve customer relations? Should crisis plans be revised, and more people hired? Should airports do more to prepare for such events, and provide more services for stranded passengers?In all of this, passengers will look to the federal government for answers. They should get them. At the same time, the nation decided decades ago to essentially deregulate air travel, making it harder for the government to oversee airlines’ decision-making.Deregulation made flying cheaper. It helped create alternatives for travelers, including Southwest Airlines. It made service to big cities easier and more convenient.But the concentration on the bottom line, rather than meeting public service requirements, has diminished the quality of air travel.."
suffolknewsherald_2022_273,"Published 6:40 pm Friday, September 9, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThe meaning of this date changed forever 21 years ago. Anyone who lived through it can attest that the horrible events of that day altered much more than the way we look at the calendar.In so many ways, there is before Sept. 11, 2001, and after. As the before continues to recede further into the past, we are always compelled to remember the loss and lasting impact of that day for all that has happened after.There was shared horror at the largest loss of life to a terrorist attack on American soil, followed by a shared loss for those who lost their lives in the attack, gave their lives trying to save others and the thousands who were left behind with their own personal grief. There was also a shared defiance to a distorted ideology and the ideologues who acted on it.The operative word in all of that was “shared.”That indefinable feeling of common cause dissipated quickly. It was a matter of days before it was carved up by divergent political interests and translated into appeals for wars we are still fighting. And fights we are still waging with each other.There is no denying that 9/11 shaped the way everyone who remembers it sees the world.The attacks and the horror of the casualties brought home many of the conflicts that had been raging in other parts of the world. We lost a sense of security that seems even more illusory today. There are dangers that must be confronted and serious arguments worth having about how to do so.Hoping we can resolve ourselves to a more unified, or at least less divisive, approach to solving our foreign and domestic policy problems may be overly optimistic. But the bright ideals of selfless heroism shown by Americans on our darkest day, and the unqualified solidarity on display in the days after, are still relevant and worth striving for.When you remember the day the world changed, don’t forget that it revealed something good in all of us.

minnpost_2022_135,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In a Sept. 9, 2021 email to the Uptown Association and other parties, Interim Public Works Director Brette Hjelle stated in defense of Public Works’ recommended Hennepin Avenue designs that, “Our streets will be designed to address a climate emergency by emphasizing low or no carbon travel. “Our streets will add protection for people walking and bicycling (and provide space for other important corridor amenities and features such as greening.”Public Works has never tried to answer the question of whether its recommended design advances these goals or moves in the other direction. The clear answer is Public Works’ recommended design moves in the other direction from these goals.Climate changePublic Works’ design will increase carbon emissions. U.S. Department of Transportation data shows that urban transit produces greater carbon emissions per passenger mile than cars. Locally, the Metropolitan Council 2040 draft transportation plan Table 12 shows that its proposed bus-rapid-transit will increase total on-road mobile source emissions including automobiles in 2040. Thus, Public Works’ design will result in increased emissions from bus-rapid-transit as well delayed cars idling on the avenue and detouring through neighborhoods.Bike and pedestrian safetyPublic Works’ sidewalk designs along Hennepin Avenue will increase bicycle and pedestrian accidents and injuries. By removing parking, the design sets up Hennepin Avenue as a freeway with expected higher speeds since it ignores the recommendations in “designing roads that guide drivers to choose safer speeds” as cited in the MnDOT Traffic Safety Fundamentals Handbook. The two-way bikeway design next to a sidewalk can also be expected to increase bicycle and pedestrian accidents and injuries according to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety studies. Public Work’s touted sidewalk curb extensions are shown on side streets instead of for crossing the busier and wider Hennepin Avenue where they are most needed.GreenspaceMinneapolis Public Works’ use of city plans and goals to justify a flawed design for Hennepin Avenue is clearly not appropriate. Public Works needs to push the reset button and provide a new design that will be a win-win for the avenue and the city’s goals.Tom Fletcher isa 30-plus year owner and manager of vintage apartments and commercial properties on Hennepin Avenue and a City of Minneapolis Lowry Hill Special Service District advisory board member."
minnpost_2022_31,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Conservatives long have argued that ideas motivate people and win political struggles.Progressives tend to see this as hot air blown by plutocrats and their minions. Yet none other than John Maynard Keynes wrote, “I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.” There is plenty of evidence that he was right and that liberals’ widespread commitment to a materialist theory of political change is wrong.Progressives have also been wrong about tactics. I’m a Bernie Sanders Democrat, but since Joe Biden became president I’ve been impressed with the acumen of moderate House Democrats. U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Democrat of Virginia, complained of Biden, “Nobody elected him to be FDR.” Maybe a few historians visited the White House and told Biden otherwise, as some have claimed. If so, Spanberger is a better historian. The Democrats lost House seats in 2020 and managed a 50–50 split in the Senate. This is far from the huge Congressional majorities that Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson enjoyed during their presidencies. The House Progressive Caucus was convinced they had “leverage” over moderates and could hold a bipartisan infrastructure bill hostage to the mono-partisan Build Back Better (BBB legislation. They were wrong. U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, another moderate Democrat, criticized what she called this “ill-fated effort to gain leverage over members of their own party.”The Progressive Caucus may have imagined itself as a counterpart to the GOP’s Freedom Caucus, which has repeatedly wreaked havoc through its members’ refusal to support necessary legislation. However, the comparison is inapt. Conservatives sometimes embargo important bills because they don’t care if the government fulfills many functions that others support. Some on the right will even hope that dysfunctional government helps their cause by damaging popular faith in the public sector. They can ditch legislative negotiations in blasé fashion.Progressives can’t do the same with such ease. As it turned out, they largely supported the infrastructure bill with no promises about BBB, which remains on hold. This was not the foolish bargain some will maintain. Progressive threats to kill the infrastructure bill by withholding votes made sense only if one believes that moderate Democrats craved that infrastructure bill so much that they would have agreed to tie it explicitly to BBB rather than get nothing. However, faced with that choice, some moderates would have walked away, enhanced their political brands with many suburban voters, and left progressives – and the American people who needed the components funded in these bills – with nothing.In fact, moderates like Spanberger and Murphy had been won over by progressive policy arguments. They were going to vote for BBB. Two Democratic Senators blocked it. Tactical leverage from progressives did not produce the surprising progressivism that appeared among a great many moderates.What did? Decades of policy arguments played the biggest role, along with evidence of the need for the components of both bills. The overarching theses that government must fund vital public needs and also support households directly amid seemingly endless economic and social turmoil have made great headway among Democrats. So has dogged empirical research from policy wonks about the effectiveness of specific programs in addressing the country’s genuine needs. The days when President Ronald Reagan won huge national majorities – and drove a wedge into the Democratic Party – by saying that government was the problem, or when President Bill Clinton announced the era of big government was over, are gone.Consider the signature fiscal measures signed by the past three Democratic presidents.Clinton’s Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 cut the federal government’s spending by $255 billion. Democrats held a 56–44 margin in the Senate, and the bill passed with 50 votes, all Democrats. The mania for deficit reduction at the time bore little connection to the recession the country had just experienced.President Barack Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 created new spending of $831 billion. Democrats held a 58–42 majority in the Senate, and the bill passed with 61 votes. This time, more sensibly, deficit spending addressed a major economic bust.President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 increased spending by $1.9 trillion. Democrats, with 50 Senators, passed this with no GOP support.Then, Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act added $1.2 trillion of spending. This time, 19 GOP Senators joined all 50 of their Democratic colleagues in support.These 2021 measures addressed real needs, but the economy was already poised for a rebound from a peculiar pandemic-induced recession.As well, 48 of 50 Democratic Senators and virtually all House Democrats were willing to support at least another $1.7 trillion on BBB.Must persuasive ideas address material realities? Absolutely. Traumas including the COVID-19 pandemic and much else, as well as the worsening climate catastrophe, demand major responses. But such responses might take several forms, not all of them progressive. Material realities do not in themselves cause predetermined, coherent shifts in thinking, and when patterns of social thought do change, they will not be damaged seriously by passing events.The Democratic Party, now led by a largely united set of leaders who support a cohesive suite of reasonably progressive policies, regularly secures majorities of the national vote. Its weaknesses in small-town and rural America and with less-educated white voters (overlapping constituencies , weaknesses amplified in their effect by the overrepresentation of such areas in national and state legislatures, constitute its key problem. Democrats can’t make gains among such voters with leverage or any other kind of pressure tactics. They can only do so with words and images, both of which convey ideas.That Democrats have achieved so much recently on such thin margins is remarkable. Progressives should recognize that persistent argument and persuasion is their proven path to meaningful change.Doug Rossinow is professor of history at Metropolitan State University."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_11,"The decision by the House committee investigating last year’s riot at the U.S. Capitol to refer Donald Trump for criminal prosecution was unsurprising. The committee had spent nearly a year and a half building its case, which it presented in focused detail at its final hearing on Monday. Issuing criminal referrals to the Department of Justice was within the panel’s mandate. It was a lamentable move nonetheless.There’s no question that the committee — made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans — found evidence of abominable conduct by Trump that day. The former president bears responsibility for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, encouraging a mob to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory, and refusing to act while his supporters laid violent siege to the Capitol. Over the course of its investigation, the committee interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses, including many of Trump’s closest aides, his son-in-law and his eldest daughter.Among the wealth of details the probe uncovered were first-hand accounts of the former president’s attempts to pressure his vice president, Mike Pence, to reject the Electoral College slates of several swing states and instead declare Trump the victor. Even as rioters roamed the halls of Congress on Jan. 6 chanting, “Hang Mike Pence” — coming, the committee revealed, within 40 feet of Pence’s security detail — Trump tweeted that the vice president “didn’t have the courage … to protect our country.”By any standard, such actions were an affront to the Constitution and to the rule of law. They clearly render Trump unfit for another term. Yet whether they merit criminal prosecution is another matter. The committee unanimously recommended that Trump and several associates be charged with four separate felonies, including obstructing an official proceeding of Congress and inciting, assisting, or providing aid and comfort to an insurrection.These are serious charges. In addition to potentially leading to jail time, they could in theory bar Trump from holding federal office again. But the referrals themselves were entirely symbolic. They carry no legal weight and will have little practical effect. It will be up to Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed last month to oversee the Justice Department’s investigations into Trump’s post-election conduct, to determine if any indictments are warranted.Given that reality, it’s fair to question the wisdom of recommending that the former president be prosecuted. The referral has further politicized the question of Trump’s guilt and made it easier for his defenders to smear Smith’s probe as a partisan vendetta. It risks elevating Trump in the eyes of Republican voters, at just the moment when many seem prepared to cast him aside. Perhaps most concerning, it risks setting a dangerous precedent: A future in which congressional investigations are routinely weaponized to prosecute political enemies now seems all too likely.For better or worse, that ship has sailed. Moving forward, it’s imperative that Smith move quickly to make a final determination of Trump’s legal culpability. The kind of endless dithering that has characterized similar investigations in the past — from Kenneth Starr’s to Robert Mueller’s — will only worsen partisan division, exacerbate voters’ mistrust of government, and distract from more urgent problems. With the stakes so high, transparency and decisiveness must be the overriding priorities.The House committee has done an admirable job in documenting Trump’s reprehensible conduct on Jan. 6. The faster the country can put those sordid events in the past, the better.— Bloomberg OpinionThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

leoweekly_2022_33,"In the little-discussed sister city to my hometown, located in a lesser-known republic on an obscure continent, the number of hospitals has become a problem. Not because there are too few, but because there are too many. So many, in fact, that nearly every building on every street is now owned and operated by the republic’s massive medical-industrial complex.It was not always so. Like most cities, this one started with a single, modest hospital. When the city’s population surged to 100,000, two more hospitals were built — one in the east and one in the west, so as to stay just within the recommended beds-to-people ratio. And all was well for a while.What city officials did not account for was the toll that the population boom would take on the water system. More and more people, especially new immigrants and tourists, became seriously ill from drinking (or bathing in the city’s practically untreated water.The mayor promised a quick solution. But mayors only have so much power in that lesser-known republic. The city council came to an intractable disagreement, at first on the methods and means to treat the water, and later as to whether the water should even be treated at all.The one thing everyone could agree upon was that more hospital beds were needed for all those made sick by the tainted water. Twenty new hospitals were commissioned and built within a month, with plans to build 20 more in the following decade, in anticipation of continued population growth and ever-more-frequent hospitalizations.And so black sludge continued to run from the faucets of our sister city. Residents adjusted to this new way of life: they boiled, they imported, they avoided. Newcomers and passers-through were advised to do the same. As a result, the number of hospitalizations due to poisoned water decreased over time instead of increasing as the city had expected.This presented the city council with a new problem: The hospitals were not full enough. Imagine the embarrassment at having set up so many beds, at such great expense, and having practically all of them empty! But rather than repurposing the surplus hospitals, or halting construction on the new ones, elected officials passed ordinances mandating extended hospitalization in the case of serious illness or injury, whether it was warranted or not, and short hospital stays for even the most minor of scrapes and bruises. Paper cuts, for example, were rebranded “cellulose fiber lacerations,” and added to the schedule of wounds for which hospitalization was required.In just a few weeks, the hospitals were so full that the city council commissioned another one hundred medical buildings to be constructed before the end of the year, with another one hundred planned for the following year. The city began using public properties adjacent to existing hospitals to increase bed capacity, so the parks, the schools, the clerk’s offices, the courthouses and even the jails were eventually part-whatever-they-already-were, part-hospital. Medical facilities spilled into the private sector as well, as churches became rehab services during the week, restaurants doubled as dialysis centers and so on.This resulted in considerable confusion. To make matters worse, a noise ordinance to quell the incessant monitorial beeping, formerly heard on every street corner at all hours of the day and night, resulted in a total ban on windows for all medical facilities, so that one could not tell what was just another hospital and what was something else. This was nice for a while; if one is not sick, one would rather not have to see or hear or think about sick people.But soon the creep of infirmaries affected more than just the sick or injured. By honest mistake, taxi drivers dropped people trying to go to a hair salon or the airport at one of the city’s three dozen ICUs. Those people were hooked to an IV until new arrangements could be made. Hospitalizing oneself eventually became the default response to every complication, medical or otherwise, because it was the only possible response. Residents would visit the emergency room to resolve tax liens, set up a new TV or sew a missing button on a jacket.The most remarkable thing about the problem of too many hospitals is that it is no longer seen as a problem at all. After a generation or two, no one noticed anything strange about existing in a place where hospitalization was the go-to solution to every ailment, real or perceived, of any quality or duration. To the residents of our sister city, everything is and was always normal; nothing has ever been out of sorts. •. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_265,"Published 6:00 pm Tuesday, September 20, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardElections have consequences, it’s been said. Or, depending on one’s perspective, rewards.Thus, it should come as no surprise that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has rolled back major changes in Virginia public schools’ accommodation of transgender students. Those changes, including a 2020 state law requiring school districts to adopt the state Department of Education’s “model” policy or something stronger, gave power to students themselves to decide, for example, which bathroom to use and what pronoun they prefer to be called.While area school districts, including Suffolk, mostly fell in line with the state law, many local schools across the state simply ignored the law. Then came the 2021 gubernatorial election, in which parental rights on controversial social policies in schools became one of the flashpoints that fueled Youngkin’s stunning win over former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe.As often happens in a changing society, activists got ahead of public sentiment, much less consensus, and the then-Democratic executive and legislative branches codified controversial changes. Voters, when given the opportunity, pushed back, in this case siding with Youngkin when he said that parents still should have a voice in school policies on cultural issues like transgender policy and social justice initiatives.The state Department of Education last week released a revised policy that vows to protect transgender students from bullying and other forms of harassment and discrimination but mostly puts decision-making on things like pronouns and bathroom usage back in the hands of their parents.The “Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools” says local school boards must adopt a slate of new policies for the treatment of transgender students. The document says that “schools should attempt to accommodate students with distinctive needs, including any student with a persistent and sincere belief that his or her gender differs from his or her sex.”The Virginia Mercury reports that the new policies require parental approval for any changes to students’ “names, nicknames, and/or pronouns,” direct schools to keep parents “informed about their children’s well-being,” specify that student participation in activities and athletics shall be based on sex and state that “students shall use bathrooms that correspond to his or her sex, except to the extent that federal law otherwise requires.”Instead of a new, radically different directive every time a new party is in power (in other words, every two to four years in Virginia , we’d prefer to put the power for sensitive policymaking entirely in the hands of local school boards, which are most directly accountable to the communities they serve. Otherwise, schools will become mere pawns in a partisan power struggle, distracted from their core mission of educating students.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_4,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“Everybody can be a refugee. It only takes one of two things, natural disaster or man-made.”Walking about the downtown streets of Mogadishu Somalia, this was the saying plastered on the United Nations office for refugees in the ’80s. I would stand there and reflect on that statement and I could never imagine myself actually being one. I am heartbroken to see what the Ukrainian people are going through at this time. The unnecessary suffering they are subjected to because of a preventable conflict that truly has nothing to do with the Ukrainian civilians. The drums of war are beating loudly in Europe. Dangerous rhetoric and movements of deadly weapons and troops are at their highest levels since 1945. Considering the nuclear war chest in Europe, there is no room for error. Just one mistake can cause a significantly disastrous situation for all.World War III can start easier than we all think it could. You could say all wars have come unexpectedly, unasked for. We look at World War I beginning with the sudden assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. With the drop of a pin, the world had seen the bloodiest conflict it had ever experienced. World War II began with the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, soon after the allies joined the fight to fulfill their treaty obligations. Ending with the loss of life and bloodshed exceeding even more than World War I.It is innocent people that carry the burdens of the war. The result of this conflict has already resulted in a tremendous loss of life and injury. This includes the destruction of important infrastructures such as hospitals, schools, and homes. War is an easy thing to start but a hard problem to end. War does not come alone accompanied by, chaos, torture and rape. The most damage done by war is to the mental health of its victims who deal with warplanes, bombs, ethnic cleansing and mob justice. All kinds of horrors are inflicted on innocent people, especially children. There are still places in the world where children get hurt by landmines while playing innocently, the result of war many decades ago.Let me share with you what I witnessed in the horrors of war. When I was running for my life as a war refugee from Somalia in January 1991, the drums of war echoed loudly but nobody heard our suffering. It seems as if there can only be one major tragedy allotted time in a given time frame. At the time of the civil war in Somalia, the U.S. was busy putting together coalitions from Europe, the Middle East, and other parts of the world, its focus on Iraq and Kuwait. On the 24-hour news cycle, CNN and other news outlets did not have the time to notice our suffering. In a time before social media, news sources were limited.As I fled the country these were the four people I saw. One, the elderly, some of them having been physically carried on the backs of their children or other family members. Number two are people who are ill, some of them ran away from their hospital beds or had family members carry and help them walk, but many were left in the destroyed buildings. The third example is pregnant women, some of whom were in their eighth or ninth months of pregnancy and still they had to fight for their lives. Lastly, the children who are young and vulnerable, not understanding the violence around them.Everyone suffers immensely in wartime. Now imagine being in these four vulnerable groups with no mental security, no food, and no water. There is no doubt in my mind that they will carry the scars of war for the rest of their lives. When I see Ukrainian people fleeing today, the images of these four groups come flooding back to me. I see Ukrainian families including children gathering in the underground train stations to hide from bombs and warplanes, and it gives me goosebumps.Europe has a vast and long history of violent conflicts. From religious wars and genocide to gulags and concentration camps. As well as torture chambers, ethnic cleansing, and a dangerously high level of nationalism. As we saw in the Bosnian war as late as the end of the 20th century, there is no guarantee that the horrors we promised “never again ” in 1945 might happen again.If World War III does happen in Europe, it will spread all over the world and no place will be safe. I urge the world leaders and every citizen of the world to work to stop the suffering of the Ukrainian people and prevent more disasters. We must stop the war as soon as possible before we let unnecessary harm and suffering be inflicted on the world.Mahamoud Wardere is a former war refugee who now lives in Minneapolis."
minnpost_2022_27,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The dispute over abortion is often framed as a struggle to “protectlife” versus “protect reproductiveand sexual freedom.” The Supreme Court’s likely elimination of the constitutional protection for abortion rights this June will not end this debate. Despite the suggestions of the Mississippi Solicitor General and certain Supreme Court Justices during theDobbsv. Jackson Women’s Healthoral argumentthis past December, controversies over abortion will not cease ifRoe v. Wadeis overturned. Rather, they will be decided state by state. They will rage everywhere, including here.The positions of the pro-life and pro-choice proponents appear intractable. But if we take a closer look at the ends that each camp seeks, and also consider the evidence that exists on how best to obtain them, there are clear legal solutions that should satisfy all sides, including first steps the Minnesota Legislature can take this term.As all parents know, babies are utterly helpless and dependent on parents to love them and care for their every need. What happens when babies are unwanted? We know fromstudies of unwanted infantswho were institutionally fed and housedbut otherwise neglected that such deprivation, “can have a profound and lasting psychological impact despite subsequent environmental enrichment in well resourced and supportive families.” Children neglected in the home are also more likely to suffer lasting negative psychosocial consequences, including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and insecure relationships.There are surprisingly few studies examining the effects of unintended pregnancy on children and mothers. But we do know from the Turnaway Study, which compares long-term outcomes in families with babies born to women who were denied an abortion versus those who were able to obtain one, that both poor maternal bonding and impoverishment were significantly more common in families where a desired abortion was denied than where an abortion was obtained and there was a subsequent pregnancy. Women denied abortions were more likely to remain in violent relationships than those who obtained a wanted abortion. They experienced significantly more financial distress than the group that obtained an abortion, were no more likely to live with a male partner, and were more likely to live alone with their child. Diminished economic status also impacted older, existing children of women who were unable to access a desired abortion.The only person who should be permitted to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the person who will bear primary responsibility to love, raise, and care for the resulting child. That is the pregnant person. No activist, religious institution, court, or state can make such a consequential decision for a competent adult.We can best ensure that babies have loving homes and do not suffer from undue emotional or economic deprivation by taking several important steps. We know that providing everyone with the tools they need to plan and support their pregnancies – including abortions where necessary – result in wanted children with healthier starts. We know that providing hassle-free financial support to low-income families yield better outcomes for children. We know that both children raised in thriving, low-violence communities and their parents do better than those in neighborhoods and homes plagued by violence. We know that providing children with access to a high quality public education can yield upward social mobility, and that working parents need subsidized, high quality childcare for their well-being and that of their children.The Minnesota Legislature can start by enacting SF 731/HF 259, theProtect Reproductive Options Act, to put Minnesotans in control of their own reproductive futures. It should also expand the Working Family Credit, increase child care assistance, and undertake significant police and public safety reforms to help reduce violence against our communities, among other measures. These steps will help support the flourishing of our communities and children, without imposing one way of life on everyone else. These are steps we should all support.Laura Hermer is a professor of Law at Mitchell Hamline School of Law."

OWL is a full-spectrum human sexuality curriculum, created by the United Church of Christ (UCC and the Unitarian Universalist Association.As an adolescent, I went through OWL at my church. It was fun, informative and empowering.Now, as a staff member at the same church, I lead seventh- through ninth-graders through OWL. We give students accurate information and help them process it in a safe and loving space with peers and trusted adults.Ensuring youth have access to age-appropriate information as they mature is critically important. It helps them become sexually healthy people who feel good about their bodies and build positive, equitable, loving relationships.Students also thought about the challenges someone would face if they were to have a child while still a teen.Data showproviding young people with accurate information, a safe environment and contraception when needed is the best way to decrease unintended pregnancy.I believe the overturning ofRoe v. Wadeis a catastrophic mistake. Forced pregnancy is a violation of bodily rights — a right that Christianity values highly. The government forcing any person to carry a pregnancy to term against their will deprives them of bodily autonomy and is thus violence. It also fails to recognize an individual’s God-given moral agency.Abortion as reproductive health care must be available and accessible, with optional mental health support/counseling. It must be unencumbered by waiting periods. It must be strictly private, and free of charge. The patient’s safety, dignity and decision-making authority must be ensured.I am proud to be part of the UCC because our denomination speaks clearly at the national, state and local level about human rights and personal freedoms, including reproductive choice.

leoweekly_2022_25,"I wrote a story called “Sunset in America” for my Medium page a couple of years ago. I was writing in support of the blossoming protests against police violence that were happening in Louisville and then across the nation. As we approach the Fourth of July, I want to quote myself and expand on this idea because the energy of those days, is needed now as much as it was then.“To quote the asshole fire chief who let 11 black people including children burn in a Philadelphia building in 1985, ‘Let the fire burn.’ Let the riots and the protests continue. Fuck it up, kids. If you march in peace, march in peace, but I’m not going to tell anyone how to be angry. To remake a nation we have to begin by destroying the symbols of its empire. America is a nation founded and consistently changed when its citizens decide enough is enough and begin to chip away at the systems that have held too many of us under its foot for so long. This has never happened without a riot.”This time it isn’t simply police violence that needs to shift in America, but America that needs to shift. From top to bottom, side to side, this nation is due for a reckoning. It is due to be remade — from the people who hold the seats of power to the documents that govern that power. This nation is on life support because too many fail to see that it’s a place that does not need resuscitation. It needs to die of natural causes.With repeated mass shootings, continued police violence (and inaction , inflation caused by greedy speculation and a former president who thought printing money was an answer to not having enough, the fact is: America is and has been ailing for a long time.The country that we want and deserve hasn’t been born yet and it is our collective duty to create that nation that really lives up to what “America” idealizes itself to be… but how?We have to stop holding on to the past, and look toward what comes next. Period. The past may hold some value, but some ideas from the past are not serving us well now. Certainly, the Second Amendment is one of those areas that has been misused and misinterpreted for political gain and now citizens of this country are dying because of it.The Constitution, along with our attitudes about guns and the acceptability and inevitability of death need to be changed. We aren’t safer because of the Second Amendment, we’re so far from safe, in fact.Referring back to my Medium piece, I really think it is time to say:“Goodbye, America the Empire. We really do want America, the Beautiful but that can’t happen with a piece of paper and no crayons. This nation needs to make good on the promises it made to all of us.”I’m not sure what else to say or how to impress upon anyone that the pace of America’s decline is exhausting and the only way to stop it is to change how we do this experiment we call The United States of America. I’m tired of yelling at Republicans. I’m tired of yelling about Jesus freaks who don’t truly follow or care about Jesus’ message. What good does any of that do?More than any of that, I’m tired of reading in the news about mass amounts of babies, teens or elderly people being shot to death by individuals who’ve been reared in a culture that says guns are the glory and to the gun we give our unabashed allegiance. We can’t blame mental illness for the insanity and result of gun worship in this country.So, on the anniversary of our nation’s freedom, I propose that we stop yelling in our echo chambers, stop trying to change each others mind and start trying to change this country into one that we would all like to live in and leave to our children so that they may be safe, loved and, theoretically, live to a happy and ripe old age.I’m not naive, I know that’s not coming without battles, but, if we’re going to have it out, let’s do it so that we can move on.Let America burn so that the seeds of rebirth have room to sprout. •.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_100,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Playing host nation to a World Cup is a highly coveted accolade; for all and sundry who make up the citizenry, this means nation building, infrastructure, job creation, renewed patriotism and lasting change long after the closing ceremonies.Qatar didn’t need the face-lift, but the nation’s leaders recognized the huge stakes when they beat out Australia, South Korea, Japan and the United States to become the first Arab nation to host the games. If done right, Qatar will create an arguably priceless legacy, but if mishandled, it may become an example many Arab nations cite as to why the games are inherently difficult for their nations to host.No matter the case and despite the condemnation that has befallen the would-be oasis in the desert given its religion-backed policies, as the FIFA World Cup looms, the country has come to play.Untold billions of dollars have been spent on developing venues with best-in-class architecture and environmental practices so as to meet the nation’s promise that its World Cup will be carbon-neutral.This is part and parcel of the infrastructure development strategy deployed years ahead of this month’s games. Qatar built seven of its eight World Cup stadiums, a new metro system, new roads, new high-rises and the Emerald City-like Lusail for the games themselves and to allow for easy and environmentally friendly transportation between the venues.Karim Elgendy, a fellow at Chatham House, a London think tank, who previously was a climate consultant for the World Cup, said Qatar’s efforts at “greening” the tournament “show a positive trend for a sporting event.”Of course, if the results are not precisely carbon-neutral, would we expect anything other than mass scrutiny, given the profoundly stark scope placed on the nation of 2.9 million, the majority of whom are immigrants?Then there is the sensitive topic of minority rights: The country’s reputation took a heavy hit when the conditions of its migrant workers came to light and entered the world’s social consciousness. Minority communities are calling for greater tolerance; their protests must not be ignored before or after the games.However, we should recall the Qatar National Vision 2030, which calls for a progressive rolling back of many historically stringent policies. Notably, the World Cup in Qatar will be the first to feature female referees.The World Cup didn’t motivate Qatar’s evolution, but the games will emblematize a challenging commitment by a historically religious community.If Qatar succeeds or fails, it will do so publicly.Like it or not, modern Qatar is on the rise. The country is now an international transit hub, an export juggernaut of oil and gas in a seismically shifting geo-commercial environment and home to the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East.It’s easy to condemn a Middle East goliath.What does it say about an international community that decries a lack of tolerance but shows none for a culture that seeks to change its ways for the sake of being a good actor in the world? Is the Western world revealing its bias in condemning a Muslim nation for its ambitions?As the country opens its doors for the world to see and the games commence, they will be a spectacle, yes. But one with ramifications — simply put, this year’s World Cup is too big to fail."

minnpost_2022_70,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“Boston is bigger than Minneapolis.”I didn’t realize that this short statement would cause someone to respond defensively by mentioning that Minneapolis is definitely bigger than Boston. I disagreed with the statement, but once again received resistance. I eventually stopped trying to argue and later in the month searched to confirm who was right and voila, the statistics show that Boston is bigger than Minneapolis.I bring up this conversation not because I care about whether or not people believe that Boston is bigger than Minneapolis, but because I’ve noticed this common trend of Minnesotans becoming overly defensive if someone criticizes the state. When someone mentions problems with Minnesota, instead of people thinking, “That’s a good point. As a state, we need to work on that,” people are quick to argue and give an objectively inaccurate statement to defend the state. This pride and allegiance to Minnesota mirrors American nationalism and unfortunately blinds people from seeing the need for change.Is part of this mentality due to the fact that many people have been in the state since they were very young, or because of the huge levels of segregation preventing people from interacting with people from different backgrounds and seeing the inequities among communities? Or is it due to Minnesota Nice, which keeps people in this utopia of believing that since everyone is nice, everything is OK? I think it’s a combination of all these different factors, but it all ties to Minnesota’s culture.I have a theory that although change is slow everywhere, it is unnecessarily slow in Minnesota because of the culture. Examining Minnesota’s statistics and history also reveals this problem especially when it involves racial and health equity. In 2015, Jamar Clark was murdered, then in 2016, Philando Castile was murdered and then, once again in 2020, George Floyd was murdered — all by police officers in the Twin Cities. Additionally, Blue Cross and Blue Shield released an article in May 2021 titled “Racial and health inequities have been a part of Minnesota’s ‘normal.’ That needs to change.”See the pattern? All of this evidence proves that the culture of Minnesota is rooted in white supremacy and racism and that Minnesota is in desperate need of change. So, how should Minnesota move forward in 2022?Second, people who have lived in Minnesota for the majority of their lives should visit other countries and live in other states for a certain period of time. Experiencing different cultures and meeting people from other backgrounds can truly shape one’s viewpoint and can break down preconceived biases.If this option is not financially feasible, then long-time Minnesotans should also make the effort of meeting people from different backgrounds by visiting immigrant communities, moving to diverse instead of racially homogenous neighborhoods or even volunteering at places with diverse populations. These small interactions can alter your own viewpoint which can trickle down to how you act at your workplace, what statements you make to your colleagues from marginalized backgrounds and what policies you speak up against in your workplace. Your little steps can be part of the overall change in Minnesota’s culture and that is very impactful.Current students and professionals in Minnesota should also be encouraged to pursue careers focused more on action toward equity versus denial and complacency regarding issues in Minnesota. There are phenomenal role models in Minnesota doing work toward racial and health equity like Dr. Brittany Lewis, a community-engaged qualitative scholar focused on equity-based action, Dr. Rachel Hardeman, who began the Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity, and Mr. Justin Terrell, the executive director of the Minnesota Justice Research Center.Overall, my role is not to change a culture, but I share this because I’m worried that the fire from 2020 is slowly dying and will eventually leave Minnesota in the same position as pre-2020.So, as we enter 2022, I want to encourage those of us who live in Minnesota to be more honest of the reality that Minnesota’s culture is blinding people against pursuing equity and change in this state. It’s time for a cultural shift and for more people to be eager for change. Without this eagerness, Minnesota will forever be stuck in this endless cycle of denial and defensiveness instead of constructive criticism and action because the latter is the future toward equity and change in Minnesota in 2022 and onward.Ayomide Ojebuoboh is an MD/PhD student at the University of Minnesota."

leoweekly_2022_72,"The 2022 Kentucky General Assembly session reflects many other political situations: There’s a decent amount of room for opportunity, and even more room for failure.By the time you read this, the redistricting process will most likely be well under way, and that will be a lightning quick, shadily quiet and absolutely partisan move by the Republican supermajority, right as the session begins on Jan. 4. There will also inevitably be childlike grandstanding, toxic culture wars waged, gross dog-whistling and shows of power from certain factions within the supermajority. Arguments about critical race theory and COVID will happen, and abortion rights will come under attack. This won’t be a session that brings people together.On the borderline bright side, it will almost certainly be more unified than the special session back in September, where the GOP-dominated legislatureessentially inherited control of the state’s coronavirus response after a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling shifted policymaking power. The special session was pretty much one big middle finger to the Gov. Andy Beshear, who angered the Republicans via his executive orders early on in the pandemic. It was about GOP payback, and tearing down what previously was built, instead of carving out the future of public health during a rapidly-changing crisis. It was messy, and the state’s COVID numbers are not exactly very good right now.So, is there room for a little bit of optimism for this session — even very, very cautious optimism?There — and I could very easily want to Sharpie this line out of every single issue of LEO that gets delivered this week — probably is.That’s mostly because the state has money to spend. Kentucky is holding onto a $1.1 billion fiscal year budget surplus and is looking forward to the incoming American Rescue Plan Act funds. And, this year, the General Assemblywill pass its first two-year budget since before the pandemic.At a Louisville Forum event addressing the session back in December, House Minority Leader Joni Jenkins (D-Louisville — who appeared alongside her Republican peer Sen. Paul Hornback — expressed some positive thoughts, saying the budget could keep the session focused.“It tends to take a lot of discussion and air out of the room,” Jenkins said of the budget. “And it is a good year for us because revenues are up, there is lots of one-time money, but for every dollar there’s been probably three or four people asking for that dollar. There’s lots of hard decisions to make.”A lot is riding on this 60-day session. Some of it’s going to be chaotic, some of it’s going to be depressing, some of it’s going to be a blatant waste of time that doesn’t serve anyone, but there has to be some common ground during a long session with a decent chunk of money. Let’s address tornado relief, poverty, equity, essential worker shortages, infrastructure, child care and economic development. Let’s create prosperity for everyone, and look to the future. Let’s move forward. We have the resources. But, at the end of the day, we have to hold out hope that a volatile supermajority gives more than it takes.. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_94,"Published 6:33 pm Friday, May 6, 2022ByStaff ReportsIt’s getting little attention in a seemingly uneventful election year locally, but Suffolk voters have a say this spring in arguably one of the most important races in the entire country: the Republican primary to decide who will oppose U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., for the 2nd Congressional District seat.Early voting began Friday for the June 21 primary, in which four candidates are running.Inclusion in the newly drawn, Tidewater-centric 2nd District as a result of redistricting after the 2020 Census is a big change for Suffolk voters, who’ve been divvied up for the past decade between the Peninsula-oriented 3rd Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, and the Richmond-centric 4th Congressional District, represented by Rep. Donald McEachin.Both of those districts were solidly Democratic, while the new 2nd District will be among the handful of battleground districts nationwide that determine which party controls the House of Representatives starting in 2023. Put simply, the stakes couldn’t be higher.State Sen. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, is considered by most pundits to be the favorite to secure the GOP nomination, but political newcomer Jarome Bell is doing his best to add some intrigue. Tommy Altman, an Air Force veteran, businessman and minister, and Andy Baan, a Navy veteran and former prosecutor, round out the Republican field.The 2nd District GOP race gained some national prominence last weekend when Bell traveled to Florida and made an appearance on stage with former President Donald Trump. Bell used the opportunity to declare Kiggans a “RINO,” or “Republican in Name Only,” one of Trump’s favorite descriptions for party officials who’ve been disloyal to him.Trump stopped short of endorsing Bell, so all eyes will be on Mar-a-Lago over the next couple of weeks to see whether the former president picks a candidate in the Hampton Roads race. Kiggans has been reliably conservative in the General Assembly but very much from the establishment wing of the party, while Bell works to outflank her on the right. An unabashed defender of gun rights, Bell held a drawing for an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle in the early stages of his campaign, “in defiance of Biden, Pelosi, and the rest of the Socialists.”Conventional wisdom suggests the more moderate Kiggans would have a better chance to unseat Luria in the “purple” 2nd District come November.

eugeneweekly_2022_21,"We ve got issues. We want to be seen as “civilized,” not looked down upon as “primitive.” But what if we have this the wrong way round? For 99 percent of our time as a human species, fromHomo erectustoHomo sapiens, we were primitive, living in face-to-face band societies without war, patriarchy, the ruin of the natural world, hierarchy and domestication. We took the wrong path. But of course, people argue, there’s no going back. In a talk to a University of Oregon audience a few months ago, Potawatomi elder and botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer refuted the “can’t go back” mantra. We can and must go back, along ancestral paths,she declared. Joseph Tainter’s invaluableThe Collapse of Complex Societiesshows why we can’t go forward. Most simply stated, civilizations outrun their carrying capacity, their sustenance. They are parasites that consume their hosts. This one last global civilization is doing just that. Built on technology and capital, it is failing on every level, in every area. If the future isn’t somehow primitive there won’t be a future. Do we choose life or the onrushing death spiral of civilization? One of Freud’s later works isCivilization and its Discontents, mainly focused on domestication, civilization’s core institution and orientation. Some species are tamed and domesticated and are more or less able to endure their servitude. For humans, Freud argued, it’s different. Domestication’s condition of unfreedom is for us a wound that does not heal. It is the source of neurosis, the basic cause of our unhappiness. The cure is as obvious as it is radical: Remove this cornerstone of immiseration. Freud shrank from the solution, while articulating its inescapable bottom line. As civilization crumbles, everything within its force field is being affected, being brought down. Youth mental health is in tatters against the backdrop of rising suicide rates, increasing opioid deaths, mass shootings, widespread homelessness and overall hopelessness. Friendships, too, fray under the pressure. The physical environment, as we all know, is a parallel catastrophe, e.g. warming, rising, full-of-plastic seas; global overheating; universal air pollution; unprecedented species extinction; severe and erratic weather, etc. The domesticators and civilizers have extended destruction and control. The breadth and depth of control are ever greater, from nanotechnology to surveillance society. Genocidal invaders decimated the Native population, declaring “Civilization” and “Progress” while making a graveyard. The Dead Zone of technological society extends the world’s destruction and our captivity. Place and presence are harder to come by, as the machine provides representation instead of life. Much has been replaced, refined — possibly society itself. In 1950, mathematician Alan Turing predicted that in 50 years the question wouldn’t be how much more human that technology has become, but how technified humans have become. Freud saw what damage domestication/civilization does to humankind, but couldn’t face the answer. Health in the face of cancer simply means an end to the cancer; the same goes for civilization. As Kimmerer counseled, we must go back along the ancestral paths. Rewilding, decolonization, de-domestication lead us there. Anti-authoritarian means anti-civilization. A mammoth undertaking, but the alternative is to keep going down a clearly suicidal road. John Zerzan is a local anarchist writer whose books include Elements of Refusal and Future Primitive.

suffolknewsherald_2022_249,"Published 6:01 pm Tuesday, October 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsThat’s right. With all the revitalization going on, it’s a good time to be in downtown Suffolk again, especially from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., Saturdays, (until Nov. 19 .Know why?There’s the iconic and legendary Mr. Peanut to welcome you at the Suffolk Farmers Market at Suffolk Visitor Center and Pavilion. Be sure to always stop by at the Visitor’s Center for more information. They’re open on Saturdays, too, and have a copy of City of Suffolk’s Program Guide, Sep-Dec 2022.You’re also lucky if you can see Black Bear there. But, of course, it’s always a good time to be in Suffolk where it is rich in history, tradition and culture. And, bargains, too, and more surprises for everyone, young and old.By the way, let’s welcome the cool of autumn with gratefulness, a sweet smile, good faith, hope, love, and optimism. Thank God, we’re alive and well, having been here in Hampton Roads for almost three decades (in my case , specifically in historic and progressive Suffolk.At the farmers market you can buy locally grown-produce, such as fresh vegetables and fruits, along with eggs, baked goodies and homemade cakes, homemade soaps, honey, pickled vegetables, jams and jellies, plants and flowers, arts and crafts and jewelry. There also are healthy organic products, informative educational materials available, in addition to books by published romance writers in the Hampton Roads area. Likewise, on the first Saturdays of every month, there’s live music, family activities and entertainment.We have been there several times before and during COVID-19. It was always good to be there downtown to buy stuff, eat and enjoy local food while patronizing our local farmers and vendors. On another visit, we were so delighted to see and pet different farm animals, such as a goat, a sheep, a pony, a horse and a llama. A local male performer was singing while playing with his guitar. And, as always, we dined out in one of the restaurants there, after driving around the historic area.We spent almost the whole Saturday there, which culminated in our Mass attendance and participation at St. Mary of the Presentation Catholic Church.Last Saturday, guess where were we? You betcha. My wife, sis-in-law, a friend and neighbor, and I went to the farmers market. We didn’t expect to be treated to music and be entertained by a group of young and talented local musicians, while we were shopping there. I don’t know about you but there’s that feeling of good vibes and contentment each time I hear sweet music in the air. It helps make you stop and listen.Mind you, we also saw a cute and quiet pet dog, on a leash, with her owner busy buying something. As usual, we bought homemade fruit and nut cakes, vegetables and raw peanuts. Before we left the farmers market, we stopped by the visitor center for some reading materials. They’re free and available on the shelves, by the way. Likewise we went to use their clean restroom.As always, we didn’t go home with an empty stomach. We ate lunch there. This time, we had Mexican food at Moe’s Southwest Grill. You know what, kids and friends? Even if Halloween is more than a month away, there’s that feeling of it already. At the checkout counter they’re giving away Halloween goodies — pretzels (Bats and Jacks , Tootsie Rolls and Pops, and candies of various kinds, colors and sizes.Sunday, after attending our church, and eating buffet lunch at a Chinese restaurant, my wife and I watched a $1 each person “family-fun” movie. You heard me loud and clear: $1 per person movie at Birdsong Theater at Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts.Know what? I haven’t really been a fan of animated movies. But after watching the funny and entertaining musically-filled “Sing 2,” I’ve come to like them. I’m going back definitely to the popular, yet historic cultural arts center building, which I just recently learned used to be Suffolk High School. This building looks elegant, strong and sturdy, with, of course, lots of effort, volunteerism, and money involved in restoring it. Call (757 923-9200 or search for Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts online.Thanks to all the donors, patrons and sponsors, and volunteer staff-personnel, and board of directors who are behind this cultural edifice, which was fortunate and proud to host the world-famous Ukraine’s Kyiv City Ballet for a number of shows and performances, including the ever-popular Swan Lake. Kudos to all of you for making cultural arts alive and well in Suffolk.Certainly, it’s a good time to be in Suffolk, especially in historic downtown, where there’s always something going on there.For October events, there’s the 44th annual Suffolk Peanut Festival Oct. 6-9; Poetry, Prose and Pizza at the Suffolk Art Gallery Oct. 13; Family 2 Mile Fun Run at Lake Meade Park, CarPool Cinema and the Hurrah Players present The Lion King Oct. 15; the 29 annual Driver Days Fall Festival Oct. 15-16; Storytime at the Station Oct. 18; Friday Night Frights playing “Pet Sematary” and “Friday the 13th” Oct. 14 and 21, respectively; Haunting at Chuckatuck: Haunted House Adventure Oct. 22; National Senior Health and Fitness Day Event Oct. 26; Friday Night Frights playing “The Ring” and “Let’s Dance (Vamos a bailar ;” Suffolk Public Library Fall Dance Oct. 28; Touch a Truck, Train and Trick or Treat, Chris Mike Magic at the Suffolk Center, Fall Festival and Trunk or Treat/Fright Night, and Dia de Muertos: Marigolds, Sugar Skulls, and Mexican Hot Chocolate Oct. 29.A host of other activities are planned for November and December.

eugeneweekly_2022_7,"We ve got issues. There’s a special kind of gaslighting that happens in Eugene. There is literally nothing like it — to witness the contortions people go through to be liked so that they can say they were a part of something they didn’t truly understand. To plant a flag of ownership somehow, to provide a sort of validation through approval. I guess a chance at witnessing glory is something most people could understand as exceptional, but the dissonance of the experience is mindblowing. It’s similar to seeing a level of artistry by Black and Brown people and forgetting the very energy that created its genius was a release — very often release of an experience, a way of life, or even trauma. Excellence in the Black community is not unusual, but how white people consume it and disconnect it from the experience of the people creating it is a practiced dissonance. The trauma is living in comparison to the endless limitations of whiteness. So it’s a special kind of gaslighting to then marvel at its genius when Black people decide to show up and show out. It dismisses the experience, and recklessly diminishes the brilliance. Not because it isn’t there, but because whiteness is conditioned to control it, naturally devaluing it. Yet, somehow Black folx keep trying to be understood. It is refreshing to witness an emerging sense of wellness outside the definition that whiteness has labeled us with. And then, again, the gaslighting persists. Anything outside that label requires an explanation, an exception, and it must be a gift. What if it was just the natural ability of unbridled Blackness? Do white folx realize how much Black people hold back in order to remain in the room? White folx truly believe that the experience of this space is aligned to theirs because we share it. This is what white privilege has done — create a deep misunderstanding of the capacity for a human experience. I can’t share my disgust. I’d be immortalized as negative, always looking at the negative side of things. Again, a special kind of gaslighting. My life is, in fact, positive. My life is full of joy. I’m a survivor, I’m a thriver, my family is healthy, we are spiritually healing, we are connected, I am grateful and forgiving. If I speak my most authentic truth, it is somehow courageous. Makes me wonder, are Black folx shooting ourselves in the foot by accepting this rhetoric? My choice to speak is only written off as courageous by those who not only recognize, but accept my oppression. I do not accept it. I am not brave for living, I am certain of my purpose to live. I do not need condescending support lined with gaslit expectations. There is no question of my value; only in the eyes that view me as a commodity. If there is a question of my purpose, it is only in the reflection of a narrow-minded perspective that leads to the belief that anyone’s purpose requires approval. Advice from a white, obtuse and self-proclaimed ally is to “connect to your values and vision and set meaningful goals for yourself, take control, lead from your cultural lens to make a difference for the greater good.” Is this advice you can use? While Black and Brown people spin their wheels here: Who is listening? The statement is our very existence. Truly, it is a special kind of gaslighting.

philinquirer_2022_33,"It will likely take several days for an accurate count of next month s ballots, but that does not mean anything nefarious is occurring.On Nov. 8, millions of Pennsylvanians will go to the polls to cast their ballots in the midterm election. In addition, the more than 1.3 million Pennsylvanians who applied to vote by mail-in or absentee ballot must return their ballots to their county election office by 8 p.m. that day.The question I am asked over and over is: When will we have the results? It’s a fair question.We will all be eager to know the outcome of such an important election. Voters will select our next governor and lieutenant governor, one of our U.S. senators, all of our U.S. Congress members, half of our state senators, and all of our state representatives.But the answer I must give may not be the one people want to hear. While we would all like to go to bed on Election Night knowing who won in every race, it will likely take a few days for complete unofficial results.An accurate count is paramount and cannot be rushed. County election workers must be given a reasonable amount of time to do their jobs and follow the law.An accurate count is paramount and cannot be rushed.That short interval of time does not mean anything nefarious is occurring; rather, it simplydemonstrates that the careful, deliberative process and timeline prescribed by Pennsylvania’s Election Code is at work to achieve a thorough count of every eligible vote.It takes time to count more than 1.3 million mail ballots. And current election law does not permit counties to begin pre-canvassing these ballots until 7 a.m. Election Day. That means county election officials cannot remove the ballots from the envelopes and prepare them to be scanned until that time —a day when those same officials are also running the more than 9,000 polling places across the state.And then, under the Election Code, counties may not even begin to record and publish mail ballot results until after the polls close at 8 p.m. Election Day.Even after votes are recorded and published, county canvass boards continue elections work. Those boards must meet no later than 9 a.m. on the Friday after the election (Nov. 11 for this election and must continue canvassing and counting through the eighth day after the election (Nov. 16 .Among other work, these boards adjudicate provisional ballots — ballots cast when it’s unclear if the voter is in the correct polling place or when a voter who applied for a mail ballot decides to vote in person instead but doesn’t have the mail ballot to surrender.The canvass also includes counting military and overseas civilian ballots, which counties must accept up to seven days after the election (by 5 p.m. Nov. 15 .Finally, absentee voters whose identification could not be verified at the time they applied have until the Monday after the election (Nov. 14 to provide their county election office with proof of identification.If there are close races, which we’ve seen more of in recent elections, every vote must be counted before the outcome can be known.It’s important to note that at every step of the process — in-person voting at the polls, pre-canvassing and canvassing of mail ballots, and adjudication of provisional ballots — representatives selected by each candidate and political party may be present and observe.Voters, candidates, and the media need to be patient as the counting process unfolds. And they need to be savvy consumers of election information.Dishonest sources who want to sow discord and doubt and create chaos sometimes use normal, expected processing times for election results to spread misinformation and disinformation about the integrity of the election.Don’t share election information unless you know it’s from a reliable, trusted source, such as your county election office website and the Pennsylvania Department of State’s voter information website,vote.pa.gov.The security of our electoral system is protected by many safeguards. We can trust in the integrity and professionalism of the local election officials who are doing the counting.Please vote on Nov. 8 if you haven’t already cast a ballot by mail. Let your voice be heard. Our democracy works best when we all participate.Leigh M. Chapman is Pennsylvania’s acting secretary of the commonwealth."
suffolknewsherald_2022_137,"Published 5:39 pm Friday, March 18, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Chris QuilpaAs Lenten season is in full swing, may our journey be filled with prayer, fasting and almsgiving. May we continue to pray for peace in Ukraine and Russia, and the rest of the world.Whether you believe in miracles or not, whether you believe in Mary (Holy mother of Jesus, our spiritual mother and her apparition, allow me, please, to share with you my thoughts and what I’ve watched and learned these days as we continue our observance of Lent.The season of Lent is a 40-day season given by our church to do something to make a difference, a sacrifice on our part for our world, while we reflect and commemorate the passion, death and resurrection of our Lord, Jesus Christ. The 40-day church event symbolizes also the 40 days that Jesus spent in the desert praying before his crucifixion.During Lent, there is one important thing we, young and old, can offer or do while glued to our TV sets, watching what has been happening in Ukraine in recent weeks with Russian military troops in “special military operation.” Invasion of Ukraine by Russia is what the media and many are saying. That’s what we believe, too. As Christians, we have a responsibility to our fellow brethren wherever they may be. As members of the catholic (universal church, we suffer when we see our brethren suffer. We feel their pain.Our prayer matters. It is our prayer that can bring us together to love peace. It is our prayer that can change our and others hearts. Praying doesn’t cost us anything but a few minutes of our time. It requires only our faith in our Almighty God, creator of heaven and earth, and his only begotten son, Jesus Christ, our savior and redeemer.Prayer can do wonders. They can make a difference in our life, in our world. If we pray together, miracles do happen.Let us pray to God for peace in Ukraine where there is war going on. Let us pray for Russia. Let us pray for peace between these two countries and around the world.For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been trying to focus on what I can do to make my Lenten journey meaningful, while at the same time trying to find out what I, as an ordinary retired military veteran, can do with regards to the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.I know, whether we like it or not, we are affected with what’s going on there day by day, for as long as there are brave journalists-reporters covering the “war.” We cannot just brush it off or ignore it because we are part of the human family, the human race that matters to all of us. Our humanity is at stake. Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine are suffering, and sacrificing their lives and many of them are fleeing, up to this time, to neighboring states.Dear folks, we have to pray together for war to stop, that there is peace in Ukraine and Russia, and other parts of the world where there is chaos, lawlessness, aggression, oppression.On the first Saturday of Lent, my wife and I watched a video on YouTube, after attending an online Mass and praying the Holy Rosary. This video is by Divine Mercy, with Father Chris Alar, MIC, which stands for Marians (Fathers of the Immaculate Conception, a Catholic male clerical religious congregation founded in 1670, in Poland, that has expanded its membership to the U.S. and other parts of the world.In the 49-minute YouTube video by Divine Mercy, “Explaining the Faith: Ukraine, Russia, Fatima: What Heaven is Telling Us?” published on March 5, 2022, Father Alar led a short prayer before he spoke to the church audience at The National Shrine of the Divine Mercy, Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He emphasized his talk was not a political talk while discussing the topics mentioned above.He talked briefly about Ukraine’s history in relation to Catholic Church. He mentioned Lenin, Poland, apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Poland, Ukraine, Fatima; about St. Pope John Paul II (a native of Poland , the collapse of Soviet Union, the independence of Ukraine, the first country in the whole world to be consecrated to Mary.Father Alar mentioned one of Mary’s apparitions in Ukraine, and read Mary’s message: “Forgive your enemies. Through you and the blood of the martyrs will come the conversion of Russia. Repent and love one another. The times are coming which have been foretold as being those in the end times. See the desolation which surrounds the world, the sins, the sloth,the genocide. Pray for Russia. Oppression and wars continue to occupy the minds and hearts of many people. Russia, despite everything, continues to live in darkness. If there is not a return of Christianity to Russia there will be a third world war and the whole world faces ruin.”He cautioned us to not despair nor be depressed but to pray for Ukraine and Russia. That’s what we’re doing, I do believe.He talked about another apparition of Mary at Fatima (Portugal . He read Mary’s message: “If my requests are heeded, Russia will be converted, and there will be peace; if not, she will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred; the Holy Father will have much to suffer; various nations will be annihilated. In the end, my Immaculate Heart will triumph. The Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me, and she shall be converted and a period of peace will be granted to the world.”Now, we have to do our part, dear folks. Let us pray and do penance, as we continue observing fasting and giving alms, sharing of our time, talents, treasures and giving up something as a form of sacrifice to alleviate the suffering of our brothers and sisters in Christ in Ukraine and Russia.Let us pray for good health, for continued disappearance of COVID-19 pandemic, and for peace in Ukraine and Russia, and the rest of the world. Together, we have to sacrifice for our life-world in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and other people who are experiencing oppression and lawlessness.May our prayers to you, Almighty God, be fruitful and meaningful. May peace reign over Ukraine and Russia, and the rest of the world. This we ask through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, with the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Joseph.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_93,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°It may be a bit late in the game, but the Biden administration could benefit by creating a new Cabinet position: The Secretary of Thinking Things Through.If the president had such an adviser, the White House wouldn’t be in the position it is now, informing those applying for student loan debt relief with the web site message: “At this time, we are not accepting applications.”That sotto voce statement is a far cry from Biden’s fanfare, first blared on the campaign trail, that he would forgive student loan debt by up to $20,000 for borrowers, freeing up their money to live life to the fullest.According to Democratic cheerleaders, it’s was necessary, it was overdue, it was vital to the lives of those who took out massive loans.It was also not in the president’s power to make such a move.That’s the reason a U.S. District Court judge in Texas struck down the plan on Thursday.U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman, whom The Hill noted is a Trump appointee, said the program is “an unconstitutional exercise of Congress’s legislative power” and the administration would need approval from Congress to move forward.“Whether the Program constitutes good public policy is not the role of this Court to determine,” Pittman said. “Still, no one can plausibly deny that it is either one of the largest delegations of legislative power to the executive branch, or one of the largest exercises of legislative power without congressional authority in the history of the United States.”This is not unexpected. Questions as to the Constitutionality of Biden’s student loan debt relief scheme had been raised for nearly as long as it had been touted. They had been raised by conservative voices, as in, people Democrats don’t listen to.If Biden had a voice of reason on staff, a No Man if you will, he could have gotten word that he’d need congressional authority to pull this off.Of course, that precludes that this was news to him.The unfortunate truth is that Biden was hell-bent on barreling his student loan debt plan through, whether it was in his purview or not.It was all about winning the moment, both with the coveted Democratic college-grad demographic, as well as progressives in the party.The losers were those same college grads, gulled into thinking they could walk away from a chunk of what they owed, and now caught up short by judicial realities.This isn’t the first legal challenge to Biden’s loan forgiveness plan.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit issued a stay on the program last month after an appeal from six Republican attorneys, according to reports.The White House was trying to elbow the student loan program under the HEROES Act of 2003, which offers relief in cases of national emergency.Biden could have avoided these legal battles if he had worked with Congress, as he did with the Inflation Reduction Act. But it might not have passed.As the Secretary of Thinking Things Through might say: told you so.— Boston Herald"
suffolknewsherald_2022_57,"Published 5:27 pm Friday, December 9, 2022ByStaff ReportsI love Advent and the Christmas season. There is a feel to this time that is unique. I hope you know what I mean. No matter how much life I have lived, nothing has yet completely robbed me of at least a taste of the wonder, hope and peace that Christmas seems to bring.This is my favorite time of year, if you made me choose. The excitement, the anticipation of Advent, the friends and family gatherings and the moments of goodwill are highlights.Have parts of it all changed since my childhood? Certainly. Have I gone to sleep on certain parts? Probably. Has the story at the center of our Christian observances of Advent and Christmas become a little too familiar, such that I have to mine it extra deeply in order to come up with something fresh at times? Maybe.This was the Second Sunday of Advent. We lit the candle of Peace. Yet in Matthew 3: 1-12 we found ourselves out in the wilderness being scolded by a wild man.This passage is hardly a treatise on the romanticized peace on earth of the Charlie Brown Chorus. It’s more like a lump of coal under the figurative tree as we draw near to Christmas morning.Ronald Allen says in his writings on this scripture that, “In Advent, the church thinks afresh about how to join God in the movement towards a world that is more like the realm of heaven. I can think of no better Advent guide than John the Baptist, whose instructions for preparation are condensed into one word: ‘Repent!’”In our scripture this week, we don’t get quiet. We don’t get peace on earth as we conventionally understand it. We don’t get a sweet baby in a manger.We get the enthusiastic and confrontive preaching of a loud prophet named John the Baptizer. The only people who like his call to repentance are people who assume the preacher is talking about everyone else other than them.Fact is, John was in no danger of the local Chamber of Commerce sending him out as an ambassador of goodwill for the area. At least based on what he was saying to part of the audience. “You brood of vipers!” I think I have somehow missed the Christmas greeting card line called The Brood of Vipers Collection.These are hardly the words we share in our Christmas carols, either. He demands a change of priority. He calls for a change of mood. He challenges us with that word “repent” to a change of ways.The wilderness was just over the hill, relatively speaking. It was not all that far away from the distractions of Jerusalem. Advent begins in this desert and we can’t get to Bethlehem without a trek through the wilderness.One friend of mine points out that this was a place of intense experiences. Matthew’s wilderness was a place of manna and living water. It was a place where the still small voice of God is heard. A place of burning bushes and glimpses of God.Now as John preached, there were no city sidewalks, busy sidewalks dressed in holiday style. There weren’t any treetops glistening with snow, nor Santa, Frosty or Rudolph. But the stark and barren wilderness, isolated and desolate, is where John preached and where Matthew takes us to listen. The grown up Jesus will soon confront his demons there.You see, repentance is not just feeling bad about our shortcomings. Repentance is a change of mind, a change of mood, a change of life and a change of direction! Hard words to hear, yet repent we must.What might we haul out into the wilderness and exchange for the lighter steps of a more peaceful existence this Advent? I’m glad you asked.What we carry around with us is our conformity to the old, familiar ways. But, deep down we all know that some of those old ways to which we so easily conform just don’t work that well. Deep down, we know that some of how we do things doesn’t square up with Jesus.From a baptism in the wilderness this Advent, we have a chance now to turn. This Advent, we could turn from conformity that hurts and excludes and takes advantage, toward newness in Christ that gives life instead! If we go out into the wilderness, there is love, there is repentance and there is hope. There is grace and yes, there just may be peace.Charles QuallsThe MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

minnpost_2022_158,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We face a growing problem of youth homelessness. Every year in Minnesota, approximately 7,500 young people aged 16 to 24 who live apart from parents or guardians experience homelessness. Do effective solutions exist?Youth homelessness results from many interrelated problems: extreme poverty, structural racism, families in crisis or separated, mental health issues and chemical dependency.One resource we offer these youth is drop-in centers supported by taxpayers, foundations, and individual donors. An example is YouthLink in downtown Minneapolis, where about 2,000 youth come annually to meet their basic needs—a hot meal, a shower, and toiletries—before returning to the street.There is little evidence about whether these organizations work and, if so, what makes them effective. Is it the building and these basic services? Is it human connections that happen there?YouthLink, like other drop-ins, is staffed by specially trained case managers, including some who have endured homelessness themselves. They engage youth and offer a supportive adult relationship.The underlying premise for case management in this as in other areas of social work and psychology is that a human relationship is healing and promotes positive developmental outcomes. Appealing as this premise may be, little evidence exists that such relationships help youth experiencing homelessness surmount the monumental challenges they face.We conducted research to test this premise and assess whether case managers help such youth move forward in their lives. Funded by The Kresge Foundation, our team studied long-term outcomes for 1,229 youth who visited YouthLink and analyzed 60,000 case notes written by YouthLink case managers following their interactions with them. We investigated outcomes over six years (before the pandemic in housing, education, court involvement and use of taxpayer-funded economic support programs, using integrated data securely maintained at Minn-LInK, in the University of Minnesota Center for Advanced Studies in Child Welfare.We found that youth who developed substantial relationships with case managers did better. They were more than four times as likely as those who did not develop such relationships to use permanent supportive housing, and to stay housed far longer. They were nearly twice as likely to earn a high school diploma.In addition to creating supportive relationships, case managers offer youth experiencing homelessness what we call transformative services, including focused assistance with education, employment, housing, mental health counseling and other services that potentially help them transform their lives to achieve their goals and become financially self-sufficient. We asked, do these efforts make a difference?We found that youth whose case managers worked more intensively with them on transformative services were twice as likely to use temporary shelters and 2.5 times as likely to use permanent supportive housing, and to stay housed much longer. They were 2.6 times as likely to earn a GED.Case managers also support youth by encouraging behaviors that help them avoid negative outcomes. The behaviors that case managers encourage span many topics, including managing school, substance use, living arrangements, emotionally charged situations and behavior in the drop-in. Sometimes case managers focus on life choices, helping youth navigate the potential consequences of their decisions. They try to help youth, many of whom have experienced serious life traumas, to achieve maturity and self-sufficiency, avoid imminent violations of implicit or explicit social norms and resolve legal problems.We found that youth whose case managers more often encouraged such behaviors did better. They were 2.5 times more likely to use temporary shelters and four times more likely to use permanent supportive housing, and to stay housed much longer. A substantial focus on these behaviors by case managers reduced by two-thirds the likelihood of a youth’s conviction for a felony.Finally, we found that case management had a very limited influence on the overall cost of taxpayer-funded economic support during our observation period.Our research demonstrates that the dedicated people who work in drop-ins do make a difference with youth experiencing homelessness. The positive outcomes we found resulted from intentional efforts by specially trained case managers. Overcoming homelessness requires tremendous determination by youth, but case managers can help them make it. Supportive adult relationships—coupled with needed services—are essential to addressing youth homelessness and deserve our financial support.Steven Foldes, Ph.D.is principal of Foldes Consulting LLC and an adjunct associate professor of Epidemiology and Community Health at the University of Minnesota.

We ve been married for around 10 years, and I fear she could still be taken away.In many ways, my wife and I are the classic Philly couple. I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware. My wife grew up in Delco. Both of us always wanted to live in Philadelphia and we’ve made the city our home.We met on OK Cupid back in 2008, and the rest is history.I collect vinyl records. I’m a tech guy. My wife, Karina, was involved in starting the farmer’s market in Old City, now known as theFarmers Market at Christ Church. We’re about to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We like to go toJaxx Steaks Taproom, sip a Peroni, and watch the Eagles games. I get a provolone with onions. My wife gets the chicken cutlet sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone. Our favorite Italian restaurant is L’Angolo on Porter Street.Like I said, we’re quintessentially Philly.There’s just one issue that sets us far apart from your typical Philadelphian couple. On our first date, my wife told meshe is stateless— no country will offer her citizenship, so she has none.» READ MORE:To Philly from Gaza: ‘When you’re a refugee, it feels like you don’t belong anywhere’She came to the United States from what is now Ukraine when she was 8 years old, after her parents fled the destruction of the former Soviet Union. She can’t go back to Russia. She can’t go back to Ukraine. Neither country will acknowledge she’s a citizen. But she also was not eligible for citizenship in the United States, even though we’re about to celebrate a decade of loving marriage. It’s because her family entered the country without inspection to seek asylum, making them so-called “illegal” immigrants. She haslived since 2012 with Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA status, a temporary reprieve from deportation.Being stateless is contrary to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Every personhas a right to a nationality, it says. Not having that right throws up a bunch of everyday challenges for both of us.For a start, we wanted to get married at Philadelphia’s City Hall, but we ended up having to get married in Maryland because they didn’t require state identification like a driver’s license, which, before DACA,my wife couldn’t get in Pennsylvania. She could use her college ID and birth certificate in Maryland. Recently, I was the best man at my friend’s wedding in Bulgaria. I flew there to give the speech but my wife couldn’t be in the audience to support me. She doesn’t have a passport, so she can’t leave the U.S., and it was such a shame she couldn’t be there with us all to celebrate.For years, I’ve worried that she’ll be deported or detained — many stateless people end up stuck in detention for a long time because there’s no country to deport them to. Yes, DACA offers protection, but it’s also a political lightning rod, so it could easily be taken away in the near future.Getting health care is also a real challenge if you’re stateless — and was a big concern for us, because my wife is a type 1 diabetic. Thankfully, our marriage certificate in Maryland qualified my wife to enroll into health care under my employer, but other stateless people are less fortunate. My wife and I both pay taxes, but I’m concerned that when it comes time to draw on Social Security, she won’t be able to. We’re both in our mid-thirties and people often ask us if we’re thinking about having a child. We tell them we are unwilling to bring a child into this predicament, with Karina’s uncertain legal status in this country. There are still far too manyimmigration detention facilitiesin the state. Frankly it is unthinkable to think of Karina being detained while she was pregnant — however unlikely it may be since DACA, it’s still a real fear. Her statelessness means that a regular aspect of life for other people is put on hold for us.We are unwilling to bring a child into this predicament.There are an estimated218,000 stateless people in the U.S.and they, too, are stuck in this kind of legal limbo. Many can’t work legally. Some end up in immigration detention,stuck there for yearsas they do not have a homeland they can be deported to. For stateless people in this country to practice their human right to a nationality, Congress would need to pass specific legislation.Fortunately, two members of Congress, both Maryland Democrats, have just introduced a bill that might fix things for stateless people in the U.S.Senator Ben Cardin and Representative Jamie Raskin’s “Stateless Protection Act” will resolve the status of stateless persons in the U.S. It could change thousands of lives, including ours. The bill, if passed into law, will give people like my American-raised wife a legal pathway to citizenship. With this status, I won’t be scared every day of her being detained, and we will be able to get on with our lives in the country Karina has long called home.Kevin Clough lives with his wife Karina Ambartsoumian-Clough in Philadelphia. She is theexecutive director of United Stateless, which advocates for stateless residents in the U.S."
suffolknewsherald_2022_208,"Published 4:31 pm Tuesday, January 11, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieSchool is back in session as the holiday vacation has ended. Before winter break began, my second-grader was studying two-digit addition and subtraction problems.When he returned to school, we had to do some refreshing to remind him how to do this math, which meant that now I was getting a lesson in new math terminology. I was introduced to the term “regrouping,” which involves numbers larger than 10. The basis of regrouping requires the understanding of place values when adding or subtracting numbers to complete the vertical addition equation using columns. Children of my generation and older learned this as “carrying or borrowing” the number from one column to the other. Imagine me sitting alongside my son attempting to assist him while using the terminology that he is accustomed to at the same time withholding the terms that taught me how to do the same problems. New math seems to be the journey of this pandemic parenthood. Mothers and fathers are using new methods to help our children adjust to their new reality.My son’s regrouping math problems taught me a lesson, which inspired a message for this new year.In planning our resolutions, we often reflect on what happened in the year prior and how we will adjust our actions and intentions to accomplish the goals we set. For 2022, I have heard several messages about what to leave behind. Our nation’s retrospection of the events of 2020 and 2021 and this long standing pandemic is dismal, because they were so difficult to endure. We are happy to leave it behind. However, the start of the year is not a blank slate.In order to learn from the summation of both 2020 and 2021, we have to do some regrouping. We need to know what to carry over and what to borrow from the journey of the past two years. Some of those experiences and lessons have greater place values than others. A good mathematician precisely adds components to the function to achieve the next right solution.One of the worksheets my son’s teacher gave to him had a bit of repetition of how to regroup when the same number is in the ones place. For example, any number added to 29 or 79 required him to regroup to the tens place. He was mastering the assignment until the next worksheet varied the numbers that were in the ones place. He had gotten so used to seeing the 9 that the new problems actually slowed him down. The switch up helped him get better. He practiced computing the result rather than depend on the familiar. This pandemic has taught us that we cannot depend on the familiar, and normality does not last. That can be good.I’ve seen the slogans for 2022 that say New Year, Same Me. I would have to disagree with remaining the same. Whatever new thing that you are dealing with at this moment is establishing a new SUM THING in you. Evolving is a function of addition. We are destined to evolve. The best of us improves in response to the inputs of our individual experiences. The result of our learning and development is a newness that brings us closer to the fullness of our being. Let us resolve that this year will be better than the previous ones because we will regroup to discover whatever makes us better.QuaWanna Bannarbie is a teacher, writer and affirmer of faith, identity, relationships and experiences.

leoweekly_2022_48,"Every news cycle now moves so fast that it’s frustratingly easy to forget heavy, terrifying breaking stories a few days later, but when the General Assembly is in session, that concept gets sent into hyperdrive. And, this year, unsurprisingly, the state’s lawmakers have constructed a tornado of harmful, dog-whistling legislation, shameless rhetoric and empty ideology.The GOP supermajority has proven they’re a dangerous bunch: The mad-dog younger generation perpetually try to turn religious belief systems and hardline party ideals into law, and the old-guard obstructionists know how to snipe any sort of real progress from a mile away. Add in the ineptness and bigotry, and we’ve got a party that never stops and thinks, only acts to achieve senseless moral victories. Like several people have recently said, I’m not sure what they even stand for anymore.It’s been a long and exhausting session in the statehouse and it will honestly probably be a long and exhausting decade, at least politically-speaking, in Kentucky.But, as the session is winding down, with the last two post-veto period days taking place on April 13-14, I wanted to briefly remember five egregious things from the 2022 General Assembly.Now, there are many more than five, so if you send over the old ‘Hey, you didn’t mention this’ line on Twitter, I’ll probably just agree with you. This isn’t meant to be comprehensive, just a few quick snapshots that show how much of a mess our state government is.For instance, we’re going to skip over major topics like gerrymandering, a massive attack on public education and public assistance slashing, because this a short column and we wouldn’t have room in this entire issue to recap all of the absurdities that the 2022 session brought us.So, here’s a few, um, whatever the opposite of highlights is:1. Let’s start with a late amendment toHouse Bill 690, which would allow lawyers to carry guns inside courtrooms. Gov. Andy Beshear, who recently vetoed the bill, said he did so at the request of the Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court, the Kentucky Fraternal Order of the Police and the Kentucky Commonwealth’s Attorneys’ Association, among others. In the veto, he said criminal defendants accused of murder could be inches from a weapon under this law. He wrote: “Courtrooms are venues of often volatile disputes that can be filled with emotion and tension.” With a super majority in both chambers the Republicans will have an opportunity to override the veto.2. When discussing negotiating process during a Capital Projects and Bond Oversight Committee in February, two lawmakers,Sen. Rick Girdler(R-Somerset andRep. Walker Thomas(R-Hopkinsville used the phrase “Jew Them Down.” They both eventually apologized, but it’s unacceptable and embarrassing that lawmakers are using hateful language.3. Senate Bill 83, better known as theanti-trans sports bill, would amend an existing law to add that “an athletic activity or sport designated as ‘girls’ shall not be open to members of the male sex.” It passed through both chambers and was vetoed by the governor, although it’s likely the supermajority will override. During a February Senate Education Committee meeting that advanced the legislation, Sen. Reginald Thomas, a Democrat from Lexington, asked the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Robby Mills, a Republican from Henderson, if he was aware of any issues or disputes concerning transgender students and sports occurring in Kentucky. Mills said he couldn’t provide any statewide examples or reasons why the bill was necessary, basically cementing it as copy-and-paste lobby legislation that focuses on party beliefs more than problems. At that committee meeting, a seventh grade transgender girl, Fischer Wells, who spearheaded getting the minimum number of players together for a girls field hockey team at her school said that “it’s disgusting that this bill is even suggested.”“I really don’t want this bill to pass, because I really want to play and it will be extremely detrimental to my mental health, as well, because, I know sports is a great way for me to cope with things,” she said into the microphone, sitting next to her parents, in the crowded room.4. A super restrictive, bare-bonesbill on medical marijuanawas purposely stalled by Senate leadership, leaving Kentucky once again in the dust of an industry that provides both relief for serious ailments and flows of additional tax revenue for participating states. Currently, 37 states are providing some form of medical marijuana access, while 18 also allow legal access to recreational. Rep. Jason Nemes, a Republican from Louisville, who has been championing Kentucky medical marijuana legislation for the past few years, tried to push through House Bill 136, which would only allow medical marijuana for a small number of conditions, including cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and nausea or vomiting. It’s embarrassing that we can’t pass something so simple.5. House Bill 3, a layered, omnibus bill sponsored by Rep. Nancy Tate (R-Brandenburg would amend state law to make it harder for minors to get abortions in cases when a parent is not able or qualified to provide written consent, as well as restrict access to abortion medication. It would also ban abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, overriding the current law, which bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy — similar to a controversial and legally-contested Mississippi law. Beshear vetoed the bill, but, again, the Republican supermajority will most likely easily override it. There’s nothing I can say about this bill that Sen. Karen Berg (D-Louisville hasn’t already put more articulately and knowledgeably. During debate, Berg — who is a diagnostic radiologist, a doctor who often does the first trimester of ultrasounds — said that the abortion medication aspect of the bill was based in personal belief systems and not medicine.“Why are we doing this, guys? And I know the answer,” Berg said back in March. “So, you have to ask, what is the purpose behind this legislation? Why are we so over-regulating, such a safe and and wanted medical procedure? The answer is very clear. There are certain legislators who feel that they have a right to regulate their personal religious and their personal moral beliefs over the rest of us, under the guise of safety for women. I will tell you again that this procedure is exponentially safer than child birth. It is a medically-accepted procedure.”Well, I’ve doubled my allotted word count, and I’ve barely scratched the surface of the worst of what came from this year’s legislative session. So, as always, stay active and angry, and don’t forget to vote.. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_121,"Published 5:24 pm Tuesday, April 5, 2022ByJen JaquaFour years ago, on a beautiful Friday, my family’s life was turned upside down.I remember the day perfectly. It was the last day of the kids’ spring break. They were out playing, and my husband and I were discussing our plans for the garden that year. Around 11 a.m., he went to play pool, as he did every Friday. The kids had wandered down to a neighbor’s house to play with her grandson.After my husband left, I walked down to check on the kids. At the time, my youngest was 4 and my oldest was 10. As I stood talking to the neighbor, her son pulled up in his car. He asked where my husband was, then proceeded to tell me he just saw a motorcycle accident down the road and it looked just like my husband’s bike.As my breath caught, I dialed my husband’s phone — nothing. I called my neighbor who he was meeting at the pool hall; they had left at the same time. My husband wasn’t there yet.And that is when I knew. That bike didn’t just look like my husband’s — itwasmy husband’s.I jumped in my neighbor’s car, and he rushed me to the scene, running two red lights and going around a police barricade to get there. I remember when I first saw his bike, laying in pieces in the middle of the road, glass and bike parts all over. At that moment, I didn’t know if my husband was alive or dead.That moment changed our family. Thankfully, he recovered after 3½ weeks in the hospital, much of that in a coma. After several long surgeries and more than six months out of work, he has few lingering side effects.I share this as an example that every biker you see has a family.Watch out for bikers and give them extra space. Motorcycles are small, and sometimes they are hard to see. A motorcycle cannot slam on the brakes. They can’t drive off the road to the shoulder to avoid a collision. Bikers don’t have a metal frame around them, and they don’t have big bumpers in front and back to absorb the crash. There are no airbags on a bike, no seatbelts or roll cages. What would be a minor accident in a car could be fatal to a biker. Drive as if that biker were your child, your husband, your sister, because they are somebody’s family member.It is spring in Virginia, and that means more bikers are on the roads. Look twice — three times even. Be watchful, be careful, and give the bikers the benefit of life. Join me in saying a silent prayer for every one of them — that they will arrive at their destination safely and that their families will never have to endure the pain and hardship of a motorcycle accident.Jen Jaqua is the page designer for Suffolk News-Herald, The Smithfield Times and the Windsor Weekly.

suffolknewsherald_2022_41,"Published 5:38 pm Tuesday, July 12, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieChildren of the 1970s have common memories of their childhood summer days. Running through sprinklers to keep cool. Paying 50 cents for a snow cone from the neighborhood ice cream man.Children could also expect to experience similar activities to commemorate the end of each school term. Elementary and middle school students were given spelling tests to assess the retention of all the spelling words you learned throughout that grade level. Do you remember the word that you misspelled in the last spelling contest that you participated in as a child?Spelling tests can be both exciting and nail-biting occasions. Perhaps that is why teachers still see the value of these assignments in modern classrooms. Special teachers enjoy challenging their students with contests for some healthy competition.Lavone Whitener Green of Suffolk is such a teacher who believes in good fun and healthy learning environments. Mrs. Green is the lead administrator and teacher of the O.L.A. homeschooling co-op. She hosted her first public spelling bee on June 18 at HP Music and Arts store in Chesapeake Square Mall.The store provided an atmosphere for inspiration as the participants were surrounded by sale products bearing affirmations and apparel with colorful combinations of lively Afrocentric patterns. Mrs. Green opened the program with a spoken word selection by artist Terrell Mercer. J’Niah Boggs and Alexia Carroll performed a praise dance to the popular Christian music hit “Jireh” by Maverick City Music.The youth began the contest speaking nervously into the microphone to spell their assigned words. As the competition continued, they grew more and more confident. Each of them cheered on the other and gave high fives as they returned to their seats following each spelling achievement.The spelling bee participants include Daniel A. Green, 13; Darrick D. Eure Jr., 8; Jeremiah E. Miller, 8; Caiden A. Wise, 8, and Caleel J. Wise, 7. The Wise brothers are the youngest of the group and both are in their first year of reading. Each of the contestants wore matching black graphic T-shirts bearing their names.Mrs. Green intended this contest to be an encouragement to her students and therefore elected not to buzz the students if they misspelled a word; rather the contest announcers were asked to keep track of the correctly spelled words as the students continued to accept their challenges throughout the afternoon’s program.Keshia Morris -Eley and QuaWanna Bannarbie were selected to be the program announcers. For nearly two hours with only one break for intermission, the contestants courageously spelled words such as “bicuspid” and “dossier.” The announcers had just as difficult a role as the children. The students requested sentences demonstrating the use of the word and definitions for assistance in accurately responding to the announcers.Parents and friends of the co-op gathered in support. The store was arranged in a recital setting with fruit and beverages provided for the contestants to refresh themselves.At the conclusion of the contest, each participant had attempted 40 words in a spell-off fashion. Two out of five contestants spelled 100% of their words correctly.Not too far from Hampton Roads, a historical spell-off took place recently in Oxon Hill, Maryland.The winner of the2022 Scripps National Spelling Beewas determined in its first ever spell-off on June 1, when Harini Logan of San Antonio, Texas, correctly spelled seven more words than her opponent in a final spelling marathon for the win.Now that the O.L.A. contestants have experienced the affirming atmosphere of their first spelling bee, they are now equipped to perhaps meet someone on that national stage in the future. Mrs. Green says that she started the homeschool because she believes that “every child has the ability to learn and to flourish.” Each of her students were successfully promoted to their next grade, respectively, and were honored for their achievements with trophies, honoree medals and bags of goodies.For more information about the co-op, contact Lavone Green 757-708-5659 andlavone03@gmail.com.QuaWanna Bannarbie is a Suffolk News-Herald columnist.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_85,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°NASA’s Artemis program is edging toward a return to the moon — this time to stay — with its successful launch this week of an uncrewed rocket. Some Americans looking at the Earth-bound problems all around us might reasonably ask: Why? The answer is not just about the scientific discovery that a permanent presence on the moon promises but also the much-needed sense of national purpose it could recapture.Humanity’s first climb to the moon began, rhetorically at least, in September 1962, when President John F. Kennedy defined the purpose of the endeavor: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”Just seven years later, Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on an extraterrestrial surface.The motivation for that astounding feat was, first and foremost, geopolitical.Beating the Soviet Union to the moon was another front in the Cold War, one that united Americans.The significant scientific discovery and spinoff technology that the moon missions spurred — including computer-miniaturization capabilities that ultimately made possible the laptop or cellphone on which you may be reading this editorial right now — were almost incidental.There’s no Cold War driving things this time, which necessitates a little more explanation as to why America is returning to what it is, after all, a large cold rock in space.First, there is the science and the basic human drive for exploration — both worthy ends in themselves. The ultimate goal, with private companies providing heavy input, is to establish a permanent moon base as a jumping-off point for exploration of Mars and beyond.Moon rocks and soil samples collected during the Apollo missions added immensely to scientists’ understanding of the origins of the moon, Earth and the rest of the solar system.Modern testing methods, more advanced than what was available half a century ago, could add to that understanding, especially if astronauts are able to conduct experiments on the moon itself while living there.That possibility has grown with the discovery a few years ago that water is trapped within the moon’s seemingly barren surface.If it can be extracted and processed, it could provide not only drinking water for astronauts, but breathable air and even hydrogen rocket fuel.Although there is no more Soviet Union to race with, geopolitical factors remain. China is planning to build and staff a lunar base in the coming decades.Allowing a global adversary that kind of scientific and strategic foothold — in orbit right above us — would be not just disheartening but potentially dangerous.Finally, there is the unifying effect that a return to the moon could have on a deeply divided America. That cold rock in space brought Americans together once before.We need that kind of shared mission again.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"

We look forward to his successful tenure as our next chief of police.Roger ChristieHiloPreposterous commentsAs a retired police captain, I want to comment on statements attributed to Thomas Fratinardo in the Dec. 13, article as reported by Tribune-Herald reporter John Burnett, in covering the final four applicants for police chief — in particular what was reported about the “culture” of the Hawaii Police Department.The article insinuates the actions of Detective Albert Pacheco and Sgt. Kenneth Mathison in the deaths of their wives are linked to a police “culture,” and that police are “murderers.”These actions happened at the hands of individuals acting on their own and not involving any other police officers.There are many dedicated and caring police officers in our community, but like in any other occupation, there are a few that do not conform to the expected standards of their choice of employment.To say that “police officers are murdering their wives in Hawaii” and there is an “epidemic” is preposterous. As a lifelong resident of the Big Island, these are the only times I can remember such tragedies happening.Saying this is an “epidemic” and “culture” — should my wife be afraid that I will harm her, or that all wives of police officers are in imminent danger from their husbands? I certainly think not!Police officers, in my opinion, are loving, caring, compassionate, dedicated and willing to serve the communities in which they live.The article insinuating that there exists a murderous culture within the department is an unfair statement and an insult to all of our police officers, active or retired.Lawrence BalberdeHiloThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

suffolknewsherald_2022_16,"Published 1:17 am Saturday, August 6, 2022ByStaff ReportsPerhaps you bought a ticket last month when the Mega Millions lottery jackpot exceeded $1 billion. If you did and, like millions of others, lost, perhaps some consolation is that public education was a winner from the Mega frenzy.During the 29 drawings of the jackpot run that began in April and ended with the July 29 drawing, sales of Mega Millions tickets in Virginia generated an estimated $30.2 million in profit, lottery officials say. By law, all of that profit goes to K-12 public schools. So there’s that.If you had high hopes of winning, Virginia Tech professor J.P. Morgan, a statistics expert, is happy to throw some cold water on your dreams, putting the astronomical chance of winning the jackpot stands at 1 in 302,575,350.“Now, 303 million seems like a pretty big number, but still, it can be hard to think about,” Morgan said. “What does one chance in 303 million really mean?”He illustrated the tall odds in two effective ways.Interested in upping your odds ever so slightly?“Try to play a number combination that not many other people will play,” Morgan said. “That way, should by some fantastic improbability you win, the pot will not be divided among very many people. That is the only strategy that you can invoke to maximize your winnings. Nothing you can do will increase your chance of winning, but you can try to avoid a split pot.”While state lottery officials — and public school leaders — probably won’t like it, Morgan offered even better advice: “Perhaps the best way to play Mega Millions is to play in your imagination. Write down your number combination on a piece of paper, then put it in an envelope with a $2 bill. When the drawing is made, open your envelope. Your combination will not match the winning combination, but you will have $2! That’s two dollars more than if you had actually played. Play imaginary Mega Millions twice a week for a year and you will have ‘won’ $208! Use it to take your true love out to a nice dinner and count yourself the real winner.”The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

minnpost_2022_119,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The best financial investment managers rigorously evaluate their own performance and identify needed adjustments as results and external circumstances dictate. Most importantly, they do this acting as fiduciaries, putting their clients’ interests ahead of their own with a duty to preserve good faith and trust.That same commitment and ethic should drive government and government investment – as many prefer to call government spending these days. State government’s massive “portfolio” of spending programs supporting the health, safety, social and economic welfare of Minnesotans require the same type of diligent oversight and monitoring of performance and results. This analysis and evaluation must also be undertaken in a setting in which the efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars and the advancement of the public interest is the priority.For 50 years, the Office of the Legislative Auditor (OLA has served in this capacity for the state. OLA performs financial audits of agencies, organizations and programs within and funded by state government to ensure safeguarding of public resources and compliance with laws that govern state operations. OLA also performs special reviews to ascertain the facts behind a specific concern or question raised about government operations. The office’s program evaluations are in-depth examinations of how well state-funded programs or organizations are managed and what results they are achieving. All this work is accomplished in an independent, non-partisan manner that commands attention, respect and credibility across the political spectrum.So given the unique and vital role this office plays, it’s worth looking at how the OLA’s resources and capacity has matched up with growth in the size and scope of state government over time. The numbers tell a story that should make any supporters and advocates of good government cringe. As we figure out what to do with $9.3 billion, consider the following:Available resources belie the continuing interest in and demand for OLA’s work.A news reportthis year described OLA as being besieged by “audit fever.” This year, 67 potential program evaluation topics submitted by lawmakers, organizations, and citizens needed to be winnowed down to just five for inclusion in OLA’s annual workplan. Lawmakers have had to urge colleagues not to overload the office by writing new investigations into statute.Nevertheless, as the size, scope, cost and complexity of government only escalates, our need to examine whether programs are achieving their objectives and how they can be improved is greater than ever. Minnesota lawmakers can be guilty of using “investment” as a euphemism for “spending” too casually. But with respect to OLA, the concept applies. Efficient, effective, accountable Minnesota government demands a strong OLA. The state needs it, and taxpayers deserve it.Mark Haveman is the executive director of the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence"

That’s never been a problem for Peanut Fest, which still excites Suffolkians young and old.Maybe it’s the time of year. Autumn puts pep in our step and makes us eager to throw on some jeans and get outside after the dog days of summer. Peanut Fest is perfectly timed to oblige.Maybe it’s the affordability. Admission is $10 per person. On Thursday, opening night, an entire carload of up to eight can gain entry to the festival and ride unlimited rides for just $50. It’s hard for a dad, mom and kids to beat that bargain, especially given the plethora of entertainment options for all ages once on the festival grounds.Maybe it’s the variety that festival organizers work hard to create. Every year, there’s something fresh to pique our curiosity. This year will bring a poignant opportunity to reflect on one of nation’s darkest chapters, the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, and to salute the first responders who responded so heroically then and continue to keep our community safe today.

eugeneweekly_2022_47,"We ve got issues. Over my decade and a half in Eugene, I’ve shared the city with Sabrina Ionescu and Marcus Mariota, and I am not in their league. What they do takes talent, hard work and discipline. But there are benefits to staying active, and whenever I lace up my ASICS and go for a run, I spot neighbors down in my league, not in any danger of making aSports Illustratedcover, just moving their bodies to stay healthy. I also know people who never get off the couch, but I don’t know enough to say more. Some can’t; they have invisible disabilities or chronic health conditions that are not my business. Others are just couch potatoes; they don’t want to exercise, so they don’t. And some self-diagnose with an invisible disability or chronic health condition as an excuse for inactivity. From the outside, I can’t tell who’s what, so I make my choices and keep my mouth shut about theirs. Nevertheless, people who get active reap a lot of rewards, and people who don’t, pay a price. The exact same thing could be said about emotional intelligence. Last September,EugeneWeeklypublished an essay I wrote about loneliness. The next week, Timothy Gardner replied that the real problem was some mix of poor mental health and willful ignorance, and concluded that the sane and informed “have a very clear right to be angry.” I’ve heard that from my neighbors, directed at many local problems: covid, homelessness, politics, hate speech, drug trafficking, porch pirating, other people’s bad driving. I’m betting none of them are oncologists, or at least I sure hope not. If you’re diagnosed with cancer, you don’t erupt with rage and pound your tumor with a sledgehammer. Instead, you come at it from many angles, amassing all reliable clues and promising treatments toward getting you from patient to survivor. I’ve seen enough cancer diagnoses among friends and family to know anger is something you might experience, and you mustn’t bury. But it’s not helpful. It’s like trying to thread a needle while screaming profanity at it. So am I saying people have no right to be angry? No, I can’t: I don’t know anyone’s backstory but my own. I do know that at least some of the time, anger can be reframed out of existence. Ever get mad at what someone did, only to find out you were mistaken? For you to stay angry, the underlying facts have to be correct and your interpretation has to be the best one. If either of those gives way, the anger goes with it. The parents of the girls killed at West Nickel Mines School in the 2006 shooting chose forgiveness over hatred, and so did family members of Dylann Roof’s victims. No one could question their right to be angry, but they set it aside. Their lives were halted by social malignancies, and they didn’t reach for the sledgehammer. They are the Sabrina Ionescus and Marcus Mariotas of emotional intelligence, and not everybody has their gifts and self-discipline. I’m just a Butte to Butte nine-minute miler, trying to stay active enough to be healthy. And some people never get off the couch because they can’t, and I try to have compassion for them. But some choose not to, and some delude themselves that they can’t when they really could if they stopped making excuses. With emotional intelligence, we don’t put up posters of Sabrina and Marcus; we join in the chorus with the couch potatoes. But a new year is here, and we should resolve to get in shape. We don’t need to “get tough on homelessness.” We don’t need to insult the vaccine-hesitant. We don’t need to brag about our road rage and blame it on other people’s bad driving. Those responses are to anger as airport security theater is to fear: satisfying, but useless. Nearly every public problem people get angry about is complicated, and real solutions would require smart planning, execution, patience and a cooperative spirit. The disintegration of trust underlying all this seeds belief in conspiracy theories, but there’s only one conspiracy I truly believe in: the folks perched at the top, holding the levers of power, are safest when we’re at one another’s throats. Anytime I point out insults and hostility aren’t productive, and float the idea that conversation and listening are necessary first steps, I immediately hear, “Oh, there’s absolutely no point to trying to talk to those people.” And that’s exactly what they want you to think.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_9,"The best gift you can give your loved ones this year? A COVID-free holiday season.By all indications, getting infected with COVID has ceased to be a frightening prospect for most. Few people wear a mask in public. Proof of vaccination is rarely required to visit most establishments. And the share of people who have received the latest booster shot is just 14%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But COVID-19 is still a very real threat with hundreds of people in the United States dying every day, most of them over the age of 65. In other words, our grandmas and abuelitas.Let’s keep them safe by taking COVID-19 precautions seriously. Considering it’s our third winter since the pandemic began, we should be pros at using the tools we have to avoid turning our holiday gatherings into superspreader events.It may seem as though it’s safe to gather in large numbers with family and friends in warm, cozy homes for holiday celebrations. But it’s prime COVID season, along with influenza and other deadly respiratory diseases. Past winter surges of coronavirus were tied directly to holiday gatherings and travel.Public health experts warn that the risk remains for serious illness, hospitalization and death from an infection as well as long COVID, where symptoms persist for months and years. Those at higher risk for serious illness include people who are older, have disabilities such as cerebral palsy or underlying medical conditions such cancer, kidney disease and cystic fibrosis. People of color who live or work in denser, high-risk areas and may have limited access to medical care are also at high risk for serious illness.In Los Angeles County, the mortality rate due to COVID-19 is highest for those living in areas of high poverty and for Latinos. The mortality rate for Latinos — 475 deaths per 1,000 people — is more than double that of white people.Even those who are not part of the above groups can easily transmit the virus, even if asymptomatic, in the first few days of an infection. Who wants to be responsible for passing on the virus to older relatives or those with weakened immune systems who may be less able to fend off serious illness?And it’s so easy to avoid. Face masks, rapid tests and booster shots are available in local pharmacies, and the Biden administration once again is sending out at-home COVID-19 tests at no charge. And in a pinch, gatherings can move outdoors or to well-ventilated areas.It’s disappointing that we are facing another COVID-19 Christmas this Sunday — and another new year in which the pandemic persists. But by now, we know how to keep one another safe.— Los Angeles Times"
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_36,"Do you remember that Donald Trump has already thrown his hat in the ring for the 2024 presidential election? Odds are it slipped your mind, on account of more-or-less general indifference not only from a media that seems to have finally learned some lessons, but even a national GOP that has at last tired of his toxicity.Regular readers of these pages will know that we have painstakingly detailed the many, many reasons that the former New York real estate promoter and lifelong fraudster is constitutionally, categorically unfit to run a hot dog stand, let alone the nation’s executive branch. Yet in this cynical game of politics, the coin of the realm is often not fitness but electoral firepower, and many prominent Republicans swallowed their pride and threw in their chips with the man they thought could deliver.Much to their chagrin, and the country’s benefit, even on that front the former president is bankrupt, as again demonstrated by the loss of handpicked candidate Herschel Walker in the Georgia Senate runoff, after the former football star managed to keep incumbent Raphael Warnock under 50% in November. But in the second round, Warnock prevailed, crucially handing Chuck Schumer a 51-seat majority that will increase his maneuverability over the current 50-50 power-sharing deal.That’s thanks to Trump, who delivered losses with Walker and other crackpot contenders like Mehmet Oz and Kari Lake and Doug Mastriano. You could say that these terrible candidates lost on their own incompetence, but that they were selected and bolstered by Trump, often over more mainstream candidates. That a few Trump flunkies like J.D. Vance proved exceptions to the rule by stumbling across the finish line only highlights how frequently the president’s backing is now a kiss of death.With Trump’s influence dead and buried at the polls, the GOP should move beyond him, unless they want to keep losing important races for federal and state office.

leoweekly_2022_14,"Lots of left-skewing folks, including me, have expressed irritation at the Justice Department’s delay in charging the former president for trying to replace Congress with a battalion of deadbeat dads who still listen to Ted Nugent. But things are looking up. The fact that the feds executed a search warrant at Trump’s Florida pleasure palace should inspire some confidence. And the charges levied against four LMPD officers involved in Breonna Taylor’s murder, including a charge against former officer Brett Hankison for conduct that a Louisville jury already found him not guilty of, might stoke one’s optimism, too. What do these charges mean for what we can expect out of this DOJ in coming months?The main statute under which the four LMPD officers are charged was part of a post-Civil-War act meant to give the federal government power to enforce the law in places where states would not. Crime and punishment were handled locally in those days; it was rare for the feds to dirty their hands with plain-old murders and robberies. But white supremacists were terrorizing the South during Reconstruction, and Southern states weren’t doing much to stop them. As one congressman put it in 1871, “men were murdered, houses were burned, women were outraged, men were scourged, and officers of the law shot down, and the State made no successful effort to bring the guilty to punishment or afford protection or redress to the outraged and innocent. The State, from lack of power or inclination, practically denied the equal protection of the law to these persons.” Laws like the one LMPD officers are charged under allowed federal agents to mop up the Klan without the help of state governments.The murder of Walter Scott in South Carolina provides an example of how this is supposed to work today. A bystander captured a video of officer Michael Slager shooting Scott eight times in the back, from a considerable distance, as he was running away. As you may have guessed, Scott was Black and Slager is white. The judge declared a mistrial when one of the jurors refused to convict, despite unmistakable evidence that Scott’s death was a coldblooded assassination. The feds took over the case, and Slager got 20 years.With this history in mind, Hankison’s second round of charges might make more sense. The state’s little dog couldn’t get the job done, so in barges the federal pit bull. The difference here is that Hankison was tried and acquitted of exactly the same conduct the feds charge him with now. Laypeople often ask, “Isn’t that double jeopardy?” It probably should be, but the Supreme Court says it’s not. We should be suspicious of this kind of power, which is regularly directed at people who state prosecutors are mad at. In the rare event that a defendant is found not guilty after a trial, state prosecutors will sometimes go running to Big Brother to make sure that someone goes to prison, no matter what any ol’ jury says. I’ve seen them do this many times, and it’s almost never directed at crooked cops.The decision to re-prosecute Hankison is even more curious when you consider that federal prosecutors will have to convince a jury composed not just of Louisvillians, but of Nice White Jurors from surrounding counties, too. These Nice White Jurors are more likely to be pro-cop, and therefore less likely to convict someone of firing shots wildly into a neighboring apartment. And the prosecutions of the other officers, at least on the charges connecting their lies to Breonna Taylor’s death, are anything but a slam dunk. Still, accountability is accountability. While I don’t love the fact that the feds have the power to charge someone for something they’ve already been acquitted of, at least they’re occasionally using that power against cowboy cops. That’s a notable improvement from previous administrations.There’s another piece here that’s helpful for context: Last month, three former Minneapolis officers — J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao — were sentenced on federal charges under the same statute used to prosecute Hankison and the other LMPD officers. Those three were popped by the DOJ for “failing to intervene” so as to prevent George Floyd’s death. None of them will do more than four years in prison, but the fact that the feds went after them in the first place means something.The overall picture is one of a Justice Department that is willing to take risks to do what’s right. Up until now, courts and prosecutors have been telling cops that even the most reckless Deadpool-style policing will be excused: fi ring into moving cars full of children? Fine. Making up charges on the spot so someone gets thrown in jail? No biggie. Blasting golden retrievers and tossing concussion grenades into occupied cribs? Yawn. As someone who used to sue cops all the time, it’s been next to impossible to convince the federal courts that they should be subjected to simple monetary penalties, let alone criminal ones.That’s what makes the charges against the LMPD officers so extraordinary. In the past, the feds have been willing to overlook any bad behavior by police during a home invasion if someone shoots at a cop. Lying on a search warrant is practically something they teach at the academy, so they haven’t gone after officers for that one either. Thao and Keung were just standing around watching their colleague kill a man; I don’t remember hearing of cops getting charged for that ever in my life. There’s a political dimension to consider, too. The FBI and LMPD work together a lot, and these prosecutions will almost certainly damage their relationship. So even if charging a bad cop seems like a no-brainer, in a sense, it’s still an act of bravery. The feds didn’t have to do it (and historically speaking, they haven’t .Regular readers will know to take my tempered praise of the DOJ for what it’s worth, which isn’t much. Federal law enforcement still has racist and classist roots, and it’s hard to imagine that the DOJ would have pursued these charges had the Taylor and Floyd murders not captured so much national attention. And of course, underlying all this is America’s chronic insistence on clubbing every social problem over the head with the criminal law. There’s not much that’s objectively “good” about this situation overall. But if you’re turning over stones looking for hope wherever you can get it, I think there’s some to be found. •. ( ."
minnpost_2022_16,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Just passed was the deadline for principals in the Minneapolis Public School (MPS system to turn in their budgets for next year.Even amid a potential strike, Minneapolis Federation of Teachers Local 59 (MFT59 members face another round of layoffs and excessing. A disproportionate number of them are teachers of color. Already, multiple teachers of color have been notified that they’ve been excessed. Union and district leaders have the power to protect them by signing a targeted Memorandum of Agreement outside of Master Agreement mediation. Instead, MFT59 has refused to protect teachers of color until demands for increased pay and smaller class sizes for all members are met.This problem is not new. Since the mandated integration of Minneapolis schools in the 1970s, the recruitment and retention of Black educators has been deprioritized in the face of budget cuts and union negotiations. The first group of Black educators in Minneapolis protested this issue in 1978 when the union chose to protect senior white teachers over newly hired teachers of color. Although MFT59 from the 1970s is clearly not the same as today, the same vestiges of white supremacy remain in our policies.MPS is caught in a dangerous cycle of losing teachers of color. Universal policies, such as pay increases – while sorely needed – are not, and have not been, enough to maintain a diverse educator workforce. The question is simple: How can we diversify the profession if educators of color keep getting caught in layoff and excessing cycles and are not offered the protection of their union?We need a targeted, equity-based Memorandum of Agreement to protect teachers of color now.I can’t shake the feeling that we are trapped between two predominantly and historically white institutions. Educators of color don’t even make up a quarter of the population of teachers in Minneapolis, compared to a whopping sixty-two percent of non-white students. Research shows that diverse teachers are good for all students, not just students of color, but MPS and MFT59 have chosen instead to prioritize the same policies that have resulted in the same lopsided outcomes.Each school submitted a budget, which will determine which positions get cut. While both MPS and MFT59 have publicly stated that they are negotiating on our behalf, it has come to my attention that negotiations won’t continue until after the deadline. How can you negotiate on our behalf and not meet this urgent deadline that is directly related to the future of our jobs?I am certainly not arguing against the merits of the teachers’ strike – livable wages, smaller class sizes and safe schools are important. However, the racial discrimination and stereotyping that we face in our schools and a lack of respect for our expertise among our colleagues won’t get better until policies that center our needs are passed. Pay increases alone won’t address this crisis, but intentionally protecting educators of color will.I am a teacher. I am a Black woman. I am a union member. If the system is not working for people like me, then it is not working at all. By not supporting policies that protect, retain, and increase the number of teachers from diverse backgrounds, we are sending a dangerous message to our student body and we tell Black, Hispanic, Asian and Indigenous teachers that when push comes to shove, our worth ceases to exist.Nafeesah Muhammad is an education activist and English teacher at Patrick Henry High School in Minneapolis.

Once I was up on a mountain in Japan. We had been in the field for a while, and it was a wet morning. Bivouacs had washed away in a typhoon the night before.Then an unexpected arrival of hot chow and mail! I got a small box from my dad. It traveled from the Cass Lake Post Office all the way to me up on that mountain in Okinawa, full of wild rice. Its smell instantly transported me back home, and I could smell the lake, the sunshine, the parching fire and all the activity of gathering and finishing rice. In that moment, I realized I needed to return to the place I had “escaped” from. For this is my homeland.But now the Huber Mill, proposed near the Leech Lake reservation in northern Minnesota, poses a major threat to this land. Please try to understand this mill is wrong in so many ways. Resort owners, those who need tourism, lumber mills, the OSB plant by Solway — all should be concerned.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources says that’s acceptable. It is not. Two sacred eagle nests would also be cut down. Also not acceptable.This land must stay intact and not be forever changed if the mill is built. I need these woods to show my grandsons what my dad showed me. This life is not a hobby, but a season-to-season way to live — and one we will protect.Right now, the project has been halted by the Army Corp of Engineers, and lawsuits against it by White Earth, Leech Lake, Red Lake and the 1865 Treaty Authority are active.

Several spaces within the building are closed to the public, and safety will become a growing concern. If we cannot stop the leaks, the building will eventually become unusable.We were delighted to receive approval from Suffolk’s Historic Landmarks Commission for several important phases of our repair and renovation work, including the replacement of rotting windows, and the installation of new flashings and cornices. This work will commence in the spring — but the work can’t stop there. Our brick-and-mortar walls have become very porous over 100 years, and they will continue to leak unless we can seal the masonry. The technology exists, but the building won’t look the same. Actually, we think it will look even better.In a normal year, the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts hosts over 30,000 people for performances, classes, gallery exhibits, weddings, and more. Every other Wednesday, we welcome third-, fourth-, and fifth-graders from every public elementary school in Suffolk for art classes. Every Thursday, we host homeschool children for art, music and dance classes. This spring, we’re hosting a Motown show, a bluegrass show, dance recitals, yoga classes, a writing workshop for veterans, painting classes, student art shows, a decoy carving workshop, author lectures, and so much more. Last year, 30% of the students in our art and music summer camps attended on full scholarship. Truly, we are an arts center for our entire community.This building holds deep memories for many folks in Suffolk, and we are honored to be stewards of this rich history. If we want this landmark to be used and treasured for generations to come, we must safeguard the building and seal the walls from leaks. We look forward to finding a solution with the city and the community to do just that.David Love, Chairman of the Board, Suffolk Center for Cultural ArtsLorelei Costa, CEO and Executive Director, Suffolk Center for Cultural ArtsOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_203,"Published 5:13 pm Tuesday, January 18, 2022ByStaff ReportsNew Gov. Glenn Youngkin had been in office only a few hours when he signed an order letting Virginia parents and public school students know that they don’t need to pay any heed to the mandates issued by their local school division.It’s hardly surprising, considering Youngkin took advantage of rancor surrounding such issues as masks in schools and critical race theory to make his way to the governor’s mansion. He essentially promised Virginia voters that parents — not our state’s army of well-trained, professional educators — would be in charge. And he’s delivering, but this executive order is not a delivery we wanted to see.Youngkin’s executive order could have simply rescinded a previous order by his predecessor, Ralph Northam, requiring masks in all Virginia public schools. That would have allowed each school division to form its own policy surrounding masking in school, and considering the pandemic’s varying effects on various parts of Virginia, that may not have drawn as much criticism.However, that’s not what Youngkin did. What he did was issue an order that says, in relevant part, “The parents of any child enrolled in a elementary (sic or secondary school or a school based early childcare and educational program may elect for their children not to be subject to any mask mandate in effect at the child’s school or educational program.” The order goes on to state that parents do not need to provide a reason their child is not wearing a mask.This is not only a bad precedent for a governor to tell parents they don’t need to follow the policies of their local school divisions, but also likely to lead to some case law before the month is out.The science is clear that wearing masks properly, in conjunction with other public health measures, helps quell the spread of the virus. Following the science is crucial. Yes, COVID-19 can and does sometimes take the lives of children, and continued spread of the virus in schools is not sustainable for anyone.The order also tells schools they should “marshal any resources” to improve the indoor air quality in school facilities, and we certainly can’t disagree with that. We do wonder, however, how many resources Virginia’s public schools have left after weathering two years of this pandemic.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_43,"With the city’s political and ownership classes tightly transfixed upon the spectacle of a contested mayoral primary, a group of poor and working class Louisville tenants are already taking power back from them.The formation of theLouisville Tenants Unionlast month represents, in part, a local wave in the broader sea change in class relations sweeping the country: The zeitgeist of unionization — from the victorious Amazon Labor Union in New York to the brave Heine Brothers baristas demanding a fair share of the fruits of their labor — is occurring at a moment in American life where those disenfranchised by decades of neoliberal austerity and its accompanying political theater have said, collectively, ”Enough.”Similarly, tenants unions across the United States are seeing victories in all arenas, from rent control policies to eviction prevention, achieved by direct action and legislative pressuring; and we’re the new kids on the block.For our first campaign, we voted to targetCT Group, a private company contracted by theLouisville Metro Housing Authorityto (attempt to manage several public housing sites in Louisville, including the HOPE VI-created Sheppard Square and Liberty Green.We had initially sought to pursue other goals immediately after our formation (elements of a tenants’ bill of rights, for example , but the abuse and neglect perpetrated upon several of our members by CT Group — under the aegis of the LMHA, mind you — forced our hand in solidarity.Scared by the sight of organized tenants, the city quickly tried to placate us with a small treat: Earlier this month, it was announced that the CT Group will stop managing 185 of its current city units on June 30. Plus, one of our union sisters was rehoused.But as Malcom X said, “If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, that’s not progress.”Two weeks ago, we met with LMHA Executive Director Lisa Osanka in a Zoom call to implore her to cancel the entire contract with this slumlord. To our disappointment, Osanka gaslit our members traumatized by the horrific living conditions allowed to fester in these supposed “public housing” redevelopments, even feigning ignorance of the material complaints filed with her own agency over the course of several years.Lisa claimed that the city doesn’t have the power to end those contracts, but that the private investors of these “public” housing buildings do — a stunning admission by a powerful bureaucratic official representing a so-called democratic government.Let us be clear: We don’t hate Osanka. We don’t consider her our enemy, even. But we do want her to feel a fraction of the discomfort that our brothers and sisters feel everytime their broken floorboards kick up strange dust and mold, or their building’s security doors stop working, or are generally treated like criminals in their own homes.We hope that those who know Lisa can convince her to stand with marginalized residents in her charge, and to use her power to end this terrible contract with CT Group so that our members and countless other residents can live in safety and with dignity — just as all people everywhere should.We also wish to stress to the public that the LTU isn’t a liberal protest movement, nor do we consider ourselves activists in the traditional sense. As such, we derive our power not from the state nor from individuals, but from the relationships we build and maintain with each other.We are a disciplined, autonomous union dedicated to prolonged struggle against the forces of capital which dictate our public housing policy, our living conditions, our quality of life and our relations to each other.We are a multi-generational, multi-racial, tenant-led organization dedicated to protecting and fighting alongside poor and working class tenants, and whose mission is to create housing for every tenant in Louisville that is safe, decent and permanently affordable.We believe that housing is a human right, not a commodity.We fight for an end to all evictions, and for community control of housing through the building of tenant power, whether you’re a traditional renter or a mortgage-paying “bank tenant” chasing an increasingly inflated white picket fence.What we are learning from this struggle, right out of the gate, is amazing: After being told our entire lives that real change happens at the ballot box, our early success and the string of union victories blazing across the country have proven that there are other, more democratic methods of making our corners of the world a better place.But this is only possible when we come together and organize, because no one else is going to do it for us.If you or someone you know is having trouble with their landlord, or you want to help organize and empower tenants into a vanguard capable of changing their material conditions for the better, please contact us at 502-438-9048, email us atloutenantsunion@gmail.com, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram..

A plea for kokua to all of you, as well as businesses and corporations, to help reopen Hawaii Care Choices Pohai Malama facility.Partnerships with Hawaii Care Choices would provide a wide range of benefits for everyone in the community, as well as provide tax benefits for the donors. It’s a win-win situation.While our experience staying at Pohai Malama facility, my husband was able to receive outstanding medical care from its wonderful, caring staff and management in the most beautiful state-of-the-art facility. I was also allowed to stay with him at the facility.Management and staff were at our beck and call. Experiencing excruciating pain, he was made comfortable, because Pohai Malama focuses on exceptional pain management care that isn’t offered elsewhere.My husband told me that this was the very best decision we made for us. There is no other facility in the state that is comparable to Pohai Malama.Initially, our intention was to have my husband pass away at home. This would require expert medical care that provided comfort for my husband. His doctor recommended that he be admitted to Pohai Malama. That was the best move that we made.I urge all of you to support Hawaii Care Choices Pohai Malama facility through financial assistance and patient usage, so it can again reopen and provide their much-needed services.So, please donate to a very worthy cause: Hawaii Care Choices Pohai Malama.

eugeneweekly_2022_10,"We ve got issues. The effort to recall City Councilor Claire Syrett is misleading, costly and anti-democratic. I strongly urge you tovote“no.” Councilor Syrett has served with distinction in her 10 years on the Eugene City Council. I know her as a thoughtful, courageous, honest leader who listens carefully to her constituents, stands up for their concerns, and is candid and forthright in council deliberations. The proponents of this recall effort have misinformed voters about their grievances — a practice that impacts the integrity of policy discussions. This recall is not about Syrett’s vote on EmX, which aligned with the majority of council and has been inaccurately described in the petition. It is about a minority of voices, unhappy with a council policy, seeking to unseat a councilor as a warning to other elected officials. It is intended to intimidate. The high cost of this special recall election will come out of the city’s general fund. Concerned about homelessness? Climate? Public safety? Councilor Syrett shares those concerns and is working hard to address them. The cost of this election diverts limited resources to this spurious effort. This recall is anti-democratic. Syrett is serving in her third term. She was re-elected in a high-turnout presidential election year with 59 percent of the vote. The petitioners on this recall disagreed with a single vote by Syrett, and are using that as an excuse to subvert the election results of 2020 with a recall effort during the quiet days of summer when few voters are expecting an election. If voters don’t turn out and say no to this spurious effort, a small minority could unseat a popular and duly elected city councilor We face hard decisions as a city and as elected leaders. Members of the City Council understand that not everyone will agree with every vote they take. For those people who are concerned about EmX, no decisions have been made by the City Council except to explore options, so it is a good time to learn more and pay attention to your opportunities to engage in upcoming discussions. I am proud to serve with Councilor Claire Syrett and proud of our City Council as we address the deep challenges facing our community. We need everyone in Ward 7, and across this community, to engage in thoughtful, respectful discussions of the issues before us. A misleading, wasteful recall is destructive of that important work. If you live in Ward 7, please vote “no” on the recall. Lucy Vinis has been the mayor of Eugene since January 2017.

minnpost_2022_145,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Changes for people with disabilities have occurred at the Minnesota Capitol because of the combined efforts of motivated parents, self-advocates and professional lobbyists to improve accessibility and inclusion. The topics range from education to human services to state government reforms. But inclusion is an acquired taste, until it is natural. More needs to be done to be responsive to the current needs of people with developmental disabilities in the 21st century.Minnesota Partners in Policymaking®, an eight-month training program, was created to helpthose with disabilities or raising children with disabilities, to speak up when laws and policiesdon’t keep pace with changing needs. Were these written after consulting with people who livewith intellectual or developmental disabilities, or have a child with significant limitations?Take Partners graduate Usha Ramakrishnan, a married mother of two. The oldest is an 11-year-old son with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair. For most of his life, he has been in a hospital or at home. Ramakrishnan wants to bring him into the community to expand his mind beyond YouTube. Outings are a challenge because most restrooms are not large enough for her to assist him and still provide privacy. When a restroom is the right size, she thanks the building owner or staff. She’s taken restroom measurements and met with her state senator to discuss accessibility. The building code needs to be updated.Partners training taught this mother to be bold and unafraid. She is asking for a simple solution tohelp her expand her son’s world. This is what moms do.In a broader effort, three Partners families in Maple Grove and Plymouth are approaching theirschool boards and want their children included in all school activities with their peers. Joel Liestman is one of those parents. He says: “Classrooms that provide space to move, and other alternatives to sitting at a desk, have shown to increase student productivity and critical thinking skills. For children needing 1-to-1 assistance because of their disability, studies show that it is more cost-effective to have the paraprofessional with the child in the class than to segregate the child into a different learning area.When kids learn together, it’s helping all kids — neurotypical and non-neurotypical alike.”Parents observe that their children learn more and are more balanced in inclusive classes. Theydevelop social skills, learn to make friends and be a friend, regardless of who has a disability.I, too, am a Partners graduate. Katie, one of my three daughters, has an unexplained dizzinessand started using a walker nine months ago, so mobility issues are relatively new. Goingthrough our first winter, and most of last year, I worked with the school to ensure a safe andeffective system for her. The school was very supportive and helped implement things that wehadn’t even thought of.She was able to do the grand march (Prom in April with accommodations. This was a schoolyear highlight for Katie. The school helped facilitate using her walker and providingparaprofessional support.We continue to take it day by day, and we learn new things every day. Going forward, I will be a more vocal and impactful advocate — and teach Katie to do the same.Mobility is too important in our society to have limits on where and when one can go certainplaces. The now international Partners program started here in 1987 to give parents a voice by “telling their story” of lives impacted by disabilities. When it is your story, it is not easily refuted or challenged, because it is a real-life experience. The class teaches the persuasive, persistent attitude of a lobbyist coupled with friendly kindness to persuade others to join your cause.Individuals who have been silent and shy by the weight of being in the disability world are finding their voice. They speak up, confronting attitudes and labels that talk of marginalized people.Appealing to others’ sense of humanity, they are changing minds and hearts. Those individuals will continue to work with others to make events and activities more accessible and inclusive.I am looking for more bold people who will think out loud and join me in speaking up for theprinciples of the ADA and other federal and state laws that respond to the everyday needs offamilies and self-advocates.Lee Shervheim is chair of the Minnesota Governor’s Council on Developmental Disabilities and a retired engineering director from Medtronic.

minnpost_2022_41,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In a coordinated campaign, St. Paul, Northfield, Grand Rapids and 13 other Minnesota cities stepped up last month to declare climate emergencies. They’re asking for state and federal funding to slow the effects of climate change. This effort, which is both symbolic and concrete, marks an important step toward more action on climate change. But the question remains, who will foot the bill?To explain why this is important to me, I need to go back to 2018.My then-fiance and I are sitting on an overstuffed couch in a small room, facing a premarital counselor. We’re in our third of five sessions and feeling like we are ready for anything. We’ve talked about our family histories, our approaches to money, our thoughts on religion, politics and end of life.But then the question comes that we knew, of course, was going to come. “Do you want to have children?”We look helplessly at one another. It’s something we’d talked about at length, but how do you plan for a future when the world is on fire?We had done our research. Articles I read stated that there’s nothing more harmful to the planet than more humans. I attended an online meeting with 80 other women about whether it’s ethical to have children when we’re in the middle of a climate catastrophe. The general consensus seemed to be, “No, it’s not ethical.”I felt completely lost. How is it that one of the most important decisions a person can make — the choice to bring new life into the world — seemed to have already been decided for me? It was decided not by me, but by people and industries who saw this coming, who knew the irreversible impact of fossil fuels on our planet, and did nothing. They chose this.In 1982, five years before I was even born,Exxon distributed an internal document detailing that its own research showed global warmingwas real and caused by fossil fuel combustion. Further, if reductions weren’t made, “There are some potentially catastrophic events that must be considered.” Chillingly, Exxon also predicted that once the effects were measurable, they might not be reversible.Despite all of this, Exxon and other fossil fuel companies chose to quietly prepare their equipment for climate change impacts while publicly denying the validity of this research . . .their own research.They knew what was happening and how to fix it and they chose to lie and put us all at risk. They took away our choices.Instead of taking responsibility for their actions, Exxon and Shell seemed to point the finger back at me, telling me I would be a bad person if I chose to bring a child into this mess. Intotheirmess.We know that responding to climate emergencies is going to be a costly and, unfortunately, regular and ongoing occurrence. In declaring a climate emergency, these 16 cities from across the state join hundreds of communities across the country in calling on state and federal governments to commit resources to protecting our communities from further damage.Is it fair to ask taxpayers to pay for what these companies chose to do? Are we going to let them get away with it? Again?In Minnesota, we expect businesses to tell the truth and to be held accountable when they do wrong. I recently started working with the climate justice organization MN350. OurBig Deception campaignraises awareness about the urgent need to hold fossil fuel companies accountable and highlights a Minnesota lawsuit that is making its way through the courts. In that case, Attorney General Keith Ellison is suing ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute for taking away our choices, limiting our options and blurring our vision for the future.My husband and I also made a choice. We decided to make a bet on the future; a radical act of hope. Late last year, I found out that I am pregnant.I hope those of you reading this will join me in making a bet on our future while holding accountable those who seek to limit our options and take away our choice. Please, for the sake of the next generation, contact your elected officials and let them know you support holding these greedy companies accountable. Don’t let them take away our choice to live safe and healthy lives.Let’s put the pressure on. Let’s make them pay for taking away our choices before we even knew we had them.Jessie Roelofs grew up in central Minnesota and now lives and works in Minneapolis.

The bond purchases were one of the ways the Fed supported the economy. Stopping the program would be like removing the punchbowl just as the party was getting going.Not so fast. This time around, the financial markets said that bad news was good news.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_77,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°When President Joe Biden screws up, he deserves to be called out just like any other American president.He had already generated considerable controversy with his hat-in-hand visit to Saudi Arabia during the summer to plead for more oil production to ease pressure on oil prices.The valid question at the time was whether Biden was doing it in a sincere effort to help American motorists or to deprive his Republican critics’ of a major point of attack heading into the fall election season.Either way, the visit entailed a high-profile meeting with the de facto Saudi leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Biden had promised to hold accountable for the 2018 murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The full public extent of Biden’s get-tough accountability gestures consisted of a punishing fist-bump greeting with the crown prince.A full-blown handshake was seen as giving people the wrong idea that things were all cordial and friendly.The Khashoggi murder occurred inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, where the journalist and contributing columnist for The Washington Post had gone to finish paperwork for his upcoming marriage. His fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, waited outside as Khashoggi entered the consulate. He never emerged.Henchmen who U.S. intelligence concluded were working on the crown prince’s orders killed Khashoggi then dismembered his body, Mafia-style.Last week, the Biden administration filed a court document stating that the crown prince qualified for immunity in a civil lawsuit by Cengiz regarding Khashoggi’s murder.The U.S. administration wasn’t required to intervene on the Saudi leader’s behalf but chose to do so anyway, citing the fact that the crown prince’s father, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, had recently named Mohammed as prime minister, a purely ceremonial title in a country where the king and crown prince have the final say on all matters of government, including who gets to live and who must die.“Jamal died again today,” Cengiz posted on Twitter, later adding that when it boils down to a question of justice versus money, “money came first.”Two Democratic U.S. senators went on the Sunday talk shows to defend Biden, praising the kingdom’s record as a U.S. strategic ally in opposing Iran and the 80-year friendship that has helped make the United States the beneficiary of low oil prices in exchange for its staunch defense of Saudi Arabia against its regional enemies.We suspect that the U.S. immunity designation, like most situations in international diplomacy, involved some kind of quid pro quo.Maybe it’s about cheap oil prices, or asking the Saudis to make life difficult for China or Russian leader Vladimir Putin.But as Washington Post Publisher Fred Ryan stated Friday, immunity for the crown prince effectively meant granting him a “license to kill.” The bottom line is that Cengiz is correct: Money came first, not justice.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
leoweekly_2022_55,"It looks like obstructionism from Republican leadership is once again going to derail a path for medical marijuana in Kentucky in 2022, squarely keeping our state’s policies rootedin a long and problematic past.Rep. Jason Nemes, a Republican from Louisville, who has been championing Kentucky medical marijuana legislation for the past few years, recently achieved what seemed to be a big breakthroughearlier this monthwhen his medical marijuana legislation, House Bill 136, received support from the formerly opposed Sen. Whitney Westerfield, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee — where the bill would likely land after passing through the House, and if it was hypothetically assigned to a committee.And pass through the House it did — easily, with votes at 59-34 — but it currently seems to be getting stalled out by Senate leadership, as it has yet to be assigned to a committee with the end of the legislative session drawing near.Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary committee held its final regular meeting of the session, without House Bill 136 on the agenda.The Courier Journal’s Joe Sonka reported thatWesterfield said the Senate Judiciary committee could still hold a special meeting for SB 136, but that’s only if the caucus sends the bill to his committee. In that same article, Senate President Robert Stivers told the CJ that it likely won’t happen because of time constraints, and that it gets pretty tight for any little bill, much less any big bill — and that s a pretty big bill from a theoretical standpoint.Sonka provided an update Friday after the Senate adjourned for the week.Long policy wonk story short: even though the House passed the bill, it’s probably not going to advance to a vote in the Senate because of a few extremely powerful people who object to it.Even though Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer told the Lexington Herald Leaderon Thursday that it s done because it lacks support, leadership is likely afraid that, if it reached the full Senate, it could pass on to the governor’s desk, who has signaled he would sign it.So, this is how our representative democracy works: If a couple of dinosaurs don’t like a piece of legislation, they can make sure it never sees a vote. It doesn’t really matter what everyone else in the General Assembly thinks. No Senate debate. No public testimony in that chamber. Just buried.The same thing happened in 2020 — so much for the glimmer of hope that this year would be different.Currently, 37 states are providing some form of medical marijuana access, while 18 also allow legal access to recreational. And HB 136 would be one of the most restrictive bills in the country, with medical marijuana only available for a small number of conditions, including cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and nausea or vomiting.As I wrotein a column last week,“There areother, much better — and profitable — billssurrounding marijuana sitting in the General Assembly, but they are sponsored by Democrats, meaning they probably don’t have a shot in hell. House Bill 136 wouldn’t end all of Kentucky’s issues surrounding marijuana — most pressingly that people continue to get arrested and sit in jail for the same drug that is legally dispensed for fun one state over. Moving forward, we could also use the tax money from complete legalization.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_98,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°After their party’s disappointing performance in the midterms, Republican elites seem to have decided that Donald Trump is their big problem. The Murdoch media empire has been trashing the former president. Many donors and operatives are reportedly rallying around Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. But Trump, who is widely expected to announce his 2024 presidential campaign Tuesday, won’t go quietly.Will Trump secure the nomination despite elite qualms? If he doesn’t, will a man who has never shown any loyalty to his party or, for that matter, anyone but himself, sabotage the GOP out of spite? I don’t know more than anyone else who follows the news.Let’s talk instead about how remarkable it is that someone like Trump managed to dominate one of America’s two major political parties and surely retains a substantial base.I’m not talking about the fact that Trump holds what I consider reprehensible policy views or even the fact that he engaged in several acts, including an attempt to overturn a national election, that can reasonably be described as seditious. Clearly, most of the GOP is OK with all of that.I’m talking instead about the evident perception by many Republicans that Trump is a strong leader, when he is in reality extraordinarily weak.Start with personal character — not my favorite subject (I’m much more comfortable talking about policy , but something that clearly matters when you’re choosing a commander in chief.I don’t think it’s romanticizing the past to say that once upon a time politicians who sought the presidency had to appear, well, presidential. That is, they had to display gravitas and dignity; whatever their behavior behind closed doors, in public they had to appear mature and self-controlled.Trump, however, comes across as 76 going on a very bratty 14. He veers, sometimes in consecutive sentences, between cringeworthy boasting (what kind of person describes himself as a stable genius? and whining, between bombast and self-pity.Beyond personal affect, what stands out about Trump’s time in office is his weakness, his inability to get things done.On domestic policy, Trump ran in 2016 as a different kind of Republican, one who would break with the party’s tax-cutting, anti-government orthodoxy. Once in the White House, however, he was putty in Mitch McConnell’s hands. His only major domestic policy initiatives were a failed attempt to repeal Obamacare and a standard-issue GOP tax cut for corporations and the wealthy.What about his promises to invest in infrastructure? Nothing came of them: “It’s Infrastructure Week!” became a running joke.On foreign policy, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un played Trump for a fool with empty reassurances about denuclearization. China’s Xi Jinping did much the same over trade, getting Trump to pause his tariff hikes in return for a promise to buy U.S. goods that proved entirely empty.In short, Trump’s performance in office was feeble — especially compared with that of his successor.President Joe Biden didn’t get everything he wanted on domestic policy, but he did get a major infrastructure bill and, in the Inflation Reduction Act, both unprecedented spending to fight climate change and a significant strengthening of health care. And Democrats’ unexpectedly strong showing in the midterms probably ensures that these policy successes will endure.Overseas, Biden assembled and held together a coalition in support of Ukraine that has enabled the invaded nation to resist Russia’s attack — a huge foreign-policy success reminiscent of America’s pre-Pearl Harbor role as the “arsenal of democracy.” And Biden’s China policy, centering on export restrictions designed to undermine China’s technological ambitions, is vastly more aggressive than anything Trump did, even if it hasn’t gotten nearly as much media attention.Yet Biden is often portrayed as weak and out of it, while Trump was perceived by 90% of Republicans as a “strong leader” on the day he grudgingly left office. How is this possible?The Trump personality cult may have been enabled in part by forces that go beyond politics. After all, we used to expect dignified behavior from captains of industry as well as politicians. But these days, perhaps because celebrity culture infects everything, business leaders are taken seriously even when they seem unable to refrain from flamboyant displays of ego and insecurity. (Cough. Elon Musk. Cough. Also, the Republican elites trying to distance themselves from Trump spent years fluffing his image. Until a few days ago Fox News, the main source of political information for much of the GOP base, gave Trump the kind of hagiographic coverage you’d expect from state media in a dictatorship.And Republican politicians, many of whom knew Trump for what he was, spent years praising him in language reminiscent of Politburo members praising the party chairman.Now those same elites want to push Trump out of the picture. But while they may be able to deny him the nomination, they probably won’t be able to avoid paying a heavy price for their past cowardice.This article originally appeared in The New York Times."
minnpost_2022_57,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial from theMankato Free Press.We hope Minnesota legislators of good faith consider a self-evaluation and inward prayer-like contemplation to ask themselves if they’re doing everything they can for the people of Minnesota as soon as they can.A legislative special session is one thing they can still do to fill the many unmet needs of seniors, schoolchildren, people with disabilities, farmers and workers.Republicans have rejected Gov. Tim Walz’s offer of a special session that would at a minimum put more money in Minnesotans’ pockets as they deal with inflation and rising gas prices. GOP gubernatorial nominee Scott Jensen had, according to news reports, told GOP legislators to reject the Walz offer and wait for the election. Last week he announced a kind of pie-in-the sky offer to eliminate income tax in Minnesota, something that would empty state coffers to the tune of $30 billion.We suspect he was trying to recover from the untenable GOP position of rejecting Walz’s proposed tax relief in the form of checks of $1,000 per individual and $2,000 per family.It doesn’t have to be this way. Near the end of the session Republicans in the Senate, Walz and Democrats in the House had agreed in principle to a deal that called for $4 billion in tax relief, $4 billion in needed investments in things like special education and $4 billion in a rainy day fund.But the deal fell apart with each side blaming the other. That delay is costing people of Minnesota dearly.A Free Press story in Monday’s edition showed that programs for people with disabilities that have been decimated by the pandemic could return again if the Legislature approved funding for increased wages for people who work with those day service programs that give people with disabilities a sense of pride in earning their own money with dignity.Another story showed an innovative environmental initiative to prevent pollution runoff into lakes where only a few small projects were funded. Again, supporters of the initiative point to the $9.3 billion surplus. Only a small share could fund hundreds of projects across the state.Funding for upgrades to Mankato’s wastewater treatment plant that affects regional communities and many up and down the Minnesota River has also been a victim of political expediency as Republicans wait for election results instead of funding this efficient project at a lower cost.Greater Mankato Growth and other groups like theCoalition of Greater Minnesota Citieshave called for a special session. In abold statementissued earlier this month GMG, the group that represents Republican and Democrat business constituents, urged the Legislature to finish their work for tax relief and business competitiveness.“Facing a record budget surplus, the Legislature had the opportunity to provide meaningful tax relief and make strategic investments throughout the state. None of that happened and instead legislators simply went home without finishing their jobs,” the group said in a statement.“Greater Mankato and the rest of our state cannot wait for next session. Our members are facing real challenges in a difficult economy. We cannot let partisan politics get in the way of economic growth in our state. Legislators need to get back to work.”Walz has said he prefers not to call a special session unless Democrats and Republicans have agreed to a deal. That lets Republicans off the hook as they have said they are not interested in a special session.Interest rates are rising. Everything the state does will cost more a year from now. It’s time to act.We urge Walz to call a special session and see who shows up. That will tell Minnesotans who is serious about tax relief."
minnpost_2022_153,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .This past November, St. Paul voters came together across ethnicity, class and zip code to vote in favor of keeping our neighbors in their homes and adopted a new rent stabilization policy. This policy — crafted by tenant advocates, policy experts and community members, then voted into effect by a clear majority of St. Paul voters — will hold annual rent increases to 3 percent, which is the historical average increase over the past few decades.Few policies outperform rent stabilization when it comes to increasing neighborhood stability. But the idea irritates your amateur economist friend, and now a few developers have threatened to pack up their toys and leave the sandbox. Only, their math doesn’t check out.I love St. Paul. I want what’s best for my city. I grew up in Highland Park eating corned beef on rye at Cecil’s, enjoying the paths along the Mississippi and playing at the Little League fields on South Cleveland. I went to law school in St. Paul, and I’ve spent the past 30-plus years as a commercial real estate finance lawyer, representing a variety of clients including those building multi-family projects. I’ve managed the real estate function for large company portfolios, which included construction, development, leasing, financing, purchases and sales, so I’ve seen a thing or two when it comes to these matters.It’s important for us all to deal in facts, not fear, as the City of St. Paul works to implement the rent stabilization policy that voters approved. Certain developers are now fanning the flames of fear and blaming St. Paul voters in an attempt to hold our city hostage. As the story goes, either we allow them to generate unfettered profit at the expense of community or they’ll disinvest from St. Paul entirely. No one has provided concrete proof to link project pauses or developer flight with rent stabilization. Development takes time, and projects often pause — with now the most likely cause being due to material and labor shortages during a global pandemic.The reality is that St. Paul’s rent stabilization policy brings stability to everyone, something just as important to the economy as housing supply. Despite the cries from developers, St. Pauls’ rent policy balances the interests of the community and the developers that invest in it. It will allow developers to finance projects in line with traditional financing parameters and enable residents to stay in their homes without fear that they will have to pay ever-increasing rents. We should think critically about the outsized role we allow developers to play in this discourse and which ones are the right developers for our communities.Those well-versed in housing finance know that when a developer explores financing options, a pro-forma is created that projects costs and income over a 10 or 20 year period. In my experience it is rare that these pro-formas include rent increases greater than 3 percent. A developer who projects rapidly spiking rents every year is signaling less certainty and therefore a riskier investment to its potential investors and lenders, while a developer who stays within historic market margins — such as 3 percent — signals more certainty and will attract more capital.This translates into how projects are valued and financed. There are many methods, but typically it is based on applying a capitalization (return on capital rate to net operating income (NOI , calculated by subtracting expenses from rent income. The capitalization rate is based on the perceived risk or certainty of that cash flow level being maintained. A higher return offered or required signals perception of higher financial risk and therefore the market designates a lower value of the project. At the outset of every project, developers must determine what kinds of returns they need in order to get investors and/or lenders on board.I may be a lawyer, but we’re not here to re-litigate the decision that St. Paul voters made together. The City of St. Paul must transparently implement the policy that voters approved, without presupposing any specific outcomes based on monied interests. I am proud to be from a city that has set a new standard for housing justice nationwide. Now, let us be guided forward by informed dialogue, real data, and an unwavering commitment to honor democracy and the will of St. Paul voters.Tim Walsh is a commercial real estate finance lawyer from St. Paul."
suffolknewsherald_2022_242,"Published 4:26 pm Tuesday, October 18, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardNearly a year after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s upset victory over Terry McAuliffe, a new poll suggests that the big picture has changed little in Virginia politics: Voters are as divided as ever.The poll, conducted Sept. 18-Oct. 7 by the respected Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, shows Virginia voters are evenly split on the direction of the commonwealth, 42% saying the state is in the right direction, 40% wrong direction.But for the governor himself, it’s been a good year in the court of public opinion.The new poll shows that 50% approve of the job Youngkin is doing. Within the poll’s 4.5% margin for error, that’s about the number that voted for him, and might prove to be the cap of his popularity in a purple state. But of note, the same pollsters asked the same question in February, within weeks of his taking office, and just 41% approved.His standing has approved in every category of voters: Republicans (90% approval in the new poll, up from 85% in February , Democrats (18%, doubled from 9% in February , independents (48%, up from 42% , whites (57%, up from 49% , African-Americans (22%, up slightly from 20% and college graduates (42%, up from 37% .His biggest gains are perhaps the most surprising. Some 47% of women now approve of Youngkin’s performance, up sharply from 32% in February, despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. That decision has helped Democrats across the country and hurt a lot of Republicans, but not Youngkin, who has mostly avoided the abortion question.The governor has also seen a big surge in popularity among young people. Some 48% of adults from ages 18 to 44 have a favorable opinion of Youngkin, according to the poll, up from 32% in February. That too defies national trends that show young people being more liberal and Democratic.Other poll results of interest:On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2022_51,"We ve got issues. As the November climate conference in Glasgow sought agreement among nations to reduce the amount of carbon and methane in the atmosphere and in the oceans, conspicuously missing from their assortment of human created catastrophes — drought, fires, floods, ocean acidification, melting ice, thawing permafrost, famine, etc.— was the root cause of all of them: overpopulation. Also missing from this charade of empty promises and futile projections was China, a country with the world’s largest population and one of the top CO2 producers. Any mention of the exponential number of us on the planet consistently gets a pass from city councils and county commissions, from state and federal legislators, from politicians of every stripe. Even environmental law conferences are gun-shy, largely because any talk of control and reduction is predictably met by accusations of racism, ethnocentrism, elitism, authoritarianism, sexism and sacrilege. Lower birth rates have been a cause for alarm, for economies predicated on endless and inequitable growth depend on a reliable spawn of workers to fuel their superchargers and falter with too many retirees living too long and feeding at the public trough. And so we continue to teem like maggots and feed off carrion of our own making. Cities have nowhere to go but up, hogging the sun from those in the shadows. Or they expand beyond their boundaries where weak, corrupt or non-existent land use regulation — little by little, lot by lot — helps transform forests, farms, natural areas and open space into lucrative real estate enterprises for ever more customers, many of them refugees from some other wasted and risky habitat suffering the same degradation. Shy of falling into the ism trap, many liberal thinkers object that it’s not overpopulation but overconsumption that’s responsible for most of our ills. To be sure, developed nations (America chief among them consume a majority of the world’s resources, most of which are controlled and enjoyed by a small percentage of their consumers. Moreover, developing countries, which consume far less, are suffering most from the catastrophic impacts of those enjoying a grosser domestic product. Clearly, the population-consumption argument isn’t either/or but both/and. However, as the “tragedy of the commons” demonstrates, land has a carrying capacity whose quantity and quality erode according to the numbers and scale of the creatures dependent on it. The pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet has been an ecological, economical and ethical disaster. In 1968, when Garrett Hardin introduced the “tragedy of the commons” paradigm, the world population was 3.5 billion. In 2021, only half a century later, there are 7.9 billion people on earth and counting. It took 2 million years of human history and prehistory to reach 1 billion people and only 200 years to reach 7.9 billion. Even if we eliminate economic inequities and reduce consumption, too many bodies remain needing and breeding and too little land and clean air and water to support them. The pollution problem ultimately is a population problem, as Hardin has noted: “It didn’t much matter how a lonely frontiersman disposed of his waste. But as the population became denser, the natural chemical and biological recycling processes became overloaded.” Already, even as we continue and accelerate our untenable numbers, lifestyles and practices, many places are becoming uninhabitable and the world a melting pot of refugees with fewer places to run to. Suffocating on air fouled by coal burning, as it has perennially in late fall, New Delhi is again facing an entire lockdown of operations, closing schools and businesses. Urban areas across the country are facing the same conditions from ineffective control of industrial pollution, coal burning, car exhausts and the relentless needs of a country with the planet’s second largest population. Yet at the 2021 Glasgow climate conference, India demanded — and received — a last minute change in the final climate agreement from a “phase out” to a “phase down” of coal power. As of this writing, massive amounts of consumer goods are stacked in ports (and accumulating fees with too few to load them onto ships waiting offshore or onto trucks and rail onshore. Blame for this distribution failure has ranged from the pandemic, to accounting errors, to old-fashioned greed, but what impresses is the monumental amount of stuff that has required precious material and energy resources to manufacture. And all of it wanting dispersal to untold numbers of customers. While our numbers have increased and economies have grown beyond local to global scales to serve them, what was economical and in sync with the local commons and its natural ecology has morphed into Economy, whose functions and effects have become alien and diffuse and little understood, much less controlled, by those it ostensibly purports to serve. Economy has become king with a decidedly autonomous and autocratic bent, and the natural environment and its inhabitants mere vassals subject to its dictates and whims. For many the way out of the trap set by the industrial revolution and mass production is another revolution, with renewables and “clean” energy leading the charge — or the colonization of Mars or some other hapless planet boosted by a Musk or a Bezos. Yet why believe that what precipitated an exponential increase of our species will somehow rescue us from its cataclysmic consequences? Glasgow’s focus on carbon and methane merely continued a chronic distraction from facing the real enemy: ourselves, the inordinate and insupportable number of us breeding and consuming too much for the planet to bear. Such conferences will highlight the futility of empty and unenforceable goals and commitments until they ignore the isms, eschew business as usual and recognize the primary importance and environmental toll of human numbers and scale. Until then it’s just more “Blah, blah, blah,” as Greta Thunberg aptly declared — outside the convention doors. Robert Emmons is president of LandWatch Lane County."

minnpost_2022_104,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Substandard eldercare is nothing new. Inadequate staffing, supervision and accountability have been chronic. COVID has merely highlighted and exacerbated pre-pandemic problems. A 2020 Elder Voice Family Advocates report revealed 44% of central Minnesota long-term care providers were investigated for care violations in 2018-2019.Pre-pandemic staff shortages appear tied to low wages and benefits. Meanwhile, the senior housing industry reaped 12% profits over a 10 year period ending September 2020, while according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care hotels earned 4%. Not surprising that between 2000 and 2018 private equity firms increased their investment in the industry from $5 billion to $100 billion according to the New York Times.Inferior eldercare has been systemic, apparently linked to profit enhancement – at the expense of our loved ones, a reality that hit me when a fall upended my mother’s life.Mom, in her 90s, loved assisted living, and everyone loved her. She was active, happily walking (with walker to all activities, attending family gatherings and her church until one day a volunteer, delivering flowers and cookies, ignored her agency’s protocols, removing Mom from exercise activities and walking to her apartment, without contacting staff. She then left Mom there at lunchtime, without notifying staff or bringing her to lunch.Unfortunately, the facility lacked volunteer protocols. Staff never spoke with volunteers. If the volunteer had consulted staff, she’d have known that Mom never walked without staff escort, occasionally needing to sit.Mom’s aide noticed the stranger taking her from exercise but didn’t inquire, and didn’t fetch Mom for lunch 15 minutes later, as scheduled. He waited more than an hour to check on her. Alone in her apartment, a bit confused from an untreated bladder infection (I wasn’t informed of recent wandering episodes which always signaled bladder infection, as staff knew , Mom fell, fracturing her neck.What ensued? Four hospital stays, two rehab placements, a cascade of errors. After the first hospitalization, Mom’s facility terminated her care, after nine years’ residency, saying they couldn’t meet her needs. “We don’t know what Mom’s needs will be,” I protested, unsuccessfully.Everywhere we went: “Have you considered hospice?” Hospice? With no life-threatening conditions, Mom wanted medical, not just comfort, care. An ER doc asked, “What’s your goal for your Mom?” “To get well,” I said. He looked surprised. Ageism? Records indicate staff everywhere expected Mom to live well past six months.No life-threatening conditions, that is, until nursing home rehab, where the care was so substandard that her prognosis declined. It wasn’t just that the Care Plan was ignored –hydration/toileting didn’t happen – but, most critically, they failed to meet Mom’s medical needs.For weeks her first rehab facility failed to address Mom’s bladder infection or monitor her medical status, despite my entreaties. One day she couldn’t even speak or get out of bed. “Shouldn’t she go to the ER,” I pleaded. “Not necessary,” they insisted, though she’d also picked up bronchitis. Finally, against medical advice, I took her to the ER – she had life-threatening sepsis.Sadly, given substandard care, Mom did go downhill. It wasn’t just call button response time often nearly an hour, but, again, staff failed to monitor and address her medical needs, or to communicate with other staff or family. Insomnia went untreated for weeks, despite my pleas, thus ending therapy – Mom struggled to stay awake, failing to make consistent progress.Mom became wheelchair-bound. For 12 days, no walking, despite promised ambulation – two staff were never available to help and family weren’t allowed to assist. Anticoagulant wasn’t prescribed to prevent clots. Staff noted excruciating pain in Mom’s legs, documenting one leg doubled in size – potentially signaling blood clots – but they didn’t take action or inform family.The ER doctor reported Mom’s entire leg was clotted. She died the next day –pulmonary embolism, two days after rehab discharge.Mom didn’t die of a virus or chronic health condition, didn’t die a natural death, as we’d always hoped. She suffered and died due to substandard eldercare and medical neglect in nursing home rehab – a preventable, premature, painful death.How can we, in good conscience, subject our elderly, our kin, to care we wouldn’t tolerate? And given the evidence, why aren’t more people concerned? Do we secretly think they’re disposable and going to die anyway? Short-term thinking, given our destiny. Our elderly have lives of meaning and purpose, and we have work to do.Jean Greenwood is a Minneapolis mediator/facilitator/circle keeper, writer, adjunct professor, and Presbyterian minister with a passion for justice and a love of nature."

The woman with the sign. The man on the stoop, with a dog. The people excluded from society, living in a tent, whose only contentment comes from the moment they shoot up.I was one of them. For one and a half years, I injected heroin in seedy motels, gas stations, and on the streets of Dover, Del. I went to rehab twice, but it didn’t work. I only stopped after my cousin Mickey saved me from dying after an overdose.It began when I was 20, during my junior year of undergrad at Delaware State University, in 2016. I was depressed, with undiagnosed bipolar disorder. No amount of school was going to change my belief that I was never going to find financial security; as an English major, I believed that even if I got a doctorate, I’d just be an adjunct faculty at some college,living in poverty.To escape this reality, I started snorting heroin, then switched to injections when I wasn’t getting high enough. I supported my drug habit by working three jobs tutoring. I thought I had everything under control. But that’s the thing about drug use; you never know if you’re the horse or the rider until it’s too late.“That’s the thing about drug use; you never know if you’re the horse or the rider until it’s too late.”In 2017, I graduated from DSU. Soon after, I entered a motel room behind a Kohl’s in Dover and shot up. And this time, I died.All that happened was I went to sleep. That’s what overdose feels like.I woke up after Mickey shot me up with cocaine, which sprang me back to life. When I opened my eyes, I couldn’t understand why he was crying. Mickey then began to wean me off heroin; I became an alcoholic instead.In 2019, I tried again to obtain a master’s in English at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, but spent my graduate stipend on drinking and snorting cocaine. In the middle of teaching class, my cousin Hal FaceTimed me from Kent General Hospital in Dover. I let my students leave early once I saw Mickey with tubes up his nose. A machine was breathing for him. He had track marks between his toes.“Say hi to your cousin, Mickey. This is Jordan. Tell your cousin goodbye for me. We love you, Mickey,” Hal said.I couldn’t speak.“Jordan … Jordan … are you there? We’re going to take him off life support now. The family is here. Is there anything you want to say to them or Mickey before we take him off his oxygen?”I told Mickey the only thing I could think of: “I love you.”In 2019,435 people died of drug overdoses in Delaware. One of them was my cousin Mickey, who had saved me from the same fate two years earlier.After Mickey died, I knew I had to change. Unlike previous attempts to quit, I faced my emotions with writing and got treatment for my bipolar disorder. I’ve been sober for two years.Since 2019, overdoses have only risen in Delaware, which now has thethird highest rate of overdose death in the U.S.In 2021,515 people died of overdosesin the state, a 15% increase over 2020.» READ MORE:Philadelphians who died of a drug overdose often had sought help for addiction, report findsThere are many reasons why someone overdoses, and no single culprit. But I know from experience that the state of Delaware bears some responsibility. The state puts too much emphasis on abstinence — meaning, quitting without the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder — and not enough on harm reduction policies such as clean needle-exchange programs, overdose prevention centers, and a clean, legal, regulated supply. I witnessed this firsthand. One time, when I ended up at a psychiatric hospital, I told the providers there that I was going to continue using heroin and needed medications such as Suboxone to quit. They refused to provide this lifesaving treatment and discharged me.

Papa says, “If you see it in The Sun it’s so.” Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?Virginia O’Hanlon, 115 West 95th StreetVirginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except what they see. They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s, are little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished.Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.You tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.Veteran newsman Francis Pharcellus Church penned this editorial, which has become the most reprinted newspaper editorial of all time.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

The charismatic figure they had followed for the past three years and in whom they had put their hopes was dead. Before their very eyes, Jesus had been mocked, tormented and crucified like a common criminal.Yet, the disciples did not truly grasp what Jesus was about until Easter Sunday, when He rose from the dead. With His resurrection, they came to understand that His kingdom — and theirs — was not of this world but of the next. And they came to see that out of great suffering can emerge enormous joy. There could be no Easter Sunday without Good Friday.It is this juxtaposition of misery and happiness that has braced Christians to endure war, natural disaster and personal tragedy over the last two millennia.Our prayers this Easter are with the people of Ukraine, who are paying the ultimate price to protect their right to live in a freedom-loving country. In our own community, we’ve seen the loss of life, limb and property. Our heart breaks for the families of the children injured in a downtown apartment fire Wednesday, and we are eternally grateful to the firefighters who risked their own lives to save them.Soaring prices on essentials like grocery and gasoline have many families in financial despair despite their best efforts to make ends meet.This Easter Sunday, as we flock to churches throughout Suffolk, let us remember those who are suffering in our community, in our region and around the world. Let us pray for a change of heart in those who are consumed with death. Let us hope that peace will replace war, that the proverbial swords will be turned into plowshares.As we learned on the first Easter Sunday, miracles do happen.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_94,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Do you know that feeling when you are approaching the end of the school year and your teenage kid has spent the past four months telling you they are doing fine in class, and when you get their report card you finally see that after all of this time, their grades are deeply, deeply disappointing? At this point you realize the only thing that could fix the issue is summer school.Well, that’s the feeling I had when the Minnesota Legislature adjourned on May 23 without passing meaningful bills proposed this year, including ones that promised to promote energy justice, security and equity for the state.As our country prepares for higher energy bills from AC use, recession and more COVID spikes, any and all good news would have been welcome. The state Legislature could have offered us a slice of comfort and positivity. With a historically large state surplus plus federal funds available for leverage, the Legislature could have drastically improved the lives of communities across the state. The bills introduced this past session and agreed upon in conference committees promised jobs, lower energy bills and clean energy funding for schools. But instead of helping us, the Senate failed to pass any of this much-needed legislation.The agreed upon bills would have invested in public schools, renewable energy, infrastructure, Native American schools and jobs. The Climate and Energy Omnibus bill alone would have invested almost $67 million into programs to benefit communities across the state. There could have been $42.45 million invested in solar, including the Solar Rewards and Solar for Schools funds, allowing schools to add low-cost solar to their buildings.Further, Minnesota could have leveraged federal funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Those are our federal tax dollars that we now won’t be able to use in our own state. And after so many lost jobs from the pandemic, the Legislature failed to pass provisions allowing for grant money that would have helped transitioning communities from closing fossil fuel plants to jobs in renewable energy.Minnesotans do not deserve legislators who drag their feet. We cannot wait until the next official session for these bills to be deliberated on again without any promise of passage. The current pace of change is failing those suffering from dangerous levels of pollution.What we need now is the legislature’s version of summer school — a special session. The governor must reconvene the Legislature and urge lawmakers to pass these important policies and budgets. If Republican leadership is truly committed to their constituents, they will do so without further needless delay.To those legislators who put politics above the health and economic prosperity of our great state: I am not mad, I am just disappointed.Jenna Warmuth is the Midwest regional director for Vote Solar, focusing on Minnesota and Michigan."
suffolknewsherald_2022_281,"Published 8:48 pm Friday, September 2, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonIn these days when so many things need a chip to operate properly, there is one thing where one is not essential. It is the backyard garden.The vote for a chip is overwhelmingly yes for almost everything, but it can’t replace the satisfaction of our accomplishments in the “hands on” work needed for growing things. Nothing can replace the experience and the delight of having beautiful flowers or ripe tomatoes and cucumbers for a summer treat.For that and many other reasons I am an advocate for gardening, even in small areas. It is there the owners or the proprietors themselves become the “chip” that performs the needed work. They have an opportunity to become creative, to teach children values they cannot learn in other ways and they may even find neighborliness is a better way of life. Seeing the end result will doubtless be met with satisfaction.The values of gardening are endless. It is a way to increase our sensitivity to what is taking place around us, to sight, smell and sound. Any untended front or backyard space can be vitalized into something of beauty or worth, showcasing flowers or vegetables or both.The beginner does not need a lot of expensive tools. A shovel and a hoe or rake are the main essentials. Beside those, two hands, a willingness to get dirty, maybe to endure some sore muscles that have needed exercise, and a love for God’s creation are sufficient for the beginner.A good comparison might be like the old days when the three-Rs were the first to be mastered. We learned more, and more was required as we grew in our understanding.The rewards of gardening are fresh air, outside exercise, an insight into God’s creation and the delight and joy of being our own chief executive officer. I hope a younger generation will not let go of finding fulfillment in gardening, even when there is failure, as sometimes happens due to weather or other reasons. Some of our best lessons in life are learned when we relive what happened that caused our problems.All this is not to say microchips are not a valuable asset to our lives. They provide a way to communicate and make our lives easier even if they sometimes fail. Recently, a neighbor could not get into his garage. The chip on which he was depending for its opening was not working. It needed some help — an unused new battery. I was outside, happened to see what was taking place and had a new set of batteries to offer, which solved the problem.Neighbors need each other just as gardens need people, not so much to make our lives easier, but to make them more beautiful. Serenity in the garden — the quiet life without anger and threats is a powerful aid to our emotional life. Being outside in the garden we have created, seeing life take on a whole new vista and meaning is sure to bring a sense of satisfaction.I like to say: “I found God in the garden, not the Garden of Eden, but in my own backyard garden.” It was there I saw how the great creator God taught some lessons.The tiny bee is one example. It knows where to look for the nectar and what to do with it. All we know is how to extract and enjoy it.When some striped worms ate my parsley and disappeared I thought they may have died. Instead, I found a chrysalis from which emerged a butterfly, a lesson about death and resurrection. See Jesus’ words in John 11:25. He said, “I am the resurrection and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me.”God has given us the privilege of seeing some of his creative powers as they were when he first brought Eden into existence. A fraction of that beauty can still be found in a garden. Happy gardening, everyone!Myrtle V.

I said: “I see you changed out of your pajama bottoms, but change your shirt as well. You wore that shirt all day yesterday and slept it in overnight.”He sighed and reached in his suitcase for a new shirt.“While you’re in there,” I said, “grab your comb so you can work on your hair. It could use a little help right now.” He sighed again. I could tell he was a little perturbed by my request, but he changed his shirt and ran the comb through his hair, removing some of the bedhead that had his hair matted from a good night’s rest.He was starting to leave when I asked, “What about deodorant?” He groaned loudly as he reached back into his suitcase.We should be teaching children personal hygiene and the need for cleanliness throughout childhood, but these lessons begin to take a new form when children reach the junior high years.Children in middle school are past the times of playing in the bathtub, but they may not have reached the point of caring enough about appearance to focus on cleanliness. This is one reason why caring adults must help young teens learn about the need to take care of their hygiene.We should begin by making sure children understand the changes that are taking place in their bodies and how those changes affect the need for personal hygiene. A discussion regarding personal hygiene should be included in talks about puberty.Setting guidelines or strict orders regarding how often clothes are changed or showers are taken is OK. You may wish to give options, such as what clothes they want to wear or if they will shower in the morning or evening, but the goal is to ensure that they stay clean. There will be times when you may need to say that they are not allowed to wear that shirt again until it is washed or that they must comb their hair before leaving the house.Children should be aware of why we are pestering them about their hygiene and appearance.“I don’t care,” may be a reply if we mentioned wrinkled clothes, unkempt hair or a dirty face, but we shouldn’t let that keep us from helping them maintain their hygiene.The goal isn’t to have children become obsessed with appearance but to help them understand that personal hygiene is important for overall health. We can help them understand, as well, that there is a difference between being vain about our appearance and wanting to look presentable before we leave the house. It’s not about vanity; it’s about taking care of ourselves and helping ourselves always put our best foot forward.Lastly, we must make sure we are lenient in our directions. Children and teens shouldn’t have to be spotless all the time. Having a young teen leave the house with uncombed hair isn’t the end of the world, and it doesn’t make you a bad parent.It’s OK to allow them to enjoy the final years of their childhood, but we should also be teaching them how to take care of themselves and the reasons for personal hygiene.Nathan Rice, a Hampton Roads resident since 1988, is a branch operations manager for a regional credit union in Virginia and North Carolina.

philinquirer_2022_7,"A terrible decision in the crucial Trump documents case by an unqualified Trump-appointed judge spotlights a crisis for American democracy.WhenAileen Cannon— a then-39-year-old junior prosecutor with a resumé that could be charitably called flimsy — appeared before U.S. senators for her summer 2020 confirmation hearing to become a federal district court judge, she also had very little experience giving interviews.We know this fromthe questionnairethat Cannon — a Colombia native whose family later escaped Fidel Castro’s Cuba for Florida — filled out for the Senate Judiciary after she was recommended for the lifetime appointment by Sen. Marco Rubio and nominated by Donald Trump. She acknowledged her only media interview had been a 2009 appearance on the wedding site The Knot — “Aileen and Josh: A Traditional Wedding in Coconut Grove” — in which the couple described how the groom’s wedding proposal during a vacation in Greece had been interrupted by a turtle.» READ MORE:Chief Justice John Roberts defends legitimacy of courtCannon’s somewhat stunning lack of experience or public exposure washighlighted on Twitterby GOP defector and Stand for Democracy founder Peter Vroom, who also noted that “she had never made any speeches, produced any reports, participated in any panel discussions, spoke at any conferences or written for any bar association.” The would-be judge’s writing experience was largely limited to a college internship at the El Nuevo Herald newspaper in Miami, where she covered prenatal yoga and flamenco dancing.Yet Cannon had two huge things going for her in the eyes of Trump, Rubio, and the right-wing project to remake the federal judiciary: She was a product of their conservative grooming project, the Federalist Society, and her relative youth meant she might sit on the bench for decades. She was one of several judicial nomineesrammed throughthe Senate on Nov. 12, 2020 — five days after TV networks called the election for President Biden, signaling that the right-wing judicial pipeline was about to get shut down.Trump seems to have remembered Cannon when he moved to Florida two months later — a private citizen after his failed coup.He even filedhis bizarre “Russiagate” lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and a former FBI agent in Fort Pierce, Fla. — when Cannon was the only district judge — in the apparent hope she would oversee the case. (She didn’t, and the judge who got it instead threw the suit out as “a political manifesto” with no legal basis. But Team Trump did get Judge Cannon fora much more important case— the ongoing probe into top-secret documents that belong to the federal government but were taken by Trump to his Mar-a-Lago club in the Sunshine State. Legal expertsseem almost unanimousin their view that a request by Trump’s lawyers for a special master to review the papers seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago was a legally ridiculous stall tactic. A tactic, they added, withdangerous implicationsfor both national security and the shaky notion that even an ex-president is not above the law.» READ MORE:The Supreme Court has a giant legitimacy crisis, which means so does America | Will BunchThe Trump-appointed judge saw things differently, ruling in favor of the FPOTUS and throwing a monkey wrench into the Justice Department probe into the mishandling of classified documents that reportedly includesensitive nuclear secrets. “This would seem to me to be a genuinely unprecedented decision by a judge,”said Paul Rosenzweig, a former Homeland Security official in the George W. Bush administration, one of many lawyers who ripped the ruling and what its radical notion of “executive privilege” to shield documents holds for an ex-president.Although it’s not clear what might happen on appeal, Cannon’s ruling is hugely important on several levels. It certainly raises the stakes on the question of whether Trump — facing multiple probes not just over missing documents but his involvement with the Jan. 6 insurrection and possible election tampering — can bebrought to justicein a system where scores of jurists, including three on the Supreme Court, rose from his political movement.But more broadly, Cannon and her hard-to-justify ruling felt like a tipping point for a much more serious problem for American democracy: that a Republican project to pack the federal bench with young justices with an extreme right philosophy has succeeded to the point of alsothwarting the popular willof the U.S. electorate on important issues such as protecting abortion rights and the environment, with other fundamental civil rights now under threat.At roughly the same time that Cannon was ruling on behalf of the ex-president who appointed her, a Republican federal judge in Texasissued a decisionthat threatened to seriously undermine Obamacare health coverage — by allowing Christian employers to claim that paying for preventive care around HIV infections would violate their religious freedom.Health-care experts saidthe ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor threatens other preventive and potentially life-saving aspects of the popular Affordable Care Act, such as cancer screenings. The radical ruling by Wichita Falls-based O’Connor wasn’t exactly new. In a separate case in 2018, the former Republican Senate aide — (stop me if you’ve heard this before a member of the Federalist Society, named to the bench by George W. Bush — ruled that all of Obamacare is unconstitutional, only to see that reversed by the high court. The right-wing Texas Attorney General’s Officefamously filesmany of its cases in O’Connor’s district, which has resulted in a range of controversial conservative rulings on issues like transgender rights.Right-wing social activists and backers of the current Trump-fried crusade against democracy shopping for friendly judges from the hundreds of ultra-conservatives crammed onto the federal bench since Bush 43′s 2000 election is, of course, a mockery of the politically neutral, “just balls and strikes” justice system that Republicans hypocritically claim to support.But it’s also just the leading edge ofa much deeper crisis: a now-entrenched judicial branch of the U.S. government that seems determined to impose a ruling philosophy at odds with a majority of the American people — and which is increasingly willing to overturn precedent and sound legal logic to get there. The headline here was June’s Supreme Courtstunning reversalof the 49-year-oldRoe vs. Wadeprecedent guaranteeing abortion rights, a ruling that has alarmed an increasingly less-silent majoritythat other civil rightslike same-sex marriage or even long-settled topics like contraception might fall next.This amped-up war on your basic rights is no accident, but the direct result of the conservative project led by now-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and boosted by Trump. Indeed, nearly a third of federal appeals judges, more than a quarter of district judges and of course three of the nine SCOTUS justiceswere picked by the 45th president, who was impeached twice and is now under felony investigation. McConnell, who famously smashed through the guardrails of democracy to deny a Supreme Court pick for our first Black president in favor of Trump, has calledhis No. 1 priorityto “do everything we can, for as long as we can, to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory.”And of course Republican presidents and senators are going to pick guys (and it’smostly white guys, Cannon notwithstanding who line up with a conservative policy, but people can see the judiciary’s legitimacy crisis is much deeper. Consider, for one example, the Supreme Court’s dramatically increased use of a so-calledshadow docketthat allows the justices to make politically charged rulings both more quickly and with much less openness.This was all happening before the bad behavior of anunprecedented early leakof theDobbsruling that overturnedRoe— most likely from conservatives looking to keep colleagues in line — andrevelationsthat Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, Ginni, was up to her eyeballs in the plot to overturn Biden’s election, even as her husband continued to rule on related cases.No wonder that public faith in the Supreme Court has plummeted toa once-unthinkable lowof 35% for what was once one of America’s trusted institutions. It’s not just that the court’s recent rulings are so unpopular — support for the abortion rights undone by the high court hasrisen to 60%— but also because what increasingly looks like failure to hold Trump accountable for high crimes and misdemeanors, up to and including an attempted coup, makes the maxim that nobody is above the law feel like an absurdist joke to most citizens.A seemingly panicked Chief Justice John Roberts sought to quell the judiciary’s growing legitimacy crisis in a speech Friday in Colorado Springs,in which he said“I don’t understand the connection between the opinions people disagree with and the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.” Roberts seems not to understand what a majority of people see with their own eyes — that respect for the judiciary must be earned, and it is melting away.The crisis can be solved, but three things need to happen. Let’s look at them in ascending degree of difficulty.First, Biden and that narrowest possible Democratic majority in Congress need to put their foot on the gas and accelerate theirpretty-successful-so-far workin filling the current vacancies on the federal bench, with nominees that reflect both the true diversity of the American people as well as our diversity of thought. But related to that, a serious push must be considered to expand the overworked federal judiciary — something that used tohappen more commonlyin the less-fraught 20th century — along the lines of proposals to add 70 new district judges, which has drawn support in the past from Republicans as well as the chief justice.Second, the best immediate protection for civil rights against a rogue judiciary would be for Congress to codify those rights in bulletproof federal legislation.There is a very good chancelawmakers will vote this fall on a measure to enshrine same-sex marriage so that the increasingly anti-privacy Supreme Court can’t overturn its 2015Obergefell vs. Hodgesdecision. Democrats must pledge in the November midterms that an expanded Senate majority would do the samefor abortion rights, voting rights, environmental safeguards, and other basic rights that might otherwise be stripped by the Trump Court.Third, and most radically, Democrats must also promise voters that a 2023 majority will stop dilly-dallying and take up the long-overdue measures of bothterm limitsfor Supreme Court justices as well asfinally expanding the court— which is not fixed in size by the Constitution — to at least 11 and probably 13 justices. Such a move would be assailed as a Biden power grab, but the reality is that it would be a powerful reassertion of democratic rule by the American majority, to undo the legacy of a GOP project to run roughshod over the will of people.In fact, I can’t think of a better moment to start debating this when the public gaze has been on the transition of the British monarchy — which ought to serve as a reminder of why the American Experiment in rule by the people was launched in the first place. Will we really continue to cede our fundamental human rights over our bodies, or whom we can love, to a gaggle of mostly white men in robes who — like King Charles III — are serving lifetime appointments? Or will we tackle the hard mission of reclaiming democracy, like we did in 1776?» READ MORE:SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter"
minnpost_2022_128,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On the streets of Warsaw, Poland in the late 1970s, I often encountered banks of votive lights and small stone monuments marking a spot where the “Hitlerowcy” (Hitlerites killed Polish citizens during World War ll. The reminders had another purpose besides honoring Polish victims. They were to convince Poles that Russians were their true friends and alliance with Moscow – not the West – in their best interest.Few Poles bought the pro-regime propaganda. They knew their history better than that. Yes, it was the Red Army that ultimately drove the Nazis out of Poland, but only after Russia first contrived with Hitler to carve up the country, then did nothing to stop Hitler’s march east until the Fuhrer invaded Russia itself. Russia looks out for itself, not for its fellow Slavs.Because his army was in de facto control of Poland when the war ended in 1945, Stalin could install a government that would do his bidding instead of leaders committed to a democratic future. During the decades of oppressive rule that followed, Poles resisted valiantly until finally overthrowing the detested regime in 1989. Returning to Poland for another assignment with our embassy in the mid-90s, I witnessed a country transformed, a people overjoyed to be free to chart their own course.This is not ancient history to Poles. They count the number of times they’ve been invaded from the east – more than 20 – and believe that, by its brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Russia is again trying to exercise its sway over what it presumptuously calls its “near abroad.”The fundamental lie was that Poles or Ukrainians accepted that Moscow was entitled to a “sphere of influence” over them. They concede no such thing. Anyone watching Ukraine’s heroic resistance can see that such claims are absurd, however brazenly Putin speaks of fraternal solidarity with Kyiv. This is a big bully throwing his weight around, not an older brother protecting a beloved sibling.The lies pile up: Moscow will never invade. Kyiv is run by Nazis. This is a special military operation, not a war. Casualties are light. Russia does not attack civilians. Russia respects humanitarian corridors. NATO is the aggressor. Bad weather tipped over Russia’s flagship carrier. And so on. George Orwell’s novel, “1984,” could be retitled, “Ukraine, 2022.”By using brute force to destroy everything in his path, Russian President Vladimir Putin may, in the end, conquer much of southern and eastern Ukraine. But he will not gain the cooperation needed to govern or administer it effectively. That requires a degree of “soft power” – the ability to attract or persuade or inspire – that Putin’s Russia so obviously lacks.If anything, Ukrainian nationalism is now stronger than ever. Ukrainians are demonstrating that they want to govern themselves, that they will give “the last full measure of devotion” to escape subjugation to Moscow’s dictates.Today it’s Ukraine’s turn to fight for its independence and territorial integrity, whether secured through membership in NATO or by some form of agreed neutrality. Moldova, seemingly already in Moscow’s crosshairs, could be next. Georgia, too, is highly vulnerable. Putin’s ambitions might also extend to former satellites that have made it into NATO, such as Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Though he is less likely to want to risk a wider – possibly nuclear – war by directly attacking a NATO member, stepped-up vigilance is required.However the war for Ukraine turns out, we need to be clear-eyed about what is happening there. This is a big power bent on conquering a smaller one. Putin’s claims to the contrary are lies. If he sets up a new government in Kyiv – or in part of the country – it will be illegitimate and should be rejected. Sanctions must be maintained and Moscow as well as its puppets regarded as pariahs until Putin or his successor ends Russia’s aggression. No country has the right to rule another against its will. Think Lincoln at Gettysburg and the sacred commitment to government of the people, by the people, for the people. Ukrainians want and deserve no less.Dick Virden is a retired minister-counselor in the State Department’s Foreign Service and a graduate of the National War College.

One thing is sure, without God we humans are helpless under the hands of powerful rulers. Biblical narratives make that plain. Kingdoms rise and fall. They always have.The Old Testament has dozens of illustrations, but the Book of Daniel, named for a young Jewish refugee God used in a drama recorded more than 2,500 years ago, is worth reading.The kingdom was Babylon, first mentioned in Genesis 10 and still relevant today, and the king was Nebuchadnezzar, whose army had conquered Israel. We will call him “Neb.”“Neb” was ruthless. He conquered Israel and took the captives out of their land, leaving only the poorest. Psalm 137 records their distress. His army ravished their temple, burned it and took all its expensive furnishings to Babylon. Some of the gold pieces became a part of his idolatrous lifestyle.The other prominent character is Daniel himself. He and his three young Jewish friends were among those taken but were chosen by Neb to have three years of indoctrination time to study the language and culture, after which they were to be placed in the king’s service. Daniel was given the name Belteshazzar; his friends’ names were Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. They lived through very frightening and perilous times, but God was watching over them, sufficient and still in control.The narrative begins with a challenge. These four young men refused to eat the rich food or drink the expensive wine served to them. They were stalwart in their faith.This powerful king thought all the kingdom’s power resided in him. He did not reckon with something so insignificant as a dream which left him on edge. He was adamant about finding its meaning, but none of the astrologers, magicians and soothsayers could interpret it. He consigned them all to death, but then he was told about Daniel.Daniel was brought before the king. His was a message we and our leaders would do well to remember today: “Wisdom and power belong to God who changes the times and epochs, removes and establishes kings, gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding…He knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with Him.” He told King Neb the future was not in his hands but was under God’s control. God will not give His glory to another.The story is so dramatic it must be left for the reader, except for one thing. Daniel “saved the day” for all the magicians and conjurers, but evil was still present. We should not be surprised to find Daniel and his friends facing severe opposition. It happens to all who stand for the truth as God has revealed it.Daniel’s life was dedicated to God. He used the gifts God gave him and became His witness without backing down.As the story ends, Daniel has aged. His prophetic words in the final chapters of the book have been rehearsed many times, but he himself would not live to see them fulfilled. He was told to “shut the book until the end times.” Much has happened through the millennia. Chapters 11 and 12 continue to bear an eerie resemblance to what Jesus said and what the New Testament writers have written about the perils of “end times.”Daniel lived through a tragic period. We have the same challenge today. His faith was anchored in the living God. We have the Bible to tell us how to remain loyal to God so we can face any challenges ahead. Let’s be sure our hearts and lives are right with Him. It starts with I John 1;9, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” That is how we get into God’s presence. He graciously accepts sinners who confess their sin.Myrtle V. Thompson, 94, is a writer who loves and teaches the Bible.

leoweekly_2022_1,"As I’m writing this, you have information that I don’t. For me, it’s Monday night, about 20 hours before the polls close on Election Day. For you, it’s Wednesday morning or after, and the results of who won the races and the fate of the ballot amendments are likely well established. Did Craig Greenberg cruise into the mayor’s seat? Did Morgan McGarvey even break a sweat on his route to Congress? Is Rand Paul returning for a third term? Or were there upsets? How compromised is the future of abortion access in the Commonwealth? You probably already know (at least some of those answers, but one of the only things that I know so far is that the aforementioned incumbent Republican U.S. Senator, Rand Paul, ran a cowardly and dangerous campaign against his progressive counterpart Charles Booker.Days after Paul missed the deadline to accept an invitation to a candidate forum hosted by KET in early October, and it became clear he was not going to answer Booker’s calls for a debate, the senator worked to flip the narrative by releasing an inflammatory ad. It was a doom-and-gloom video suggesting Booker befriends violent people, and that the challenger wasn’t actually interested in an exchange of ideas, despite calling multiple times for exactly that.It’s a loaded and gross ad that is accusatory toward several prominent local Democrats, but the tagline at the end is the most explosive aspect: “It’s clear: Charles Booker doesn’t believe in civil discourse, only violence.”Booker, who ran a campaign on unity and hope, was framed as aggressive and militant. Paul choose to fan the flames and heighten the political temperature through partisan dogwhistling, which, in the current climate, is extremely dicey and irresponsible.In an appearance on Fox News shortly after the attack on Paul Pelosi, Rand Paul spoke of the parallel between the Speaker of the House’s husband’s recent hospitalization after being hit by a hammer during a home invasion, and his own experience of being tackled and severely injured by his neighbor in 2017. At first it seemed that Rand Paul — who has been unnecessarily made fun of about the attack on him — was going to be level-headed during a time when misinformation was spreading like wildfire. While he didn’t lean into deep conspiracy, he, after trying to initially sound empathetic, almost instantly made the situation about politics, accusing the Dems of creating a “misdirection.”“I think we should have some compassion for Paul Pelosi and not make everything about politics,” he said on Fox News. “But I see today, and yesterday, all the left-wing is doing, all the Democrats are doing, are trying to make this about politics and I think this is a misdirection thing to get away from all of the things they are doing so terribly with the economy, with crime and everything else.”How do you contradict yourself that hard in less than 100 words? He thinks he’s throwing out feints within feints here, but this is just blatantly egregious political pandering. There’s no buffer between the show-some-compassion-this-is-about-more-than-politics part and the Democrats-are-ruining-America part.This isn’t a low-stakes situation. In terms of the Pelosi attack, there’s a disinformation campaign centered around a man who committed a crime after being radicalized from disinformation campaigns. Several right-wing politicians and pundits are spreading it. The richest person in the world — who now owns a major social media network — posted a link to a debunked conspiracy theory about the attack.It was an opportunity for Rand Paul to rise above that. He failed.Even looking back at Paul screaming at Dr. Anthony Fauci during the peak of COVID, it was clearly political theater, more of a PR stunt than a conviction contest. He was campaigning. A viral batshit video is essentially a free campaign ad when you’re trying to inflame a certain base.To me, it’s clear that Paul is floundering as he’s morphing into something that he once claimed to hate: a career politician who spends their time playing the game instead of working for the people. And he’s diving in hard during a significantly dangerous time to do so. •. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_278,"Published 7:20 pm Tuesday, September 6, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:Over the past several months our mayor and councilmembers have heard innumerable objections to the Port 460 project. The reasons presented are as diverse as the individuals presenting them, from environmental damage, to crippling effects on local businesses, to parents viewing the statistical certainty that this plan will directly – with 99.99% certainty – cost the lives of local school children.I myself have presented more than 20 years of national data showing the harm that occurs when warehouses are placed close to metropolitan centers, particularly to minority communities. The developers have admitted the massive cost to the city for infrastructure and maintenance. From a practical standpoint, truck related accidents on U.S. 460 are already too common and adding more freight traffic is a timebomb.Counter to these arguments, you have heard projections for job creation, tax revenue, and the inevitability of such development. While these numbers are spurious, the reality is that progress is necessary, and these projects must go somewhere. We concede that, however our city has delivered multiple warehouse districts to the benefit of the state and the port. There remains growth within those districts yet to be realized without robbing your citizens of yet another portion of their city.Regarding the concerns about land use, Mr. Williams has offered the best resolution yet: a solar farm. Solar farms require no rezoning, no infrastructure improvements, have no impact on the school zones or traffic, do not affect runoff or the environment, and preserve the land for future development. With evolving state codes, North Carolina has seen an average 2000% increase in local tax revenue from solar farms, with numerous proffers to the community. The ultimate benefit is that by restricting warehouse districts to their current locales, you can continue to attract port business while focusing infrastructure improvements where they are most needed. This is an ideal strategy that addresses the needs of the citizens, the state, the port, and Mr. Williams.At this moment in time our representatives have a choice to make – one which will forever affect the future of historic Suffolk. They can approve this project, based on the “used-car pitch” that it is a one-time opportunity, or they can pass on it. Should they embrace rezoning, there will be no second chances. Any miscalculation or deviation from the advantages presented by Matan will be indelibly branded on the future of Suffolk.If they abide by the zoning already in place, the future of our city remains open, and all avenues of growth, including a responsible relationship with the port, may be pursued.For the future of our city and our children, I ask them to choose wisely. Those pleading for rezoning do not live here. We do.Gerard Celia, PhD, HCLD, TS, CCSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_31,"Published 5:57 pm Tuesday, July 19, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceColumnistHe was digging through his suitcase and grabbing what he needed to go to bed.“Don’t forget to brush your teeth,” I said. “I know,” he said as he pulled out the needed items to clean his pearly whites. “You’ve told me every night this week, so it’s kind of a habit now.”He comes from a home without much care, so a nightly reminder to take care of his teeth was something with which he is not familiar. However, oral hygiene habits began forming on the fourth night of our week together. The practice started to develop because he learned that brushing his teeth was an expected part of preparing for bed, and he knew that I would remind him every night.As we work with children and youth to build good habits, we should set expectations, give constant reminders and follow up as needed.The first key is to make sure that they understand the expectation that you are setting. There’s no expectation at Timothy’s home for him to brush his teeth, so I had to make sure that he knew that while we were together, brushing his teeth every evening before going to bed was an expectation.I spoke with him several times before about the importance of brushing his teeth often, but I am unable to remind him to take care of this task before he heads to bed since I am not with him most evenings. This week, however, we were staying near each other, and I could work with him each night.However, getting him to brush his teeth every evening didn’t come from my ability to share about oral hygiene, cavities or the connection between a healthy mouth and his overall health. He started brushing his teeth only when I was there to remind him every evening as he prepared for bed.Next, constant reminders are important as they can help children and youth get into the habit of doing what they need to do. It lets them know, as well, that it is important enough for you to mention it over and over.Lastly, it is important to follow up with them to ensure that what you have asked has been followed. A reminder without some verification may not be that helpful. I made sure I saw a toothbrush and toothpaste in his hands as he headed to the bathroom. I didn’t have to watch him brush his teeth. I trusted him enough to complete the task once he has the items needed and is heading to the bathroom, but I did make sure he had what he needed.We shouldn’t have to be harsh investigators in most circumstances, but we should be looking to ensure that the steps we have asked that they take are being followed.Building a good habit isn’t easy for most people, and it’s even more difficult for children who often lack the self-discipline to do necessary things or the foresight to understand the future consequences of poor habits. Therefore, it is up to the adults in their lives to set the exception, remind them consistently and follow up to ensure completing what is expected.Nathan Rice, a Hampton Roads resident since 1988, is a branch operations manager for a regional credit union in Virginia and North Carolina.

leoweekly_2022_38,"This is the question many of us are asking after we read what appears to be a frothmouthed Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade in a case styled Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.The reproductive rights movement has been diligently planning for this, and those folks are organizers par excellence. They will raise all the money, drive all the miles, smuggle all the pills and do whatever needs to be done. I can’t answer the “what now?” question when it comes to what reproductive justice orgs are going to do, and if I could, I wouldn’t do it here.I can, however, explore a little bit of “what now?” when it comes to the federal courts. For more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has been a party to the neoliberal détente, struck between a developing corporatocracy and the working classes in the 20th century. From the perspective of the ruling class, the terms of that détente are, in essence:We’ll give you your individual liberties, so long as you let us make gobs of money however we damn well please; and we won’t drop you out of helicopters and/or you won’t guillotine us.Under this tacit agreement, we can wear jackets that say “fuck,” but unions are brought to heel; we can marry people of a different race or the same sex, but winning a lawsuit against your employer is going to be practically impossible; we can consume all the crush porn we want, but corporations are people and cash is their free speech, and so on. Not a great way to do society, but I suppose it could be worse.This configuration of the Supreme Court is unflinchingly willing to blow up that bargain. This is laid bare by the Dobbs opinion, but the Court has been sending a not-so-subtle message to red-state legislatures for a while now. The message is: Do your worst. We won’t stop you.In the long run, maybe this is good, because it prods us to stop seeing American institutions as sacred and holy, and start seeing them as the blasphemous things they are. The courts have long been terrible on all sorts of run-of-the-mill Civil Rights issues, but you wouldn’t know that unless you had a closeup look at them, and anyway there are these big SCOTUS wins, so they can’t be all bad. Now we can observe the reality, which is: Yes, they are all bad.In the short run, of course, the Court’s collective urination on the neoliberal pact will be devastating. There’s the obvious issue of: What if they come for our other rights? That’s a scary thought, sure. But a far more terrifying experiment is to ask: If they decide to roll back all the progress of the 20th century to make way for the ill-conceived, warlord-run, Old Testament Libertopia that the far right wants, what options do we have to prevent it?This is where my imagination comes up short. I’m an American lawyer, trained in an American law school. I, like all lawyers, am necessarily an “establishment” type. The primary way I know of to go about making things better is by using the institutional lemons that some old slaveowners put in place centuries ago, and hoping for something potable to dribble out.This romantic view of the role of change-making lawyers is no longer tenable, I’m afraid. We are entering an era in which we must accept that the courts are barriers to — not conduits for — justice, liberation, peace, wellness and all the other stuff we might want as humans with finite life spans. And so long as those barriers persist, the reforms we so desperately need in this country will be impossible.Think of the best case scenario for the Roe problem: Congress is reluctantly roused from its state of suspended animation and decides to pass legislation codifying the federal right to an abortion. Within a month, SCOTUS strikes down the law. Now what?Or suppose President Biden decides to “pack the court” with new justices who reverse Dobbs, thus reversing the reversal of Roe. Even assuming that this could happen (which is a sparkly-eyed, cotton-candy fantasy , there is no way that red states would accept the legitimacy of any decision by a 13-plus member Court. They’ll go right on prosecuting women and doctors, creating a situation that is impossibly weird at best, heinously violent at worst.You can apply this logic to just about any scenario you can come up with. Say the backlash from Dobbs leads to the election of “radical” Democrats nationwide, and Congress decides to pass Medicare for All (again, a gratingly naive daydream . A wave of the Supreme Court’s wand and ZAP — unconstitutional. Free college? Paid parental leave? A Green New Deal? Not in my lifetime.So the answer to “What happens now?” is not one that I see any pleasant answers to. We are going to be in a protracted battle to determine how far backward in time we go, how much ground we give, how many of our hard-fought liberties we are willing to sacrifice. Moving forward won’t be possible within our existing framework. And the demolition of that framework, even if sorely needed, will come at a frightfully high cost.Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor.

suffolknewsherald_2022_151,"Published 6:40 pm Friday, March 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan Rice“Max is dead.” I stopped to process the news, sighed, and hung my head. It was a call that I was hoping would never come, but it wasn’t a call that came as a big surprise.Max and I were good friends growing up. We lived a few doors away from each other, and it was hard to find a day when we weren’t together. Unfortunately, Max began using drugs as he got older, and our lives took different paths. He had some good times, but he was never able to shake the vice that would end up taking his life.As I stood up to speak at his funeral, I couldn’t help but think of his life and wonder what might have been different if drugs hadn’t taken hold of him. Could we have gone to college together, lived near each other as adults, and continued the good times together into our old age? I’ll never know.It seems that drug use today is becoming more acceptable than it was several decades ago when the “Just Say No” to drugs campaign was spread throughout our nation.A lot has changed in the last 40 years, but what hasn’t changed is the fact that illicit drugs still destroy lives, break up families, damage our society, and kill. That has not changed.While the government’s “war on drugs” from decades ago may have waned, I hope our personal war against it has not stopped. I’m not an addiction expert, but I know three things that we can all do that would make a big difference.First, what if we as society took to heart the old “Just Say No” campaign and refused to take that first hit of a substance that so often leads to destruction? What if we all decided that the high that came wasn’t worth the potential consequences of what came after the initial thrill?We must work together to spread the word that there are better ways to deal with the struggles of life than by turning to drugs. Let’s join together to commit to never use illicit drugs ourselves and to help those who are tempted to turn to drugs find another solution.Next, lives could be saved if those struggling with addiction made the decision to do whatever is needed to get clean. I can only imagine how hard this can be, but I know it can be done because many have broken free from addiction. There are many groups like Narcotics Anonymous and Celebrate Recovery that can help.Lastly, what would happen if each of us truly supported those who were trying to break free from the grip of drugs? A difference could be made if we, as a society, began doing all that we could to help others break free and supported groups that know how to help.I know there’s no easy answer. I’m aware the three steps that I’ve listed are brief, but I am hopeful that these words will help few people commit to battle a problem that has taken so much from us already.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_2,"Published 9:12 pm Friday, December 16, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIf warehouses, forklifts and 18-wheelers are your indicators, Suffolk’s economy is on a roll.MS International Inc., a flooring, countertop, wall tile and hardscaping products distributor, has announced plans to build a 548,000-square-foot distribution facility on Holland Road and create 80 jobs – another in a string of logistics-sector projects coming to town.State officials, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, were gleeful in announcing the $61.6 million project, saying they competed with Georgia, New Jersey and South Carolina to get it. Locals, still bummed about a controversial City Council decision a few months back to allow a massive warehouse complex in the heart of the city, were far less enthusiastic.MS International officials shouldn’t take it personally. This is part of an ongoing “family” squabble between a citizenry worried about adding ever more truck traffic to already-inadequate road infrastructure and leadership seemingly content with logistics jobs as Suffolk’s economic identity.All of that is beyond the control of MS International, whom we welcome to Suffolk. We certainly don’t blame its management for picking our city, which has much to offer. We hope those making the decisions will hire locally and maximize the economic impact of the Holland Road facility.As citizens fret about the impact of more and more 18-wheelers on their quality of life, we’re reminded of the urgent need for Suffolk’s elected and appointed leadership to share their vision for the city’s economic future.Is it to simply be “all in” on warehousing jobs and keep rolling out the red carpet anytime the Port of Virginia or state economic developers need to site another distribution facility? Is there no limit on how many will be built? Is there a concrete plan for funding the road infrastructure that will be required for a strictly warehouse economy? Or is the strategy to simply hope the state will cough up the money?We hope our leaders have a different vision and very soon pivot away from warehousing, say “enough is enough” in that sector, and embrace a bold strategy for competing for and getting the high-tech jobs currently going to thriving suburban regions such as Northern Virginia and North Carolina’s Research Triangle.Logistics facilities gave Suffolk a boost when little else was happening in economic development a decade ago.

Suffolk public school grads will get their diplomas this weekend. We’ve been inspired by reporter Jimmy LaRoue’s profiles of the valedictorians for each school. What a smart, talented, motivated group of young people.As the graduates convene one last time as a class before heading down their separate chosen paths, it is our hope that they cherish and relish the moment and reflect back on the 12-plus years it took to reach this achievement.Late-night cramming sessions. SAT prep classes. Elementary school recess. Boring driver’s education videos. Exciting victories on the basketball court. Stunning defeats on the baseball diamond. Flunked classes. Spelling bees. Spring musicals. Book reports. Gym class. Pop quizzes.And then there was COVID-19 to disrupt much of their high school years, robbing them of time-honored traditions.Every failure and success has brought them to this point. As they walk across the stage to accept their diplomas, one chapter of their lives concludes. We wish them the best in all their future endeavors, as they begin the next chapter in their story.The graduates will soon find out the difference between school and life.

minnpost_2022_82,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When Florida schools begin their 2022-23 school year, teachers will have lost 41 percent of their available math textbooks.That’s because the state of Florida seems determined to use children of all races as pawns to promote a political agenda — one aimed at reinforcing racism, rather than dismantling it. Earlier this year, as part of its controversial “Stop WOKE Act,” the state of Florida banned54 math textbooks.These books reportedly contained prohibited topics, including so-called references to critical race theory, or CRT.After being asked to reveal specific examples of the offending material, the state offered a mere five screenshots, including a statistical analysis of racial prejudice and a mention ofsocial and emotional learning.It is difficult to find, in recent memory, any policy that does a better job of illustrating white supremacy and systemic racism than the “Stop WOKE Act” and the subsequent banning of math textbooks.Having a powerful group mostly comprised of white men unilaterally decide what is and isn’t racist and what can be taught about racism is itself a perfect illustration of systemic racism. The math textbooks have been found to contain no mentions of critical race theory. A majority of reviewers gave the books “perfect or near-perfect marks” according to the Washington Post. That they can be banned to justify the state’s backward policy somehow is a perfect example of how white supremacy hurts everyone.CRT is being used as a scare tactic by proponents of the “Stop WOKE Act” and similar legislation. However,CRTis a fundamentally positive thing for anyone interested in seeing racism eradicated. The mere mention of the existence of racism is not CRT.Politicians and political pundits who spent their careers stoking racial anxieties and supporting racist policies have co-opted this term to inject confusion into any anti-racism efforts, including efforts to teach accurate history.In a country that has supported genocide, enslavement, internment, segregation, racial housing discrimination, education bans, lynching, medical experimentation and voting bans, it is absurd to suggest that teachers should not talk about racism.If we want to learn from the mistakes of our past, we have to educate our students about them, so that we, as a country, do not repeat them. Racism will endure if we pretend that it doesn’t exist.Anti-racism efforts like CRT are only political because they have been politicized. Regardless of a person’s political orientation, we should all find common ground and agree that racism is a social ill that should be eradicated.The “Stop WOKE Act” signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis transports this country back to a much darker time. Not since the state of Missouri banned all Black people from getting an education in the state, free or enslaved, can I think of a policy that has made such a clear attempt to debase the education of children for purely racist reasons. As Fredrick Douglass warned, “it is easier to build strong children than to repair broken adults .”Turning away from this country’s racist past and building an anti-racist future depends, and has always depended, upon our ability to raise the next generation to be better than the last, and we have come too far to go back now.Matthew Kincaid, a former social studies teacher and school administrator, is founder, CEO and chief consulting officer of Overcoming Racism.This commentaryoriginally appeared inThe Hechinger Report."

The new is not identifiable, so we tend to try and get back to the “that.”The stirring feels uncomfortable, uncontrollable and unacceptable. We try so hard to regain what was lost, not realizing that we cannot go back to the possession that once “was” in order to find the “what is.”What are you trying to recover in your life? Is the recovery process worth the fight? What happens if what you were searching to recover still feels stolen or lost once it is back in your possession? What happens when the possession no longer fits and indeed is truly now “stolen” even if you were the original owner?My charm bracelet holds a special place in my heart because each charm represents a piece of my life; it represents my journey, my passions and my battles.One day, I was cleaning the house, and I forgot to remove my bracelet. When I removed my hand from the water, my bracelet “appeared” rusty, dark, gritty and tarnished. My heart skipped a beat because I could not recognize the beauty that was once there. I ran some water over the bracelet, yet the new “dirty appearance” stayed the same.Feeling as if I could not find a solution, I placed the bracelet in an “I don’t care place,” and I moved forward. When the bracelet was up to my standards, I was careful with placing it in a safe place. Now that the bracelet did not meet my standards, I became careless with the protection.Don’t be afraid that where you are right now may seem rusty, dark, gritty and tarnished; there is a solution to your recovery.I decided to research how to clean the bracelet, and was excited when I found out that baking soda and vinegar would restore what I thought was lost. As I placed the bracelet in the mixture, I could see remnants of darkness coming off the bracelet. It was beginning to look like what I knew, but the beauty was still not recovered to its natural state at that point. I began to wear the bracelet again despite its appearance.Are you willing to wear transparent clothing of truth to share your story with the world? Stop being afraid of your remnants that may be surfacing. God is soaking you to refine you.I shared my story with my mom when she realized that she had some “special cleaner” that would restore my bracelet. Get this: The “special cleaner” was purchased over seven years ago, so there was no way that it held its potency for that long. When I saw the bottle, it “appeared” bruised with a hole on the side.My mom shook some out on an old towel, and we began to dip each charm in the substance, scrubbing with a toothbrush, wiping vigorously and buffing on a rag and then soaking in water. I was beginning to see a new beauty that I had never seen before. You see, the baking soda and the vinegar started the process, but the “special cleaner” finished the process.Sometimes, you have to take that situation and dip it, scrub it, wipe it and buff it and baptize it in the process of recovery.The new look was so captivating that we decided to clean more things. We cleaned an old vase, rings and an anklet.God’s love for you will continue to multiply in recovery. You are a recovered charm. If you are looking to be restored back to the original beauty, you are walking in an ugly truth. God wants to polish you to a new level of beauty, passion and courage.The baking soda and the vinegar will remove the remnants that are trying to destroy you. The “special cleaner,” which is the Word of God, will restore you to the “what is.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

We hope it inspires readers as much as we were inspired by the stories of the heroes featured in this year’s edition.Begun a couple of years ago soon after the outbreak of COVID-19, the edition is a collaboration with our journalistic “cousins” at The Tidewater News in Franklin, The Smithfield Times and Windsor Weekly. We thought it might be a one-time publication, but feedback from readers was so positive that we’ve continued to publish it annually.The truth is that the people who, through volunteer service or their vocation, serve their fellow man were doing so long before COVID, and continue to do so today as our lives return to normal after two years of lockdowns and other pandemic-related disruptions.There’s a whole lot to love about Western Tidewater, but one of the best is the comfort of knowing that it is filled with caring community servants who will be there in our time of need. This year’s Heroes edition features a range of such servants, from a Suffolk firefighter who rescued children from a burning apartment building to a Southampton County minister who has tended the spiritual needs of his congregants and others for decades.Narrowing the list of heroes we feature each year is a difficult task. So many are deserving of the spotlight for what they do day in and day out to serve others.If you know someone deserving of inclusion next year, please let us know with an email to news@suffolknewsherald.com.

leoweekly_2022_18,"The Supreme Courthas ended our federal constitutional right to abortion and overturnedRoe v. Wade— turning its back on nearly 50 years of precedent. The court has failed us all — especially our most vulnerable communities who have arguably been living in a post-Roereality already, due to barriers to accessing abortion and other healthcare services that have always existed. Barriers like, finding childcare, taking time off of work and navigating the costs of transportation and lodging associated with traveling hundreds or even thousands of miles to the closest provider. With this new decision, the number of people dealing with these obstacles to get the essential healthcare they need will skyrocket.But Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates of Kentucky will not back down. We have the majority behind us in supporting access to safe and legal abortion, and we must do everything within our power to protect it.We can do that by voting no on Amendment 2 this November, a dangerous constitutional amendment that would explicitly eliminate any state right to abortion in Kentucky. Make sure you are registered to vote and join Protect Kentucky Access, the coalition working against the amendment atwww.protectkentucky.com.AfterRoefell, Kentucky’s “trigger law” went into effect immediately, banning abortion across the state. Soon after, Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Kentucky sued to restore abortion access under the Kentucky state Constitution. Right now, abortion is accessible because of a temporary restraining order while we continue to argue in state court that our state constitution affords Kentuckians the right to access abortion under the right to privacy and self-determination. This is it. Our state Constitution is our last chance to protect a basic right to care for Kentuckians today and in the future.Miscarriage. Ectopic pregnancy. These are all forms of pregnancy that can require an abortion for life-saving care. Yet politicians with zero medical background are inserting their opinions into our exam room, forcing physicians to withhold care or face criminalization. Forcing pregnancies that could not only jeopardize a person’s wellbeing but their right to decide their own future.The consequences of the Supreme Court decision have been swift and devastating for communities nationwide: OverturningRoemeans 26 states could swiftly move to ban abortion, including 13 states with laws that could immediately go into effect. That means in half the country, people would no longer have power over their own bodies and their own lives. If we don’t protect our state Constitution at the ballot box in November, immediately one million women and people who are of reproductive age will lose access to abortion.No exemptions for rape, incest or the life of the pregnant person. Nothing.Generations before us have fought tirelessly to gain and protect the rights we have today. Planned Parenthood will not back down. Together, we are going hard to make sure that everyone has the care they need to control their bodies and build their futures. That means no politicians, no bans, no judges should block our personal medical decisions. It’s not over. We have strength in numbers and power in our united voices.Join us in protecting Kentucky access. Vote “NO” on Amendment 2 this November. •. ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_5,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°On Dec. 2, Gary Rasor, an 83-year-old worker at Home Depot, died from injuries he sustained after being violently pushed to the ground while on the job. Rasor had worked at the store as an “associate” for nine years, and celebrated his 83rd birthday in the hospital just days after the attack.Rasor’s fatal assault at work may seem an extreme case, but it illustrates the dangers faced by America’s rapidly growing elder workforce. These older workers are at far greater risk of death on the job than workers under age 55. While fatal occupational injuries among workers of all ages decreased by 17% from 1992 to 2017, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “older workers incurred 56% more fatal work injuries in 2017 than in 1992. This trend is especially pronounced for workers in the oldest group, those aged 65 and over.”Dying from your job in old age is the most severe of many hazards and inequities endured by the elder workforce. Startlingly, half of all new workers projected to be added to the economy by 2031 will be over the age of 65. In a ray of hope, a bill introduced in December by Reps. Don Beyer, D-Va., and Marie Newman, D-Ill., would create an Older Workers Bureau to give elderly workers like Rasor a strong federal ally in securing better jobs and pay, safer and more age-friendly working conditions, and more opportunities to choose between work and retirement.If passed, the Older Workers Bureau Act would have its hands full of immense challenges. Older workers today are disproportionately stuck in jobs that are physically demanding and precarious. Despite technological advances that have eased some of work’s physical burdens, more than 25% of older white workers and over 40% of older Black and Latinx workers toil in physically demanding jobs. Among men over the age of 62, the most common jobs available include delivery work, truck driving, janitorial and cleaning services, and farming and ranching. For women in that age group, common jobs include personal care, nursing and childcare, all of which are physically strenuous.Analysis from 2018 shows that older workers are more likely than prime age workers (age 25 to 54 to be involuntary part-time, gig or temporary workers. In the next decade, about 40% of middle-class older workers will be pushed into poverty or near poverty when they reach their 60s, partly due to lack of employment or low wages. Nearly 30% of older women work in low wage jobs and most are considered working poor.Most middle- and lower-wage older workers are not financially prepared to retire and must work to avoid poverty and maintain living standards. Because of low wages, many older workers already claim Social Security benefits even before they retire. For work to be a bulwark against old age poverty and deprivation, that work must be decent, and work and retirement policy must be compatible.Improving work and incomes for older workers also helps their families and communities. As Teresa testified before the U.S. Senate Joint Economic Committee in February 2022, if we don’t help older workers improve their bargaining power, younger family members will be pressed for time and money to help their impoverished elders. Meanwhile, our long-term care system will be populated by precariat workers. And our economic growth will continue to be impeded because we do not match workers to jobs and, on the demand side, because of less spending power within older communities.An Older Workers Bureau would help empower older workers and ease the transition to full and partial retirement. No government body currently plays this role. As older workers make up an increasingly large part of the U.S. labor market, it is long past time that we form an Older Workers Bureau to hear from older workers and their employers, to investigate their needs, coordinate the vast resources of the U.S. government, and to modernize age discrimination laws and worker training.Teresa Ghilarducci is a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research and director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis.

Eventually, the effort switched to providing new toys for children whose families needed a little extra help, and it has been that way ever since.Every year in recent memory, the Cheer Fund has collected more than $40,000 to help with this effort. This year, as you could see with the update on the front page of Sunday’s paper, we collected $41,631 this year, meeting the goal.Capt. Angel Simmons of the Salvation Army Suffolk Corps said the Salvation Army’s Christmas programs, partially supported by the money from the Cheer Fund, supported 2,663 children this year. Those were children who otherwise would not have had anything under the tree on Christmas Day without the kindheartedness of hundreds of Suffolk individuals, families, groups and businesses.Margie Wiley, head elf and board member for the Cheer Fund, had this to say upon learning the news of the goal being met: “​​I am once again completely blown away by the love our city shows our needy families and children at Christmas time. Each year we look to our community for support and each year our citizens open up their hearts. Thank you to all who gave and donated so that every child could have a Merry Christmas.”The Suffolk News-Herald echoes our thankfulness for the generous donations we received this year.

suffolknewsherald_2022_258,"Published 8:32 pm Friday, September 23, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardTime will tell whether five Suffolk City Council members acted wisely this week in blessing a radical transformation of the city whose well-being they were elected to safeguard.Count us among those who are gravely concerned, even as we sincerely hope for the best.By any definition, it was an extraordinary act of defiance of the public will. The five votes to rezone hundreds of acres at the gateway to Suffolk to accommodate yet more warehouses and 18-wheelers were exactly five times the number of city residents who spoke in favor of the Port 460 project at a City Council or Planning Commission meeting or in a letter to the editor of this newspaper. That number, by our count, was precisely one, not counting the property owner who will be enriched by its sale to a Maryland developer, nor that developer’s paid lawyer.We understand, of course, that opponents are always louder than supporters, regardless of the controversy. But this was different. Even as elected officials and city staff touted Port 460’s considerable economic benefits, not a single prominent business or civic leader stood up to say that the project will be good for Suffolk. That’s astounding in a city with a long history of strong civic leadership on worthwhile causes.Despite lots of lip service Wednesday night about having listened to and considered the consensus of the citizenry, the truth is that the only support for this project came from politically powerful interests outside Suffolk’s borders, primarily the Port of Virginia. In the end, their interest trumped the citizenry’s. And for a cheap price. The port to date has pledged a mere million dollars toward road improvements that will push or exceed $100 million, and even that million from the port is conditioned on a matching million from Suffolk taxpayers. Insulting.For the record, we don’t begrudge port officials for pushing the project. Additional inland warehouse space is sorely needed if the port is to be the busiest on the East Coast, an achievement that would be of unquestionable benefit to the Tidewater region, which includes Suffolk. Nor do we blame statewide politicians, who are elected by the commonwealth as a whole, for backing the project.But regional and state loyalties must be secondary for Suffolk City Council members. “We are here to represent the will of the people of Suffolk,” Councilwoman Shelley Butler Barlow implored prior to Wednesday’s 5-3 vote.Councilman Tim Johnson added, “I know this would be good for our region, but it wouldn’t be good for our citizens.”Johnson, to his credit, defended the integrity and sincerity of the five council members who approved the rezoning. We concur. It was obvious to us that Mayor Mike Duman agonized over his decision, preferring a further tabling of the matter. We were less impressed with veteran Councilman Roger Fawcett, who arrogantly lectured the packed room at City Hall, telling citizens that “you have convinced yourselves” that the project is bad, apparently all of them lacking the wisdom of Fawcett himself to conclude differently.We have a much higher regard than Fawcett for Suffolk residents, as expressed succinctly by Johnson: “The people of this city are not stupid.”Now the important work begins to maximize benefits and minimize risks from a monumental remaking of the U.S. 460 corridor, and it’s incumbent on Duman, Fawcett, Donald Goldberg, Lue Ward and LeOtis Williams to personally work to ensure the positive outcome they predicted with their votes Wednesday night.That should mean, at minimum:The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

The stated intention is to increase capacity in the pipe. But expanding on existing fossil fuel infrastructure should receive great scrutiny, as it always comes with costs to the people and ecosystems of the area.Consideration of the proposed project must include review of how construction would impact local water bodies and wetlands, historic districts and agricultural land. Some of the areas through which the construction would occur are areas with existing pollution, inadequate infrastructure or proper sewer storage.The project will be reviewed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or ‘FERC.” The agency is now taking comments from the public to know what concerns you may have, and what it should focus on as it reviews potential impacts.As a local resident, your voice is most important in this process.

suffolknewsherald_2022_46,"Published 5:28 pm Friday, December 9, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Larry DaviesDo you remember December of 1989? News organizations broadcast live from the Berlin Wall as it came crashing down symbolizing the rapidly imploding collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the coming breakup of the Soviet Union. Christmas for many would be a happy celebration for the free world and the United States in particular as the “Cold War” was about to end. Having grown-up under the constant threat of global nuclear war during the 50s and 60s, I normally would be elated.But these were not normal times for me. My life came crashing down much like the Berlin Wall. 1989 would be my first Christmas as a divorced single parent with two young children. My credibility and confidence as pastor of a local church was understandably compromised. Didn’t the Bible say: “If someone cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God’s church?” (1 Tim. 3:5 Tom Riddle, a dear personal friend and former employer called immediately upon hearing the news and offered a lucrative job and an opportunity to quit the ministry and come back to business.In the Gospel of Matthew: “Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph. But while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. Joseph, her fiancé, being a just man, decided to break the engagement quietly so as not to disgrace her publicly.” (Mat 1:18-19 We know and accept that Mary was pregnant through God’s Holy Spirit, but all Joseph knew: “Mary is pregnant and he is not the father.” Brokenhearted, he strived to do the right thing in the midst of the shame and controversy surrounding their engagement. These were not normal times for Joseph. His life came crashing down much like the Berlin Wall.The future looked bleak for Joseph, but toughtimes often kindle life-changing turning points if we make ourselves available to the voice of God. “An angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. ‘Do not be afraid to go ahead with your marriage to Mary. For the child within her has been conceived by the Holy Spirit and she will have a son and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’” (Mat. 1:20-21 Joseph changed dramatically. Rather than dumping Mary, he became her protector throughout the accusations and gossip that swirled around their relationship. After all, who would ever believe that a young girl could become pregnant by God? “What a lame excuse for teenage shenanigans! You would think she was carrying God’s Son, The Messiah!”Joseph received God’s blessing of witnessing the birth of the Christ child: God’s Son, whose life, death and resurrection would transform the world.For me, like Joseph: Tragedy 1989 became a dramatic turning point that would change my life forever.I too heard the voice of God offering comfort and healing grace many times during those long, sleepless and lonely nights. Family and friends surrounded me with love and acts of kindness. The church I served went out of its way to demonstrate their love for me and their confidence in God’s hand on my ministry. My children needed me more than ever and I gradually regained self-assurance.Over the next few months, like Joseph I heard God’s voice and decided not to quit but to change: I discovered an exciting new ministry offering God’s grace and hope to others experiencing divorce. I became a more compassionate minister disposed to share struggles as well as triumphs. I worked hard at being a good single parent for my children. I became more dependent upon God’s guidance.I also met Mell just before Christmas. As she talked of her recent divorce, marital problems and mistreatment, I found myself sharing my own difficulties. We were soon talking as if we had known each other for years and I remember thinking, “I don’t want to counsel this wonderful woman. I want to marry her!” And we did marry, and we are still married today.Christmas is not always a happy time, but it can be a meaningful time. God has a way of taking our tragedies and using them to become turning points toward better lives. If you are in the midst of a tragic Christmas? Look up! God is there, ready, willing and able to provide comfort, guidance and help so that Christmas becomes a dramatic turning point for Germany, for Joseph, for me and for you.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_82,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°There are a few political figures today more maligned by conservatives than House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, mostly because she has been so effective. From her guidance of the Affordable Care Act through Congress more than a decade ago to her steady hand through the tumultuous Trump era, she built a legacy that history will treat far better than it will her detractors.But the 82-year-old Pelosi’s decision last week to step down as the House Democratic leader is the right one, handing off to a new generation during what is sure to be a confrontational reign by a slim Republican House majority.Whoever succeeds Pelosi should strive to provide the same stability and seriousness she brought to her post — which must include reining in the often-counterproductive instincts of the party’s hard left.Pelosi in 2007 became the first woman elected to a top congressional leadership role.Since then, in her stewardship of House Democrats both as speaker and minority leader, she has built a historically diverse House caucus, elevating women, racial minorities and LGBTQ candidates into House seats and leadership positions in unprecedented numbers.At the same time, she has deftly herded the cats that make up her philosophically divided party, pushing through landmark legislation on health care, pandemic relief and infrastructure by convincing her perpetually dissatisfied fellow Democrats of the necessity of compromise and realism.Contrary to the Republican caricature of her as a quasi-socialist, Pelosi has generally sought to “govern from the middle,” as she once advised Barack Obama.Not everyone in her party has been happy about that.The leftist young House progressives known as “The Squad” (which includes St. Louis Rep. Cori Bush have brought some energy to the caucus but also have created partywide headaches with their defund-the-police nonsense and other distractions.Pelosi has generally managed to walk the line between keeping them at the table and not allowing their ideological extremism to commandeer her caucus.House Republican leaders can’t say the same — not with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other batty right-wingers poised to wield significant influence under the coming GOP House majority.The best response from Democrats would be to seat new leaders who can uphold their party’s ethos of diversity, tolerance and progress while confronting head-on the missteps Democrats have taken on issues like inflation and crime.Pelosi’s designated heir-apparent, New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, appropriately highlighted both those issues in a letter to colleagues last week. Jeffries, who would be the first Black caucus leader, is conversant with the left of the party but not in thrall to it.That initially feels like the right mix for Democrats to continue navigating their own internal conflicts while unifying to confront what are sure to be the excesses of the Republican right in the next two years.— St. Louis Post-DispatchHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

minnpost_2022_149,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Every Minnesotan facing higher utility bills each month knows that energy prices are soaring.A variety of factors such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, inflation, supply chain disruptions and severe weather events are all converging at once, contributing to increased volatility and higher prices. Many Minnesota families are struggling to keep up with energy costs, underscoring the importance of rapidly expanding our homegrown sources of clean energy. Doing so will ensure we can generate local jobs and deliver low-cost, reliable, and resilient energy. It will also spur economic development opportunities and secure our energy independence.According to the2021 Minnesota Energy Factsheet, Minnesota electricity imports fell to their lowest level in more than two decades in 2020. While this is partially because of the overall reduction in energy use due to the pandemic, it is also due to the fact that in 2020, wind and solar accounted for all new electricity generation added in the state totaling 588 megawatts. Investing further in innovative clean energy technologies and solutions will increase the amount of local energy we can produce, which in turn will provide Minnesota workers with family-sustaining jobs and careers. Minnesotans pride themselves on self-reliance and resilience, both of which clean energy provides.Currently, 55,300 Minnesotans work in the clean energy industry, with over 40 percent of jobs residing in Greater Minnesota. My business, an engineering company called EVS, Inc. based in Eden Prairie, employs 118 people. We have grown more than 300 percent over the past several years after refocusing our business to provide engineering services for large-scale solar and other renewable energy projects in both Minnesota and across the country. As a veteran of this industry, I know clean energy work is a key to our success now and in the future.Clean energy is not only affordable, with the prices continuing to decrease, but also reliable and will lead us to energy independence. Data from BloombergNEF in the Factsheet compares the cost of producing electricity from a host of different technologies including wind, solar and natural gas. And you know what the data finds? Building a wind farm continues to be the lowest cost form of new energy to build today – and that is on an unsubsidized basis. Wind and solar power come at a lower cost because these fuel sources of energy are abundant and free. Moreover, rapidly evolving battery storage technologies will allow us to store this power for use when the sun is not shining and the wind is not blowing.With rapid inflation and international conflicts impacting worldwide energy markets, it is clear that diversifying our energy mix with cleaner and cheaper energy is a win-win. Clean energy allows us to control our own energy supply and costs so we know that our families are taken care of and our businesses can thrive. Now is the perfect time to rapidly accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy to not only lower energy costs for Minnesota families but to increase our energy security and independence as well.Andy Kim is president of EVS, Inc., an engineering firm based in Eden Prairie."

Or why Justin Schaaf, a conductor on the BNSF line,lost a tooth recently— months after he chose to attend his son’s seventh birthday instead of keeping a dental appointment on a prized day off.It’s those kinds of everyday horror stories from the American workplace that unionized rail workers hoped to write an ending to this fall as they fought to negotiate a new labor contract with the nation’s profit-drenched rail systems. Seeking paid sick days was a simple humane demand —one that was crushedthis week when a labor deal lacking them, crafted by the Biden administration and endorsed by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, was imposed on 12 key rail unions.To say that thousands of blue-collar Americansfeel betrayedby a Democrat whofamously promisedto be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen” would be an understatement. Rail union leaders say they’ve been inundated with calls and texts from rank-and-file members angry that they were badgered in 2020 to vote for Joe Biden, and who in no way would support him in 2024.“Joe relied on us to get him home to his family,” Reece Murtagh, a roadway mechanic based in Richmond, Va.,told NPR, referring to Biden’s nightly commute on Amtrak when he was a Delaware senator. Now Murtagh is furious that the president and Congress imposed a settlement that blocked workers from exercising their right to strike. “But when it was his turn to help us out ... to better our life, he turned his back on us.”In the 20th century, blue-collar workers like Murtagh and Schaaf weren’t only the backbone of a thriving U.S. economy, but their votes were cherished politically. But in the 21st century, working-class men and women — especially the dwindling numbers enrolled in labor unions — have practically no one in Washington fighting for their interests.The sick leave sellout marked an a-ha moment for anyone who thought that Biden — child of Scranton and the last days of the Industrial Revolution — would be radically different. The president, in signing the emergency bill that averted a national rail strike that would have slowed the flow of goods right before Christmas,made a weak-tea promiseto keep fighting for mandatory sick leave for all American workers — after inexplicably not using the leverage he had to make it happen here.Meanwhile, in one of her final acts as a legislative wizard on Capitol Hill, outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosigreen-lighted the schemethat allowed members to ram through the deal that Team Biden crafted back in September while allowing Democrats to cast a just-for-show vote on a separate bill for seven paid sick days that she knew would never succeed in the Senate.That’s because she understood Republicans — despiterecent crowingfrom some conservatives that the GOP is now the party of the working class, amid theeducational dividethat sees Democrats increasingly as the bastion of college grads — would do their part to support the highly profitable, campaign-contributing corporate owners of railways and blow off actual laborers and their actual problems. Indeed, 42 of the 48 GOP senators present voted toblock the worker sick days(joined by Democratic traitor Joe Manchin of West Virginia .You didn’t need a rocket scientist or even a political scientist to see how Washington squandered an opportunity to both keep the trains running for the holidays and empower workers with paid sick time.Said Michigan U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib, one of just eight House Democrats to oppose the forced settlement: “If the rail industry wants to avert a national rail strike, then they should provide their employees with guaranteed paid sick leave. As for the Democratic Party, if we are going to be the party of the working class, we need to stand with workers every time.”So why won’t they? The “essential workers” of America’s rails seem to have been caught up in a perfect storm. The “most pro-labor president ever” taking the C-suite view on sick days is par for the course for a Biden presidency that often works to avoid bad chyrons on Fox News over consistent policy — which also explains why the most pro-climate president ever is obsessed withkeeping the gasoline nozzle open.Not that the federal government needs much prodding to adopt the most Wall Street-friendly view of any crisis, regardless of which party is controlling Congress and the White House. In this case, rail executives lobbied hard that while they could make concessions on other issues like wages, giving workers more power to take sick dayswas a deal breakerbecause of their lean system known as “precision-scheduled railroading,” or PSR. That system allowed rail corporations to cut their payrolls by 30% while posting sky-high profits, but the system depends on harsh schedules for workers that collapse if just a few call out sick.Simply put, the activist investors who keep the stock price of these railroads so high demand that PSR stay in place, as the lynchpin of a system that delivered $27 billion in yearly profits for the seven major carriers. So rail executives — who’ve spent much of that windfall on dividends or stock buybacks — can’t spare a dime for sick days.Wrote New York Magazine’s Eric Levitzin an excellent analysis: “That strategy is predicated on treating rail workers as if they were nearly indistinguishable from the railcars they drive. The typical railcar requires maintenance at predictable intervals and does not require an unanticipated day off to see a doctor about an unexplained pain or to visit a loved one in the hospital. But workers often do.”Of course, that strategy also got a hearing on Capitol Hillafter the rail companies spenta collective $13 million lobbying Congress, as their executives and PACs doled out another $3.3 million in campaign contributions this election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. Sometimes the best explanation is the simplest: Money still talks.The plight of the rail worker epitomizes the broader workforce issues facing America coming out of the pandemic. The tight labor market since 2020′s COVID-19 lockdowns has meant low unemployment and rising wages — albeit, increasingly swallowed by inflation — but also brutal conditions for those employees getting a slow clap as “essential workers” while toiling 12-hour days or on unpredictable schedules that wear them to the bone.» READ MORE:A ‘strike wave’ is coming to save America’s working class the old-fashioned way | Will BunchThe cruel conditions of the post-pandemic workplace have already triggered walkouts at companieslike Kellogg’s— where cereal workers complained of working more than 100 days in a row with no weekendsand said“they don’t even treat us as well as they do their machinery” — or at Frito-Lay,where workers wonone guaranteed day off a week by striking for 19 days, using the leverage that rail workers were just denied.“This whole railroad workers episode further clarifies that the ‘essential worker’ discourse we’ve been bombarded with for almost three years is about disciplining workers to labor in perilous conditions, and not about respecting and protecting the people who do vital work,” Sarah Lazare of Workday Magazinewrote on Twitter.What is so incredibly frustrating is that the Railway Labor Act of 1926 that gave Biden and Congress the power to craft and impose a labor settlement was a golden opportunity to turn the battleship around and impose a vision that restores some of the balance between harried workers and their gold-plated bosses. Our so-called leaders lacked the courage to do that.It’s a question of priorities. Yes, a work stoppage would hurt the broader economy for a time — because that’s what a strike is! A work stoppage — and public and political support for workers, even if they must walk the picket line — is a statement that a healthy middle-class life for employees is something our society values over corporate profits. And yet somehow this notion that human beings deserve to be treated better than machines can’t win majority support from either Republicans or Democrats.There has been so much talk in the last six years about saving American democracy, yet there has been precious little conversation about what has gone so wrong with our political system that no party will stand up for the American worker. A healthy republic would have a minimum of one party that would make fighting for things like worker sick pay, or the right to organize, or a living wage its top priorities — a Labor Party, as one might expect in Europe.To say that America lacks a true labor party is the political understatement of the millennium. Republicans may be getting more blue-collar votes, but only throughexploitative culture wars, never by giving workers an economic break. Democrats seem determined to become solelythe party of college degree holders— a losing formula when that’s only 37% of U.S. adults. That political gamesmanship has kept the spigot of corporate cash flowing for both Dems and the GOP, and left coughing, toothache-y employees out in the cold. Until that day when our workers finally realize how essential they truly are — and shut it all down.» READ MORE:SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter"
leoweekly_2022_59,"March 13, 2022, marked the second anniversary of the death of Breonna Taylor — a 26-year-old Black woman murdered in her home by the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD . Many people have reached out to me for my thoughts on what I believe we have gained in the wake of Breonna Taylor’s death and the subsequent protests in Louisville during 2020.It is an interesting way to frame the question, “What have we gained?” This question is often asked by people who do not look like me. People were never concerned about the police forcefully entering their homes, people who do not worry every time a police officer drives behind them. People who aren’t concerned that a minor traffic stop could have life or death consequences. People who exist in a different Louisville than I or someone like Breonna ever did. The question makes me think of Professor Blyden Jackson’s statement in “Life Behind A Veil:” “Through a veil, I could perceive the forbidden city, the Louisville where white folks lived. It was the Louisville of the downtown hotels, the lower floors of the big movie houses, the high schools I read about in the daily newspapers, the restricted haunts I sometimes passed, like white restaurants and country clubs, the other side of windows in the banks, and of course the inner sanctums of offices where I could go only as a client or a menial custodian. On my side of the veil, everything was Black: the homes, the people, the churches, the schools, the Negro park with the Negro park police…I knew that were two Louisvilles and, in America, two Americas. I knew also which America was mine.” After the tragic death of Breonna Taylor and the war-like tactics in response to the protests, Louisville has made it abundantly clear which Louisville is mine.Louisville has reminded me that it is yet another city in the long line of cities where the lives of Black women are expendable. This city has reminded me that Black women will be asked to labor to transform this city with little to no reward. Daily, I am reminded that leaders will ask for our labor, disregarding the laborious undertaking that Black women shoulder trying to right a city that still refuses to face the historical and current ramifications of racism. How many times must Black women fix it — often at the expense of ourselves. When I wrote “Breonna Taylor: Say Her Name,” I said, “I have to march for you not to kill me. And now you are asking me to teach you how not to kill me.” And now, in 2022, you are asking me what we have gained? I will never forget that Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, said, “For her, every day is March 13.” Every. Single. Day. So how do I look at her and tell her what we have gained?Truthfully, I believe the better, perhaps more meaningful question, is to ask Black people, particularly Black women, what have we lost? What…have…we …lost? There are things that are gone in this city that I do not believe we will ever get back. Something in this city has broken. Any sense of security I may have felt, as minimal as it may have been, is gone. I was once asked how often do I think about Breonna Taylor? I think about her all the time. My own daughter is named Brianna. She is 26. I look at her sometimes and think about the dread I would feel if her life was snatched away from me and no one was held accountable. Every time I ride downtown, I remember being teargassed. The images flash in my mind of police in full riot gear, armored trucks pumping out teargas as innocent people sat in the street with signs that declared, “Justice for Breonna.” How do we even begin to process the collateral damage from the murder of Breonna Taylor? I remember the pain, almost tangible, that hung heavy over the crowd gathered in the West End as one of their beloved community members, David McAtee, lay dead outside of his place of business for hours, killed by the National Guard. I remember going away trying to drum up the enthusiasm to celebrate my birthday only to get the news that Tyler Gerth, a local photojournalist, was killed in Injustice Square Park. I was stunned to go on Facebook and read the news that activist Travis Nagdy, who we all knew would be a force to be reckoned with in this city, was killed. I still feel the ripples of 2020.The impact of what happened on March 13, 2020, drew a faultline through this city.So, when will it be enough?There will be no time in my existence that I will ever look at the death of Breonna Taylor and the aftermath and say, ‘Look how far we have come, look at how much we have accomplished.’ I see what was left in the wake of these so-called reforms. 2020 impacted my life in so many ways that I am just beginning to unpack two years later. The emotional toll has been tremendous.Why must the road to reform be paved with our bodies, bones and blood?Why must we fight through rage before we ever get to redemption? At what point will America do the right thing simply because it is long overdue to do the right thing? How long do you think feeding us minuscule morsels of justice will satiate our palates?Do you think we feel any safer? Do you think we believe that Officer Friendly exists for people that look like us? Do you think we no longer feel a tightness in our chest when the police pull behind us on the road? Do you think we aren’t concerned anymore about a minor traffic stop having life or death consequences? Do you think this city has been reformed for the better since 2020? Do you think we won’t be here again because of some reforms? As journalist Ernest Owens wonderfully demonstrated by sharing the Police Reform Flowchart, created by Brett Hamil, we are in a deadly cycle that we refuse to break.After the world watched George Floyd be murdered on social media as Officer Derek Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he cried out for his deceased mother, Minneapolis passed police reforms. Perhaps some even thought they would never be in that situation again. And less than two years later, Amir Locke was murdered in his Minneapolis home by the police.So while we did pass Breonna’s Law in Louisville banning no-knock warrants, I cannot help but turn my eyes to Amir Locke, killed in a home, similarly to Breonna Taylor, by officers within the Minneapolis Police Department while he was trying to sleep. I watched the conversation online after Locke’s murder and people were confused, thinking that no-knock warrants had been banned after the murder of George Floyd. In fact, with “reform,” the police just got a workaround. The Saint Paul Police Department applied for a “knock and announce” warrant, and the Minneapolis police department insisted on a no-knock warrant, according to the St. Paul Police Department. According to Rachel Moran, associate professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, “In November 2020, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced a new policy regulating MPD’s use of no-knock warrants, which has been referred to as a ‘ban’ (including by Frey’s campaign , and did not actually affect the knock requirement at all. What Mayor Frey’s November 2020 policy did was require Minneapolis police in most situations to announce their presence before crossing the threshold into a residence. So, they could open the residence without knocking, but they were then required to announce their presence before crossing the threshold.”That is the problem with reforms. There is no true reform when police can ignore or circumvent them. When you reform something, you make changes in order to improve what already exists. However, when you transform something, you change something into something else. A part of justice for Breonna and George and Amir and countless others isn’t more empty reforms. It is transformation. It is not even reimagining policing. It is transforming an entire system that was birthed out of slavery. How do I get people to understand it is not a few bad apples? The tree’s roots are corrupt. The soil has been tainted with the blood of innocent people throughout history. You do not reform this. You must work to create something entirely new. And that isn’t done by covering up bad systems with passive reforms to placate the people demanding justice. This isn’t solely about system reform. It is so much deeper than that. This is about personal soul transformation. This is about individual inner work. The system and the reforms are only as good as the people.There is no silver lining when I look at the murder of Breonna Taylor and the aftermath. So, when I am asked, “What have we gained?” — please know for me, no matter what reforms come after a young Black woman has been murdered in her home by the police while she was trying to sleep, it will never be a glass half full type of situation..

And there are many parents waiting to adopt.It is a sad day when all around women hear that it is OK to abort their baby. It is very shocking that with all forms of media, our politicians declare that it is OK to abort babies and even say this is one of the most important issues that our society’s government should support and is the reason to vote for a particular politician.These politicians are saying to the world that America stands solidly behind aborting any baby that is inconvenient and a burden to society. These politicians’ morals have sunk to the very lowest depths. Their minds have become like those of animals, not of humans.To think a baby in the womb is but an inconvenience to be disposed of like trash is the product of the most evil mind.Denise YamamotoKeaauWill got it wrongI generally agree with George Will’s opinion on a national matter (“The election results should move both parties to introspection,” Tribune-Herald, Nov. 10 .Mr. Will is wrong in context of what has happened to the country’s political climate within the last three or so years.

However, this freedom must be exercised in a peaceful manner.In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case on abortion, I want Virginians to know that the administration of Gov. Glenn Youngkin will protect all citizens of our commonwealth — and that includes keeping state and federal judges safe while simultaneously safeguarding our First Amendment rights.It matters how we conduct ourselves.This is not the first time the United States or Virginia has dealt with robust differences of opinion and conviction, nor will it be the last. Trials and tribulations will come in the future just as they have throughout our history. And just like we have in the past, we will overcome them together. What sets Americans and Virginians apart is the manner in which we choose to air our grievances. This is the difference between our vibrant discourse and the places in the world that aren’t protected by these freedoms.These national ideals, inked by Virginians, have been replicated and memorialized around the globe for nearly 250 years. It is up to us to uphold the historic words written by Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe and our very first governor, Patrick Henry. Virginians have always been resilient and undeterred, pressing through challenges together while embracing the spirit of Virginia.In that spirit, I want to assure all Virginians that Youngkin and his administration are committed to the safety of all Virginians in their ability to exercise their First Amendment rights. Ahead of the Supreme Court ruling in the Dobbs case, we took preparatory measures across the commonwealth to ensure the public’s safety during these politically charged times.His administration has consistently coordinated with local and federal authorities to ensure that the Supreme Court justices and their families who call Virginia home are protected from intimidation tactics. In May, Youngkin and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce federal law to prevent the intimidation of justices and their families at their homes. After a draft decision in Dobbs was leaked in early May, protesters gathered at the homes of some justices in Maryland and Virginia.Youngkin has spoken to the justices frequently. Ensuring their continued safety is a top priority for our administration. There are ample resources to ensure all of our justices and our citizens remain safe.It is imperative that protected peaceful protests don’t turn into violence or destruction. This is for the safety of all Virginians. Let me be clear: Those who do not heed this message and perpetuate violence will be brought to justice to the fullest extent of the law.Violence is not and never will be our legacy.Virginians expect and deserve nothing less.Bob Mosier is the Virginia secretary of public safety and homeland security.

suffolknewsherald_2022_219,"Published 4:26 pm Friday, November 18, 2022ByStaff ReportsVirginia’s income tax brackets have always shocked me, especially because of their glaring lack of fairness.When I was a newspaper columnist in South Hampton Roads, I eventually earned in the upper five figures annually. That placed me into the same category as someone who made just over $17,000 a year.We both paid an income tax rate of 5.75%.That dichotomy was crazy. It didn’t represent even a whiff of equity. The brackets are based on taxable income.Why didn’t I shoulder a heavier burden? Why didn’t folks earning much less keep more of their desperately needed cash – and render unto Caesar a smaller percentage?I bring this up because the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released a report recently about making the income tax system fairer – and saner. My Virginia Mercury colleague Graham Moomaw reported on the antiquated brackets and JLARC’s recommendations to the General Assembly.The Assembly directed JLARC to study increasing the “progressivity” of the individual income tax system. That means taxing people according to their ability to pay, instead of setting the same tax rates for the rich and the poor or taxing the poor disproportionately.Income taxes account for 70% of the state’s general fund revenue, so they’re the main source for spending.The report noted the Assembly, thankfully, already had changed two components of income tax this year to make it more progressive. The legislature nearly doubled the standard deduction, and it made the state earned income tax credit partly refundable.Good.The problem is the Assembly hasn’t altered the state’s four tax brackets since 1990. That practically begs claims of neglect against our legislators.Virginia’s median income has risen 108% since then, “but income taxes owed by a single filer with median income increased 173%,” JLARC said.At a minimum, the state could update the tax brackets to account for inflation.The third-highest bracket now, for instance, covers folks earning just $5,001 to $17,000, and the highest has everybody above $17,000. Why someone earning six or seven figures annually is lumped in with a person making less than even $20,000 is mind-boggling.“Thirty-two years ago, you were considered rich at $17,000 and hit the top tax bracket,” a delegate said earlier this year at a legislative hearing.I don’t know of anywhere in America in 1990 that $17,000 was considered “rich” – especially not in Northern Virginia or Hampton Roads. That certainly wasn’t the case in Detroit, either, where I was living at the time.Comments like the delegate’s make me ponder about the discernment process of the Honorables in Richmond. But I digress.There’s been pushback from parts of the state Capitol on some of JLARC’s proposals, including possibly raising taxes on the rich. The report says that move would increase progressivity and state revenue, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the GOP-controlled House of Delegates prefer broad tax cuts (of course rather than tax increases.Youngkin and other pro-business leaders say lower taxes would help the commonwealth compete with North Carolina and other Southern states. They should be careful not to ignite a race to the bottom, where the quality of life could suffer just to lure companies to relocate here.The state already approved $4 billion in tax cuts this year, though Youngkin wanted to go further. Before making additional tax cuts, legislators should tell Virginians exactly how they would deal with the reduced revenue.The state’s dismal performance in fully funding its own Standards of Quality, for example, is a sore spot with educators and localities. It’s a perennial problem. Virginia also ranks 41st in state per-pupil spending, according to an analysis by The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis released in 2021.Virginia’s legislators should create tax brackets that account for the inflation that’s occurred over the past few decades. Six brackets, instead of four, should be debated. A 10% rate for the state’s millionaires must not be out of the question, either.What the Assembly shouldn’t do is continue to treat someone on the low end of the income scale like someone making tens of thousands more. That’s indefensible.Longtime columnist and editorial writer Roger Chesley worked at the (Newport News Daily Press and The (Norfolk Virginian-Pilot from 1997 through 2018.

eugeneweekly_2022_0,"We ve got issues. Cultural shifts are no longer measured in generations, decades or even years. From one month to the next, we see screen time increase, community gatherings becoming more diffuse and ebbing, and media organizations scrambling for life rafts. New, often more user-friendly — and less community-friendly — alternatives sometimes emerge. Community radio is perhaps the most hopeful new wave of media that both bucks these trends and adheres to them. In Eugene, I am celebrating 40 years in public radio and two years in community radio. In surrounding small cities, dedicated, passionate staff and volunteers are creating and programming a variety of local, diverse and expressive radio. Veneta, Cottage Grove, Corvallis, Florence and Roseburg all have community stations, and although they don’t extend very far as a signal, most are online and accessible. Some stations have become essential for public service information as public radio becomes increasingly removed from communities they allege to serve. Our local NPR station has brief local news but has dropped in-studio performances and new music releases, and has less and less music and local programming overall. Many of the few remaining music shows are syndicated. Diversity is also neglected by local public radio. Our one 24/7 public music station is mostly nostalgia in its specialty programming, catering to a mostly white, male audience; it has never had an African American or Asian American programmer or staff in 75 years. Community radio emphasizes diversity in its mission statement and strives to meet that imperative. Our Eugene low-powered FM station, KEPW, has abundant Latino, African American, Native American and LGBTQIA+ music as well as public affairs programming. Community radio humbly provides many genres that public radio has mostly disowned: bluegrass, hip hop, new age, environmental, kirtan and international genres are welcomed on community radio. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. As public radio and NPR tend to repeat dominant culture genres and narratives, accessible and compassionate expression runs wild on community radio. Fundraising on community radio is sporadic and does not rely heavily on corporations, grants or wealthy donors. Community radio also welcomes original, creative programming and youth voices. Oregon’s community radio has invented youth broadcasting and music programs, environmental music, bluegrass, nutrition, experimental jazz and therapeutic shows. However, community radio often struggles to achieve best practices in radio. With few boundaries or oversight, community radio sometimes flounders with technical problems; lack of quality; informative, brief back announcing; and incoherence in program placement. Program directors (often volunteers frequently lack training, resources or interest in radio strategies. Radio in general depends on a positive public association with its station, even though the average listener tunes in fewer than 10 minutes at a time on any station. One poorly delivered moment on radio can lose a listener for life. At the same time, community radio is where you will find the most inspiring and expressive programming. With free speech also come personality, adventure and authenticity, which are unique to its medium. My opposite personal experience with many public radio stations often exposed an environment of fear and control due to finances and invasive oversight. One swear word on daytime radio can result in an FCC fine that can threaten a station’s future (and it only takes one complaint to investigate . Community radio is far less likely to have listener scrutiny for the occasional swear word, with fewer listeners and more audience affinity for free speech. Even so, community broadcasters are cautious with cussing, and community radio doesn’t have much money to take away! With all its challenges and opportunities, the future of community radio is bright. As commercial radio, social media and public radio become increasingly rigid, with dehumanizing algorithms, our neighbors and culture are accessible on the dial through community radio. Lower power FM is destined for increased wattage as Congress proposes boosts. Technology is allowing increasingly professional-sounding software to deliver local programming. And the hearts, traditions, and new voices in music and public affairs are thriving with ever-growing small community stations.

minnpost_2022_108,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The current war in Ukraine is the largest war in Europe since World War II. The United States and many European countries have pledged support for Ukraine, with most of this support coming in the form of weapons and humanitarian aid. The war poses existential threats not only to Ukraine but also to European and global security. In addition to ending the war, a second immediate challenge facing the international community is the monitoring of the weapons and weapon systems given to Ukraine. The current movement of weapons creates one of the largest stockpiles in Europe, having the potential to have far-reaching and largely unintended consequences once the war comes to an end.It is no secret that legally traded weapons often wind up in the world’s most conflict-ridden areas. For example, the weapons Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates legally purchase from France and the United States find their way to Yemen. Similarly, the weapons the United States gave as part of its military aid to Pakistan can now be found in the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan. It is too early to know what might happen to the weapons that Western and other countries are sending to Ukraine, but the international community has the opportunity to learn from past mistakes as well as the responsibility to ensure that these weapons are properly secured or returned to their home countries once the war ends.The Russian aggression has led to worldwide support for Ukraine. According to a Politico report that focuses on weapons transfers to Ukraine, 250 countries have promised aid, with much of this aid coming in the form of military support. According to this report and the Forum of the Arms Trade, 31 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Greece and Finland, have already sent munitions and arms to Ukraine. These contributions included anti-tank and anti-aircraft launchers and munitions, as well as small arms and their munitions. These same sources report that, as of the end of March, the United States alone has contributed more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, 4,600 Javelin anti-tank missiles, five Mi-17 helicopters, three patrol boats, four counter-artillery and counter-drone tracking radars, 2,000 light anti-armor weapons, 300 grenade launchers and ammunition, 600 shotguns and 600 machine guns, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 25,000 sets of body armor and helmets, nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and more than 1 million grenades mortar and artillery rounds, 70 Humvees and other vehicles, 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems and 100 Switchblade drones. This is just one nation out of 31 reporting their small arms and light weapons transfers to Ukraine. More is on the way from the United States and other countries.There are many conflict zones around the world where one or more than one of the parties to the conflict will pay good money for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry. Many groups battling militaries are primarily overpowered by the superior military strength brought on by tanks, armored vehicles, and helicopters. With some of the weapons from Ukraine, those force multipliers are suddenly taken off the board. In the hands of irregular forces who are skilled in ambush tactics, many of these weapons pose a real danger to a large group of countries and their militaries. The international community must open its eyes to the increasing risks for weapons trafficking through Ukraine.The United Nations, the United States, and the European states should continue to focus on immediately ending the war in Ukraine before many more people lose their lives. And yet, they must also seriously consider the problems the ongoing movement of weapons to Ukraine will likely lead to in the future. Ukraine has opened its borders to foreign volunteer fighters. CNN reports that more than 20,000 volunteer fighters have already crossed the border, with many of them receiving rudimentary two-week basic training before they are given weapons to fight the Russian forces. It is not clear what the vetting process has been to accept these incoming volunteer fighters. Similarly, Russia has reached out to foreign forces. The likelihood of Ukraine recovering all the weapons back from these foreign fighters plus whatever they capture from the Russian forces is considerably low. It is also unclear what might happen if foreign forces recruited by Russia or even its regular forces get a hold of even some of these weapons. It is imperative that the international community dedicate resources to track the movement of weapons so that these weapons do not end up being used to start or prolong other conflicts around the world.Marcus Engstran is a Political Science and Criminology and Criminal Justice student at Hamline University.

minnpost_2022_77,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It is not lost on me that, in community meetings where I encounter the passionate voices of advocates for plans like those proposed for the new Summit Avenue Regional Trail, those voices are primarily and overwhelmingly white and male and able.It is not lost on me that the only consideration they have is for how they live their lives.Where they likely have jobs they can ride a bike to, time to do so and the luxury of not having any other responsibilities that may keep them from being able to do so. That they have a place at work to secure their bike, a place to change or maybe even shower. That they only have one job and not two. That they have the time on the weekends or evenings to do so for recreation. That, except for the evil of cars, they don’t have to worry about any other threats to their safety. That they likely live lives of such privilege — where everything is an app-based service — that even the tissue they wipe their saddle with is delivered to their door by someone less fortunate.Or so, given their statements, they would have you left to believe.It is not lost on me that they give no consideration to those who have two jobs, or have kids to pick up from one place at one time and get to another by a different time so that they can get to a third place on time and they barely have time for that. Or those who have many places to be at throughout the day for their work. Or those who have two (or sometimes three jobs to make ends meet. Or they have shopping to do for a family of three, or four, or five or six.Or those who are disabled. Or those who are elderly. Or those who, because they are not white, will never feel safe on a bike through a neighborhood in which it is felt they don’t belong. Or women who would never be in any vehicle alone where they could not lock a door. Or those who can’t ride a bike (yes, Virginia, some never learn for a variety or reasons also lost on you, but not on me .It is not lost on me that all the cities they say we should be like — Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Luxembourg — have an unsurprising similarity when it comes to cultural and racial makeup. It is not lost on me, a Black man, that they would probably like to be more like those cities in other ways besides biking.It is not lost on me that all they see is what is best for them. Because, if it is best for them then obviously it must be best for everyone…. Right? We should get rid of all cars, they’ll say only half jokingly or without a hint of jest. We should replace parking with bike lanes, they’ll say without even a consideration of the people who actually live or work or go to church or attend an AA meeting or visit a friend or any of the other perfectly normal and regular activities that occur on a major metropolitan street. It is not lost on me that they give no weight — in fact even less — to the voices of the people who actually live on that street.But what seems to be lost on these folks is the point of extreme privilege from which they speak and hold such positions. The utter lack of respect, understanding, consideration or even lip service they give to any who may not be, well, like them.It is not lost on me that these things will continue to be lost on them. Because for them it is not about participation, it is about privilege.

minnpost_2022_98,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In recent years we have been so myopically focused on the extremist positions of the political far right and the political far left, (views that divide us , that sensible centrist views that should unite us tend to go unnoticed. Sensible centrist positions tend to draw the ire of both political extremes, and when that happens, the extremes race to the center of the room to see who gets to play whack-a-mole with the centrist position first. Let the game begin.Pro- and anti-gun advocates shouldn’t be fighting against each other. Both sides stand in opposition to the common enemy of violent crime, and the enemy of my enemy should be a friend. Both sides need to come to the realization that our grand scale national political divide on the issues of the day cannot be solved without a dramatic change in the status quo. A dramatic change in the status quo does not mean a highly divisive and destructive “civil war” as unimaginative, backward thinking, far right extremists have been suggesting. “A dramatic change in the status quo” means a grand scale move to the sensible center, a move that would require compromise.The anti-gun advocates need to actively acknowledge the right of people to “bear arms” for hunting and self-defense. They need to acknowledge and support the rights of others to own guns in pursuit of their happiness, just as people collect old cars, build and fly airplanes and collect antiques in their chosen pursuit of happiness.The pro-gun advocates should in return, accept that by law, public ownership of weapons of war and their accessories, should only be allowed to exist, to be operated and to be sold, at highly secured federally certified, armory/gun ranges. Own as many AR-15’s as you want. Blast away under the watchful eye of armory/gun range security personnel, who also have AR-15’s. The environmental side benefit for doing this would be that the harmful by-products of these weapons (like lead would be “harvested” in accordance with a federal statute. The staggering amount of lead that is being introduced into our environment by ammunition is largely going unnoticed.Soldiers living on and off military bases, including our “well regulated militia” of “citizen soldiers” (the national guard and the reserves , don’t keep their weapons of war in their homes. They store them in armories for safety. The soldiers are highly trained, supervised, and regulated. Background checks?Extensive background checks.Monitored for mental illnesses? Yes. Must follow orders? Yes. But if you are 18 in Texas, you can just go into a store, know nothing about guns at all, legally buy weapons of war, and then just do whatever you feel like doing with them. The clock is ticking. It will take decades to get weapons of war off of our streets.Pro-gun advocates are correct. Guns in and of themselves don’t kill people, and most violent crimes are committed with hand guns. However, guns are now the leading cause of death in children. Come on pro-gun advocates. The status quo needs to change. The status quo is going to change, with or without your permission.Gun violence in the United States is just an indicator of a much bigger problem. It is as if we are shocked to find a pool of oil under the car, and we now think that the real problem needing to be fixed is finding a way to clean it up.In Barcelona, Spain, every night, very large groups of people gather together on the streets to socialize. No one is worried about gun violence. They just get together to enjoy each other’s company. They may not be united, but they are happy. Their culture is healthy. They have a culture of happiness that we don’t have here in the U.S., and as such, we cannot rightfully claim to be the greatest nation on earth until we fix the cultural problems that divide us. Fix the cultural problems, and the gun problems go away. The game of whack-a-mole is now open in the comments section.John A.

We come from different ethnic backgrounds, neither of us white. That fact matters when white is all you’re surrounded by. We handled that reality differently, and at the same time our families were teaching us similar lessons: Honor, pride, dignity and balance. I wondered if that’s why he meant so much. Familiar in the unfamiliar.Ethnically different and bi-culturally different. Both balancing the white world outside our homes and the culturally poignant reality within our homes. I think I may have created the barrier of ethnic differences in my head, to be honest. Our families had a lot of respect for one another, and still do. We cross paths every so often, and each time, no time has passed. It is curious that the universe ensures we know the other is doing well. As I think back, maybe it was me — but isn’t it always like that? You never know what to expect so you think, “I’m definitely out here on a limb, on my own.” I don’t think I knew the kind of love it was at first, not until we got older. When we were young, it was just the ease of friendship, a quiet understanding of the other’s needs, a balance to outside judgment —we didn’t do that with each other. We were always truly kind to each other. It was later, as a teenager when the answer of whether or not he thought of me too was clumsily answered: an awkward kiss at a party. He’d been drinking and so had I. We were almost too familiar with each other, almost like siblings. Looking back, I also think I felt he may have been “too good” for me. He was always seemingly excellent at everything. That night, when he leaned in, and definitely ran the other way, I had no idea what to do with all of that. All these years later, life has happened. He is married, I’m divorced, we both have children and empty nest dynamics, but his smile is just the same. It transforms the entire moment. Our last encounter, we spoke of the passing of my mom. He was in tears thinking of the fond memories he had with her — as he spoke, I just sat and listened. He hadn’t got a chance to tell her, but wanted me to know to carry it on. It made me think, how often is it that we hold onto our true feelings and impressions in order to remain familiar. What do we lose in the experience of authenticity? We walk wearing masks, the quiet omissions, the blatant compromises. In 2022, we live with no regrets. The hope I have for you and for me is to live a little dangerously and tell someone just how their smile brings butterflies to your world, after just a day or even after 40 years, how their presence in this — sometimes unfriendly — world, assures the untethered joy of years to come.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_57,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°I will miss science Twitter.It’s hard to overstate the influence of the social network on science during the COVID-19 pandemic — and the pandemic’s influence on science Twitter. A rich community of researchers and science journalists existed there before COVID-19, but seemed to expand exponentially during the early months of the pandemic.Twitter became an invaluable tool for finding, sharing and debating emerging science on the virus. Researchers made connections and collaborations through the platform, posted data nearly in real time, and often explained those findings (and their limitations in lay terms so that journalists and the general public could understand them.Of course, there were downsides. Healthy debate could be misinterpreted by the public as uncertainty rather than a natural part of the scientific progress. Follower counts could be conflated with expertise, amplifying hot takes that served to make people either overly anxious or overly blasé about the disease.Then there was the in-fighting. By year three, science Twitter had gone from being largely united against a common enemy — COVID-19 — to being divided over the right response to that enemy. What was once useful public vetting of information became instead an opportunity for each faction to reaffirm their particular pet position. Nuanced discussion was lost. Some arguments escalated into verbal abuse. And yet, the optimist in me felt certain that if a new virus emerged, science Twitter would get its act together.That optimism evaporated following Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. Even if the last two months of chaos turn out to be a momentary wrinkle, I can’t imagine the community will ever operate like it once did. Agents of misinformation and disinformation had always been problem, particularly when it came to COVID-19, but are increasingly indistinguishable from — and at times seem to be algorithmically preferred to — reliable sources. Some prominent members of the science Twitter community have understandably dialed back their use or left the site altogether. Even if there are good conversations happening, they’ve become very hard to find.That science community, of course, had always been about so much more than COVID-19. The platform has played an important role in vetting new discoveries. The rise of science Twitter — which I’m using here as a catchall for all corners of the biotech, medical and vast scientific universe — coincided with the rise of preprint servers. Those allow data to be shared quickly and openly, but before it’s been peer reviewed. One could watch in real time as researchers digested new papers, pointing out their limitations or highlighting where the work might matter. Twitter also helped create a venue for public accountability in science. People like Dutch microbiologist Elizabeth Bik used the forum to shed light on research improprieties in both academia and biotech companies.Even with its warts — and we all know there are many — those things are not only worth keeping alive, but important to maintaining a healthy scientific ecosystem. Yet most people I’ve talked to seem to agree that Twitter is no longer the place. And as long as Musk is the owner, it seems unlikely to recover.As Derek Lowe, a well-regarded pharma blogger told me the week after he announced he was leaving Twitter for good, “It might be able to piece itself back together, kind of like gravity gradually bringing the chunks of a shattered asteroid back together.” Then again, he added, “it might not.”The two prime destinations for the broader science Twitter community seem to be Mastodon and Post. Both, for now at least, feel half-baked. Communities take time to develop, but they also need the right format to flourish. Whatever comes next needs to be able to facilitate discussion that’s easy to find and participate in, and allows all stakeholders to be heard. From what I’ve seen so far of Mastodon and Post, I’m not sure either is quite it.The lack of a viable alternative likely means the community will splinter. As one researcher pointed out (on Twitter, of course , they’ve noticed journalists migrating to Post and scientists heading to Mastodon. That would mean losing the best aspect of Twitter — that is, that so many people were in the same room. Over the past 13 years, I’ve been able to participate in conversations between biotech CEOs, academic researchers, venture capitalists and patients — really anyone who has a stake in a technology or new drug or health care policy.So yes, I will miss science Twitter — and in fact, I already do.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

And parental vigilance is more important than ever as kiddos enjoy a fun night of trick-or-treating.From state Attorney General Jason Miyares’ office comes word of a threat we hadn’t considered: drug-laced edibles disguised as treats.The counterfeit tetrahydrocannabinol (THC -laced products are designed to resemble popular brands of candy and snacks, making it difficult for children, and even adults, to differentiate between legitimate food products and copycat THC-infused products.“As Halloween nears, I want to remind parents about the dangers of copycat THC edibles and encourage them to check their child’s Halloween candy this year,” Miyares said. “Due to the deceptively intentional design of these products, it is possible they could accidentally get mixed into Halloween candy.”In Virginia these copycat products are illegal. The THC dosage labeled on copycat edibles is widely inconsistent, inaccurate and, in some cases, contains 10 times the amount of THC disclosed on the package. Tragically, a 4-year-old boy from Spotsylvania recently died due to consuming a “large amount of THC gummies.”According to the Blue Ridge Poison Control Center Director Dr. Christopher Holstege, reactions to THC products tend to be more severe in children and even standard dosages of THC can have a stronger effect and negatively impact developing adolescent brains.Symptoms of THC overdose in children may include profound sedation, trouble breathing, increased anxiety, agitation and tremulous behavior.If you believe THC edibles have been accidentally consumed, please contact the Virginia Poison Control Center at 804-828-9123.Additionally, if you witness these copycat products being sold in a store, you are encouraged to file a complaint with the attorney general’s Consumer Protection Section, identifying the product and the store.

philinquirer_2022_18,"Garden State drivers should not be deprived of the choice every other American driver gets to make when they fill the tank.Gas prices are at all-time highs. While most states areenacting gas tax holidaysandother short-term fixes, New Jersey has a golden opportunity: It can cut prices by allowing consumers to pump their own gas.Having an attendant pump one’s gas has been acherished New Jersey tradition since the 1940s. While it may be pleasant to have someone else do the dirty work, it also costs more. In the face of economic pressures, something has to give. Yet politicians still ignore or deny the obvious fact that gasoline prices could be lower with self-service sales. Senate President Nicholas Scutari, for example,claimsthat “there is no data supporting any contention that moving to a self-service model would save residents money at the pump.”That is false. Anew studyby one of the authors of this op-ed finds that allowing self-service would indeed generate significant savings for beleaguered drivers.Beginning in 2018, gas stations in some Oregon counties — the only other state with a ban —were allowed to offer self-service gas. Prices fell by about 5 cents per gallon. New Jersey’s high labor costs would translate into even greater savings of up to 8 cents per gallon. That adds up to about $50 per year for the average driver — enough, depending on what you drive, for an extra tank or so.The reason for the savings is simple: Just as shoppers pay more for groceries delivered to their door, drivers pay more for gas delivered straight to their tanks. Thousands of New Jersey attendants earn under $15 per hour on average. Station owners might sign their attendants’ checks, but it is the drivers who pay the wages.Proponents of the paternalist ban on self-service routinely cite survey results claiming to show that New Jersey drivers are somehow different from everyone else. Arecent Rutgers-Eagleton poll, for example, found that 73% of New Jerseyans prefer having someone else pump their gas. “The people of New Jersey are very clear in wanting to keep the system we have now,”claimsScutari. Jersey girls don’t pump their own gas, as the saying goes.But the survey questions are misleading because they don’t allow respondents to take price differences into account. Many likely assume that prices for full-service and self-service are equal. If that were true, practically everyone would prefer full-service. Similarly, most hotel guests would prefer valet parking to self-parking if the former, with the convenience it affords, was offered at no extra cost. Of course, hotels charge more for valet parking because the service costs them, and they have to recoup the expense. That’s the scenario we have in New Jersey right now: everyone pays more for gas because of the extra service.Additionally, arguments to keep the ban in place have long been made out of thin air.Some arguethat the New Jersey way is somehow safer. But judging from the fact that 48 other states’ drivers have been self-pumping without issues for decades, the public safety case is a hard one to make.» READ MORE:Should New Jersey drivers be able to pump their own gas? | Pro/ConThen, there are those crying wolf about job losses. But with record-low unemployment and lots of businesses having trouble filling open jobs, this may be the perfect time to make the switch.What’s more, eliminating the ban doesn’t mean service stations can’t still offer attendant pumping. It just means more options for drivers, like hotel guests with valet and self-parking.Inflation is out of control, and people are having trouble making ends meet, so it’s time for lawmakers to quit making excuses.

The far left and far right are polarizing America in an attempt to win votes and power. The rest of us must stick together and not fall victim to polarization. We cannot let them make fools of us.Clowns to the left of meJokers to the rightHere I am stuck in the middle with you– Stealers Wheel, “Stuck in the Middle with You”(1972 Now, we would never make it our business to state or imply that any politician in particular is a joker or a clown. There have been too many already who have thrown around those kinds of personal insults. Principle Based Politics simply is using a catchy refrain from a 1970s song to drive home the point that extremism on both the political left and right is not good for our country.Each political party in America used to be known for its principles. The Republicans used to be the party of freedom, free enterprise and free religion, as well as limited government and national defense. The Democrats used to be known for principles of peace, equality and protecting the vulnerable. Republicans were protectors of liberty, property, speech, and religious rights, while being defenders of the law. Democrats were protectors of people, magnanimous ideas and dreams.The parties were known for what they favored, not what they opposed.Extremists in both parties today are the clowns and jokers of the left and right, and they are trying to pull America toward their polarized views.Here is how bad polarization is getting? When asked in surveys today how well they like members of the other party, on a scale of 1 to 100, Americans rate members of their own party 56 points higher. Stated differently, someone who put Republican people generally at “85” on the 100-point scale would put Democrats at “29.” A Democrat who would give Republican people a “29” score would give their fellow Democrat a “85,” on average. That kind of identity-based hostility against members of the other party is much worse than in 1978, for example, when the average gap was “only” 27 points on the same scale.The sad irony is that political parties and ideologies depend on each other. Both have good ideas that can help America. As columnist Peggy Noonan recently pointed out in theWall Street Journal(attributing the line to Oscar Hammerstein , “liberals need conservatives to hold them back, and conservatives need liberals to pull them forward.”In addition to its jab at those on the left and right, “Stuck in the Middle with You” has a few other lines that are thought-provoking, starting with the very first words of the song:Well, I don’t know why I came here tonightI’ve got the feeling that something ain’t right . . . (refrain Yes, I’m stuck in the middle with youAnd I’m wondering what it is I should doWe know political extremism “ain’t right.” Those of us “stuck in the middle” should stick together. That’s what we should do. We should make known to the political parties that we will not follow them in their hatred of the opposing party. We will vote for what the parties love, not what they hate. We will vote for principled politicians.To avoid being influenced by jokers and clowns left or right, we should stay where we are and insist that the political parties get back to their principles.

minnpost_2022_20,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesota is a diverse and rapidly growing state. Our education system should match that reality. However, when it comes down to the numbers, we see that the demographics of those teaching our students do not reflect that of our diverse student population. Students of color make up 37 percent of our K-12 schools while our teachers of color make up just 7 percent of the teacher population. This disparity is alarming and one of the many key barriers preventing the State from closing the major opportunity gaps that we see in our schools.As we are amid the 2022 legislative session, we must elevate policy that is working genuinely and thoroughly to close that significant gap. As a first-generation Liberian-American student, I understand firsthand the importance of representation; the representation that was absent from my childhood. Whether that representation is in media, politics or most importantly, in the classroom, it matters. Our students need to see and be taught by people that look like them and understand their lived experiences.Enhancing equity in education does not have to be far-fetched. It can happen this year through the Increase Teachers of Color Act. This key piece of legislation doesn’t just aim to increase teachers of color, it is a thorough bill that addresses the systemic barriers at hand.

leoweekly_2022_22,"There’s a lot of lingering questions surrounding Gov. Andy Beshear’s recent executive order on medical marijuana — about guidance for law enforcement, about qualifying documentation, about whether it will draw a legal challenge — but if you zoom all the way out, the overarching one is: Will his gamble on an issue the state has been glacially slow on pay off, or could a clunky rollout create a convoluted mess?His executive order — which will effectively legalize medical marijuana through pardon power for Kentuckians diagnosed with 21 medical conditions (although it must be lawfully purchased from another state — goes into effect on Jan. 1, but, for being only a few weeks away, there are definitely clarity issues.In this week’s cover story, LEO staff writer Josh Wood and I reported out the loose ends and various perspectives surrounding the governor’s order.In our reporting, a Louisville hemp shop said they have been getting daily calls asking if they sell marijuana — something that obviously won’t be allowed under the order. Government officials from neighboring states told us that Beshear’s office had not been in contact with them. A Democratic state representative who we interviewed — an advocate for marijuana decriminalization — said “On a practical level, how is somebody supposed to navigate this?” A statement from Beshear’s office said they were currently “working on language for the ‘palm card’ for law enforcement,” as of Dec. 5. So, 28 days before a monumental executive order wades the state into uncharted territory and no direction for law enforcement was available? Will a tight communication timeframe lead to confusion and unexpected arrests?But, that’s not to say all of the reactions were negative. In a state where a few Republican dinosaurs are holding up any sort of progress on marijuana, anything can feel like a win. It’s not perfect, but it’s something. It’s a step forward. It creates a conversation. And I really, really hope everything shakes out, it succeeds and legislative action happens during the upcoming General Assembly, and it further advances medical marijuana in Kentucky. Because we need it. Our friends and family with medical conditions need it.Personally, I’m 100% for legalizing recreational marijuana, decriminalizing minor possession of all drugs and expungement and pardons ramping up for previous convictions. No one’s life should be ruined from a bag they carried in their pocket. With Beshear’s order, it’s nice to see something done, and it could possibly move the needle on legislative action, but it’s hard to look at the order and not see its flaws and shortcomings.Even Beshear framed his executive order as a pathway to a more concrete action.At a Nov. 15 press conference, he said that he planned to work with the state legislature during the upcoming session in January.“It’s about the people,” Beshear said. “It’s about people that are suffering. And I hope that we can provide them this form of relief, if they qualify, until legislation is passed. But I would anticipate legislation will provide relief to more individuals than the executive order. Here you still have to travel, you still have to meet certain conditions.”Politically, this executive order is going to make him more popular. Procedurally, things could be a lot more tricky. •.You Filthy Man Sl*** Better Watch Your Mouths."

minnpost_2022_3,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After serving 25 years on the Blue Earth County Board of Commissioners and eight years as rural development state director under President Obama, my passion for getting to know and represent the needs of rural communities continues to grow. Armed with this knowledge and drive, I look forward to helping build back a better rural America under President Biden’s leadership.President Biden used his first State of the Union address to talk about where our country has been and where we are going. The president mentioned a lot we can be proud of and even more to look forward to, especially in rural America.The country has faced deep challenges over the past year, and the people of rural America know this better than anyone. But rural communities are resilient, and as the success of rural America goes, so goes the rest of the country.That’s why the progress we have made in rural Minnesota over the past year is a good sign for everyone. By investing in water infrastructure and broadband, rural business opportunities and the American food supply chain, USDA is helping communities build a foundation for sustained economic growth.For example, the city of Freeport is working to improve water, sewer, and storm water infrastructure with help from a $2.7 million loan through USDA’sWater & Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program. These efforts will reduce health and safety concerns caused by infiltration and improve the water quality for 632 community members.A great example of how we’re helping to support Minnesota’s food supply chain is by investing in agricultural producers and small businesses like Minnesota Family Farms Cooperative. The Coop recently received an $18,700Value-Added Producer Grantto expand sales of their pork products.Additionally, through programs like theFood Supply Chain Guaranteed Loan Programand theMeat and Poultry Processing Expansion Program, we’re answering the President’s call to create more resilient, diverse and secure supply chains. Promoting competition in the processing sector will lead to fairer prices for farmers, greater value for workers, and more affordable and healthier food produced closer to home for families.And they’re just the beginning. In the State of the Union, President Biden committed to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes so every child and every American has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American; urban, suburban, rural and tribal communities.The Biden-Harris Administration’s plan for the economy is already producing historic wins, and there’s room for everyone to participate, no matter their zip code.That’s why we’re optimistic that our best days lie ahead.By giving everyone a fair shot and providing equitable access to federal resources, we can do our part to carry out the President’s economic vision. That means making more things here at home, strengthening our supply chains and lowering costs for working families. It means giving people opportunities to make a good living without having to leave the communities they know and love.For a lot of us, that means staying right here in rural Minnesota.Colleen Landkamer is the Minnesota state director of Rural Development for the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture."
minnpost_2022_36,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Fighting words are all we seem to hear today. They pop up at the dinner table with family and friends, dominate social media and even helped incite an insurrection at our U.S. Capitol. They are present in the daily rhetoric we hear from politicians, the media’s talking heads and even our neighbors.The war on drugs. The war on terror. The war on poverty. Cancel culture. Political correctness. Messaging wars.“How to Destroy the Republican Party, in 3 Easy Steps”(The Nation ;“5 Ways to Fight the Left and Make Your Life Better”(Investor Times .The use of the words of war in political discourse, while not new, has escalated and infused our entire culture with a vitriol I have not witnessed in my lifetime. Moreover, these fighting words today are personal, not just political. Neighbors not only hate the politicians of the other party, they hate each other.How did we get here?Fighting words were first defined by the United States Supreme Court inChaplinsky v. New Hampshirein 1942. Words which “by their very utterance, inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.” The Court later ruled in 1949 (Terminiello v. City of Chicago that the First Amendment does not protect fighting words that produce a clear and present danger but words which invite dispute and cause unrest are protected.It is time to set aside the use of fighting words and focus on what brings us together not what pulls us apart. If we all did this, perhaps our example might persuade our elected officials to follow. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is not war, not even sport. “Winning” does not mean someone else must lose.

minnpost_2022_132,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The Minnesota Community Action Partnership (MinnCAP , in partnership with the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, released a report on poverty in Minnesota. This report sheds light on Minnesota’s poverty disparities. For many Minnesotans, particularly African-American and Native American families, federal benefits programs and income are not enough to cover the costs of their basic needs.The key findings of the report are that 8.6% of Minnesotans were in poverty in 2019, according to the supplemental poverty measure, but the state rate masks a lot of variation across the state. More than 20% of African-Americans and nearly 30% of Native Americans in Minnesota were in poverty. Six of the 23 regions examined had poverty rates higher than 10% and over 10% of Minnesotans age 65-plus were in poverty. The supplemental poverty measure is considered a superior method of estimating economic deprivation compared to the official poverty measure produced by the Census Bureau because it accounts for more public assistance benefits (like SNAP and the earned income tax credit and adjusts for geographic differences in housing costs.Our Community Action Agencies offer a variety of services to help move people out of poverty. These services and programs are localized specifically to meet the needs of communities and to meet people where they are along the continuum – from crisis nutrition needs, helping with rent, childcare, building credit toward their first home purchase, older adult services and more. While we know federal benefits programs can help low income families cover some of their basic needs and mitigate the effects of poverty, for many Minnesotans, federal programs like SNAP and tax credits are not enough. This new report makes clear that Minnesota cannot eradicate poverty with only the current policies and programs.MinnCAP advocates at the state and federal level for policies that help build community resilience, address the causes of poverty, and enhance financial stability. We are advocating for flexible grant funds that allow local agencies to meet the varied needs of their communities. To mitigate this and ensure that more people are able to escape poverty, MinnCAP is proposing three statewide policy initiatives driven by the results of this Poverty Report to be implemented immediately.The report calls on lawmakers and policy makers to:We implore Minnesota lawmakers and policymakers to take action now to invest in our citizens struggling every day to live in dignity and respect.More information and the full report is available athttp: www.minncap.org/Minnesota-Poverty-Report.Bill Grant, is the executive director of Minnesota Community Action Partnership.

leoweekly_2022_34,"Christian Academy of Louisville wants its students to tell their queer friends that they are living sinfully and are terrible people. Sure, they phrased it with nicer words but this is what they are going for. The irony is astounding. It looks like, unsurprisingly, the persecution fantasies of modern Christians are again simply projections of their actions against others.In social media posts, JP Davisshared the assignment. The instructions read: “In at least 8 sentences, try to show the friend from the Bible, reason, and your personal friendship: that God’s design for them is good, that homosexuality will not bring them satisfaction, that you love them even though you don’t approve of their lifestyle.”The assignment is one geared toward middle schoolers, kids who have either not begun to explore their own sexuality or who are just beginning to form their positions about themselves and others. It’s highly inappropriate to assume that the students who received the assignments aren’t also part of the LGBTQ+ community, and it is inappropriate and presumptuous to think that these children disagree with those who are part of that community.Modern Christianity, particularly evangelicalism, isn’t about love, if that love comes with conditions. If you can only love someone who abides by your rules, it isn’t love. It’s narcissistic, abusive and dangerous. While it is true that across the globe, Christians face dangerous situations (i.e.North Korea, someMiddle Eastern nations , overall their fear of persecution, especially here in the United States, comes from their need to persecute others.Inan article for the Atlantic, Alan Noble, an associate professor of English at Oklahoma Baptist University, wrote in detail about the evangelical persecution fantasy saying, “In the United States, evangelical values have often been in tension with public policy and cultural mores, especially in the last several years; this includes recent debates over contraceptives coverage, abortion rights, and the rise of same-sex marriage. Some Christians anticipate major restrictions to religious liberty in the future as a result of these tensions, a concern that is not unfounded. But in anticipating such restrictions, it is easy to imagine, wrongly, that they are already here.”Meanwhile, CAL is actively persecuting LGBTQ children. Being queer is as legitimate an existence as any other on earth. It is as old as any other way to exist and love on this planet. The way this assignment has been presented sounds like being homosexual is something you purchase on the black market. It’s ridiculous, and if it wasn’t such a harmful ideology, it would be worthy of much ridicule. How in 2022 are we still debating this?What other harmful archaic values are we allowing to trickle through our education systems?I’m frustrated that Christianity has been given a bullhorn in our society. What good has it given us? From the damage towomen’s rights, proper health and deathcare to the way we should shame people for who they love. Someone please enlighten me on the positive role of Christianity today.I’m just not seeing it. Sure, as a personal choice, kept quiet like overeating ice cream, I can understand. But the way it has pervasively invaded the government, the health care system and education is unacceptable to me. It should be unacceptable to anyone, from any faith. There are places where religion doesn’t need to go and yet again; we’re seeing a sick example of this. Yes, I understand it’s a private Christian school. The problem is they wanted to go past their doors with this assignment.This school is harming children on the dollars of parents who are hoping that they can produce good citizens. If you’re a parent of a child at this school, rethink where your dollars are being spent. You can have good children, who are morally adept and kind without this.In a written statement following the assignment going viral,CAL Superintendent Darin Long saidthe school will evaluate the assignment to be sure it has “clarity in its purpose and language.” He also attempted to paint the course as simply an elective (as if that changes its harms and went on to quote the Bible’s “Old Testament” regarding the “covenant of marriage” and sex within that “covenant.”Convenient picking and choosing of scripture to suit their needs.Here’s a complication for you, CAL: not everyone lives under the laws of your book. In fact, you don’t even live under the laws of this book. If you do, remove the polyester blends from your closets because Leviticus tells you to. Your preacher’s polyester suit is sinful. I digress because arguing the Bible is foolish; the book doesn’t keep itself consistent, so how can its followers?Long’s statement went on to say, “We believe that all individuals are created in the image of God and therefore should be treated with compassion, respect, dignity, and love at all times even in disagreement.”In response to this assignment, Davis wrote a letter to himself in 7th grade. It’s a letter that LEOhas published onlineand one that I think is worthy of a read. It is imperative that all children, regardless of who they fall in love with, know that they are loved and supported and that it doesn’t come with any conditions.If you’re a young person reading this online or in the LEO newspaper, you are loved and we fully support you... whoever you are and whomever you love..You Filthy Man Sl*** Better Watch Your Mouths."

minnpost_2022_165,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesota has an unprecedented budget surplus, which gives us the perfect opportunity to make bold and necessary investments in childcare.Minnesota consistently ranks as one of the most expensive states for childcare. The reason is simple. We underfund childcare compared to other states, and not just by a little, but by a lot. In January, Gov. Tim Walz proposed using part of what is now a nearly $9.3 billion state surplus to make investments in childcare. These investments could transform how we do childcare in Minnesota and have huge benefits for children, families and all of us.There is a wide gap between the actual cost of providing high-quality childcare and what most families can afford. While approximately half of the 96 families we (Pumpkin Patch Childcare and Learning Centers serve receive Child Care Assistance, the number of families who are struggling to afford child care is so much higher. Over the past year, we have had about 20 families who have had to leave or have considered leaving because they can no longer afford the cost. That doesn’t account for the 30 percent of families who call for enrollment information and decide not to enroll only because they cannot afford to.The Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP is intended to bridge the gap between what families can afford and what child care actually costs. But the rates providers receive from Child Care Assistance are currently far behind the federal standard, leaving providers to make up the losses to provide high-quality care. Raising the rates would allow providers to make ends meet and invest in their programs.The way Minnesota currently funds CCAP makes it difficult for families to receive assistance when they need it. The state currently only provides a set amount of funds for assistance every year and these funds are given out on a first-come, first-serve basis. When the funds for the year are depleted, families have to wait, meaning, they may go without care for weeks or months. We can eliminate waiting lists by fully funding the program.CCAP naturally has income limits that families must meet to receive assistance. But the current income limit is far too low. Many, many families make above the income limit, but don’t make nearly enough to pay for child care. This is not hard to imagine as the current income limit to enter the Child Care Assistance Program is 47 percent of the state median income. For a family of three, this means about $45,000. The cost of care for one child in Minnesota for a year is at least $10,000-$12,000, and often thousands more, making it impossible to both pay for child care and basic essentials like housing and food for a family of three. Once a family qualifies, they have to make less than 67 percent of the state median income to continue to qualify. Still, 67 percent is far too low. I have heard from many families who had to decide whether or not to accept a promotion at work because of a pay increase which would be enough to bump them off of assistance, but nowhere near enough to cover the costs of child care. Families are working incredibly hard. The ability to advance their careers should not prevent them from affording the child care they need to provide for their families.House File 3861, which is currently being considered in the Minnesota House will raise the eligibility for Child Care Assistance to 85 percent of state median income. This would allow thousands more families throughout the state access to high-quality childcare like ours with copays closer to 5-14 percent of their income. With a $9.3 billion state surplus, we have the opportunity to expand Child Care Assistance across Minnesota permanently. An investment in this program is an investment that has innumerable benefits – moral, social, educational and economic – not only for families with young children, but for all Minnesotans, because Minnesota is at its best when our youngest citizens and their families have the opportunity for success.Amanda Schillinger is the director of Pumpkin Patch Childcare and Learning Centers in Burnsville.

minnpost_2022_61,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Last month, I ended my final class of the fall semester with a passage from scholar and activist bell hooks.“Were a love ethic informing all public policy in cities and towns, individuals would come together and map out programs that would affect the good of everyone,” I quoted from hooks’ 1999 book, “All About Love.”The next day, the world learned that she had died.A “love ethic” is one that assumes every person has a right to be free, live fully and live well. hooks delighted in knowing her words have the power to uplift others and create real change, and I have been reflecting upon what her vision might mean for Minneapolis in thisage of trauma.As the city lurches forward after two years of overlapping crises, centering a love ethic has never been more critical. Tension, conflict and anxiety feel endemic, and that is unlikely to change for some time. That disequilibrium can help us identify exactly what we need to conserve or discard as we imagine a city where every person can be free, live fully and live well.Oneideagaining momentum in other cities and worth considering here is the creation of an Office of Care within the City of Minneapolis. This concept is at the vanguard of city planning, and few other places could use it as much as we can.The office would break down bureaucratic silos, partner with community members, and coordinate multiple functions — economic development, transportation, health, housing, public works, parks, schools, community engagement, arts and culture — for the sole purpose of enabling residents to thrive.Specific activities for an Office of Care would vary depending on the stakeholder. It might involve enacting a “no wrong door” policy for people experiencing homelessness and seeking stable housing or support services. The office could mobilize local midwives or doulas to close gaps in maternal and neonatal health care. The goal is to meet the needs of our residents, block by block. What care looks like in Powderhorn does not look the same as it does in Jordan, Kingfield or Dinkytown.It was bell hooks who also told us that “t here can be no love without justice.” Reimagining a city that centers itself on a love ethic is therefore not possible without repair. There are physical repairs still to complete, of course, but hooks is speaking of a deeper social and spiritual repair that we must undertake together.Fully confronting our past as the“Jim Crow of the North”is an act of love and care, and there can be no justice without truth, accountability and reconciliation. An Office of Care could create the holding environment to contain the trauma experienced by residents and help us process the conflict, chaos and confusion that these past two years triggered.They are wrong, and their cynicism shows us the widening gap between the values they espouse and their ability to act upon those values in service of a more just, life-affirming city. “Love” and “care” are not empty words, and they can be used to connect thought to action. Applying these lenses to our policy priorities generates an opportunity to expand, enhance and refine our thinking about how this city works for each of us.A love ethic doesn’t always require a charter amendment or a politician’s blessing. It can start with an acknowledgment that your fate as a member of this community is inextricably linked to mine, and vice versa. Accepting this truth fosters the curiosity and empathy that allow us to listen and be willing to be changed by what we hear from those with different perspectives.Whatever form it takes, a love ethic must sit at the center of everything we do now as a city. We witnessed what the absence of love and care looks like for the people of Minneapolis, and we will not go back. Love is the antidote to fear and despair, as hooks told us, but it requires us to move beyond words and summon the imagination, moral ambition and pragmatism to prove it.Anil Hurkadli is a lecturer at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs."
leoweekly_2022_63,"I had something else in mind for this week, but the lens has shifted a bit, and I feel it is necessary and right to zoom out and look at the world.WithRussia’s invasion of the Ukraine, I was reminded of meeting my first Ukrainian people when I was 19. Their stories of leaving behind their lives and most of their belongings due to theChernobyl disasterseemed so distant and unusual from my own experience until I remembered the year that I, too, had to leave most of my belongings and my poodle behind as my mother moved us to a new residence. My Ukrainian friends had to pack a small suitcase, not more than 25 pounds, and make their way through decontamination and on to an unknown fate in a nation willing to accept them. The backdrop of the stories are different, mine was parental and theirs was the now infamous nuclear disaster, but the commonality of having to abandon a life you’ve spent cultivating and forming relationships are just as devastating. Most of us don’t know what it means to leave behind everything we know or to be pushed away with war on your doorstep. I was a child with scars that many children bear and the only war in my life was between the adults who were supposed to protect me. What happened in Chernobyl and what is happening in Ukraine are quite different and yet, new scars are being created. Scars that will carry over for many years and affect generations of people.A few years ago,I interviewed a Syrian family for LEO. Again, this was a family who was displaced by a conflict that they had no part in creating, but because of the machinations of others for greed, territory or religious control, they were forced to abandon their home, friends and family. As we talked, they asked me, “Can you help?” I had no answer but to say, “I wish,” because truly, I do wish to help. I’ve always wanted to write something that could change one heart or one mind. I think many of us come to this job wanting to have some influence and voice in the world around us.Now with the gears of war turning in the Ukraine and conflict still happening in Syria and other parts of the world, the desire to help is big, a weight more than any one of us can bear alone, but collectively, we can.Those who have been in the streetsprotesting around the world, despite the risks of contracting COVID or their own risks of oppression, have set the tone for the rest of us who care about those in the Ukraine being attacked. As well, those of us who recognize the interrelationships of struggle are shaken even more because all of these conflicts speak loudly to those similar in our own nation, with many of our neighbors — Black, Asian, Latin or other BiPOC — still looking over their shoulders as violence and oppression continues to follow here at home.As loud as we are about Ukraine and Russia, we have to be as loud still about Syria, about Palestine, about the Uyghurs… about ourselves. Why? Because none of these issues are isolated and none of us are free until all of us are free.So as Louisville’s eyes and hearts join the world in standing beside Ukraine… As we lit up our bridge in support, we must keep a space alive and lit for those who need us everywhere, including here. Martin Luther King, Jr. told us many things but right now, these words are speaking ,as loud as ever: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”And when someone asks, “Can you help?” The answer is yes. If you are in the streets, yelling in protests and waving the flags of the Ukrainian people, you are helping. If you marched and ran from tear gas and flash bangs in the streets of Louisville during the 2020 protests against police violence, you helped. The will of the people is bourne when we join each other and let those demands be known. Ukraine, we’re with you, and by being with you, we are also with ourselves.

suffolknewsherald_2022_85,"Published 5:28 pm Tuesday, May 17, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Kenneth E. ThorpeThis spring, a U.S. negotiating team in Geneva made a deal that could have dire consequences for patients around the world.Those negotiators — along with their counterparts in the European Union, India, and South Africa — threw their support behind a proposal that would effectively nullify intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines. Though ostensibly intended to make the shots more accessible, the deal will do the exact opposite — by discouraging the research investments that lead to lifesaving vaccines and treatments.Patients can only hope that negotiators come to their senses and back out of the deal.In October 2020, before the shots were even approved by regulators, India and South Africa asked other member nations of the World Trade Organization to waive patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. The two countries claimed this unprecedented assault on intellectual property rights was necessary to combat the pandemic, since it would supposedly enable generic drug companies in developing countries to quickly manufacture and distribute cheap knockoff vaccines to patients that otherwise wouldn’t have access to the shots.This claim was ridiculous then, and it’s ridiculous now. Vaccine developers inked hundreds of voluntary partnerships with other manufacturers — including many in the developing world — to rapidly scale up production.Those companies collectively produced about 12 billion vaccines in the past year — enough to fully vaccinate every adult on the planet — and the world has the capacity to produce another 20 billion this year.In fact, far from a shortage of vaccines, there’s now a glut.The CEO of the Serum Institute recently explained that he has 400 million vaccines in storage, and that his company has halted production until new orders come in. Likewise, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recently requested a pause on vaccine donations until later in the year, saying that he worries that new donations will expire before they can be used.Yet despite all the evidence showing that patent protections aren’t hindering the supply of vaccines to developing countries, India and South Africa seem to have finally gotten what they wanted. This deal is a slightly slimmed down version of their original request.The timing of the deal is more than a little odd. India and South Africa have effectively sided with Russia in its war of aggression against Ukraine — yet U.S. negotiators are now poised to reward both nations.More importantly, the deal — if it’s approved by all 164 World Trade Organization member nations — will hamstring scientists’ ability to respond to new COVID-19 variants and future pandemics, putting patients at risk. Intellectual property protections enable companies to innovate, take risks on research and development projects, and rapidly respond to public health needs with confidence.There is still time for the Biden administration to reverse course. This IP waiver is a proposal in search of a problem, and it could have dire consequences for the scientific research that ultimately saves patients’ lives.Dr. Kenneth E. Thorpe is Robert W.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_41,"A secret group of German ultranationalists being arrested after plotting to overthrow the government, murder the chancellor and install a monarch is a situation you might expect to find in a 19th or 20th century history textbook, not contemporary headlines.Yet in these strange times we live in, exactly that happened this week as German police arrested 25 people of a roughly 50-member group of fanatics bent on reestablishing a state modeled around the nation’s Second Reich, under Kaiser Wilhelm and Bismarck. Better that than the Third Reich under you know who. All hail the descendant of a former noble family calling himself Prince Heinrich XIII.There are plenty of crackpot groups out there, but this one set itself apart by having members as prominent as the aristocratic Heinrich and a former German federal legislator, military officers and reservists, and plans already drawn out for the new state they would supposedly create.Most alarming though, were the ideological motivations of some of the adherents; according to prosecutors, in addition to the homegrown Reichsbürger movement, members were driven by COVID conspiracy theories that first took hold in the U.S. and the all-American QAnon conspiracy.While we often talk about the risk of political violence posed by dangerous disinformation and conspiracy-mongering here, it’s worth remembering that this noxious cultural export, driven largely by U.S.-based social media companies and often trialed on U.S. audiences, is driving a risk of extremist violence everywhere.QAnon began as a series of obscure postings on the far-right message board 4chan, growing out of earlier Pizzagate theories about a supposed cabal secretly controlling U.S. and global institutions.Now, this one bizarre movement is getting warped into whatever local flavor is most appealing and radicalizing people into violence, highlighting the fact that content moderation and efforts to combat the spread of disinformation online have global implications.

eugeneweekly_2022_30,"We ve got issues. Henry Allen is a fairly well-known commentator on our cultural and political ways. Among his themes or interests was putting a name to various decades, e.g., the ’80s was the Me decade. Thus, he acquired the nickname Ziggy Zeitgeist for having his finger on the spirit of the times. In August 2013, theWall Street Journalran his “The Disquiet of Ziggy Zeitgeist” column, which was basically a big “WTF!” He opened with, “For the first time in my 72 years I have no idea what’s going on.” He continued to disclose his bewilderment, his being very unsettled by “the sense that reality itself is dwindling, fading like sunstruck wallpaper.” My last column, “The Meta… What?” tried to provide some of the answers to Allen’s puzzle. The disquiet, the feeling that we are losing something very basic, comes from an ever more pronounced technological world, with the Metaverse and its totalizing agenda making it all the more plain to see. At stake is nothing less than the dematerialization of human existence. Along with the ever-more-defining techno environment is a companion development, a more and more lonely life-world. The technosphere is prone to declaring that we have never been so connected, but the opposite is the case, a sad fact of life. We are increasingly estranged from each other, with fewer friends, and this clearly predates the pandemic. Not to mention we are more alienated from our bodies and from the Earth. The loneliness is profound, as the social realm is more and more privatized, commodified and shrunken. Undeniably, mass society has undone community. The word community is thrown around a lot by politicians and developers, but where are the social bonds, the connectedness? This has been a long time in the making. One milestone is David Riesman’s 1950 classic,The Lonely Crowd. In post-World War II society, the individual is guided less by internalized community values and more by anonymous signals of a changing mass culture. In 1970, Philip Slater’sThe Pursuit of Lonelinessdiscussed excessive individualism and other “forces that are pulling our society apart.”Bowling Alonewas Robert Putnam’s 2000 study of the decline of clubs, lodges, sports leagues and other communal ties. The pandemic only worsened what had long been under way. Greater isolation was exacerbated, not ameliorated, by ever increasing, ever more defining levels of technology. No wonder that in recent times so much has been written about loneliness. There has never been so much of it, evidently. In February of this year a new psychiatric illness was officially proclaimed: “prolonged grief disorder.” In this ruined world, loneliness is accompanied by negative health effects, including earlier death, as well as affecting mental health. It is also a factor in the rise of irrational beliefs and conspiracy “theories.” Theodor Adorno said that the single word that best typifies society is its coldness. The depth of this condition calls for a rethinking. What is society, and where is it going? John Zerzan is a local anarchist writer whose books includeElements of RefusalandFuture Primitive.

suffolknewsherald_2022_223,"Published 5:54 pm Tuesday, November 15, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThe arrival of another holiday season reminds us again of the importance of shopping at home.Despite the many reasons we hear from consumers for shopping online and in bigger cities to the east, we remain an unapologetic advocate of our Suffolk retailers, especially those independently owned businesses that are the backbone of the local economy.There are many good reasons to shop at home – both during the holidays and year-round.Hometown merchants take a personal interest in their shoppers, because they know most ofthem. They see them at church, at sporting events, at social functions and all around town. They treat their customers like friends, not just another body with a fat wallet.Supporting local merchants is good for our community. Their taxes help pay for police and fire protection, street improvements and the like. When you buy locally, you also provide jobs for your friends and neighbors.Plus, local merchants give back to the community. They are generous in their support of schooland charitable fundraisers, civic clubs, youth sports, the arts and just about any other good project. We ought to pay them back with our shopping loyalty.Being an independent retailer is not an easy row to hoe these days. Besides the big-city malls, which themselves are struggling, there is increasing competition from stay-at-home shopping, especially through e-commerce behemoth Amazon. We get the convenience, but the internet experience is impersonal and, frankly, just not as much fun as walking into a Suffolk shop.Especially this time of year, it is quite the social experience. If you don’t already know the shop owner, you probably will before you leave. And you’re likely to bump into a friend or neighbor while you’re out and about.Small Business Saturday on Nov. 26 presents another opportunity to get out and shop local. Strategically timed the day after the madness of Black Friday, Small Business Saturday is a less stressful way to check off the gifts on this year’s list.If our hometown merchants were to dry up tomorrow, it would immeasurably lower the quality of life in this community.

minnpost_2022_164,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On Feb. 2, an innocent resident of Minneapolis was murdered by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD . His name was Amir Locke. He was not a suspect. He was sleeping on a couch when MPD barged in and killed him within a few seconds of being startled awake. Four days after this 22-year-old was killed, a handful of residents came together as strangers with a simple question: What can we do?In the wake of Amir Locke’s extrajudicial killing by the Minneapolis Police Department, the Ethical Practices Board at the City of Minneapolis should have investigated ethical violations related to the mayor’s handling of that case. Instead, on March 16 they dismissed more than 1,000 ethics complaints submitted by Minneapolis residents.We determined that since it is our responsibility to hold our leadership accountable, we as residents and neighbors were obligated by our commitment to each other to submit an ethics complaint against Mayor Jacob Frey. We did not take this lightly. It is a serious decision to launch a complaint against a mayor.After a week of discussion and organizing, we held an event at City Hall with more than a hundred people – including clergy, university professors, musicians, elders and young people – to mourn Amir Locke. At that event we submitted the ethics complaint to the City Attorney’s office, with the signatures of more than 1,300 Minneapolis residents.The complaint states that Frey violated the city’sEthics in Government Code. The mayor failed to exercise judgment to further the best interest of the city and allowed city resources to be used unlawfully, breaching his fiduciary duty. Mayor Frey allowed MPD to execute a dangerous, predawn no-knock search warrant in a downtown apartment building. He knew no-knock warrants were dangerous, for both law enforcement and community members, which is why he claimed to have banned them previously andcampaigned on that lie. Instead of firing the police officer that extra-judicially killed Amir Locke, Mayor Frey continues to authorizepaid administrative leaveand held a press briefing wrongfully stating facts about the careless operation that led to Mr. Locke’s execution.On March 15, the Ethical Practices Board dismissed the complaint without even a cursory investigation of its merits. The mayor himself dismissed his own constituents’ concerns as a political stunt. This is wrong. It demonstrates this administration’s dismissive attitude toward residents who demand safety, transparency and accountability, the very things the mayor identifies as his vision for the city but fails to provide.Unfortunately, the review by the Ethical Practices Board was done in a closed session, and there is not a meaningful explanation of the decision’s merits included in the Board’s official dismissal document. According to reporting by theStar Tribune, the Ethics Officer Susan Trammel did notify the mayor that, “… the Board went further in the order and authorized me to dismiss any future complaints on the topic without bringing them back to the board. Thus no future complaints about the Amir Locke no knock warrant situation will come before the Board.”In other words, the Ethics Officer and Ethical Practices Board are promising the mayor that they will shield him from accountability.Despite the boards’ audacity, we will work to hold the mayor accountable, and we are calling on all residents of Minneapolis to pay attention to this administration’s actions. Until we have accountability, the rift of mistrust between Minneapolis residents and the city will continue to grow.Elianna Lippold-Johnson, Jennie Leenay, Kristen Ingle and Jonathan Banks are Minneapolis residents who worked (with others on organizing The Residents’ Complaint.

minnpost_2022_60,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. has had a long and storied career as a public servant and leader among the people of the United States. In 1970, when he was but 27 years old, Biden was elected to the New Castle County Council in Delaware. During his two years on the council, Biden supported public housing and opposed oil corporation proposals to build their refineries on environmentally sensitive coastal land.In 1972, Biden became one of the youngest U.S. senators in American history at age 29. He served as senator from Delaware for 36 years. During his time in the senate he was a longtime member and chair of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. While he sponsored many bills, he has stated that his most significant piece of legislation was The Violence Against Women Act of 1994.Under President Barack Obama, Biden served as 47thvice president of the United States for eight years. During this time he oversaw spending on infrastructure under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, helped prevent a government shutdown with the passing of the Budget Control Act of 2011, and led the Cancer Moonshot efforts to help defeat cancer.On Jan. 12, 2017, because of his lifetime of public service, Biden received the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction.In November 2020 Biden was elected 46thpresident of the United States and was sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2021. While Biden is the oldest man to serve as president at 79 years of age, former President Donald Trump is the second oldest president at 74 years of age when he left office.Our nation owes a great deal of gratitude to President Biden for his consistent and important service to all of us.On Nov. 20 of this year, Biden will turn 80 years old. At that point he will have served nearly 50 years in public office. On his birthday, he should give our great nation a most wonderful gift. He should resign the presidency.With a simple signature from a White House pen, Biden can hand off the baton of political leadership with dignity and pride to the next generation. He can single-handedly help the first woman and second person of color to become president of the United States. This would be a most glorious exit from the political stage and ensure his place in history.By resigning on his birthday this year, Biden will give Vice President Kamala Harris the time she needs to prove herself before the 2024 election. This way, she will have a much better chance to be competitive and possibly defeat former president Trump.Trump, like Biden, is late in his eighth decade of life. Born on June 14, 1946, he will be 76 years old this year. If reelected he would be 78 years old on Inauguration Day, the same age President Biden was when he assumed office.Between now and Nov. 20 of this year, President Biden should try to accomplish as many goals as he can to round out his illustrious career. He should also start allowing Harris to become more involved in the day-to-day operation of the Oval Office. She should shadow and learn from the president to prepare for her taking over the highest position in the land.An orderly transition will make future president Harris a much better leader.If she succeeds, we all succeed. If she fails to be a good leader, then the Democrats should replace her for the 2024 election campaign.It’s time for historic change.Dave Berger of Maple Grove, is a retired sociology professor who taught for nearly 37 years.

leoweekly_2022_62,"Editor’s Note: The following is an excerpt from Dan Canon’s new book,”Pleading Out: How Plea Bargaining Creates a Permanent Criminal Class.”which is out on March 8. There are also three events for the book: anonline eventon at 8 p.m. Tuesday, March 8 via Left Bank Books; anin-person eventat the main location of the Louisville Free Public Library at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 10; andin-person eventsat Pints & Union at 2 p.m. on Saturday, March 12.If you’ve spent time in the seedier parts of the internet, you might have heard of “Rule 34.” Rule 34 is shorthand for the idea that if you can imagine something, someone has created pornography that features that thing, be it an object, a historical figure, an abstract concept, rabies, houseplants, the Indy 500: anything. There ought to be a similar rule for the American criminal justice system. In writing this book, I discovered that anything bad I could think of, no matter how frightening or outlandish, is something that has already happened. “Let’s see,” I thought one night after my third cup of coffee, “I wonder if anyone has ever been arrested for a law that doesn’t exist.” Yep. “Wild! Wonder if anyone has agreed to be physically castrated as part of a plea deal.” Sure enough. “Holy cats! Well, I wonder if a cop ever framed all the Black people in an entire town. . . .”In a system like ours, such horror stories are easy to come by. They are generated everywhere, all the time. As an American lawyer, I have a backstage pass to the blood, guts and gore of it all. I’ve seen cops lock people up for years without trial, just to get them to plead guilty to something. I’ve seen innocent people pressed into pleading guilty by overworked defense attorneys. I’ve seen defendants describe details of things they couldn’t possibly have done to judges who knew they were lying but let them go to prison for it anyway. I’ve seen good people get thrown in cages for the most minor mistakes imaginable, cages that they never really get out of, even after they serve their time.If you don’t have a law license, you probably don’t get to see the inner workings of the bizarre contraption that doles out what we loosely refer to as “justice.” Paradoxically, if you are in the courthouse every day, you probably don’t think much about the injustices you see because you see so many of them. Shortly after law school, most lawyers learn to accept the haphazard tinkering we do with the rights and liberties of our fellow citizens. And once we learn to accept those realities — even those that would repulse most nonlawyers — it isn’t that hard to normalize them or even to believe that justice couldn’t possibly be dispensed in any other way. In other words, the horror stories don’t look horrible to us. They look quite ordinary.Among these everyday monstrosities is the practice of plea bargaining. It’s a quotidian injustice that most of the public doesn’t know or care much about. Legal professionals, on the other hand, are steeped in it. For as long as any of us can remember, we have been taught that plea bargaining is the way to manage crime, so we don’t question it. Some judges and lawyers, unable to imagine any reality other than our current one, believe that this is the only way our system has ever functioned. The common refrain heard from legal professionals is that a reduction in plea bargaining would “crash the system”—that is, any change would create a vast swamp of cases from which the criminal courts might never escape. As someone who has had the honor of representing defendants at just about every stage of criminal proceedings, I myself long believed that plea bargaining was a natural, necessary, and beneficial part of our justice system. But time, research, and years of speaking for people trying to undo the guilty pleas they entered have all changed my mind.This book will argue that despite its nearly universal acceptance in the United States, the practice of plea bargaining is not natural, necessary, or beneficial. In fact, no other country on Earth relies on plea bargaining to the extent that the United States does, and it’s no coincidence that so many legal systems function much better than ours. Some U.S. jurisdictions have also experimented with ending plea bargaining, with surprising results. This book will look at those examples to expose plea bargaining for what it really is: a means to perpetuate centuries-old class conflict, a tool for satisfying the insatiable appetite of the prison-industrial complex, and a chief enabler of the ills that plague our criminal justice system today.Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor.

suffolknewsherald_2022_84,"Published 6:51 pm Friday, May 20, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Thomas W. MastaglioGuest columnistIf you recognize Decoration Day as the one-time name of the upcoming holiday, then I can probably guess your age or at least generation. It is mine also.I recall, when I was a youngster, adults calling the 30th of May Decoration Day; later it became known as Memorial Day. And then the date for Memorial Day was changed to the last Monday of May, to accommodate the desire to make most holidays three-day weekends. This year we get to have it on a Monday and on the traditional date.Decoration Day was recognized shortly after the Civil War in 1868 as a day on which family and friends “decorated” the graves of Union veterans (probably celebrated in the South as well with flowers and flags. A common slogan was “they gave their all” — still appropriate today for acknowledging Memorial Day.The holiday began being referred to as Memorial Day after the World Wars, but surprisingly it was not designated a national holiday until 1971. I also remember others misunderstanding its purpose. They would say it was to memorialize any relative or friend who has passed by flowering their gravesite. I also in recent years have had family members thank me for my service in the armed forces in recognition of Memorial Day. There are holidays to do that: Veterans Day and Armed Forces Day, which, incidentally, is traditionally celebrated on the third Saturday of May.Simply, Memorial Day, this year on Monday, May 30, is set aside to honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice fighting for the U.S. in our armed forces. While many view Memorial Day as the start of the summer and an opportunity for gathering family and friends to picnic and relax, I encourage each of you to take the time to reflect on those service members who have given their lives and their families who lost loved ones.Locally Suffolk and Smithfield both hold Memorial Day services. However, if you cannot attend these and want to find a venue for such reflection, the flags on every grave at the Horton Veterans Cemetery in Suffolk or those on graves of veterans, dating back to Revolutionary War days, at Benn’s Church Cemetery in Smithfield will provide you a somber venue should you visit them this coming weekend.So please, have a nice Memorial Day, take time to honor our lost servicemen and women and enjoy nice summer weather on this holiday. But please don’t “wish” me, or anyone else, a “Happy Memorial Day.” It is a time for reflection and honoring the fallen, not celebration.Thomas W.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_40,"More than 20 years after 9/11, Americans are still taking their shoes off at airport checkpoints and remain prohibited from packing larger bottles in their luggage.Yet the folks at the Department of Homeland Security continue to be flummoxed about how to implement more stringent identification requirements for airline passengers.On Monday, the department announced that it was again delaying enforcement of the Real ID Act, which Congress passed 17 years ago.The legislation imposed certain standards on states for issuing driver’s licenses and ID cards, forcing recipients to provide additional documentation.The purpose was to enhance travel security by improving the reliability of state-issued identification.The latest extension means air travelers have been granted a two-year reprieve and won’t need federally approved IDs until May 2025.Department officials blame the most recent delay on the coronavirus, claiming that “Real ID progress over the past two years has been significantly hindered by state driver’s licensing agencies having to work through the backlogs created by the pandemic.”But this ignores the fact that missed deadlines have been a feature of the law from the outset.The act was initially supposed to be applied in 2008, and the latest delay is the seventh time enforcement has been pushed back.The real problem is that many Americans still don’t have the upgraded licenses.According to the DHS, only 43 percent of state-issued IDs as of 2021 met the law’s requirements. Many people still don’t realize that at some point they will be unable to board a flight without the Real ID or a passport.Imagine the chaos — and the effect on airlines and airports — if half of all travelers were turned away because they had only a traditional driver’s license.Those in the travel industry have warned of disruptions. In 2020, Kevin Burke, president and CEO of The Airports Council-North America, told NBC News that enforcement of the law is “a crisis waiting to happen.”He added, “If the government doesn’t make a definitive statement now that they’re going to extend this, then we’re going to have a real crisis on our hands.”Equally important, however, is the debate over whether the Real ID will actually have any significant impact on airline safety.Homeland Security officials have been unable to enforce the requirement for 17 years, yet the nation has avoided a repeat of 9/11.“There is precious little in way of evidence supporting the idea that this additional hurdle could prevent terrorism,” notes Reason magazine’s Emma Camp.Attempting to minimize disruptions that will accompany enforcement of the new ID policy makes sense. But disruptions are inevitable.If Congress isn’t willing to live with that after nearly two decades, perhaps it should reconsider imposing this mandate at all.— Las Vegas Review-Journal"
eugeneweekly_2022_31,"We ve got issues. People often ask me where my career in food began, assuming that I have a mother or grandmother who is a wonderful cook, whose apron I held onto as a child while picking up tips and tricks of the kitchen. This is not the case. I will not spend too much time recounting the nearly inedible meals my mother and grandmothers are famous for, because this is about where my true passion for food and cooking was ignited: The University of Oregon’s Urban Farm. In 2006, as a freshman at the University of Oregon, I was told it was very unlikely that I would get into the Urban Farm class in my first term, but a stroke of luck and good timing allowed me to enroll. On the first day of class, Harper Keeler, my group’s teacher and leader, brought his grill to school. In mid September, summer vegetables still abound but must be harvested and consumed or preserved quickly before the rains come. Keeler fired up a grill and plucked a couple of eggplants, zucchini and peppers off of plants and chopped them, tossed them with a little oil, garlic and salt and threw them on the grill. The result was astounding. Never had I tasted such flavorful and delicious food. That moment is one I refer back to often, the simplicity of organic, fresh, local ingredients and how little it takes to prepare them — how truly simple great food can be. My experience at the Urban Farm is not unique. Many local nonprofits, farms, restaurants and markets have been started by former students of the Urban Farm. Shelley Bowerman and Dan Schuler met and fell in love at the Urban Farm when they were students and ended up teaching. They went on to start Moondog’s Farm and Lane County Bounty, growing beautiful food in Marcola and providing an online farmers market with door to door delivery. Claire Schechtmen went on to start the Whiteaker Community Market, where she features small producers and local farms and has provided a rich and diverse cultural haven for small business owners, artists, artisans and entrepreneurs. Sophie Bello went on to be an integral part of Groundwork Organics. Tracy Gagnon went on to help grow the Oregon Food Bank and Luke Mauer started the Portland State University Learning Gardens. The list goes on. Even if you have never been to the Urban Farm or are not aware of its existence, you have likely enjoyed food grown or cooked by someone who has. The Urban Farm was started in the mid-’70s by Richard Britz and a group of students deeply invested in creating self-sufficiency, ending the dependency on imported goods and testing the potential of how much food a city block could produce. Chickens, rabbits and a flourishing earthworm composting system helped to build soil fertility as well as the composting of food waste generated by restaurants and households. A manual was published that documented the research. It was called theEdible City Resource Manual,and it spawned the creation of the Edible City Resource Center, which eventually became the Willamette Farm and Food Coalition, all the while maintaining the same goal: to promote sustainable food systems, responsible design and community-based activism. The School Garden Project of Lane County was conceived and created by Urban Farm students who wanted to take what they were learning out into the community. In 1983, Anne Bettman, who had been teaching for the Landscape Architecture program, took over leadership of the farm and started to establish perennial flower and orchard plantings as well as vegetable beds that would create a structure for the Urban Farm and drastically increase student interest. Bettman created the first Urban Farm course offerings, which provided the foundation of what the farm offers today. The Riverfront Research Park threatened to develop over the farm in 1986, but Bettman joined members of the Landscape Architecture department to oppose the plan and was victorious in her efforts. She reminded the Research Park and the university that the farm was a kind of sacred site, and building upon it would violate the university planning directives. It seems that the battle is not over and the university needs to be reminded, yet again, of the importance of the Urban Farm, the established orchard and the nutrient-dense soil that has been built and enriched year after year. In 2023, the UO is planning to start construction on the second phase of the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact, which includes huge development around and on top of the Urban Farm. Students, staff and community members have been organizing to stop this development and preserve this wonderful outdoor classroom. The university is attempting to assuage the student outcry by promising that the farm can be relocated, that the Urban Farm program will still be offered to students and that the fruit trees (some of which are over 40 years old can be transplanted. Each year the Urban Farm has grown and established itself as a thriving and vibrant hub for students who seek to understand their environment and gain the foundational and life sustaining knowledge of how to grow their own food. Urban Farm has proven to be one of the most popular classes offered by the UO, filling its 140 openings in less than 24 hours of registration opening. Students continue to arrive in droves to get their hands in the dirt, grow, connect and feast. It is time to step up as a community to show that we value this space, this classroom, this legacy and are willing to speak up and fight back to preserve it for the generations to come.

suffolknewsherald_2022_275,"Published 6:37 pm Friday, September 9, 2022ByStaff ReportsThis Sunday marks the 21st anniversary of 9/11 — a horrible, historical event in modern U.S. and World History.The unforgettable and memorable Sept. 11, 2001 was an unexpected terrorist attacks that befell on U.S. soil, specifically in that Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York, at Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, (just outside Washington, D.C. , and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.The deadliest terrorist attacks in the United States of America, from the four hijacked planes by the Islamic group al Qaeda, have killed almost 3,000 people, young and old, innocent, freedom-loving people.Where were you during that tense, harrowing hours when the hijacked planes, under the control of militant terrorists, were doing their suicidal attacks, wreaking havoc on buildings, properties, notwithstanding maiming and killing lives? What were you doing in those intense moments, that unfortunate day? What were your reactions or how did you feel when you heard about it, when the attacks were happening?Did you pray, if you’re a man/woman of faith, or have time to pray that day, and the days after? Did you have a valid reason or reasons to be concerned about life, your life and the lives of others? Did you have a lot of questions, like why? how?, about our safety and security, local and national, global in general?I was working at The First and Finest Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth. Working in the radiology department, taking charge of all our training records, both civilian and military, I was busy checking out individual training records and noting down who needed this and that update. I made sure that all of us have had current CPR and other in-service trainings needed/required for the JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations . If there were staff-personnel, civilian or military, that have had their CPR going to be expired or renewed, I set up CPR classes for them. I sent email letters, reminding them of what they’re missing in their training records. In short, I have had to make sure that our department was always timely and up-to-date with all the requirements set by JCAHO.That Tuesday morning, my busyness at the staff lounge was disrupted when retired Navy Chief Thomas (we call him Mr. T. came in and, with that remote control in his hand, turned the TV on. There it was…a plane hitting the twin towers! Then, another one ramming the building!Personnel came in, at times they rushed to the room in pairs, the room began to be full. We’re all in shock of what we’re seeing or witnessing on TV. The room was in complete silence and “Oh my God!” was all that I heard, afterwards. One person changed the channel, from NBC to CNN. Then to another channel. For another perspective, I guess, of the ongoing news/event, that time. Sad and teary-eyed we were all. Quiet and reserved. Startled and puzzled. It was just like watching an ongoing shooting of a movie being made. But that was real! Real event and not acted out.That day, I tried to get back to my work (our training records but I couldn’t concentrate. For a few hours, I couldn’t stay focused because it was confusing or mindboggling to me what had happened. I believe the rest of my co-workers also were perplexed.But, eventually, we had to do what we have to do to get back in business of providing quality healthcare and services to our healthcare beneficiaries. Business as usual, as what they say. Teamwork has to be uphold for mission accomplishment. That’s what it is in the military and, I believe, in civilian sectors as well.So, what did we learn from 9/11? What impact did it have to protect our freedom and democracy? Were there effective and efficient safety and security measures, policies, protocols implemented to safeguard and protect our country, our people?And, along with the Jan. 6, 2021 United States Capitol insurrection in Washington, D.C., what have we learned so far about these attacks that endangered our safety, security, freedom and democracy as a nation of laws?Have we been more vigilant and patriotic? Or, have we become more divided than united? Have we been safer and more secure than before those two historic events that happened?As everyone has almost been saying, “Never Forget.” We are different yet we are one. Let there be love, peace, hope and charity, as we continue to pray for peace in/to the world.Chris A. Quilpa, a retried U.S. Navy veteran, lives in Suffolk and Chesapeake.

minnpost_2022_37,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Last week, we lost two Black youth – Jahmari Rice, 15, who was murdered by a fellow student just outside of his school in Richfield, and Amir Locke, 22, who was murdered by the Minneapolis Police Department during a botched police raid.As a mother, a woman of color, a former educator and the executive director of an education advocacy organization and organization that advocates for equity in education, I grieve, and I am angry. When is enough going to be enough? When will we decide to invest in our young people, hold oppressive systems accountable, and legislate for justice and for the good of all our communities? How many more young Black men do we have to lose? Minnesotans have the opportunity to make real change towards education equity and justice for all our students statewide this year at the legislature if we’re willing.During a press conference, Amir Locke’s cousin Nneka Constantino put it best.“Our family is not naive. We understand that it is not necessarily a person (who is solely responsible , but a system of injustice that has killed Amir Locke,” said Constantino. “It’s a layered system of injustice that starts with so many inequities and abuse.”She is right. And it’s no secret that among those inequitable systems in our state is education.Minnesota has the most disparate educational outcomes in the country between white students and students of color.This year, on top of all the staffing shortages and other crises brought on by the pandemic, the opportunity gap is only growing wider. During periods of distance learning, we see racial disparities in access to learning opportunities. Schools should be a place where students’ needs are met, where they feel safe and affirmed and where they receive a rigorous and relevant education. Instead, our schools have become the subject of red herring political battles over whether teachers can teach an honest history of the United States and whether students can use the bathroom and play on the sports team that matches their gender.Legislators, I urge you to invest in education and stop playing politics at the expense of our children. I challenge you to make the hard decision, a decision for the future, and be patient as you watch the current and next generation benefit from your investment.Paula Cole is the executive director of Educators for Excellence-Minnesota."
minnpost_2022_133,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When Minneapolis passed the Midwest’s first $15 minimum wage and St. Paul followed suit a year later, it was a historic victory for workers, especially women and people of color – disproportionately pushed into low-wage jobs. Our movement won against entrenched opposition from the majority of elected officials in both City Halls who spoke generally in favor of $15 per hour minimum wage while doing everything in their power to undermine, delay and confuse its passage.Now the real gains of $15 are under threat from rising prices of basic goods, medical care, lack of union recognition and rising rents, which have skyrocketed an average of 10% nationally in the last year alone. This is why renters in both cities voted in favor of rent control. To win a strong policy that actually benefits renters, it’s going to take building a relentless movement of union, faith groups, community organizations, working class homeowners and most importantly, renters.Conceding to the growing movement for rent control, the Minneapolis City Council has launched its own process, which doesn’t even explicitly set the target of strong rent control. It’s currently being guided by councilmembers who openly spoke against strong rent control last summer when they killed the renter-led pathway. The language of “involving all stakeholders” describes a long history of tables packed with corporate and real estate interests, with the goal of a compromise position. At such tables, working-class people are always at the disadvantage.To win $15, our movement collected 20,000 signatures to put the decision to voters, but the Minneapolis City Council legally doubled down twice to keep $15 an hour off the ballot. The council created the Workplace Advisory Committee (WAC , and we sat on any table, spoke with anyone who was genuinely open to enacting the strongest possible $15 per hour. While the WAC has gone on to lead on a wage theft ordinance and other important proposals, we need to be clear: fifteen was won through a showdown between workers and corporate interests, not a Minneapolis City Hall composed committee.Corporate interests sat on committees at City Hall to discuss worker’s rights, then turned around, lined up with state-level Republicans and sued the city to stop the implementation of sick time and $15. The same real-estate lobby that opposes almost any pro-renter policy, even the federal eviction ban itself, obviously has no place on a committee to pass rent control.Minneapolis City Hall will drag its feet and claim it needs more data. This cry has come from councilmembers who ignore the city’s own, University of Minnesota delivered studies on both $15 and rent control. In both cases, the studies showed what working people have said all along: the rent won’t wait.Some Minneapolis workers are only this year reaching $15 per hour because corporate interests were successful in pressuring City Hall to water it down. Our movement mobilized to the very last vote to defeat further pro-corporate amendments to carve-out industries, leaving workers behind. Without the clarity that our power in the streets needed to counter the big business lobbyists in the backrooms of City Hall, it’s unlikely that we would have won.Also, St. Paul’s rent control victory offers a powerful lesson for our movement. Mayor Melvin Carter is fighting to gut the policy, approved by a majority of voters, with developer-friendly exemptions. This is contrary to the national momentum behind the renters’ rights movement that has fought back to defeat carve-outs previously won by the landlord lobby, like “vacancy decontrol.” New construction carve-outs are a death blow to strong rent control, incentivizing big developers to bulldoze existing affordable units to skirt rent control mandates.In Minneapolis, Lake Street and West Broadway Avenue corridors are primed for development over the next several years; without strong rent control, these working-class, historically Black and immigrant neighborhoods are under threat of being quickly priced out. This is why any Minneapolis rent control must be universal, without these corporate carve-outs, and retroactively applied to cut across price fixing.The most important lesson from the $15 minimum wage campaign in Minneapolis is this: working people cannot limit themselves to what is deemed acceptable by the political establishment and its ties to big business. We need to organize independently around our collective needs to get things done.Ginger Jentzen is a member of Socialist Alternative and a volunteer organizer with Minneapolis United for Rent Control. Guillermo Lindsay worked in fast-food and played a leading role in the Fight for $15 alongside Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha (CTUL . Rod Adams is executive director of the New Justice Project and was a lead organizer in the Minneapolis fight for a $15 minimum wage."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_17,"Musk has positioned himself as a champion of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. This framing could not be further from the truth. Instead, he has allowed extremists and people with hateful ideologies to expand their reach on Twitter. Musk fired staff in charge of dealing with hateful content on the platform, leaving the company too short-staffed to handle the increase in harmful posts. In the 12-hour period after Musk’s ownership of Twitter was finalized, the use of derogatory language toward Black people increased almost 500%.While concerns about Musk’s damaging impact on free speech have been well-documented, the risks to another fundamental right have been overlooked: freedom of religion, which recognizes the right for people of all faiths or none to practice what they believe. Social media is so intertwined with our lives offline that threats to religious freedom are no longer confined to the physical world. Every day that hate is allowed to run rampant and target communities online, the freedom to believe as we choose erodes.In recent years, harmful content on social media has manifested in physical acts of violence targeting vulnerable communities. A 2021 report from the Anti-Defamation League exposed the harmful effects of online hate on different communities, from an increase in violence against Asian Americans, to antisemitic harassment directed at Jewish members of Congress, to the quadrupling of hateful Facebook posts against African Americans after the murder of George Floyd.There are too many examples of real-world violence committed by young social media users who encountered increasingly extremist content online. The perpetrator of the devastating attack at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, streamed the massacre on Twitch. The shooter wrote a manifesto on Google Docs filled with white supremacist ideology, stating that he was radicalized on 4chan in 2020. The Twitch livestream was taken down in just two minutes, but the video remained on Facebook for over 10 hours, allowing 46,000 people to share it. His actions, and the failure of platforms to identify and take down content like this immediately, created further extremist material for other users to view.For better or for worse, social media is the most accessible way for people to connect online. Our government has an obligation to protect people of all backgrounds and identities. As backlash against content moderation comes to a head on Twitter, there’s no telling how other platforms might adjust their policies in the future. The national conversation around what’s happening with Twitter is laser-focused on the whims of a CEO who doesn’t seem to understand what he wants. All the while, real people and communities are being hurt.While people like Musk play games with the ever-growing universe we’ve created online, our government must devote real time and resources to taming the giant that is the tech industry. Without regulation, and while people from different faiths, backgrounds and identities are harassed on and off social media, this country fails to be a safe haven for the people who need it most. Big Tech and its social media platforms are only getting started — we must ensure that this industry’s progress does not come at the cost of our most sacred freedoms.Emmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home.

This is Davis’ response: a letter to a young JP.Dear JP in seventh grade,Hey. I’m you when you’re 39.I’ve learned and grown a lot since seventh grade, and I have something to say to you.I understand why you’re staying in the closet. I’m sorry. I’m sorry your parents live in fear and swim with insecurities. I’m sorry you’re surrounded by a world of people who don’t accept you as yourself. I’m sorry you’re taught you’re going to hell and are a sinner. No matter when you choose to come out, it’s going to be tough, not going to lie.It will not go well with the parents and some of your friends. In fact, it will change your Mom forever; it will never be the same between you two. So take the time you need. Soak up all the quality time you need with your Mom before you decide to finally live your truth.All the girls that say you’re gay, they actually really love you and just wish you were straight so they can have you. They will be lifelong friends.For a few of the guys who bully you, I’m sorry. Stay strong.They do eventually come around and apologize. The world is a big place; unfortunately, your world right now is small. You’re all being taught the same bullshit, but as you all grow older, travel, learn, expose yourself to others, you see the world more clearly. I’m sorry it sucks for you now.I’m sorry you can’t experience dating, love and sex normally as a young person. I’m sorry you can’t flirt. I’m sorry you can’t hold hands or show affection with a boy. I’m sorry you can’t take your guy crush to dances. I’m sorry you can’t be yourself. I’m sorry adults teach that something is wrong with you. Stay strong. You’ll find out by being yourself and staying strong, things really work out for you. People respect and love you.I’ve learned that many adults live in fear and insecurity. Many adults don’t know how to think and speak for themselves. Many adults are victims and tools to power and control.You’re a strong spirit, just like Mom. Never change.It won’t be easy. You’ll never understand, at least at 39 years old, some aspects of the world or humans. Still today I walk around most days feeling like I live in a parallel universe.I simply don’t understand humanity sometimes. A lot of folks not living their truth.Keep having empathy. Keep seeking understanding. Keep loving.Trust yourself, your values and your soul. It’s going to be OK, and one day you’ll have the influence to change hearts and minds. Maybe help save a life.I’m sorry you can’t be you right now.Hang in there; you’ve got lots of people who will need you and will love you. You will make a big difference one day in our world.Love, JP.#stopthehateJP Davis is the founder of JP Davis Partners. He is from Eastern Kentucky. ( ."

Mayor Duman seems to agree with the disaster creation strategy advocated by the Port of Virginia representative who declared “economic growth can reveal transportation challenges. The Port of Virginia is committed to work to leverage state and federal partnerships to identify transportation solutions.” Build it, create a transportation nightmare for those of us who live here or want to visit, then we’ll work on a solution to fix it.Citizens are smarter than that. We know what needs to be fixed and it will cost $100 million or more.How will Suffolk and its residents benefit? The property owner, developer, port, and even the Commonwealth all get money from this deal, while taxpayers get an eyesore, air and water pollution, safety issues, trucks competing with our cars for our local roadways, and mostly backbreaking low-wage jobs that don’t provide economic dignity for anyone.

minnpost_2022_2,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Later this week, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will mark up S.Res.623, an initiative to designate the Russian Federation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and we are asking Congress and members of the public to support it.Historically, Russia has been trying to control more than just Ukraine. Russia’s military involvement in Chechnya, Georgia, Abkhazia, Ossetia, Transnistria, Tajikistan and Syria had showcased Russian aspirations in colonialism and imperialism. When Russia asserts that it has never been a colonial power in Africa, remember Russia has been in the imperial business for over half a millennium. The brief period of nonassertive Russian foreign policy in the early ’90s was an anomaly, quickly reversed by the war in Chechnya. As we speak, Russia is trying to force neighboring Belarus to fight and die for Russia in Ukraine.You are probably aware of Russia’s genocide in Ukraine — there is no shortage of evidence that Russians not only support the war to wipe Ukrainians off the earth but are eagerly getting to the act. There have been multiple intercepted calls from Russian soldiers bragging about their looting and murder of civilians to mothers and wives. There have been numerous intercepted calls between Russian soldiers and their wives casually joking about “permission” to rape Ukrainian women and girls, suggestions to just “kill them all, even children.”The Ukrainian identity is at stake — Mariupol filtration camps (a modern Russian take on concentration camps and removal of civilians. The Russian state-controlled news agency Interfax reported, citing the Russian military, that more than 1.9 million Ukrainians have been forcibly deported to Russia since the start of the invasion, over 307,000 of them children.All the evidence points to the fact that Russia wants to erase Ukraine.A recent articlefrom the New York Times calls out Russian use of the prohibited cluster munitions (over 2,000 that can pose risk to civilians for several decades even after the end of the war.Russia left Ukraine with a choice between obliteration and existence, using any cease-fire and humanitarian corridors it offers to further strengthen its positions to erode Ukraine’s sovereignty. However, Ukraine has a chance to win. With proper military aid, Ukraine would be able to prevent consolidation of Russian gains and liberate the rest of the territory. The only question is “at what cost?” Faster assistance is essential to reducing the number of lives it takes to preserve Ukraine’s independence.History rarely gives us black and white choices, but this is truly one of them. The alternative to a world in which Ukraine is free and independent is a world with a dragged-out war, numerous lives lost and destroyed, ruined cities and infrastructure, and many more millions of refugees to host. Make no mistake: Given an opportunity, Russia will dig in and establish a military foothold in Ukraine directed at Europe and, more important, the ramifications will not be contained just in Europe.Russia’s war is already blocking substantial wheat and corn exports from Ukraine and Russia, which particularly affects the African continent. Russia is not hiding that they are using famine across the poorest countries in the world as a bargaining chip. This is much bigger than the genocidal war in Ukraine, this is a war against the developing world and the basic values of the free democratic world. Just listen to the Kremlin propagandist Margarita Simonyan:“The famine will start now and they will lift the sanctions and be friends with us, because they will realize that it’s impossible not to be friends with us,” – said Kremlin propagandist Margarita Simonyan during the Petersburg Economic Forum.#StopRussiapic.twitter.com/48f1dHnfaC— UkraineWorld (@ukraine_world June 20, 2022All in all, this war is also about our values as humanity.

The voter turnout rates in the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential election, hit historic highs of 50% and 66% respectively, with Minnesota once again having the highest turnout of any state in the country, reaching 81.3% in the 2020 presidential election.While Minnesota’s turnout is historically high, that is not the case in many states, so there is much to improve upon. In our new book, “100% Democracy: The Case for Universal Voting,” we put forward the bold idea that universal voting – that is, making voting not only a fundamental right of every citizen, but a required civic duty for every citizen – can lead to participation rates of 90% and higher.If we are willing to learn from other countries, a remarkable opportunity lies right in front of us. In 26 democratic countries around the world, as disparate as Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Greece, Luxembourg, and Uruguay, some form of required voting is in place. One powerful example is Australia.Australia enacted its current policy of mandatory participation almost 100 years ago, in 1924. Since then, voter turnout has hovered around 90% in every major election. Ninety-six point three percent of Australians are registered, and 91.9% of them voted in their most recent national elections in 2019.How do they do this? First, there is a major and energetic effort to get everyone into the process. The Australian Electoral Commission takes the lead in “enrolling” every citizen through the Federal Direct Enrollment and Update Program, and political parties and civil society organizations join in a major public education effort. There are multiple avenues of early and mail voting, and Election Day, always a Saturday, is a national day of celebration, with “democracy sausage” stands outside every polling place.Second, there is a light-touch enforcement of the requirement to participate. Enrolled voters who did not cast a ballot are sent a letter asking for an explanation. Almost all reasons are accepted, and if none is given after two attempts, a fine of $20 (U.S. $15 is assessed. In practice, very few people pay any fine; 13% of non-voters, or 1% of all citizens in a recent study.In addition to having an increased turnout and a voting electorate fully reflective of the population as a whole, there will be other important benefits. If everyone is required to vote, the institutions of our communities will shift to help people fulfill that obligation. Schools will do more civic education, employers will be more likely to give time off to vote, civic organizations and media platforms will increase their level of providing information, and – studies have shown – citizens themselves will work to inform themselves about their choices.Campaigns and parties would change, too. The strategy of winning by just ginning up turnout among your base, and – in the worst but not uncommon scenario – attempting to depress the turnout of your opponent, would be a non-starter. If everyone is required to vote, then nearly everyone is listening. Campaigns would have to talk to everyone and make a case that appeals broadly.There is a powerful analogy to jury service. The reason for universal and mandatory jury service is so that people making decisions about guilt or innocence, and the appropriate punishment, will be drawn from a fully reflective “pool” of jurors. The same logic applies to voting; decisions affecting all our lives, and the selection of the people who will make them, should be made by all of us – if you will, by the consent ofallthe governed.We realize there may be strong opposition to the idea of universal voting. In our book, we answer many of the objections. To libertarians, we note that we propose very light-touch enforcement, at most, a $20 fine, which most non-voters won’t have to pay if they offer any reasonable excuse for not voting. Citizens could also apply for conscientious objector status and would be exempted from any penalties. And for those who might find even a $20 fine burdensome, we note the fine would not be criminal, and could not be increased by penalties or interest. It could also be waived in exchange for an hour of community service.So how might universal voting be enacted? While a federal bill, The Civic Duty to Vote Act (H.R. 7536 has been introduced, it is far more likely that a state or municipality, fulfilling their roles as “laboratories of democracy,” could adopt universal voting in a manner tailored to their circumstances.Minnesota is a state well positioned by its history to have this discussion. In addition to its already-high levels of participation, Minnesota was one of the very first states with same day registration, which has turned out to be a critical factor in making voting accessible to all.Universal voting is a big idea, one that goes well beyond the boundaries of our current discussion about voting and elections. And though it has had powerful proof of concept in other countries, it is a very new idea for debate in the United States. But every proposed reform and every policy discussion begins at some time, and in some place. In “100% Democracy,” we are offering the opportunity for that discussion to begin. Might it be a discussion to begin in this state laboratory?"
minnpost_2022_21,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After two years of a punishing pandemic that’s disrupted nearly every facet of our lives, Minnesota’s economy finds itself at a unique juncture. We face some extraordinary challenges in workforce, job growth, and racial disparities in our economy. But we also face an extraordinary opportunity – a $9.25 billion dollar surplus to invest in addressing these challenges.It’s a rare thing to have such strong resources to tackle such big challenges, and how Minnesota meets this moment will determine the course of our economy for decades to come.The governor and lieutenant governor’s “Budget to Move Minnesota Forward” contains proposals that will put Minnesota’s economy on the cutting edge. This includes investments in talent attraction, our startup ecosystem, broadband, and our workforce in the fastest-growing areas of our economy like manufacturing, agriculture, health care, and technology.In an intensely competitive and fluid economic environment, the legislature should seriously consider these investments this session to ensure Minnesota can lead the way for post-pandemic global economy.One of our top priorities is to replenish the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. During the pandemic, this program served as a lifeline for 900,000 Minnesota workers and their families. We estimate the benefits we paid out supported over 353 million bags of groceries and $18 million in monthly rent payments. Now, we need to make sure this one-time investment prevents pandemic-related tax increases for our businesses and stabilizes the system for future workers. And we must honor frontline workers who have continued to serve Minnesotans throughout the pandemic; we also propose payments that provide some compensation for their essential and life-saving service.We also need to finish the job on connecting our entire state to high-speed Internet. Minnesota is home to one of thebest broadband incentive programsin the country – enabling providers to serve homes that would otherwise never make sense for their bottom line. An investment of $170 million in this DEED program would, in combination with incoming federal dollars, finish bringing broadband access to all Minnesotans.Currently, 92 percent of Minnesotans are connected to reliable broadband. This investment is particularly important for Greater Minnesota, which suffers much lower rates of connectivity than the metro. Much like rural electrification in the last century, broadband today is not a luxury but an essential part of our state’s infrastructure and vital for health, education, and economic development.At the same time, we need to grow small businesses and foster innovation in our state. Since the pandemic began, small business starts are up 41 percent in Minnesota – people are trying new things in the new economy. We need to make sure they succeed here, so Minnesota creates the next Fortune 500s that define the future. That’s been our legacy for decades.To do this, we need to be aggressive. We need to invest in growing ourLaunch Minnesotaprogram for startups, expanding to accelerate promising companies who want to scale their endeavors in our rich talent market. We also need to renew theAngel Tax Creditso venture capital keeps flowing to our state.These programs work. In 2021 alone, the Angel Tax Credit issued $10 million to help more than 80 companies raise $40 million in private investment, while Launch Minnesota grantees leveraged state investments to raise $35 million, with 100% of grantees saying their businesses were propelled forward.We also need to modernize Minnesota’s policy frameworks for engaging startups. In doing so, we can better leverage the State Small Business Credit Initiative Investment, a $97 million federal influx of capital headed our way that will help promising small businesses and startups get the capital they need to thrive.As we invest in supporting new businesses and small businesses across our state, we must make sure we have the workforce to support that growth. Since February 2020, Minnesota is down about 87,000 workers. The governor’s budget invests in the most promising sectors of growth.At DEED, that means training workers for the jobs of the future. A $15 million investment to grow the tech jobs pipeline for youth would help prepare BIPOC youth – one of the fastest growing segments of our workforce over the coming decade – to meet the demands of Minnesota’s dynamic tech industry and prepare young people for this high-paying career track.A $13 million dollar investment in an Adult Tech Training Program, again with a focus on BIPOC workers, would address racial and gender employment disparities worsened during the pandemic by helping adults transition to a field with a promising future and high pay. And a clean tech workforce program of $8 million will help Minnesota’s workforce prepare for all the clean tech jobs growing in our market as this critical industry booms.Minnesota’s economy must work for all Minnesotans. Immigrants and refugees will continue to be a vital source of talent that Minnesota companies need to thrive. In fact, New Americans accounted for nearly half of the state’s labor force growth over the past decade.Investing $470,000 to solidify an Office of New Americans at DEED would support immigrant and refugee integration, reduce barriers to employment, and improve connections between employers and job seekers. Key sectors like health care and manufacturing would face even greater workforce challenges without the immigrants and refugees who now call Minnesota home. Yet we still don’t accelerate or optimize the employment of our newest Minnesotans nearly effectively enough. This office would do just that, addressing critical workforce challenges that currently constrain growth.These proposals, along with others in theWalz-Flanagan budget to Move Minnesota Forward, would provide a powerful catalyst for equitable, innovative and sustainable growth for Minnesota at a critical time. Let’s meet this extraordinary moment with investments that prepare Minnesota for the future – building a state that all Minnesotans can be proud to call home.Steve Grove is the commissioner of the State of Minnesota’s Department of Employment and Economic Development."
leoweekly_2022_23,"In 2014, a Phoenix cop killed 34-year-old Rumain Brisbon. Police got a tip that Brisbon was selling drugs, so they went to find him. When Brisbon tried to pull what officers said they thought was a gun from his pocket, they opened fire. Only he didn’t have a gun at all — just a bottle of Oxycodone.This is not an unusual story for anyone paying attention to the news in America over the last 50 years. Brisbon was one of countless casualties of our ill-conceived War on Drugs. We will occasionally catch the names of collateral damage — Breonna Taylor is a notable example — but for the most part, we’ve accepted the constant buzz of unnecessary assault, state-sanctioned home invasions, robbery and death as background noise. The War on Drugs is a war, after all, and we can’t be expected to monitor every injustice of a war, can we?By now, it is widely accepted that the American drug war has been a colossal failure. Mainstream conservatives like the Koch brothers admit that our continued obsession with drug crime has had “huge negative manifestations, not only for the individuals who get trapped in that system, but also for society.” Even the most fringe of GOP fascist loonies support legalization of cannabis. Maybe, just maybe, we’ll see drug incarceration rates continue to fall.Ah, but the prisons are still standing, and the prisons demand bodies.Enter the War on Abortion. Elective abortion is now functionally illegal in more than 20 states. In those states, the mechanisms used to keep providers in check will be those we utilize to deal with all other crimes: police, courts and prisons. At a bare minimum, we can expect that those caught aiding and abetting anyone who seeks abortion care are going to have their houses raided by SWAT teams, their personal affects scattered about, their bodies twisted and mangled, their pets killed and their freedom summarily revoked. The patients themselves are not safe either, no matter how much mainstream antichoice groups say that they have “never advocated for penalties for women.” Women have already been charged with murder, feticide and manslaughter for miscarriages. We’ll see more of that.But do we think these bodies, without more, will meet the needs of the insatiable criminal-industrial complex? Surely not. A War on Abortion, like a War on Drugs, is an ever-expanding concept, something that adapts so as to claim as many victims as possible. Even now, the idea that IUDs and Plan B should fall into the category of “abortion” has worked itself into mainstream conservative thought. And if those are valid targets of the War on Abortion, why not synthetic estrogen and progesterone pills? Why not spermicidal lubricant? Why not barrier methods like diaphragms and condoms? Why not onanism?God forbid the feds get in on this, but if the GOP ever takes control of both houses of Congress again, that’s exactly what will happen. Now that the courts are out of the way, nothing stops a Republican Congress from passing a 50-state ban on abortion that will supersede whatever “safe-harbor” laws blue states put in place. Then the antichoice movement will have fully co-opted the machinery used to create so much misery during the Drug War Era. You can be sure they will use it. Perhaps the FBI will form an Abortion Crimes Task Force. Perhaps the Customs and Border Patrol will establish an elite Abortion Travel Enforcement unit. Perhaps an entirely new agency, like the DEA, will be necessary to police all the “abortion” happening everywhere — a Reproduction Enforcement Agency.A new war on American soil will help ensure the continued employment of the boys in blue, too. If millions of law enforcement officers could be conscripted into kicking in doors to private homes and killing people over a bag of marijuana or a bottle of Xanax, it should be even easier to find soldiers in the War on Abortion. What nobler cause could there be than saving innocent babies? Like their drug warrior predecessors, these abortion warriors will make sure the prisons stay full for yet another generation.Back in 1989, Justice Thurgood Marshall denounced what he called the “drug exception to the Constitution,” referring to the idea that the courts tend to turn the other way when individuals fall victim to the nebulous crusade of the War on Drugs. The Bill of Rights, international human rights standards, our communities’ norms and mores, any basic notions of decency; these are all pushed aside to make way for the mass grave we’ve dug in the name of stamping out narcotics. There is every reason to think that the same atrocities — and worse — will happen when the government fully commits to the War on Abortion. There is no fantasy too dystopian, no prediction too bleak, no outlook too pessimistic for what lies ahead.The cop who shot Rumain Brisbon never faced criminal charges for his death. I never heard Brisbon’s name until I sat down to write this, or if I did, I don’t remember it. I likely will have forgotten it again by next week. When the War on Abortion claims its casualties from the periphery of what reasonable people might call “abortion,” will we care any more than we did during the War on Drugs? When the 100th person is shot grasping a bottle of birth control pills, will we remember her name? It seems unlikely.. ( ."

My response is usually: “Let me check Instagram.”There, I pore over the profiles of various bars and clubs in Philly, looking to find a space full of young Black people that will play R&B and rap music. Most nights I’m unsuccessful.Instead, my friends and I are often forced to infiltrate non-Black spaces, taking the chance that other young Black people might show up. If they don’t, we’re left feeling uncomfortable and singled out; it’s hard to have fun and relax when you’re one of just a few Black people in a mostly white space. On occasion, trusted Black DJs and event planners, such asKillsingandNas Haddad, will host events or perform guest sets at these venues, signaling that at least for the night, Black people have control of the space.“It’s hard to have fun and relax when you’re one of just a few Black people in a mostly white space.”But that’s not enough. Black Philadelphians are not satisfied by this inconsistent nighttime experience.In amajority-Black city, there should be numerous bars and clubs in Center City that young Black people can call their own. We should be able to hop from one Black bar to the next, instead of feeling like outsiders in this city’s nightlife, or that we have to drive to the outskirts of town to find a place that caters to us. Just as non-Black people enjoy fun and safe weekends in Center City, young Black people must be afforded the same opportunity in spaces that prioritize us.Recently, Philadelphia created a director of nighttime economy, aposition some cities have dubbed a “night mayor,”andhired Raheem Manning to the position. Manning must make developing Black nightlife one of his priorities.Other cities have shown me what is possible for Black nightlife. A recent visit to Washington, D.C., exposed me to U Street and Dupont Circle, areas full of nighttime venues in the heart of the city that had young Black people lined up on the streets eager to get in. The energy was buzzing, exciting, and undoubtedly Black. I was reminded of the years I spent living in New York, frequenting Black bars and clubs every weekend.Philadelphia must create a similar experience for the Black people that live here.Our exclusion from Philadelphia’s nightlife is bigger than dance moves and tequila shots.Studiessuggest that there is a connection between boredom and crime. Asour city is on pace to have the deadliest year of gun violence, local officials should be considering every possible angle to address the root causes, including boredom. One viable solution to preventing boredom would be the development of more nighttime activities directed toward young Black people.» READ MORE:Four ways to promote Philly’s nightlife as a possible antidote to nuisance and violenceThe city’s new nighttime economy director, Manning, must push City Council to invest in new Black-owned bars, clubs, and lounges.

minnpost_2022_76,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The Supreme Court’s decision to reverse 50 years of constitutional protection for the right to get an abortionis more than 200 pages long.Morgan Marietta, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, and editor of the annualSCOTUS seriesat Palgrave Macmillan, studies the ideas and ideology of the court. The Conversation asked him to illuminate the thinking that lies behind the momentous decision.This is a revolutionary ruling. Not just for abortion, but for the ongoing debates over the nature of rights under the Constitution.The ruling signals a massive change in how we read the Constitution, froma living readingto anoriginal reading. The court has firmly rejected the theory of theliving Constitution, which argues that the meaning of the document’s language changes as the beliefs and values of Americans change.The living view, which prevailed at the Supreme Court during the second half of the 20th century, means that additional rights can emerge over time, including abortion,privacyandsame-sex marriage. The living Constitution is updated through the judgment of the justices of the Supreme Court, who determine when public values have changed, and hence new rights have emerged.Originalism, which is the approach taken by the justices who overruled Roe, rejects the living Constitution.In the originalist view, the Constitution is static until officially altered by amendment. It does not evolve on its own without public approval. The role of the justices is to determine the original public meaning of the text, but to leave other decisions to democratic representation through elections.Regarding abortion, the conclusion of Dobbs is clear: “The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to thepeople and their elected representatives.”“Arrogated” is an unusual word;it meansto take without justification, implying that it is done in an arrogant way. That is the core argument of Dobbs: Roe was the court being arrogant, taking power the justices didn’t have, which rightly belongs with “the people,” a Revolutionary-era term in a revolutionary ruling.The new originalism of the court’s majority argues that if a right is present in the text and original public meaning of theConstitution, including theBill of Rightsand any other amendments, then the decision is beyond the reach of majority rule. But rights must be clear and established in order to wield that sort of influence.The explicit rights clearly described and enumerated in the Bill of Rights — freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to bear arms and others — are rising in influence, specifically because they have been approved and ratified by the people.But the other evolved or implicit rights that have been recognized by the court over time — abortion andgay marriage, among others — are simply not constitutional rights in the view of the new majority. Enumerated rights — the ones specifically spelled out in the Bill of Rights — will be accorded stronger protections, while the recently recognized rights of the living Constitution will not be protected.Under Roe, the majority saw abortion as within the category of rights. Hence it received constitutional protection. But under the new abortion decision, it should be governed by majority rule, the kind of question that is to be determined by the citizens of each state through their legislatures.Even the originalist justices, however, recognize that there are some unenumerated rights which, though not spelled out in the Constitution, should be given constitutional protection. TheNinth Amendmentexplicitly argues for their existence: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”So how do we know what those rights are? The court has settled on something known as theGlucksberg standardfrom 1997: Americans hold those additional rights that are “deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition.”In other words, if during the early phase of American history — roughly the 100-year period between the founding and the 14th Amendment, the 1770s to the 1870s — Americans publicly asserted the existence of a right, then it exists. But if they did not, then it does not exist. Under the Glucksberg standard, there has to be clear historical evidence from public debates, political speeches or judicial rulings that the right was asserted and recognized.In Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in Dobbs, he provides areview of the historyof abortion: “The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973,”Alito writes.In the future, the court may rely on its own reading of history to determine which rights exist under the Constitution. But if the record is uncertain, the justices are far more likely to allow states to decide for themselves, rather than “usurp the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves to the people,” wrote Alito.Each state will decide.The abortion debate has two core questions: Is there a right to abortion? And is afetus a person?Even if a right exists, this does not justify the killing of a person — who is another holder of rights. In Roe, the court decided for the nation what the boundaries of fetal personhood were in the early stages of pregnancy: A fetus could not be considered a person before viability at approximately six months, but states could decide during the last trimester. In Dobbs, the court changes course and allows each individual state to make its own determination.Whether the court should decide disputed realities is a deeply divisive question. There was a fascinating case calledKahler v. Kansasdecided in 2020, which addressed the specific question of who gets to decide disputed social facts. In that case it was the boundaries of insanity: Could Kansas define mental illness and hence the insanity defense differently than other states? Does there have to be one definition throughout the nation about such matters as what counts as legally insane, or can we have variation?In adecision written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court ruled that when realities are uncertain, individual state legislatures could decide for themselves. The same now applies to the personhood of a fetus. The power of individual states to decide social realities within their borders is the future of many constitutional disputes.As Alito writes: “In some states, voters may believe that the abortion right should be even more extensive that the right that Roe and Casey recognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on theirbelief that abortion destroys an ‘unborn human being.’”In overturning Roe, the majority’s opinion offers a new and weaker standard for overturning the past rulings of the court. Simply put, precedents will be easier to overturn in the future.For 30 years,the Casey ruling, which upheld the core of Roe in 1992, has been considered the “precedent on precedent.” It established four considerations for the legitimate discarding of a previous decision: the ruling misunderstood the Constitution; it proved to be unworkable in practice; new facts have emerged; and it accounts for what are known as “reliance interests,” where citizens had been guided by a ruling in making decisions about their lives.Dobbs reverses Roe by rewriting the law of precedent. This will open up many other cases for reversal.The most significant change is what Alito calls “the quality of reasoning.” Rulings that “looked like legislation,” offered faulty history or created standards unjustified by the Constitution can be overruled under the Dobbs standard.The ruling includes a footnote describing all of the recent cases in which the court has overturned precedents. It may be thelongest footnotein contemporary Supreme Court history, coming in at over a page and a half. The conclusion is that the meaning of the Constitution is more important than the history of the court, so precedent “does not compel unending adherence to Roe’sabuse of judicial authority,” Alito wrote.Contrary to much speculation and worry, the Dobbs ruling and the new majority will not overturn protections of interracial marriage, especially the landmark ruling inLoving v. Virginia. That ruling hinges on theequal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which is also enshrined in the text and is clearly protected under an original reading.Questions of rights not explicitly protected by the Constitution — and therefore now in the hands of state legislatures — will rely much more heavily in the future on local democracy. Social movements, campaigns and elections, all at the state level, will become the main battleground of American rights.Morgan Marietta is an associate professor of political science at UMass Lowell.This article is republished fromThe Conversation."
minnpost_2022_99,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Social well-being is essential togood health. Yet, as the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the country and upended social routines, supporting social well-being becameeven more challenging, including inrural areas. Social well-being was impacted most directly by the need to socially distance and isolate, and many people moved some or all their social activity online. However, this proved more challenging in rural areas, where broadband connectivity isless availableand devices areless omnipresent, and for older adults, who generally reportlower useof online technology than their younger counterparts.In an April, 2022 report released by AP and NORC at the University of Chicago, rural adults age 50 and older reported thelowest level of satisfaction with available social activitiesin their community (only 38% thought the area they lived in was doing a good job at providing social activities, compared with 52% in urban areas and 55% in suburban areas, despite the fact that older adults make up adisproportionate shareof rural residents . The survey also showed that rural residents reported lower satisfaction with transportation and availability of services to help them age in their own homes, compared with their urban and suburban counterparts.Clearly, while rural older adults may havestrong relationships and desire for social connection, there arebarriers to good social health. That said, rural areas have long boasted a rich social tapestry, and as we stumble our way toward a new social normal more than two years into the pandemic, we must find ways to support community and connection.We researched social opportunities in all60 non-metropolitan countiesin Minnesota, focusing most on those geared toward older adults. We found ample opportunities, but also variation between counties. Most – but not all – counties offer some combination ofsocial infrastructure, including public libraries, senior centers, farmer’s markets, faith-based organizations (notably mostly Christian churches , American Legions and/or VFWs, and public parks. For some, there were community arts centers and hobby groups (e.g.,quilting,fitness classes,bee keeping,cards,gardening,community theater,movie nights,bingo,photography,fishing,art classes,wine tasting,book clubs .Some counties and communities made it easy to find opportunities online. For example, the Todd Countywebsitelisted a variety of opportunities and social infrastructure resources in an accessible, user-friendly fashion. This is good for residents looking for new ways to connect with each other, but is also important for loved ones who live out of town and are trying to find opportunities for those they care about. Many counties also have local news sources through which activities and events can be shared, although the availability and independence of those has decreased nationally in recent years, potentially making it more difficult to share local social opportunities.Some counties had more inclusive messaging than others. For example, Crow Wing County provides a list of LGBT-specific resources in itscounty resources guide, including one organization geared toward older adults. Chippewa County features aRestorative Justice programon its website, including volunteer mentoring opportunities for adults. Within Goodhue County, Red Wing has awebpage focused on racial equity, including a community strategic action plan.Although our exploration of social infrastructure in rural Minnesota was limited to what’s advertised online, we found a wealth of opportunities for social connection. Not all rural communities have adequate capacity for website maintenance, though, and a lot of social activity happens in less formal ways. Not to mention, online advertising doesn’t work for people who can’t get online.Rural older adults reportlower satisfaction with social activitiesavailable to them, and the pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to strengthen social connection to improve health. Going forward, weneed investmentinsocial infrastructure– that is, accessible and inclusive places and opportunities for people to meet, gather, and socialize – to make sure that existing opportunities to connect are supported, expanded, and sustained.Dr. CarrieHenning-Smith is an associate professor in the Division of Health Policy and Management, School of Public Health, 2021-2022 Fesler-Lampert chair in Aging Studies, and deputy director of the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center.

eugeneweekly_2022_27,"We ve got issues. May 25 marked two years since the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin. Though not the last Black man killed by militarized police, the outrage and heartbreak that flowed from his death spurred an uprising that continues today. Hundreds of communities around the world took to public spaces to protest systemic racism and state violence. Emboldened by the regime of former President Donald Trump, racists and fascists also took to those spaces to violently intimidate and suppress viewpoints they don’t share. Many Americans finally learned the realities of modern racist policing in America. By July 2020, more than 14,000 people had been arrested in the U.S. for protesting in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. Despite most protests being largely peaceful, more than 200 cities imposed curfews and nearly 100,000 National and State Guard troops were mobilized, the largest non-war military operation in U.S. history. By November 2020, 25 people had died in the uprisings, with many more blinded or otherwise seriously injured. Locally, significant erosions to our civil and human rights occurred in 2020 — May 31 in Eugene and July 29 in Springfield’s Thurston neighborhood. (We will report back soon about our lawsuit regarding the Thurston events. On May 30 and 31, Eugene City Manager Sarah Medary signed orders issuing curfews, making it a crime to leave your home or be outside, but she deferred completely to Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner — not surprising since her background is in landscape architecture and city planning, with no training in First Amendment or other constitutional issues. On May 31, while shouting through loudspeakers and ordering people to go home, marauding militias ambushed peaceful civilians with impact and chemical weapons. Shortly before the curfew went into effect, a young woman was shot point blank with a 40mm “foam” launcher round by EPD Sgt. William Solesbee, while holding up her hands saying “don’t shoot.” Solesbee has been the subject of several previous excessive force lawsuits, yet continues on the force and, in fact, is one of EPD’s primary trainers. Chief Skinner excused Solesbee’s use of force, saying he had been “inadequately trained.” After the downtown curfew began, most protesters moved to just outside the curfew zone. While kneeling in remembrance of Floyd, they were given three minutes’ notice that the curfew was expanding citywide. They dispersed in small groups, walking on the sidewalk. Even so, EPD arrested several people of color, while white-appearing people were allowed to continue on their way. A woman doing jail support was arrested for simply asking arrestees’ names and contact information as she left the area. As people continued to leave downtown, the city brought out tank-like BearCat vehicles, tossing tear gas canisters into the crowd and shooting PepperBalls. A reporter forEugene Weeklyreceived a direct hit from a tear gas canister after repeatedly telling officers he was press. Solesbee even shot 40mm rounds at people on the porch of a residence. Of the many people arrested and charged on May 31, 2020 that we are aware of, the majority of the cases were dismissed. In response to the city’s trampling on the Constitution to quell righteous protest, Civil Liberties Defense Center first filed a lawsuit on behalf of the reporter, which the city quickly settled. We filed a second lawsuit on behalf of the woman shot by Solesbee, two people who were at home when Solesbee shot at the porch and three people arrested while leaving downtown. The city again settled quickly, but only with the person who was shot. We have completed discovery, which is the exchange of evidence between the litigants prior to trial, and are looking forward to the next round in the case, where we will present our evidence to the court and ask for a ruling. The city’s attorney attempted to use intimidation and privacy invasions in discovery, but our clients bravely stuck it out. What our clients want from this lawsuit is not just reparations for harm (although that’s an important element of justice , but also change, even if incremental, in the way Eugene operates in the future. The community can support these goals — for example, through donations to cover the astounding costs of depositions. But more importantly, we encourage people to continue to push harder, through outreach, media and other non-litigation techniques, to help ensure such overreach never happens again. We can also all learn how to better protect people’s rights. For protesters and media: Videotaping can be helpful when we sue the police, but the government also uses live streams to identify people to charge. Think before you stream! Focus on the bad behavior of the cops/counter-protesters. For municipalities and cops: Change is gonna come despite your intransigence. When defending against lawsuits, consider not just the current expense, but the need to change behavior. Civil rights plaintiffs are demanding significant changes to protect their rights and their communities Lauren Regan is the executive director and senior attorney at the Civil Liberties Defense Center. She is a trial lawyer and national expert in the defense of political activists, particularly those engaged in climate, racial, environmental and Indigenous justice advocacy."

I would like to ask county officials to rethink that idea.I was under the impression that evacuation routes, such as Waianuenue Avenue, are not supposed to be restricted in terms of traffic flow because that might hinder a swift and organized evacuation from downtown in case of a tsunami and from upper Hilo in case of oh, for instance, lava.In addition, Waianuenue is the primary path for emergency vehicles to access the hospital.Yes, I recognize that there are multiple schools in the vicinity, but they are hardly new to the area, and I don’t understand who thought that speed tables are needed or would be a good way to improve traffic for the people of Hilo.County officials, please consider another option, if one is actually needed.Jane HoffHiloPlan for Red HillRegarding the wonderful engineering feat of the underground tanks at Red Hill, I have a possible win-win solution for the U.S. Navy and the City and County of Honolulu: Fill the tanks with fresh water.As a Navy veteran and sailor of the Pacific and Asia, I can tell you all that fresh water is one of the most vital needs of our ships at sea.In addition to water for drinking, bathing and food preparation, it is also used for waste disposal, cleaning and, most importantly, operation of the boiler systems, without which ships don’t move (steam turns the propellers/screws and aircraft don’t fly from the aircraft carriers (steam propels the system that throws the planes off the deck and into the air . Fresh water is necessary for all of these systems.Consider this: The U.S. Navy has the ability and the capability to clean the tanks of oil and repurpose them as magnificent containers of some of the Earth’s freshest and best water — that from the Oahu aquifers. If a leak were to occur, only water would impact the aquifer below the tanks.I see this as an important positive factor for our society facing a troubling future with many problems to solve. Please give this idea some serious thought.Steve NemethHiloRegarding billionairesBillionaires have a new term to justify their focus on making lots of money (“Billionaires didn’t save the world,” Tribune-Herald, Nov. 23 .“Effective altruism” means you can be more effective at doing good things with your individual lots of money than thousands of people donating small sums.I think the term “effective altruism” is better expressed as “affective altruism.”William MautzKurtistownNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

suffolknewsherald_2022_92,"Published 7:59 pm Tuesday, May 10, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Lee H. HamiltonGuest columnistHaving just watched a Supreme Court nominee supported by a comfortable majority of Americans draw just three Republican votes in the Senate, you could be forgiven for thinking bipartisanship in Congress is a thing of the past. And in the case of Supreme Court nominees, you’d be right: The last time a nominee got over half the votes of the opposition party was in 2005, and you have to go back nearly three decades — to Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 — to find one who drew votes from almost all senators.But if you look carefully, there are plenty of signs that bipartisanship is still possible in Washington. President Joe Biden recently signed into law a bill reforming the Postal Service, which drew strong support from both parties in Congress. The same happened with a measure that keeps companies and universities from shielding themselves against lawsuits for sexual harassment. And both houses have passed a package aimed at boosting American competitiveness, again with support in both parties.There are other examples, as well, but you’ll notice something about them: They’re not focused on hot-button issues like voting rights or gun control or immigration. This is in no small part because in the Senate, a measure effectively needs 60 votes to pass — which means neither party can get bills approved without members of the other party.This is often intensely frustrating to partisans of whichever party is in power. Yet I’d argue it’s not a bad thing. In fact, the need for bipartisanship is pretty much baked into our system.We live in a time when political life is intensely polarized and many Americans live in what amounts to partisan bubbles of like-minded neighbors. For many people, this is just fine; they’re OK with avoiding contact with people who have different views. And ambitious politicians, always looking for an edge, have figured out how to navigate division: They use polarization to raise money from one group of potential supporters by attacking another group, and then goose election turnout by riling up their base.There are some state legislatures where party-line lawmaking can produce actual laws. Witness the wave of strict anti-abortion and anti-voting-rights measures passed last year and on the docket this year. But at the national level, intense polarization yields legislative deadlock. And at both the federal and state levels, it produces laws with dubious futures.The reason for this is that by requiring lawmakers to compromise and work with their political adversaries, bipartisanship often produces better, longer-lasting legislation. It helps ensure that a proposed law will take into account a broad range of views, produces wider acceptance both within a legislative body and in the public at large, and perhaps most important, means that the legislation has a chance of surviving the next change in power. Which, inevitably in our system, will occur.Politicians recognize this, of course. It’s not just that most Americans prefer to see bipartisanship. The reason you see politicians talking about finding bipartisan support and, less frequently but still often enough, working hard to secure it, is that they know that getting support from members of the other party is usually necessary not only to get something passed, but to have it be implemented effectively.To put it simply, if you’re just interested in scoring points with the base, then bipartisanship doesn’t matter. If you want to have a beneficial and lasting impact on American life, it matters a great deal.It may be tempting these days to throw up one’s hands in despair at the displays of highly partisan behavior in Washington and all around us at home in our states. But as a voter, there’s something you can do about it. Notice all the instances in which lawmakers work across the aisle to secure some piece of legislation. Pay attention to who does the heavy lifting to make it possible, and who stands in the way. Then support the people who recognize that bipartisanship is the route to effective legislating.Lee Hamilton is a senior adviser for the Indiana University Center on Representative Government; a distinguished scholar at the IU Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies; and a professor of practice at the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.

leoweekly_2022_74,"Last month The Atlantic ran a piece called “How to Save Democracy.” This was just one of hundreds of similar articles from the past two years, all of them variations on one central question: How do we make things “normal” again? To the extent that these pieces are prescriptive at all, they mostly prescribe simplistic-but-radical changes in the way we do everything. End gerrymandering! Stop the spread of disinformation! Learn to get along with the fascists who want to erase you! In other articles, the rescue measures are egregiously oversold. Call your representatives! Check your voter registration status! Plant a tree!Those pieces do not answer the original question. That’s because there is no answer.This is not solely a commentary on the current state of electoral politics. I’m writing this column the weekend before Election Day, and I don’t know if Democrats held onto the House or the Senate, or who won the Governor’s races, or the Secretary of State races that will determine the short-term future of fair elections. I won’t know until after this issue goes to press. It’s not quite right to say “I don’t care” about the outcome of the midterms (in fact I do care very much . What I mean is: The democracy cookie is crumbling, and it is unlikely that we can halt the process.Let’s think this through. Even if Democrats had a clean sweep this year, they’ll become an easy punching bag for the GOP. If they can’t head off the appeal of right-wing populism by mending the wealth gap (spoiler: they can’t , they lose the presidency in 2024. But let’s say the Dems fix everything in the next two years — they pass a Green New Deal and Medicare for All, increase the minimum wage, wipe out student debt, the whole progressive package. The courts will erase all of it, even as they enable red-state legislatures to do whatever they like. And Republicans will still take the White House by consensus, judicial fiat, insurrection or otherwise.In short, antidemocratic forces are poised to get their way for the foreseeable future, and at this point there isn’t much we can do about it. Scholars and well-informed pundits have been saying as much for years. We stood agog, watching the comet destined to strike America hurtle millions of miles through space, and now it’s finally close enough to touch.It’s strange, then, that of all the energy expended by thinkpiece writers on how they’d like to quantum leap back to the safe-and-sane 1990s, almost no ink has been devoted to what is surely a more important question by now: What are we doing to prepare for the inevitable death of American democracy?Maybe that’s because it’s so hard to see what The Empire looks like after it burns. Lots of bad things are probably going to happen, but it is not inevitable that we will end up in a totalitarian hellworld, our every emoji monitored by morality bots, an fMRI machine installed in our heads to detect dissent, our neighborhoods separated by razor wire. This is not your grandparents’ fascism, after all. Examination of our most powerful conservatives reveals a cabal of barely functioning failsons whose mothers never hugged them. These people do not care about governance. They seem barely cognizant of the existence of other humans at all. There is no coordinated master plan to wipe out one race or another, no grand ideology which might be said to drive the whole thing. So far it’s mostly a directionless cash grab at the expense of the ill-defined enemies of the hour. The engineers of democracy’s end will loot and pillage what they can, leaving the rest of us to fight for what’s left.Assuming that the artifices of the state collapse, how long do we need to mourn? “Normal,” for us Xers and Millennials wasn’t all that pretty. An orderly, coordinated America started hundreds of wars, installed dictators, imprisoned millions, erected torture chambers, poisoned waterways, segregated, overcharged, displaced, bulldozed, killed and killed and killed some more. We could do without all that.Consider, too, that there have always been humans without governance, without hierarchy, without leadership of any kind. This mode of living is not confined to early hunter-gatherer societies, but has been a lived reality for people all over the world at various times, and remains so today. Historian Peter Marshall writes, “In Africa, most people have managed their lives communally outside or despite their corrupt and dictatorial governments.” All of Catalonia was run by syndicates of workers for a few years in the 1930s. During an economic crisis in 2001, Argentinian activists set up their own trade systems. And in Chiapas state, indigenous activists kicked out the Mexican army in the 1990s so that they could do what the government wouldn’t: Provide clean water, pave roads, and build working hospitals and schools. The army never came back.Philosopher Colin Ward wrote: “A society which organizes itself without authority, is always in existence, like a seed beneath the snow, buried under the weight of the state and its bureaucracy, capitalism and its waste, privilege and its injustices, nationalism and suicidal loyalties, religious differences with their superstitious separatism.” People on every continent still prepare meals, read to their children and dance at weddings without thinking too much about who is running things, or whether things are being run at all. Maybe we’ll be alright on our own. Maybe even better off.Still the question remains: How are we preparing for the end? How can we, when there are so many unknowns? Should we pack all of our things into knapsacks and find a new place to call home? Should we fortify our houses to keep them safe from marauders, duct-taping pots and pans to the windows? Stockpile rifles and canned beans? Build catapults to fight off the drones? Should we buy up medical textbooks and loot imaging devices so that we can play doctor to our aging parents? Should we disappear into our screens, becoming Sims in a virtual world that we can make into whatever we’d like? Or should we learn to eschew weapons, computers and all other tools, wishing instead to feel the earth and grass sifting between our fingers as we plant seeds and dig for grubs?These are difficult, unpleasant considerations. But it seems to me that we can we are better served by asking how we can consciously craft the kind of society we want in the future rather than repeatedly asking how we might salvage the old one.•.

eugeneweekly_2022_1,"We ve got issues. There is a Jewish tradition that on the anniversary of a loved one’s death one lights a memorial candle, ayizkorcandle. One autumn a few years back, I needed a yizkor candle and walked over to one of our local supermarkets during my lunch break to see if they had one. The branch on the other side of town carried them, so I thought I might find one here. I didn’t expect the store workers to know about yizkor candles, so I said it was a Jewish memorial candle in a glass often found in the kosher section. They didn’t know what kosher was and brought me to the candle section. I explained again (and again that it probably wouldn’t be with candles and was usually with Jewish or kosher food items. The saleswoman became exasperated and told me they would have more Jewish items at Christmas time. I assumed she meant Chanukah candles. Before I said something rude, I left. So, I sighed when I looked at a calendar and saw this year that the days of Chanukah overlapped with Christmas. Jewish holidays move around the Gregorian calendar because of the Jewish calendar’s leap year which adds an extra month seven times during each 19-year period. Why the big sigh? Because when Chanukah and Christmas are near each other, it provides more opportunity for people like the saleswoman to think the holidays are the same and that Chanukah is, as I’ve heard, basically Jewish Christmas. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. When Chanukah is over before Christmas, even occurring sometimes on Thanksgiving, I can reply to people who say, “Happy holidays” by saying, “Thanks, but my winter holiday was over weeks ago.” When the holidays are close together, it’s hard to find a good response. Sometimes, I say Chanukah isn’t really that major a holiday, but thanks anyway. Sometimes I add that the important Jewish holiday seasons are in fall and spring. None of it is satisfying to me and usually not to the greeter, who often is trying to be inclusive. I hate saying Chanukah is not important because it has importance, and it’s a lovely holiday — candles, dreidels (spinning tops and greasy foods like latkes (potato pancakes andsuvganiot(jelly donuts . Both my son and grandfather were born on the fifth night of Chanukah, so it’s particularly special to me. But in Judaism, Chanukah is more celebration than holy day and is not mentioned in the Torah. Ironically, Chanukah celebrates resisting assimilation. In 167 BCE, King Antiochus IV tried to force Jews to assimilate into Greek culture and made it punishable by death for practicing Judaism. The Maccabees led a successful revolt against this oppression. When the Jews re-entered their temple, it was in disarray with only enough oil to light one day. Miraculously, so the story goes, the oil lasted eight days. Thus, eight nights of candle lighting. Because it celebrates fighting assimilation, traditionally you place the Chanukah menorah or Chanukah in your window to proudly be visibly Jewish. Despite this, Chanukah is the Jewish holiday most assimilated into mainstream culture. Given this history, I’m not sure I feel better when people say, “happy holidays” rather than “Merry Christmas.” At least if they mention Christmas, I can say, thanks, “I don’t celebrate Christmas, but I hope your holiday goes well.” Saying happy holidays puts me in a quandary about how to respond and sometimes sets me up as being ungracious. It’s hard to get the nuance of Chanukah without feeling you are dismissing your culture. Idon’t need blue and white elves, Chanukah tinsel or even people saying happy holidays near Christmas. On the other hand, I am so grateful in the fall during the Jewish High Holy Days when someone says “Happy New Year” or even “Happy holidays.” Particularly with the rise of anti-Semitism, I appreciate those people who consider the fullness of the Jewish community, including when and what their holidays are. Many, many cultures and religions have winter holidays worth finding out about; many involving light during the dark winter days. I love to learn about other people’s traditions and customs and am honored when I am included in their celebrations, Christmas included. My hope is to be respectful of what different communities observe and find important not only in the winter, but all year round. That’s something we all could celebrate. ν tova stabin recently retired from being the Communications Manager for Equity and Inclusion at the University of Oregon.

suffolknewsherald_2022_189,"Published 3:00 pm Thursday, January 27, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Ariane WilliamsWorth is the level at which someone deserves to be valued or rated. I ask you today, “Do you know your worth?”One night, I decided to search within myself; I decided that enough was enough, and that it was time for me to be refilled and allow God to refine my worth. You see, I was looking for refining in the wrong places and in the wrong people. It all began with a dream when I began walking towards a blazing fire. My hair was hanging down my back; I wore a flowy white dress, no makeup, and I wasn’t wearing any shoes. Just me. I can remember the feel of the rocks as they stuck to the bottom of my feet. I knew that the pain from the crushing rocks was temporary but my refining was going to refill me with the permanent love of God. At first, I was afraid, but there was a sense of comfort in the heat that pulled me closer and closer to the fire. A voice whispered to me, “It is time for you to walk through as I refine your worth.”Refining is the removal of bubbles from the molten glass and is supported by high temperature and stirring. How many of us know that in the midst of refining, there will be some trouble bubbles on the route and some heated moments as God begins to stir what is within us to get it out of us? As I walked towards the voice, there was something holding me back. As I looked to the left, I saw all the things that tried to hold me back last year. I felt the pain from some of those things just like contractions when you are getting ready to push to deliver life into the world, yet the contractions subsided and were replaced with the whispering voice that birthed healing. I began to walk through because on the other side of the fire, I saw my worth for the first time.It becomes a battle within the mind and the heart when you are taking back your power. Know that your pain, your challenges, your tears, your uncontrolled emotions, your ability to not let go, your crazy mind was only a journey to bring you to the fire. This is your season of refining your worth. Be careful of trying to get people to validate your worth when God sent His son to die on the cross, because He already knew your worth. Stop being afraid of the fire, just go through it. On the other side of the fire, is your “powered” strength. Those things that tried to control you will become ashes and on the other side, those ashes will be replaced with an anointed beauty.There are those moments when we are tried. It may not feel good in the midst of the refining process, but you must allow God to take what’s within you, refine it, and breathe it back in you so that you can blow it back out to heal the world.Today, look back at those things one more time and get ready to walk through the fire. It is not going to burn you physically, but as you walk through, it is going to refill you with a new fire of strength to empower your anointing. It was in your preparation stages that God stripped you from what you thought you were to clothe you with who He knows you are. Your season of refining is here. Those bubbles did not destroy you. You stood in the high temperature as life stirred around you. The uncharted emotions from your past will be left behind the fire. Just walk. You may have felt like you were getting further away from God; He was only bringing you closer to the fire. Know your worth. Your value cannot be devalued by anyone who can’t measure the truth of your heart.Ariane Williams is a teacher, minister, published author and liturgical dancer.

minnpost_2022_109,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesota has an enviable problem – how to spend a $9.25 billion fortune, the latest and greatest in a decade-long series of state budget surpluses.While the governor, a Democratic House and a Republican Senate dicker and bicker over what to do with that windfall, 80 percent of preschool children living in poverty have yet to become even a footnote in state education spending.That neglect must end. Now.The $70 million in state money earmarked for early childhood scholarships hasn’t changed in four years. Neither has the grim outlook for 31,000 disadvantaged kids left behind by a state initiative too ill-funded to help every child in need.It’s time for the state to double-down on early childhood education this year and, after measurable results show what that spending can accomplish, double spending on disadvantage kids again in the next biennial budget.Study after study show that children, from birth to age 4, enrolled in quality early education are less likely to later drop out of school or run afoul of the law and more likely to be healthier and end up as reliable taxpayers with stable families.If the governor and legislator can’t agree on a surplus spending plan by midnight, May 22, the state will be failing tens of thousands of kids who can’t wait another year to get a head start in education – and in life.Investing in those kids is the best long-term investment the state can make, an estimated 16 percent rate of return – far higher than competing claims on public money.The improved school outcomes for early ed for kids, age 3 and 4, are sustainable and well-established.But preparing disadvantaged children for school – to learn how to learn – must begin even earlier, with pre-natal visits and recruiting parents to engage with their children from birth to their earliest years.The latest research, published earlier this year, indicates an enriched environment literally can spark to life key regions of developing brains.I recently moderated a panel that illustrated the promise stimulating even the youngest of minds. The session was sponsored by the Heller-Hurwicz Economics Institute at the University of Minnesota, a think tank dedicated to transforming research into tools of public policy.Money can be a key element in changing the fortunes of the youngest living in poverty. An experiment, which already has spent $5 million raised from foundations and private donors, has yielding fascinating evidence of how infant brain maturity is affected by family income.Using electronic imaging of the brain activity of 435 healthy one-year-olds born to low-income parents in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Omaha, New York City and New Orleans, the study is in its fourth year.In a random lottery, the mostly Black and Latina mothers with incomes averaging about $20,000, were divided into two groups. One receives a monthly cash gift of $333. The other a token $20 a month.The experiment, begun in June 2019, will continue with unconditional payments to mothers until the children are four years, four months old.The study started with a simple premise, according to Katherine Magnuson, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.The results visibly verified that idea.Electronic scans, interpreted by neuroscientist, showed the brains of children literally lit up in regions associated with cognition. That is, if their mothers had received a 20 percent increase in family income from the $333 monthly checks.Meanwhile, the electrical activity of the same areas of the brain were muted for kids in the families receiving only $20 a month.In effect, children whose families got an economic boost also got a lift in brain development, Magnuson said.“It’s the idea that even before you can really reliably assess cognitive development from figuring out how many numbers or words they know, what colors they understand, you can look at their brain activity and potentially get a glimpse of what’s to come,” she said.Let’s awaken the brain waves of Minnesota’s political leaders with a call to action.Improving the future of kids living in poverty is doable. Let’s do it.Art Rolnick is a board member of the Heller-Hurwicz Economics Institute and retired director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis."

Everything that could possibly close did so. Everyone who could possibly stay home did so, too.That’s the way time was. A time when tiny hamlets around our land pulled their worlds in around them and folks gathered ’round hearths with family members and friends, something of a Norman Rockwellian picture of the holiday the way we would like for it to be.Perhaps in some places it’s still like that. Maybe some families are still able to make it a point to come together, eat, enjoy one another’s company and spend the day without shopping — maybe even without football!Why not spend this Thanksgiving rejoicing in something we have rather than lamenting what’s missing?That exercise might yield different results for each person, even if the times — your times — seem dark or short on hope. Thanksgiving is about, as overworked as it might seem, giving thanks for the things we have, even the tiniest of things.Are you in passable health? Be thankful.Got enough to eat? There are plenty who don’t. Give yourself the blessing of a warm heart and them a full stomach by making a donation to Suffolk charities that provide for the less fortunate.Do you have a place to live? More and more don’t each and every day. Ponder it for a moment.The holidays should be about giving, sharing joy and alleviating suffering for others, while being thankful for our own blessings. When it comes down to it, we can make our own holidays even more joyful if we consider giving to others.Sure, stores are opening earlier, sales are starting sooner, people will be lining up for the bargains while the turkey leftovers are still on the table.

leoweekly_2022_58,"While the end of winter in Kentuckiana brings the promise of warm weather staples like Thunder Over Louisville and the Kentucky Derby, the onset of spring in the political world means primary elections are right around the corner. Until recently, Judge Shelley Santry was making her rounds on the campaign trail. It was hard to miss her hot pink election banners posted throughout the city. The signs would come down in early February however, as Santry was informed, she would be running unopposed in the upcoming election cycle, thus sealing her next eight years as a Jefferson County Family Court judge. Despite being unopposed, Judge Santry stays committed to fervently serving her community.After working at Legal Aid for nine years, in 2001 Santry began her work as a prosecutor, handling sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse cases for the Jefferson County Attorney’s office. Then in 2010, she would be offered the director position at the Ackerson Law Clinic through the UofL Louis D. Brandeis School of Law. It was a position Santry jumped at.“I began my career as a teacher in Boston Public Schools, so I felt at home as a professor teaching law by experiential learning,” recalls Santry. During her time in the clinic, Santry taught approximately 250 law students using a curriculum of practical learning. “We represented low-income survivors of domestic violence from the beginning of their cases in family court, focusing on the protective order piece, and then offering a ‘holistic’ service for additional issues,” says Santry of her class.Despite two unsuccessful judicial campaigns in 2008 and 2018, Santry remained undaunted on her path to the bench. “I feel that the ultimate way that you can help people is to be a judge who is fair, compassionate and respectful,” says Santry. She would finally get the opportunity to put those principles to practice as Gov. Andy Beshear would appoint her as a family court judge in April of 2021.With her professional history, Judge Santry is certainly an expert on the nationwide increase of domestic violence incidents that the pandemic era has brought. The National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice estimated that domestic violence incidents in the United States increased 8.1% on average following stay at home orders. On a global scale, the United Nations estimates a 20% increase in domestic violence incidents across its 193 member states during the COVID-19 mandatory quarantines. Judge Santry highlights several reasons for these increases saying, “domestic violence is often motivated by many stressors like unemployment, loss of lives and frustration.”“The pandemic delivered these stressors in abundance and did not help households,” she continues.Of course, these statistics only document the cases that we know about. Many pandemic-era domestic violence incidents have gone unreported. In Louisville, Judge Santry points to survivors not being aware the legal system was still operating during the pandemic as a reason for low domestic violence reporting numbers. In fact, this was a situation the judge took intentional steps locally to correct. “As police officers are the first people on the scene, some of the committees I serve on made a conscious effort to educate our officers to tell survivors that you can still take out an EPO, the courthouse is open, and the family courts never closed,” says Santry.While Santry said the reporting numbers of child abuse decreased during the pandemic, one of the main avenues for reports to be made, schools, did not operate in the same capacity. “One of the best reporters of child abuse are our teachers,” says Santry. “And when the kids were not in school, teachers didn’t have the opportunity to talk to their students on the playground about why they were so sad. As such, we saw those reporting numbers go significantly down,” she continues. Be it domestic violence or child abuse, if the incidents aren’t being reported, it becomes even more difficult for victims to find relief.Despite the term “endemic” being tossed around recently, the effects of the pandemic on domestic violence and child abuse cases are still seen today. Santry points to the reduction in the work force, specifically a shortage of sheriffs, as a pandemic byproduct affecting domestic violence cases in Louisville. “A few weeks ago, I had a docket of 72 cases but was only able to hear about 15 of them because the rest were unserved,” she states.And even though the days of mass quarantine are behind us, Santry states that domestic violence numbers remain high. Despite this, she still tries to instill a sense of hope for survivors. “It is important for folks to know that they’re not alone and there are plenty of people that care about your situation,” she says.Judge Santry is certainly one of them.James J.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_95,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°In the first nationwide test of public sentiments since the Supreme Court last summer ended abortion rights in America, voters got to have their say. So far, their verdict has been resounding: Voters in almost a half-dozen states cast their ballots Nov. 8 for measures to protect the biological self-determination of women — and nowhere did voters turn back those rights. Exit polls indicated it was the second-most important overall subject motivating voters and by far the most important one motivating people to vote Democratic.Pro-choice forces must heed the clear message here and make sure the topic remains front and center throughout the lead-up to 2024.The court’s ruling overturning Roe v. Wade this year was heavily influenced by the personal preferences of five conservative justices, who chose to disregard a half-century of court precedent. Privacy rights implicit in the Constitution were held less important than states’ rights. They also disregarded the views of a strong majority of Americans who support abortion rights with reasonable restrictions.By removing Roe’s nationwide guarantee of abortion rights within the first trimester, the court effectively threw the issue back to the states. Red state governments in Missouri and elsewhere responded by quickly gutting abortion rights in their laws. Kansas lawmakers wanted to join the anti-choice stampede, but the state’s courts had already ruled that the Kansas Constitution protected abortion rights. So Republicans pushed a referendum on last August’s ballot to amend the state constitution — only to see their normally conservative voters overwhelmingly defeat it.It’s now clear that outcome was no fluke.Five additional states on Tuesday had measures on their ballots either bolstering or undercutting abortion rights.And in every case, voters sided with women’s ability to control their own bodies, including in the red states of Kentucky and Montana and the swing state of Michigan.Kentucky’s measure would have explicitly established that the state’s constitution doesn’t protect abortion rights, while Montana’s measure sought to confront the specter of “born-alive” abortions — which in the real world virtually never happen but which anti-abortion activists have used to gin up emotion on the topic. Both measures failed. Voters in Michigan, California and Vermont all enshrined abortion rights in their state constitutions.Missouri voters aren’t nearly as radically right as their elected legislators, as evidenced by voter-approved referendums on Medicaid expansion, labor rights, the minimum wage and, last week, legalized recreational marijuana sales and use. The once-unthinkable idea of putting abortion rights on the ballot in Missouri is perhaps something pro-choice activists here should be looking at.Nationally, Democrats should take Tuesday’s results as evidence that abortion rights are indeed a politically potent topic that should be highlighted at every turn.As congressional Republicans whisper about a federal abortion ban should they ultimately win control of Congress, Democrats should be talking more loudly about bolstering abortion rights nationally — which can only happen if they win in 2024.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"

One way to change this is by telling their story to the world.I recently attended the Brunswick County Business Summit along with other ecosystem stakeholders. The summit centered around discussions on how the county can tell its story more widely and frequently. The main topic of the event was to share that Brunswick County is open for business.

philinquirer_2022_23,"The host nation of Qatar is proudly repressive and has engaged in human rights abuses. Love of soccer or no, I can’t ignore my conscience.I’m not going to call it a boycott.After all, I didn’t intend to skip out on this year’s World Cup. I did not set out,as others did, on a moral crusade to get others to stop watching. I just haven’t.It isn’t that I’m not interested. Far from it, I’ve been in love witho jogo bonitofor as long as I can remember.Nike’s classic 1998 adfor the World Cup, in which Brazilian players start a pickup game in a busy airport (even dodging planes on the tarmac , is ingrained in my consciousness.As young kids choosing our own pickup games in a shared driveway in Frankford, I was soccer’s only consistent supporter. Since my family didn’t have cable, I would walk to my grandparents’ house to watch World Cup games. With the U.S. not expected to be a real contender, it was easy to transfer my support to the Brazilian team, whose spectrum of skin tones reminded me ofmy familyand neighborhood.Still, I have not been able to bring myself to watch this year’smatches. I’ve checked the scores, scanned the tables of games, but when I switched on the TV for the inaugural match between Ecuador and host nation Qatar, my attention went elsewhere, quickly. It hasn’t really returned. By holding the tournament in theproudly repressive country, FIFA went too far.Love of soccer or no, I couldn’t ignore my stubborn conscience.» READ MORE:US OKs $1B arms sale to Qatar during key World Cup matchSadly, corruption has been a part of international soccer since the start. While I couldn’t have known it as a 9-year-old, the game I was growing to enjoy is run by theFédération Internationale de Football Association. That’s French for one of the most corrupt organizations in the world.As a history student at Temple, I studied thehistory of global soccer— the record is abysmal. When FIFA held the 1934 World Cup in Italy, Swedish referee Ivan Eklindmet with Benito Mussolinibefore the semifinal and championship matches. Eklind’s choice has led to a long-standing belief that Mussolini conspired with FIFA to fix the tournament in Italy’s favor, a massive propaganda win for his fascist movement.The corruption, and sanction for repression, didn’t stop there. FIFA picked Argentina, ruled by a military junta that killed tens of thousands in the “Dirty War,” to host the 1978 championship. Russia was awarded the 2018 tournament, despite invading Ukraine four years before and Georgia a decade earlier.In some ways, locating the cup in Qatar, one of the oil-rich, authoritarian Gulf States, is broadly in line with tradition. And soccer is hardly the only sport to rely onunsavory,racist,misogynistic, andwealthy elite leadership. But as bad as those choices may have been, choosing Qatar is worse.Most World Cups are played inexisting stadiums with their own legendary history — such as Brazil’sMaracanaorWembley Stadiumin London — or make do with stadiums built for other sports, like our ownLincoln Financial Field. Lacking these facilities, the Qataris had to build them. To do that, they used slave labor.According to an investigation by the Guardian, more than6,500 of these captive laborersdied as a result of FIFA’s boneheaded choice. While Qatari sources dispute this death toll, their own statements put the numberin the hundreds, an unconscionable sum. Qatari leadership has claimed to not even have an official number, showing just how little these lives were valued.Euphemistically termed “migrant labor,” these workers paid the blood price for FIFA executives’ greed. The death tolls, whether you accept the Qatari estimates of the Guardian’s research, are brutal.Migrant workers have long been a part of the economic calculus of Qatar. Estimates put thenonnative share of the populationat nearly 90%. While some are highly compensated, well-educated professionals, others are subject to the brutalKafala systemof sponsorship-based employment, which traps them in a cycle of abuse. Some companies operating in Qatar have even been formally charged withholding workers in involuntary servitude.Of course, Qataris,and their defenders, say that criticism of Qatari law is an example of Western arrogance and neocolonialism. Gianni Infantino, FIFA’s president, went as far as to compare the treatment of LGBTQ people under Qatari law to the “bullying” he apparently experienced for hisnow nonexistentred hair.» READ MORE:Top US diplomat criticizes FIFA armband threat at World CupWhile certainly fans can survive a few hours without beer at a stadium — which the conservative host nation banned two days before the first game — the lack of libation is hardly the most pressing cultural issue at hand. Unspoken was the obvious question: How could gay fans, women, and others who lack basic rights in Qatar trust the assurances of fair treatment, given the last-second U-turn on something as lucrative as booze?Qatar isn’t a nation being colonized unwillingly by occupiers; it is itself a wealthy and powerful nation, so much so that it was able to bribe FIFA to win its bid, erectseven brand-new stadiums, build anew rail system, and even constructan eerily empty cityfor the tournament.By utilizing the captive labor of migrants to accomplish these feats, it is the Qataris who are engaged in exploitative and cruel practices most associated with colonial imperialism, not those who have stood up for human rights. After all, “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”As much as I love soccer, and even with the corruption and misconduct I’ve long had to put up with as a fan, the reality of daily life in Qatar has soiled the beautiful game."

Trump has already told his followers to lay down their lives for this contrived crisis. I have to give him credit, though; what Trump and many others like Tucker Carlson do is akin to a magic trick. They can take a cup of conspiratorial crap and turn it into billions of barrels of bull excrement.The “legitimate political discourse” of the National Republican Convention — to include this strategy but is not limited to attacking with bear spray and blunt objects any law enforcement officer who stands in their way when they are trying to disrupt an official government procedure that is mandated by the Constitution of the United States — is now being applied to a newly imagined MAGA crisis.The newest fabricated crisis about CRT endangers teachers, administrators and school district representatives. Trump has told his followers to lay down their lives to combat CRT. This is the same incendiary language Trump used when he ordered his acolytes to disrupt a congressional procedure on Jan. 6, 2021.How many innocent people will be killed and injured this time over another contrived crisis? Don’t teachers, principals and school district representatives have a hard enough job already? Now they’ve got to worry about offending anyone who might think their worldview is being challenged by what is being taught to their children in the classroom.Technically speaking, CRT is only taught in law schools. The accusations about CRT being taught in any class below a graduate level is disingenuous. However, I firmly believe critical thinking is an essential tool everyone should strive to have some competency in.If children are not taught to think critically and to discern on their own what is true and what is not true, then they will be easier dupes for any demagogue who has a bully pulpit. For instance: Without critical thinking you might become an easy mark in the con where you pay tens of thousands of dollars to enroll in a university that is not a university in any way, shape or form. I am referring to Trump University — just to be clear.Evidently the real fear of the MAGA high command is the fear that their constituents might start thinking critically— and as we say in poker lingo, that’s the “tell.” If Trump’s MAGA mob had a high level of critical thinking, then maybe they might be able to see through the MAGA high command’s self-serving palaver.One thing is for sure: Trump is not going to stick his neck out for anyone or any issue — as was clearly evident the last time he pulled this stunt of asking others to lay down their life for his aspirations.Melvin Brinkley, a retired Veterans Affairs and Air Force chaplain now living in Davis, California, graduated from Suffolk’s John F.

suffolknewsherald_2022_47,"Published 6:09 pm Tuesday, June 28, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Lee H. HamiltonGuest columnistThere’s been a tidal wave of commentary lately on the Supreme Court’s politicization. Much of it argues that the court has fallen prey to the same partisanship and polarization that have marked American politics in recent decades.It’s possible that this alarm over the court’s drift is simply a measure of the scrutiny its decisions have come in for. Over the course of my career I’ve seen rising public interest in what the court does and how it affects American social and political life, as the justices have rendered controversial decisions that touch on the most intimate aspects of Americans’ lives and on the workings of American politics in a divided age.Still, this is hardly the first time that the court’s politicization has become a hot topic. It’s come up repeatedly during our history — all the way back to 1801, when John Adams and the Federalists passed a law shrinking the court upon the next vacancy so as to keep Thomas Jefferson, who succeeded Adams, from getting the chance to name a new justice.It seems inarguable that the court is more polarized than it was a few decades ago. This is, in the end, largely a reflection of the polarization of the Senate. In the past, presidents often sought to nominate justices who could command the broad center of that institution: people like John Paul Stevens, who was a liberal Republican, or Lewis Powell, a conservative Democrat. But those days are over, at least for now.I’ve never bought into the idea that the court is above and beyond politics. Justices can’t help but have their political biases. I think that, at least in the past, they worked hard to put them aside, but doing so completely is an impossible task.Can the court regain some of the respect it’s lost among Americans at large? A lot will depend on the justices’ behavior. They have to be good listeners. They have to possess enough humility to recognize that they don’t have the answer to every question. Obviously, they should have a deep respect for the law and for precedence.And, I would suggest, they need to balance the framers’ points of view with the experiences of the ordinary Americans whose lives will inevitably be affected by every decision they make.Lee Hamilton is a senior adviser for the Indiana University Center on Representative Government; a distinguished scholar at the IU Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies; and a professor of practice at the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_83,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°In the midterms, Republicans who focused on inflation, crime and other concrete problems made gains. Those who slung the slop of Trumpite invective and conspiracy theories, insisting the 2020 election was stolen, overwhelmingly remained stuck in the muck.Yet since narrowly taking the House, Republicans under leader (and likely next speaker Kevin McCarthy have not rolled out a five-point crime control agenda. Or a smart plan to slow inflation. Or a blueprint for fixing America’s immigration system. Rather, out of the gate, the incoming leaders of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees are vowing to investigate President Joe Biden’s son.We hope they enjoy themselves. The people they represent sure won’t appreciate two years of Benghazi-style hysterics.Let’s be clear. Hunter Biden had lucrative dealings with foreign firms; his laptop is not some right-wing fever dream. An NBC News analysis of his hard drive and other documents published in May revealed that from 2013 through 2018, he and his firm raked in about $11 million from work with a Ukrainian firm and a Chinese businessman since accused of wrongdoing.Indeed, the president’s son is now under investigation by the Delaware U.S. attorney — with prosecutors, led by Trump appointee David Weiss, purportedly weighing charging him with tax crimes and making a false statement regarding a gun purchase. In contrast to a predecessor who treated the Justice Department as a weapon to wield against his enemies, Joe Biden has said he will not interfere with the professionals as they mull what to do. Attorney General Merrick Garland made a similar pledge.Not content with letting the wheels of justice turn, learning nothing from the first Trump impeachment, hyperventilating House Republicans are intent on smearing the son, and by association the father, in a transparent attempt to fire up the angriest slice of their base.President Biden has signed into law a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill and an Inflation Adjustment Act with $500 billion in new spending and tax breaks. Here’s a crazy idea: Maybe the House Oversight Committee could make it its highest priority to … oversee that spending?— New York Daily NewsHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track. Contractor Nan Inc. began construction on the project in Dec. 2023, following a design and planning process that started in 2017."
minnpost_2022_148,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Recent news reports suggest the Biden Administration is likely to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA to address key shortages in critical minerals, like lithium and nickel. This is a response to supply chain disruptions brought on by the Russian war with Ukraine.The DPA has been recently used to command the production of medical equipment during COVID-19. This law enables a president to use loans, direct purchases and other business investments to incentivize production of goods and materials to promote national defense.Using the DPA for clean energy supply chains would seem like a popular strategy. Earlier this month, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK and Joe Manchin (D-WV urged President Biden to take this action. Energy activists are also heralding this as a move that can spur investments in electric vehicles.Yet, the DPA is the wrong instrument for increasing domestic supplies of minerals for clean energy development. In the U.S., a new mine will take an average of 10 years to receive its permits because of the extensive investigations needed to prove safety. Even if minerals are extracted, they need to be shipped abroad for processing since there are no facilities in the U.S. to process these minerals. New mines and processing facilities simply cannot come online fast enough to address an urgent need for minerals. And, the Biden Administration has already supported the mining industry through the recent infrastructure law. The 2020 Energy Act also directed the Department of Energy to invest $740 million in research and development for the industry.Tellingly, the mining industry has been lobbying for use of the DPA for years. Invoking the DPA now feels like the first step toward what the industry actually wants – the fast-tracking of mining projects so that they don’t require extensive regulatory review. While the press is reporting that the Interior and Energy departments will help implement the use of the DPA, these same agencies have been blocking new mines because of the danger they pose to natural resources and public health, particularly for tribal communities. For example, in October 2021 the Biden Administration announced a 20-year ban on new mining activity on federal land near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.Investing in the circular metals economy is part of the Biden Administration’s recentlyreleasedcomprehensive strategy for mining reform. This policy aims to strengthen permitting standards and define what sustainable and responsible mining looks like in the 21stcentury. The goal is to revise the antiquated 1872 law that essentially allows mining companies to purchase a mining claim for either $2.50 or $5.00 per acre, grossly undervaluing the land itself and all the ecosystem services provided. Just a few weeks ago, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland stated that “The 150th anniversary of the Mining Law of 1872 is a great opportunity to take a hard look at how we regulate and permit mining in this country.”Given all this important work underway, the DPA is a distraction and intended to serve up favors to Biden’s political opponents and a mining industry intent on picking up spoils from the Russian invasion. This is not how we spur a just and clean energy revolution.Roopali Phadke is professor and chair of the Environmental Studies Department at Macalester College and the principal investigator of a National Science Foundation multi-year study on the future of mining in the 21st century."

leoweekly_2022_19,"Entrepreneurs:Are you looking for a way to start a business that helps marginalized people, thereby lending direction to your purposeless, empty life? I have a billion-dollar1 idea that you can have for free. First, some background. If you’re familiar with criminal justice problems in the region or if you’re pressed for time, you can skip past the numbered list.1. The jails around hereare bad.Other LEO writers and I have covered this extensively, so I don’t see reason to spill more ink on it here. If you still need convincing, read the rest of this issue.2. The problems are bigger and badder than you think.For every horrible death you hear about, there are at least a million constitutional violations that happen at jails and prisons all over the region. Incarcerated people are denied medications, beaten up by guards, tossed into solitary confinement for months at a time, deprived of bedding and basic hygiene items, and generally subjected to what anyone who knows international human rights standards would call “torture” all day, every day. Most of this stuff is so common as to be considered unnewsworthy. Even run-of-the-mill deaths can go unnoticed, especially in rural areas where there are few reporters, attorneys or other outsiders with access to prisoners.3. The courts could make things less bad.We have been taught that a lawsuit should be the standard response to violations of one’s civil and constitutional rights for about seven decades in America. For purposes of this article, let’s assume this is still true. Yes, the federal courts are mostly populated with psychopaths, and the current Supreme Court is like a council of spider-demons from a Neil Gaiman book. But Louisville is about to seat some of the most forward-thinkingstate-court judges in the country; judges who understand the plight of incarcerated people, or who at least possess a modicum of compassion. Many other metropolitan areas are seeing similar shakeups. There’s still a pathway through the courts, however narrow, to something resembling justice.4. There aren’t enough lawyers to handle all this badness.Assuming that the courts are willing and able to fix things a bit, there’s still the question of how a case might get to a judge in the first place. There are only so many hours in a day, and the few self-employed lawyers who represent incarcerated people need to make enough dough to pay their overhead and eat. The amount of money won at trial for, say, a garden-variety jail beatdown is usually not enough to justify the time and expense spent litigating said beatdown in court for a year or two. As such, private attorneys can only afford to take the worst of the worst cases: Paralyzing injuries, deaths or class actions. More than 90% of all lawsuits against jails and prisons are handledpro se(without a lawyer , and those are brought only by prisoners who have the wherewithal to file them in the first place. Federal courts know that no one will notice if they dismiss those cases quickly and quietly, so that’s usually what happens. As a result, penal institutions (and their insurance carriers have little incentive to correct anything that doesn’t result in shocking, gruesome, newsworthy death, and most constitutional violations go totally unchecked.This brings us to my billion-dollar2 idea. Presently, I know of no nonprofit between here and Chicago that both 1 focuses on criminal justice issues and 2 has an advocacy arm (that is to say, it employs its own salaried lawyers . You should start one.Such organizations exist in just about every other region in the country. Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, for example, has five chapters throughout the state, and there are umpteen orgs based in the nation’s capital. California has a few options, including Prison Law Office and For the People. Washington has Columbia Legal Services. In the South, you’ve got the Florida Justice Institute, North Carolina Prisoner Legal Services, and others. These nonprofits do great work, but there’s nothing like them within a 100-mile radius of Louisville. Public defenders don’t do civil cases, Legal Aid doesn’t handle criminal justice issues, and most other nonprofits rely on volunteer legal help from private lawyers. The closest thing we’ve got are the state ACLU chapters, and they’re busy dealing with the incessant, screeching madness emanating from Frankfort and Indianapolis.Too often, we hear about a social problem and think, “That’s terrible, but at least someone is taking care of that.” We are usually wrong, especially when it comes to the rights of incarcerated people. Of the tens of thousands of bodies crammed into more than 200 facilities in Indiana and Kentucky, only those few who can get the attention of a private lawyer have any shot at getting help or vindication, even if they’ve been subjected to unspeakable horrors. A dedicated nonprofit organization wouldn’t correct this problem, of course, but it would help. A small team of salaried attorneys can litigate the cases the private bar can’t afford to take. Over time, they’d be able to identify patterns that news crews don’t see. And they can hit the same institution over and over until its warden/director/insurer decides that the price of settling multiple cases might be more costly than addressing the underlying problem.So there you have it. A couple of grants, a partnership with a law school, maybe a little3 startup cash, and you’ve got yourself a brand-new, billion-dollar4 nonprofit along with a newraison d’être. When you’ve got enough of a budget to hire an outrageously overpriced consultant, I hope you’ll think of me. •1 Spoiler: This article is about starting anonprofit. You will not make a billion dollars from this idea. But you’ll feel like a billiondollars if you do it!2 See n.1, supra.3 By “a little” I mean “a lot.” It would take a lot.4 Again, see n.1, supra..

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_4,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°One result from Tuesday’s midterm elections is already clear: Donald Trump’s political touch is anything but golden. The former president’s favored candidates largely tumbled as voters recoiled from their extremism.Trump’s Svengali-like hold over the GOP is based mostly in fear that he’ll whip his followers into a frenzy against any Republican who crosses him. (Just ask Mike Pence. But what happened Tuesday should convince Republicans that the threat of bucking Trump isn’t as politically dangerous to their party as embracing him.As the vote-counting continues, Republicans might still retake the House, as has been long expected, with the Senate remaining a tossup. But make no mistake: The GOP’s undeniable failure to meet expectations in this election was in large part directly attributable to Trump’s disastrous role as self-appointed kingmaker.In congressional and state-level primaries around the country earlier this year, he bigfooted again and again to back the Republican candidates most solicitous to him and his election fraud lies, rather than those with the best chances to win.The consequences were clear Tuesday in contests like Pennsylvania’s Senate race. Democratic victor John Fetterman was viewed by many as too far left, then he suffered a stroke that impeded his ability to campaign.But he had one thing in his favor: Republican opponent Mehmet Oz, a celebrity quack doctor who Trump muscled onto the ballot over better candidates because he obediently parroted Trump’s lies.Trump reserves special ire for the few congressional Republicans who responsibly voted for his impeachment. He made sure that two of them, Reps. Peter Meijer of Michigan and Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, failed to win their primaries, getting Trumpian candidates onto the ballot instead. As of Thursday, the GOP had lost the Michigan seat and was on the verge of losing in Washington.It was Trump who helped saddle Georgia Republicans with scandal-wracked Senate nominee Herschel Walker.In May, Trump predicted that Walker’s only problem would be having to share the ballot with Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who displeased Trump by disputing his election lies.On Tuesday, Kemp won reelection with more than 53% of the vote, while Walker got 48% — about 1 point less than Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock.Since neither Walker nor Warnock hit 50%, they will compete in a runoff next month. Warnock and fellow Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff both were elected in 2021 runoffs in which Republican turnout was tamped down by Trump’s false claims that the state’s elections were corrupt.In other words, Democrats largely have Trump to thank for their current control of the Senate — and he may yet help them keep it.As tempting as it is to cheer on Republicans’ self-sabotaging fealty to this bull in their political china shop, they would help both their party and their country by finally pushing him out.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
suffolknewsherald_2022_170,"Published 5:43 pm Tuesday, February 15, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:As a resident who has lived in Suffolk for two years, I have noticed that pedestrians are not adequately accommodated when it comes to the streets of Suffolk. In my area, on Kenyon Road, I live right between a high school and a middle school; yet, what surprises me is that there are not any visible sidewalks to protect the children from cars. Paved sidewalks are vital in a prosperous community as it reduces roadway crashes involving pedestrians.According to the U.S Department of Transportation, “Roadways without sidewalks are more than twice as likely to have pedestrian crashes as sites with sidewalks on both sides of the street.” With the upcoming expansion of Holland Road, it is important to first accommodate the pedestrians, especially the schoolchildren walking to and from school. It horrifies me that there are no crosswalks or sidewalks between these long stretches of busy road.Sidewalks are necessary in a community. Not only do they help pedestrians get from point A to point Z, but they promote a healthier lifestyle, such as running, biking and walking. Also, sidewalks would help the area grow economically. In an article from the AARP, “Retail properties with a Walk Score ranking of 80 out of 100 were valued 54 percent higher than properties with a Walk Score of 20 and had an increase in net operating income of 42% for more walkable properties.” Keep in mind that walk scores above 70-89 is deemed as very walkable for running errands, while a score of below a 50 is more car dependent. The Suffolk area has a walk score of 15, which is deemed as dependent on transportation and not pedestrian-friendly. Walkable communities help businesses grow, as pedestrians are more likely to walk to local businesses due to the connectivity between residential areas and commercial areas. One article, from the Professional Concrete Flatwork & Repair Company, stresses the importance of adding sidewalks in a community, stating “Well-designed and safe sidewalks help direct the flow foot traffic towards local retailers or commercial centers as well as foster social interaction and customer loyalty.” A car-dependent city is an unhealthy, unsafe and stagnant city.This letter is a call to action. We need to be heard and supported as a community. The busy roads near the schools and neighborhoods are far too dangerous and could lead to a foreseeable accident in the future. Implementing crosswalks and paved sidewalks would help the community travel easier, while promoting a healthier way of living. Residents in communities with sidewalks are 47% more likely to be active for at least 39 minutes a day, than compared to non-pedestrian friendly communities, according to an AARP article. A pedestrian-friendly city would benefit our community socially and economically, for it would bring the community closer while establishing good standing relationships with local businesses. It is time for an immediate change.Siggy ReyesSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_83,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .While well intended, current planning theory and the Minneapolis 2040 plan are failing in their objective. The district court decision last week inSmart Growth Minnesota v. Minneapolis,which halted enforcement of the 2040 plan on environmental grounds, is only the most recent evidence of the problems with using planning theory to solve social justice or environmental problems.Planning, planning theory and urban design run in trends. Among the more fashionable theories in the last few years have been a push for increased urban density through the elimination of single-family zoning and a call for greater reliance upon more mass transit to move people around. The goals of both are to provide more affordable housing, eliminate racial and economic segregation, and protect the environment. This was the design of Minneapolis’ 2040 comprehensive plan, which washeralded nationallyas a model of progressive planning.From the late 19th century until the 1950s the trend was the rapid urbanization of America as people left the farms for the cities. Industrialization, improved sanitation and economic opportunity drove this. Yet this urbanization came with racial covenants and segregation, includingMinneapolisand perhapsSt. Paul.But post-World War II suburban America was born. It was the product of aging of city infrastructures, the lure of cheap land in the suburbs, the rise of the automobile and massive building of highways, and white flight. Cities depopulated and suburbs became the new population centers. Metropolitanwide areas became racially and economically segregated, as described by among others Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton inAmerican Apartheid.Twenty-five years ago a team of researchers including me pointed to theTwin Cities as one of the most segregatedurban areas in America.But a generation or so ago New Urbanism as a planning theory arose. Inspired by Jane Jacobs’ classicThe Death and Life of Great American Cities,New Urbanism declared that suburban sprawl was economically inefficient, it permitted racial and economic segregation, and it was environmentally bad. Sprawl wasted land or encouraged dependence on cars, often occupied by single commuters. Cities were generators of complexity, and to be successful they should not mimic suburbs in heavy reliance upon single family houses on wide open spaces. New Urbanism proclaimed “Return to the city”; densification is good, and creating more mass-transit options is the best way to transport people.People did return to cities, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, but this did not come without problems. The underlying racial and economic segregation that existed in cities was not mitigated by the return of aging Baby Boomer suburbanites or Millennials and Gen Zers who wanted to live there. In fact, redensification of cities brought with it gentrification of neighborhoods with concentrations of poor or people of color. Rents accelerated, housing prices increased, and suddenly cities were facing massive affordability crises. This, too, is thestory of Minneapolis and St. Paul,which has theworst housing shortageamong metro areas in the nation.In an effort to address these problems Minneapolis mainly and St. Paul to a lesser extent acted. Minneapolis’ 2040 Comprehensive Plan sought to address this problem byelimination of single-family zoning. Allow for up to three units per property and, as the belief went, it would increase housing supply, and with more units, it would address the affordability crisis and promote desegregation.Yet that has not happened. For one, housing is not a unified but a diverse market. Housing built for the affluent or middle class is not same as housing built for the poor. All things being equal, developers will build the type of housing that is most profitable for them, and it is not for the poor. While some argue that simply increasing the supply of housing willlower overall housing costs,there ismixed evidencefor that, especially for low-income households.Second, housing has a market driven by demand by renters and owners. But housing also has a national market, driven by investors looking for opportunities to make money.Preliminary studiespointed to how the change in zoning brought about increases in housing costs in low-income neighborhoods of Minneapolis — an early sign of speculation and gentrification taking place. As theWashington Postpointed out in its analysis of housing markets across the U.S., including Minneapolis, national investors are gobbling up housing in north Minneapolis because the real estate is relatively cheap and they can turn it over into multi-unit buildings easily. As a result, people of color in north Minneapolis are losing homes and apartments to investors with little indication that the housing that is replacing it is affordable or racially integrated. Studies point to the fact that home ownership is inaccessible toBlack families, including in theTwin Cities. This is the prime notion of gentrification.Moreover, densification is not breaking down racial or economic segregation or necessarily leading to more affordable units, according to a recent article inGoverning Magazine. Densification is not addressing mortgage lending discrimination, which persists in Minneapolis according to theFederal Reserve.There is little indication that pricey single-family homes in south Minneapolis are being broken up into affordable housing. Densification may help business growth, but it is not doing much to mitigate segregation or provide more affordable housing for those who most need it.Moreover, as Hennepin District Judge Joseph Klein pointed out in his June 15 decision on the Minneapolis 2040 plan, increased densification potentially brings a host of environmental problem that were not well considered when adopting it. The city needs to think about them if it wishes to proceed with elimination of single-family zoning and greater density.Now consider the impact of COVID on urban design and planning. At the height of the pandemic people were told to avoid mass transit and work from home. This was made possible for many, especially the middle class and above, by telecommuting. As the pandemic eases there are studies by theUrban Instituteandothersthat people are not returning to mass transit, or that remote work is making the need for it less than before, thereby driving up the cost per passenger, according to anAmerican Public Transit Associationreport.Additionally, many fled cities forsuburbsor even more remote locations to find cheaper and roomier housing, andthere is evidencemany are not returning and many businesses are looking at more remote work into the future. This aligns with a recentSurvey of Working Arrangements and Attitudesfinding a generational and permanent shift in views toward hybrid and remote work. People fled the cities to escape the pandemic. Suddenly, suburbs look like a safer place to be from a public health perspective.Several years ago I chaired a panel for a regional American Planning Association Conference examining the wisdom of the Minneapolis elimination of single-family zoning. A person from the Met Council proclaimed: “We have more single-family housing than we need in the metropolitan area.” Asked if such housing was affordable or available across the metro area there was no response.There is a housing problem across the Twin Cities metro region. Something needs to be done, but the planning fixes that are currently being employed will not solve the segregation and affordability issues. Moreover, planning theory and urban design have yet to recognize a new reality that the pandemic has produced. Public health factors need to be factored into the design of buildings and transportation and into the layout of cities. Density, assome studiespoint to, may not be the right answer going forward if we need to address future pandemics. Finally, the pandemic showed how telecommuting may also be reversing the desire or need to provide more mass transit or construction of housing units exclusively in traditional urban core cities.David Schultz is Hamline University Distinguished Professor of Political Science. He previously served as a city director of planning, zoning, and code enforcement and as a housing and economic planner for a community action agency."
suffolknewsherald_2022_107,"Published 5:44 pm Tuesday, April 19, 2022ByStaff ReportsWith recent advances in safety technology, driving a vehicle should be safer than ever. Yet, we’re told by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles that fatal car crashes in the commonwealth reached a 14-year high in 2021 — and that 2022 is off to an even deadlier start.So far this year, 245 people have been killed in crashes on Virginia roadways, a 12% increase compared to this point in 2021.Last year, 968 people died in crashes on Virginia roadways — a 14.3% increase over 2020 and the highest number of annual fatalities since 2007, when 1,026 fatalities were recorded. According to final 2021 crash statistics from DMV’s Highway Safety Office, fatalities increased across a number of categories, such as speed-related fatalities, commercial motor vehicle-involved fatalities and fatalities of motorcyclists, pedestrians, bicyclists, teen drivers and mature drivers.The common thread in all of the discouraging numbers is driver error or negligence.“There are immediate, simple actions Virginians can take to save lives on our roadways,” said acting DMV Commissioner Linda Ford. “This is critically important as fatalities continue to increase this year. Vehicles and roadways are safer than they ever have been, yet we continue to lose lives to senseless crashes. Do your part to help. Slow down, buckle up, focus on the task of driving and never drive impaired. It truly is that simple.”Virginia’s numbers reflect a startling national trend. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 31,000 people died in crashes in the first nine months of 2021, a 12% increase over the same time period in 2020 and the highest number of fatalities during the first nine months of any year since 2006.We see a couple of culprits.First, drivers are too distracted. In the old days, distractions while driving occurred mostly outside the windshield. Today, there are many ways to be distracted inside the vehicle, from the car’s internal technology to handheld devices. A relatively new state law that prohibits touching a smartphone while behind the wheel is largely ignored, based on what we see when out and about on Suffolk roads and highways.Second, motorists are wound way too tight, and many let their emotions get the best of them. We completely understand the lingering effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on people’s collective psyche. The rising cost of living due to soaring inflation also has people on edge. Unfortunately, pent-up anger and frustration are being released through aggressive driving. Road-rage incidents are becoming more common, inevitably leading to crashes that injure and kill.We all need to take a deep breath before getting behind the wheel, lest the statistics get worse.“This trend is poised to continue unless Virginians take action,” Ford said. “Most people want to contribute to something greater; by driving safely, you can truly make a difference, not just in your life, but in the lives of everyone with whom you share the road.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_88,"Published 7:25 pm Friday, May 13, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Tonya Sinclair SwindellAt the end of the day when it’s all said and done, occupational therapy is a well-rounded profession: a skilled rehabilitative service, a whole health focus at the core — from pediatrics to adulthood OT patients learn to do more.They go beyond limitations to achieve a more independent life with assistance from others or with the aid of a device: a reacher, long-handled bath sponge, sock aid or button hook, patients may even be retrained on how to feed themselves or cook.Feeding oneself can be a very important goal achieved with larger utensils that are easier to hold. If adaptive mobility needs are required to be assessed, occupational therapists can determine if manual, powered or active assisted wheelchairs are best. When in the nursing home, the patient’s needs are evaluated to see if they can go back home or to an environment that is safe.When hospitalized on an inpatient unit, increased endurance is often the key to get through it. OTs may co-treat with physical therapy staff to restore, rebuild and make gains on the path to prepare for the next discharge environment that is optimal for a patient’s stage of development. When patients are seen in outpatient clinics, it may be for any number of reasons. As outpatients prepare for hip or knee surgery, it may be a time for education and learning about how to perform tasks in alternate ways that increase independence while managing pain.Occupational therapists working within the school system can help to make a very big difference by engaging young students in playful activities that help to expand their current abilities. Pediatric patients may lack fine motor skills that are needed to have a successful school year. And when neurological systems seem disorganized, OTs work with interdisciplinary team members helping students to thrive.For brain injured patients with ongoing disabilities, OTs may explore their existing capabilities as patients learn to use different strategies that compensate for decreases in their memories. For individuals who may be more physically injured, many OTs are trained to deliver information including helpful education about the benefits of home modification. If shoulder, hand or an elbow injury results in decreased functional mobility, an occupational therapist may be called upon for evaluation, treatment and splint fabrication.Every day may look different from another because the needs of OT patients differ from one person to the other. Skill building groups like writing, stress and anger management hearken back to the roots of the OT profession when clinicians worked with military veterans needing to process effects of war and devastation. Their shell shock was eased by effective clinical interactions with workers later to be named occupational therapists. Overall, occupational therapy is a helping profession that focuses on creating optimal function. It successfully blends the healthy aspects of what’s needed for a patient to achieve success in critical areas of daily living for the desired outcome of holistic healing.Tonya Sinclair Swindell of Suffolk is a mental health occupational therapist.

suffolknewsherald_2022_3,"Published 5:59 pm Tuesday, August 16, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardYou wouldn’t know it based on some of the extreme rhetoric out of Richmond some days, but bipartisanship is alive and well in Virginia.After a long, ultimately successful push to remove partisanship from congressional and legislative redistricting, a group formerly called OneVirginia2021 announced Tuesday that it will continue under a new brand, expanding its nonpartisan work on the important cause of fair elections.UpVote Virginia, as the nonpartisan group will now be called, is “dedicated to ensuring that Virginia leads the way in improving the structure of our electoral system to better reflect the will of voters, thus providing for a more representative, inclusive, open and transparent government,” its members said in a news release.The highly regarded Liz White, who will continue as executive director, said in a launch video that “in Virginia, voters are standing up and affecting change by focusing on foundational, nonpartisan solutions that can improve our democracy. Now it’s time to build on this momentum and set the stage for years to come.”OneVirginia2021 worked for the better part of a decade to take redistricting out of the hands of partisan politicians and turn it over to an independent commission. While even that commission couldn’t agree on congressional and legislative maps, their backup, the Virginia Supreme Court, stepped in last year and did a masterful job on new maps. You knew the court’s map drawers had done a good job when both Republicans and Democrats whined about the outcome.Under its new name of UpVote Virginia, the group has new, specific goals. Two political heavyweights gave Tuesday’s launch credibility. Former Republican Gov. George Allen and current U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Virginia, were both on hand and used the opportunity to endorse the group’s new signature priority, ranked choice voting.We’ve long been intrigued by the concept, which is used in a number of places across the country. Instead of only choosing one candidate, voters rank their order of preference: first, second, third, etc. In races with more than two people on the ballot, this creates an instant runoff, with the lowest-ranked candidate getting eliminated, and voters who selected that candidate instead have their second-choice votes counted. The winner is ultimately declared when a candidate receives over 50% of the first place votes that are counted.Allen noted a Virginia law allowing localities to adopt a ranked choice voting pilot program “was supported by the most conservative Republicans, moderates and the most liberal Democrats. And that’s because this doesn’t benefit one party over another. It benefits the voters; the people of Virginia (because their will is better reflected.”Beyer added: “George Allen and I aren’t always at the same events, but ranked choice voting brings people together, no matter their political leanings. This is an issue that puts the will of the voters front and center. I’ve been a strong supporter of democracy reform for a long time, (because we know how tenuous and fragile American democracy can be.”We’re not ready to endorse statewide implementation of the voting method just yet, but the fact that UpVote Virginia, Allen and Beyer are behind it increases the likelihood we will do so.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Americans know it, too. They trust their local news outlets, even in this highly fractured and partisan time. Compared to national news, six in 10 Americans have more trust in local news to report on stories that affect their daily lives, and they are about twice as likely to trust local news to report on the information they need to vote.Despite our trust in local news, too many communities today are hurtling towards Jefferson’s worst fear, but in a way he never could have imagined.

Instead of the government stifling journalism, local papers are steadily being shuttered due to the unchecked influence of two private entities: Google and Facebook.The main challenge for small news publishers is that Google and Facebook have hindered local outlets’ ability to be fairly compensated for the significant value their content generates for these platforms. Big Tech has commoditized and disconnected news content from its sources, undermining the advertising business that served as a bedrock of the newspaper industry. Big Tech platforms control virtually every aspect of the online advertising business and use clever tactics to keep users on their sites and deprive publishers of the ability to monetize their content.Faced with this anticompetitive behavior, it should be no surprise that local papers are struggling. In 2022, more than a fifth of Americans live in news deserts. And, 1,625 counties have only one newspaper, while more than 200 have no local newspaper at all. Social media is increasingly filling the void with untrustworthy sources and misinformation and becoming America’s de facto local news source.Big Tech’s threat to local journalism will not go away on its own, and the cost of inaction is too great to ignore. Congress must act.Among the antitrust bills Congress is considering this year, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act (JCPA is the only one that provides a direct check against Google and Facebook’s anticompetitive tactics that put local papers at risk.Ironically, Big Tech is protected by U.S. antitrust laws, which prevent local papers from negotiating as a group. The JCPA would provide a temporary, limited antitrust safe harbor for small, local news publishers to collectively negotiate with Facebook and Google for fair compensation for the use of their content. It’s narrowly tailored to ensure that coordination by news publishers is only in the interest of protecting trustworthy, quality journalism.Critics of the JCPA have parroted Big Tech’s argument that the bill would predominantly help large national publications. However, the JCPA is specifically designed to help small- and medium-sized papers and would help flow subscription and advertising dollars back to their newsrooms. Large national publications like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times won’t qualify. The bill also incentivizes publishers to invest in hiring new journalists and newsroom personnel. In fact, publishers that demonstrate their investment will receive a higher portion of the negotiated funds.As Big Tech devalues high-quality journalism in favor of provocative, divisive clickbait, the prospect of layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs has become an everyday reality for local journalists. While critics of the JCPA squabble about utopian solutions, local publishers, who recognize the urgency to revive local news, are firmly supporting the JCPA. They acknowledge the JCPA is the only bill that will put them on a more level playing field with the tech giants.Join me in asking your representatives in Congress to prioritize passing the JCPA to protect their constituents’ access to objective, quality local reporting – and to ensure that Thomas Jefferson’s fear of a democracy without robust journalism never comes to pass.Dean Ridings is CEO of America’s Newspapers, the trade association for thousands of newspapers across the United States, including the Suffolk News-Herald.

leoweekly_2022_39,"When Shameka Parrish-Wrightvisited LEO’s office back in Marchfor our mayoral candidate interviews, she told a story of door-knocking and speaking with a man who worked full time and made enough money to pay his mortgage, but couldn’t afford utilities, and, at that time, had them turned off.She used the story of that interaction to highlight that, across the city, in every neighborhood, there are people on the edge of housing insecurity.As someone who has experienced homelessness herself, she spoke of how most people are a bad break or two from facing hardship, and how Louisville needs to increase access to affordable housing and public services such as programs for homeownership, house repair and rental assistance throughout the city, because most of us are susceptible to falling on hard times.“In every end of our city, someone is struggling,” she said.The more she spoke, the more it was apparent that story was just a microcosm of how she has a unique and direct understanding of the sometimes concealed challenges that people face in our city on a daily basis.Parrish-Wright is running as “The Candidate For The People,” and she highlights her many years in public service as proof. Parrish-Wright might be most well-known for her work withThe Bail Project— a nonprofit that helps people who cannot afford bail — where she was up until recently the operations manager, and currently serves as the partnerships and advocacy manager. She also has been involved in organizations such astheKentucky Alliance Against Racist & Political Repression,Kentucky Jobs with Justice,La Casita Center Board,Continuum of Care Board of the Homeless Coalition,The Carl Braden Memorial Center,Louisville Books to Prisonersprogram,Justice NowandSowers of Justice Network.Parrish-Wright has been a human relations commissioner for the city. Parrish-Wright is also an activist who has protested against police brutality and racial injustice. As someone who has both worked within the government and stood with the people, she says she also wants to strengthen the connection between the two. During her time at LEO’s office, she spoke about how the position of mayor is primarily a management position, not only responsible for delegating duties, but making sure that the people sitting on boards and in positions of power are a diverse group that are reflective of the city. She spoke of streamlining ways for more people to get involved.Parrish-Wright’s progressive platformincludes empowering residents to be able to create the solutions for their own neighborhoods, police accountability, anti-violence programs, support for unions, funds for environmental projects and other forward-thinking proposals.For these reasons, LEO has decided to endorse Shameka Parrish-Wright for mayor.For far too long, Louisville leadership has more focused on “becoming the next Nashville” and aggressive development than on its people and problems. Our city has deep scars that come from decades of injustice, while politicians have maintained the status quo. It’s time to elect someone who falls outside of the general archetype of wealthy business person turned politician, someone who aligns more with the working class.And that person is Shameka Parrish-Wright, someone who can build with the people and manage the city’s fiscal needs.“I’m inclusive, I build bridges,” Parrish-Wright told LEO. “I also live all of the issues. There is no issue, that any mayoral candidate is running on that I haven’t been impacted by, that I haven’t lived and I haven’t fought for on a social justice level. So, I feel like we need a new direction.”LEO agrees.. ( ."

Woodson had a bold, new idea in 1926 he called Negro History Week. He was also considered to be the “Father of Black History” and wanted to celebrate people who many others in this country thought had no place in history. Woodson understood that the efforts of African Americans “were overlooked, ignored, and even suppressed by the writers of history textbooks and the teachers who use them.”After a while, it developed into Black History Month. The heritage that he left lives on by accrediting and teaching others about the accomplishments of Black Americans.African Americans have continued to go through serious difficulty trying to join recognized American culture. The unmistakable character is fixed from the past of Afro-Americans. Our culture is different and has a tremendous impact on American and international culture.Even though being held in captivity limited the means for Africans to use their unique traditions, several customs, virtues and principles held up, and bit by bit have changed and/or fused with other cultures. After being freed, special Afro-American customs have been constantly growing, as extraordinary heritage or revolutionary concepts in creativity, music, faith, food and other areas. No matter what, writers, artists and activists have intervened to repair the spirit and equality of a minority.From early on in captivity, ending in the 20th century, African American art was able to make a dynamic contribution to the art of the United States. In the 1920s, creators like Aaron Douglas (painter , Augusta Savage (sculptor , Faith Ringgold (painter, writer, mixed media sculptor, performance artist, narrative quilts and Renee Cox (printmaking, photography became popular for their art.

In fact, the average American worked 12 hours a day six days a week. It would be another 34 years, until the passage of the Adamson Act in 1916, that the modern standard of an eight-hour workday was established.Despite its name and the fact that the day is specifically dedicated to labor appreciation, not all employees — including first responders, hospital staff, retail and food industry workers and others — have the federal and state holiday off. We commend them for their service on Labor Day and every other day.The “unofficial end of summer,” Labor Day weekend is also reported to be the second busiest travel holiday (behind Memorial Day with an estimated 137 million people leaving town. That’s a mind-boggling 53% of the country.A little more than half, or some 70 million people, will travel by car. That means busy roads and dangerous travel conditions.Virginia State Police is urging those traveling this weekend to stay alert, drive sober and wear their seatbelts.“Last Labor Day, fatal crashes were half of what they were in 2020,” said Col. Gary T. Settle, Virginia State Police superintendent. “Because one traffic fatality is too many, I challenge Virginians to achieve zero fatal traffic crashes this holiday weekend. The recipe is easy: Ditch distractions, drive sober, comply with posted speed limits, wear your seatbelt and be patient.”VSP plans beefed-up traffic safety and enforcement patrols as part of Operation CARE (Crash Awareness Reduction Effort , a nationwide program that aims to reduce traffic crashes, fatalities and injuries caused by impaired driving, speeding and failing to use occupant restraints. Virginia State Police’s participation continues through midnight Monday.VSP is also participating in the annual “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over” campaign, an anti‐DUI enforcement and education program sponsored by the Washington Regional Alcohol Program (WRAP . A key piece is sobriety checkpoints and saturation patrols.“When Virginians choose to get behind the wheel after drinking, they risk their lives and the lives of others,” Settle said. “Virginians statewide can expect to see more state and local law enforcement on the commonwealth’s roadways through the Labor Day holiday as we seek to deter and apprehend impaired drivers through DUI checkpoints and saturation patrols.”On a weekend meant to celebrate the social and economic achievements of the American workforce, please do so responsibly and enjoy the last hoorah of summer.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

I am so disappointed to see the direction our city leaders have taken us in the past 10 years.Our city leaders are allowing our forestland to be cut and they are allowing our farmland to be swallowed up by concrete. They are allowing our roads to become dangerously congested. We don’t have enough police to adequately cover this large city now, yet they continue to add more burden upon their shoulders than they have manpower to cover.People are dying on our roads because Suffolk doesn’t have the manpower to adequately monitor and ticket reckless drivers. And now it looks like they will probably allow a large swath of land to be rezoned from farmland to heavy industrial to allow for more warehouses to be built on Route 460.I urge all of our city councilmen and mayor to vote “NO” for Highway 460 rezoning to build more warehouses. Suffolk road congestion is already awful, and to add additional truck traffic will cause more accidents and death.I urge our city councilmen and mayor to consider our existing citizens’ quality of life.

philinquirer_2022_6,"A Pennsylvanian is currently serving 14 years in a Russian penal colony for carrying roughly half an ounce of medical marijuana. The Biden administration must not forget him.I was relieved to hear thatbasketball star Brittney Grinerwas returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange with Russia. But my brother, Marc Fogel, is still in a maximum security penal colony there, held under similar circumstances.Marc is aresident of Oakmont, Pa., who has served as an international educator for 35 years. He wasdetainedin August 2021for carrying roughly half an ounce of medical marijuana, prescribed by a doctor for his chronic pain. Now he is serving14 years in a Russian penal colony. The Biden administration must not forget him.Our family has exhausted all legal options in Russia, sowe are asking the Biden administrationto use all possible means to bring Marc back to the United States. The events of the past few weeks have shown us that despite the exceptionally difficult relationship between Washington and Moscow, dialogue and negotiations are possible.My brother has spent the last 35 years teaching International Baccalaureate courses in history to the children of U.S. consulate and embassy staff and American expats in Mexico, Malaysia, Colombia, Oman, Venezuela — and, most recently, Russia.In August 2021, Marc and his wife, Jane, who is also a dedicated high school teacher, were returning to Moscow for what was to be their tenth and final year of teaching before retirement. Upon his return, Marc was arrested at the airport for carrying medical marijuana prescribed by his doctor in Pennsylvania. Marc suffers from debilitating back pain as a result of multiple spinal surgeries beginning in the early 1990s.In the year and a half since Marc has been trapped in Russia, my family has received dozens of letters from his former students and colleagues. They described him as charismatic, caring, enthusiastic, energetic, and boisterous. Many spoke about how Marc went out of his way to make them feel included and engaged in the classroom. This outpouring of letters, phone calls, emails, and grassroots assistance told the story of a man dedicated not only to his craft, but also to the health and well-being of the young men and women he taught.But none of these letters have brought him home.When I think about my brother, I also see a man who can’t stand up straight because of back spasms, or I see his ashen face after waking up from yet another surgery. Few people outside his family saw this side of Marc, and even fewer still understood the effort he had to make to put a smile on his face every day. I shudder when I think about how he is faring.For his crime, the Russian “justice” system sentenced my brother to 14 years in a maximum security penal colony. Marc Fogel is a 61-year-old with chronic health problems, who cannot survive this outrageous sentence.Marc has been a passionate teacher for more than three decades. He is also a dedicated husband, father, son, brother, and friend who is missed every day.To the Biden administration: Please bring Marc home so that my 93-year-old mother doesn’t have to spend another Christmas without her son, or my nephews another Christmas without their father. Marc should be at home with his wife, reading a book and sipping a cup of coffee in his retirement, not sitting in a Russian prison.The last time I spoke to Marc he said, “Tell them teachers matter, too.”Lisa Hyland is Marc Fogel’s sister.@freemarcfogel"
minnpost_2022_129,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It wasn’t until the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that I developed an interest in birds. On a walk in my neighborhood, I spotted a pileated woodpecker hammering on the trunk of an oak tree. I was awe-struck by this strange creature with a dramatic red crest and yellow eyes. I realized that I had never truly noticed the plants or animals I have shared a community with for many years. I became aware of my non-human neighbors for the first time.Countless other people have a story like mine. Stay-at-home orders and social isolation sparked a boom in bird watching during the pandemic. Wild bird supply retailers reported sales increases of up to50 percent, and public participation in bird monitoringsoared. Morerecent datareveal that interest in bird watching has persisted beyond lockdown periods. As spring unfolds across North America,five billion birdsare embarking on their long migration north in search of more abundant resources, and bird enthusiasts–old and new–are poised to witness their incredible journeys.As I came to learn, birds aren’t just nice to look at – they are essential to human survival. Our fragile ecosystem depends upon birds topollinate plants, control pests, recycle nutrients, and distribute seeds. Pileated woodpeckers, like the one who sparked my fascination with birds, excavate tree cavities that are subsequently used for nesting and roosting byother bird species and small animals. Each species plays an important role in the complex web of life on Earth.Most birdson the planet today are not wild, but have been domesticated for their eggs or meat, and our increasing appetite for farmed birds has become a threat to wild ones. Intensive poultry farming is currently accelerating the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 among wild and domestic birds in the US. Roughly24 million farmed birds, including at leastone millionin Minnesota, have already been euthanized in an effort to contain the virus. Meanwhile, avian flu has been detected inMinnesota and31 other states among 34 wild bird species, including waterfowl, shorebirds, and theraptorsthat eat them. Scientists believe infected wild birds mayspread the virus to more domestic flocksas they migrate north this spring (which may in turn infect more wild birds .High demand for meat and eggs requires intensive animal farming, which exacerbates viral disease outbreaks like avian flu. Onfactory farms, birds are packed indoors by the thousands, surrounded by their own waste, with no fresh air. These cramped and unsanitary conditions are especiallyconducive to the emergence and spread of infectious disease. According to Dr. Michael Greger, author of “Bird Flu: A Virus of Our Own Hatching,” “If you actually want to create global pandemics, then build factory farms.” As more domestic birds across the country contract the virus, the threat to wild birds grows. Our flawed food system has bound together the fate of farmed and wild birds.In addition to the risk of disease, factory farming has an even more direct impact on wild birds by depleting their habitats and draining the resources they rely on for survival. Groundbreakingresearchpublished in 2019 revealed that North America is home tothree billion fewer wild birdsthan in 1970 – a 30 percent population decline. Two primary drivers of this dramatic disappearance – habitat loss and climate change – are fueled by the use of birds and other animals for food. Animal products requiremore land, feed, water, and other resourcesto produce than plant-based foods. Increasing demand for meat and other animal products is precipitating thedestruction of critical bird habitatto make space for feed crops and grazing.The naturalist Aldo Leopold famously wrote, “There are some who can live without wild things and some who cannot.” At some point between the start of the pandemic and now, I have become one who cannot. Wild birds have enhanced my sense of connection to my community, and the looming possibility of empty skies has become heartbreakingly personal. The unexpected solution that could save wild birds–reducing the exploitation of their domestic kin–gives me hope. By extending our circle of compassion to farmed birds, we can protect all birds for future generations.Julie Knopp is president ofCompassionate Action for Animalsin Minneapolis."

Donald McEachin’s passing on Monday after a battle with colon cancer.Until the most recent round of redistricting, McEachin had capably represented portions of Suffolk in Congress since 2016, following service in both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly. In each stop in his legislative career, the Democrat championed reforms to gun laws, environmental protection and affordable health care. Regardless of your political position on those issues, McEachin was a respected ally or adversary, advocating forcefully but unemotionally for the causes he believed in.In the days before news broke of his death, we enjoyed reading a Capital News Service article on McEachin’s plans to prioritize housing security in his fourth term, to which he was elected this month in a landslide in Virginia’s 4th District, which, after redistricting, stretches from parts of Henrico County south to Emporia, westward to Brunswick County and east over to Surry. He got 65% of the vote against previous Republican challenger Leon Benjamin, according to the Virginia Department of Elections.The most populous areas of the 4th District have faced a tumultuous few years in almost every aspect of the housing market, CNS reported.

leoweekly_2022_0,"I thought initially that I would structure this as a prayer. I’m not religious but I understand the function, the meditativeness of prayer on things that we find troubling. To some degree, it is still that but I’m not talking to any god. I’m talking to you, the community.In this holiday season, as we spend time with our families and reminisce about days gone by and those we have lost, I ask you to take a moment to remember those you don’t know but those who deserved to be here with us. Remember the 12 people who died, tragically in the hands of Louisville Metro Corrections.In this week’s cover story, our news writer, Josh Wood, delves into the lives of some of the people lost in the custody of Louisville Metro Corrections. Instead, and like too many cases across the country, the only remedy for those society deems undesirable, better unseen, too challenging — or for those who too directly reflect the flaws in the American fabric back in the faces of those who don’t like seeing America as imperfect — is to lock them away, maybe to forget they exist.Case after case, the deaths in Metro Corrections point to the fact that no one was looking. So, for various reasons —many petty and unnecessarily carceral — these people died because of a neglectful and cold system.Being poor, being mentally ill, being out of step with what society calls normal, should not mean a death sentence in our justice system, but for too many it does.Too often those in these situations have multiple intersecting issues and are incarcerated and kept because they can’t meet the bail amount to free themselves. So their incarceration becomes a poor tax.These situations quickly become uroborus ones where feeding and devouring itself happens in the same breath. The system preys upon the huddled masses that this nation has claimed to accept for more than 240 years. If you are tired, poor, hungry or any of the “wretched refuse” of this country, any one of these people in Wood’s story could be you. Or someone you know.So, as you read about Buddy Stevens, Thomas “TJ” Bradshaw and Stephanie Dunbar, remember that above all of the issues and things that make them complicated people, they are people first. They were warm bodies that loved, hurt, made families and lived their complicated lives in a world out of step with what they needed. Remember, too, that these people were sacrificed to a system that isn’t created for the needs of human beings.TJ Bradshaw was arrested for panhandling — for asking for what he lacked, money. Whether it be for food, a place to lay his head or for drugs to forget the cruelty of his situation, he was simply asking for help. To be jailed for this is outrageous and to then lose one’s life because they simply asked for help is even more insidious.Metro Corrections has asked, repeatedly, for a new facility, blaming their problems on a dilapidating facility that wasn’t even originally built to be a jail, antiquated intake and maintenance procedures. What could come first is to stop incarcerating people for things that don’t deserve a penal response. We could stop persecuting people for being broken, sad, poor or anything that isn’t pretty to look at. We could have some fucking compassion and let people be, even if we find it imperfect, unpalatable or uncomfortable. Everyone deserves, at least, the chance to live. To simply live. •. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_280,"Published 8:50 pm Friday, September 2, 2022ByStaff ReportsThere was a wide array of games and activities set up and ready to go, and it didn’t take long for the campers entering the gym to spread out to their chosen activity. The gym was filled with the sounds of children playing basketball, sliding down the slide, bouncing in the bounce house, playing ga-ga ball, and much more. Everyone was having a blast. Everyone, it was, except for James.James sat crying with his back against the wall. He hadn’t been allowed to try to catch a snake that had been seen slithering around the path to the gym, and he was upset.I understood why he was sad. He wanted to catch the snake, but it wasn’t something we were able to do. He was disappointed, and I know how disappointment feels. It’s a lousy feeling. Sometimes after disappointment, we need to pause to process our thoughts and deal with our emotions.The problem for James, however, is that he cried and pouted for the next two hours. I tried to convince him to join in with any of the other games or activities, but he would not budge. Therefore, he missed out on a lot of great things that he would have certainly enjoyed.We can attribute his missed opportunity to a child tired from a busy week facing a disappointment that his young heart and mind might not yet be equipped to process.I can’t help but wonder, though, if adults sometimes do the same thing in a different way. A disappointment in life can throw us into a downward spiral, cause us to pout, give up on life, or miss out on the good things around us.It’s good to pause after a disappointment to process emotions, and it’s okay to mourn what could not be obtained. The problem starts when we choose to continually feed our negative emotions instead of processing them. It can cause a downward spiral where we end up pouting, in an adult manner, rather than working through the disappointment we faced.While we may not sit down and refuse to participate in anything, like James did in the gym, but disappointment can cause us to give up. We’re saddened by what disappointed us, so we pull out of participating in life. We didn’t get one thing we wanted, so we give up on getting anything. We should not allow disappointment to cause us to stop moving forward in life.Lastly, disappointment can blind us to good things around us. We can become so focused on the one thing we could not obtain that we lose sight of all the good things that we do have. James missed out on several games and activities he enjoyed because he would not stop crying over what he could not do. Let’s ensure we don’t miss out on the good things around us because we’re upset over what we have missed.The question we have to answer isn’t if we’re going to face disappointment. We will. The question is how we will handle ourselves after we are disappointed.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_71,"Published 6:19 pm Friday, June 3, 2022ByStaff ReportsGovernment gridlock can frustrate partisans on both sides of the aisle, but in a purple state like Virginia, forced compromise can sometimes lead to a good outcome.Such is the case with the Virginia General Assembly’s two-year budget approved overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate on Wednesday after months of disagreement over taxing and spending. The $165 billion final product, now on the desk of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, has much to like for both liberals and conservatives.Among the highlights:The budget’s tax relief includes one-time rebates of $250 for individuals and $500 for families later this year. About $1.6 billion would go toward increasing the standard deduction, though not quite as much as Youngkin had advocated.About $372 million in tax relief would eliminate the state portion of sales tax on groceries and essential personal hygiene products; $301 million would provide phased-in income tax relief for military retirees 55 or older; and $315 million would make the Virginia Earned Income Tax Credit partially refundable, The Associated Press reports. The plan does not include a gas tax holiday, another Youngkin initiative.The partial repeal of the state’s 2.5% grocery tax was an example of compromise. Republicans wanted the tax repealed entirely, while Democrats wanted to save the 1% that goes to local governments to fund schools.After months of squabbling and failure to adopt a budget during the 2022 regular session, this week’s vote was overwhelming. In the Senate, where Democrats hold a slight edge, the vote was 32-4. The Republican-controlled House approved it 88-7. Del. Emily Brewer, R-Isle of Wight, was among the handful of lawmakers selected to negotiate the compromise.We agree with Republican House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, who said, “It’s been a long haul, but I believe the result is a fiscally sound, bipartisan budget we can all be proud of.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_111,"Published 5:51 pm Friday, April 15, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor,I have a question that’s been bothering me for some time now. I was reading about all this stuff that the new police chief wants to do to better the department and pick up morale within his officers. Everything he wants to do sounds really good and I think our men and women in blue deserve it.So this leads to my question: Does it not pique your interest as to why he has a hard time keeping officers? When you do a story about officers who are terminated or that they are quitting, have you ever interviewed them to see why? I have never read a story about any officers’ reasons for leaving or being terminated. I believe you can’t do a story justice if you don’t know both sides.And as far as you printing that story (“Chief backs process to decertify,” Sunday, April 3 , don’t you think that they have suffered enough? You need to know the whole story before you print it. I don’t believe that all of those officers did what they said. I think that maybe these officers would not kiss the ring, so to speak, and were targeted.These people have a hard and stressful life and see things no one should see. When they go through a situation that can cause mental stress the upper brass is supposed to have their back and I don’t believe that they do. What if it was your son or daughter and it happened to them? Would you print half a story? I think not.Randy SmithSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_95,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Two years ago we were in our first pandemic lock-down and SARS-CoV-2 was a mysterious new virus with an impact we were just beginning to unveil. In year three, we have a much better understanding of the virus and tools to lessen its impacts for patients, and yet, the pandemic drags on with peaks and valleys in the incidence of new cases. We are currently ticking upward with BA.2, and possibly other variants, and public health measures being pulled back. We are uncertain what the future will bring and where we are in the recurring cycle of surges, and yet, we are still trying to “return to normalcy.”Immunologists, infectious diseases experts and virologists at the University of Minnesota will tell you that what we have been experiencing isn’t surprising. In fact, we are collectively experiencing the immunity cycle of viruses, especially with aggressive variants. As more immunity builds in a population, the less extreme virus impacts are on a collective level. At this point in time with the majority of people in Minnesota, the U.S. and many countries around the world vaccinated – and many millions more who have had natural infections – we are reaching or exceeding the initially targeted level of 70% of the populations with some degree of protective immunity. And yet we have learned that the virus has not gone away and that breakthrough infections do occur after vaccination and reinfection occurs after natural infection.Since the pandemic, the university has been working on a range of high issues in academic medicine, from advancing clinical care to drug trials. What we know about COVID-19 now, from our national leading research and reporting on SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, is that the current virus can be in a community well before it is detected in hospitalizations. Additionally, we know that vaccinations for COVID-19 lessen symptoms and transmission, which protect those most vulnerable. As immunity rises from vaccinations and natural infections, all the data points to the virus becoming endemic in human populations with future cycles of seasonal peaks and valleys in cases.We must not let our guard down. We need to adjust our thinking not to, rather than returning to what was normal, that we become comfortable with a new normal. That will likely mean that we will constantly need to be monitoring what levels are out there and make adjustments accordingly. We will need to gear up on our levels of protection when we have a surge – face coverings, avoiding crowded places especially indoor ones – and then in between surges we can perhaps let our guards down a little. We must always remember that this is not just about our own comfort and safety, but keep in our minds that we are also providing safety for those with medical issues that not only make them more vulnerable but also less likely to build immunity from infection or vaccines.Long-COVID has been found to have detrimental effects on the cardiovascular system and the brain. These health conditions vary from person-to-person, but highlight how serious the virus impacts the body through inflammation and high fever.With what we know as academic scientists is that even as the virus becomes a part of our lives, there is still more we don’t know. On a community level, using wastewater as a public health informer can show us which communities are being impacted. On an individual level, vaccinations and receiving boosters are still very effective to help generate and boost immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.What we as scientists and infectious disease physicians are doing to protect ourselves and our families before COVID-19 enters an endemic phase is staying updated on our vaccinations to reduce the chance of being hospitalized, wearing a properly fitted N95 or KN95 mask in spaces where virus levels are likely to be high, and taking a test when exposed to someone positive with COVID-19.Testing for COVID-19 when you develop symptoms of a viral respiratory infection is still important for finding cases, and people should continue to self-isolate at home when infectious to prevent spread of the infection to others. For immune compromised people, preventive monoclonal antibodies are an effective tool. Also, we now have oral and intravenous antiviral medicines and monoclonal antibodies that can be given for individuals at high risk of COVID-19 complications to help prevent hospitalization and serious outcomes.Continue to be vaccinated and boosted. Seek medical advice if you become ill. If you have had COVID-19, consider enrolling in auniversity trialand talk to your healthcare provider about what you are experiencing long term.Dr. Susan Kline is an infectious disease physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview, Dr. Jill Foster is a pediatric infectious disease physician at the University of Minnesota Medical School and M Health Fairview and Marc Jenkins is the director of the Center for Immunology at the University of Minnesota Medical School."
philinquirer_2022_15,"What if the place I loved also had people who grew up like me and understood me? What if we, our community, had teachers of color?I come from a rural town in New Jersey where we rode bikes, fished in ponds, hiked, camped, and where I was one of the only students of color. The school I loved was filled with people who hurt me: students who brought Confederate flags to football games, a kid who called me the N-word, the teachers who stereotyped me. What if the school I loved also had people who grew up like me and understood me? What if we, our community, had teachers of color?I teach in New Jersey, where44% of students and 84% of teachers are white. Over 13 years teaching in five schools, I was often the only teacher of color. There is a clear problem with diversity in New Jersey education.A lasting effect of the lack of diversity in education is that teachers of color may not feel a sense of belonging in our schools and with our coworkers. We may feel a constant separation between us and them. When there is no one in a classroom, auditorium, faculty lounge, or administrative office who looks like me — who shares a similar story and similar cultural narrative — it is easy to feel as if I don’t belong.Last year, New Jersey signed into lawthe Diversity and Inclusion Lawand the History and Contributions of Individuals with Disabilities and LGBT Law, changing curricula in public middle and high schools.For instance, schools, as stated in the Diversity and Inclusion Law, areteaching by including economic diversity, equity, inclusion, tolerance, and a sense of belongingin connection with gender and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, disabilities, and religious tolerance, and updating texts throughout many subject areas.This is good news. Finally, New Jersey schools seem to recognize the importance of diversity in learning and are doing something about it. But it’s not nearly enough to address the diversity problem in schools.So, what is the solution? It’s not just racial sensitivity training. It’s not just including more diverse curricula. It’s not just hiring more teachers of color. The solution to improve the sense of belonging in schools for teachers of color — and to retain their talent, which is so desperately needed in our schools — is to redefine how those teachers are valued. We must recognize these teachers not only because they come from marginalized communities but also because they are great teachers.My ethnicity, being Black and half Jewish-white, is part of my story, part of my identity, but not all of it. While I am a teacher of color, I am still just a teacher, one who loves education — who loves his job.The only way to build a better system of education in our region is to build it with diverse educators, leading with diverse curricula. Our children deserve the best of what we have to offer: teachers who represent and celebrate our country’s diversity.Sometimes I think about white students who have never had an experience with an authority figure of color. I think about how many of these students have such a limited worldview. Teaching them diversity is not the same as being taught by diversity.» READ MORE:Young people are in mental health crisis and New Jersey needs a plan to help | OpinionIn the last 13 years, I have taught thousands of students, mostly white. I think about the impact, hopefully a positive one, that I will have on those kids who haven’t had a teacher that looks like me. At the same time, I think about the students of color, who have never seen someone in this position that looks like them, and just how important it is for them to see their faces and their stories reflected in their teacher.I think about how half-handed New Jersey education is when it values the appearance of diversity over the actuality of having diversity in all facets of its schools: teachers, administrators, school counselors and psychologists, and their student population.

suffolknewsherald_2022_238,"Published 7:17 pm Tuesday, October 25, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIt speaks to the collective funk of Suffolk’s citizenry that the recent announcement by Lowe’s Companies Inc. of plans to build a distribution center here and create 100 jobs was met not by jubilation, as it might once have been, but by a common sentiment:More trucks.The Suffolk City Council, an elected body that bears responsibility for the mood of the citizens it serves, has some work to do after its fateful, less-than-unanimous decision to bless a mammoth warehouse complex smack dab in the middle of town.The malaise started the night of the vote, when a room full of energetic, involved citizens filed out of City Hall with their heads hung in dejection. When the room was empty and only the TV cameras were rolling, the atmosphere remained funereal as the council members who approved the controversial project explained their votes in deflated, almost apologetic tones. If the project is all that city officials cracked it up to be, shouldn’t its elected backers have been ecstatic?Now comes news of litigation by citizens to try to stop the Port 460 project, ensuring many more months, if not years, of tension between the electorate and those they trusted to represent them. We don’t blame the plaintiffs, but we’re sad to see a proud, thriving city dragged down by the weight of a controversy that was completely unnecessary and avoidable.The City Council has a chance, perhaps even an obligation, to lift the spirits of a downtrodden citizenry. Here’s what we’d suggest:For the record, we’re pleased that Lowe’s is investing in Suffolk. The new facility’s location in the Virginia Port Logistics Park is appropriate and, unlike Port 460, won’t make traffic congestion noticeably worse.A decade ago, we’d have been much more excited about the Lowe’s announcement. Now, our expectations are raised. Suffolk must quickly begin thinking bigger than warehouses.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_21,"Chances are if you’ve read the news in the past year you’ve seen a headline like these: It’s time to go nuclear. Mark Zuckerberg is choosing profit over children. We need to ban kids from social media … And who could disagree with them? After all, you must be some kind of monster if you don’t want to protect children.Society’s reaction to new technology is alarmingly cyclical. When a new technology is introduced and becomes mainstream, there is almost always an outcry against it. Video games make you violent. TV rots your brain. Everything we learn falls by the wayside when some new, more alarming technology is introduced.Today, the panic is about social media and mental health. Of course children deserve protection. The question is not whether children should be protected. The question is how they should be protected.The rise of social media seems to coincide with a rise in teenage mental illness and self-harm. The only issue is, the direction of causation is tough to parse. Some research has found a clear negative relationship in that more social media leads to more mental health problems. Other work has found that this is only the case for girls, while boys actually need some social media. To complicate it even further, some research has found no relationship at all when activity logs instead of survey questions track usage.To be clear, the rates of suicide and self-harm amongs teenagers are on the rise. The loss of someone you care about is a terrifying reality to confront – especially when it is someone so young. Seeing young people struggle is terrifying; however, we should remember our tendency to panic and remember that, without seriously considering the underlying causes, our attempts to help may very well make the situation worse.So what do teenagers say about social media?According to reporting from Pew, most teenagers use social media to connect with others or learn new things. Further, the very same documents that the Wall Street Journal used to condemn Facebook indicate that 2 in 5 girls report feeling better about themselves after using Instagram. Overall, teenagers report having a positive experience with social media more often than not.The urge to leap into action when there is a crisis is strong, especially when it is one that affects younger generations. It is important to remember that, no matter how well intentioned, our attempts to help can backfire. Considering how nuanced the teenage experience with tech is, a complete ban could cause more harm than good.Instead of trying to ban tech, leaders and parents should be looking to help teens better understand and manage this tech. Here are three suggestions I would endorse.First, set screen time boundaries. Too much time spent online can be detrimental to children’s emotional well-being, but so can complete restriction. The actual healthy amount will vary by child, but researchers have provided a valuable starting point for parents when setting boundaries.Second, have conversations with your child about their tech usage. Not all screen time is made equal. Time spent using devices to draw, learn and engage directly with peers is not the same as passively consuming content. Conversations are key to understanding how your child engages with technology and what issues they may be encountering.Third, ensure that screen time does not disrupt activities essential to health — such as exercise, sleep and social interaction. Sleep is an important aspect of health for everyone, but especially teenagers. If your child is sacrificing sleep for time online, then you should be stepping in to help encourage them to engage in healthier behaviors.Given that the research is not as conclusive as the critics make it sound, we should proceed with caution. Otherwise all we might end up doing is erasing the benefits of social media and creating new problems for those we are trying to help.Aubrey Kirchhoff is Technology and Innovation Program Associate for The Center for Growth and Opportunity"
eugeneweekly_2022_50,"We ve got issues. The time of COVID — 2020, 2021 — was incredible for many many reasons. One poignant reason, I think we can agree on is loss: loss of income, loss of housing, loss of security, self assurance, mental health, loss of direction, loss of inspiration, loss of a loved one. Everywhere you look, there are more questions; even within the answers there are more questions. This is probably no different, to be honest. Spiritually, it’s said that in order to grow or evolve you must let go. Let go of what no longer serves you. It’s a beautiful thought and expression. The reality is, the “let go” part comes down to acceptance. Accepting that you recognize the truth of where you are, and where you want to go, and most importantly what you do not need to continue to do, to reckon with, to face and — to let go. Seems reasonable. The process is terrifying. To let go is to transform. When you change so dramatically, especially traumatically, you do not know what, who or how you will continue to “be.” A mental health crisis doesn’t always require CAHOOTS. It also doesn’t mean permanence or a diagnosis. A crisis is just that: a time of intense difficulty, trouble or danger, and is generally seen as negative. Change is hard. Transformation is complicated. The truth is, experiencing the social construct of our realities — like race, social economic status, gender, family structure — all collides and melds into our collective conscience. Of course our coping skills vary, we all have different boats in the same storm. In other words, my loss is your loss. My oppression is your oppression, my houselessness is your houselessness. This social transformation, this global crisis, weighs on our mental health. This crisis weighs on our senses as a whole. In the midst of such loss, can we allow space for each other? Inclusivity is not just a term for diversity, race and equity enthusiasts. It is human, without the false directive of social separation. Can we give each other grace in this massive transformation we are globally and very personally experiencing? Suuuurrre — but harder yet, let us allow the space and time to be whatever we need to be in order to feel whole. Can we imagine what letting go of urgency may look like for ourselves, for our family, for our business, for our community? What if we all consider this forced transformation as a sort of mental revision that any of us could be trying to work through — at any given time? Can we acknowledge the courage it takes for each other to just show up to any table at this point? This is different. Our lives have been touched by loss, either personally or we have witnessed it. The best way to “let go” is to recognize how to face what we’ve known to be true and pick up something necessary and new for all of us.

minnpost_2022_105,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When theColumbine High School massacre took place in 1999it was seen as a watershed moment in the United States – the worst mass shooting at a school in the country’s history.Now, it ranks fourth. The three school shootings to surpass its death toll of 13 – 12 students, one teacher – have all taken place within the last decade: 2012’sSandy Hook Elementary attack, in which a gunman killed 26 children and school staff; the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, whichclaimed the lives of 17 people; and now theRobb Elementary School assault in Uvalde, Texas, where on May 24, 2022, at least 19 children and two adults were murdered.Weare criminologistswho studythe life historiesof public mass shooters in the U.S. As part of that research, we builta comprehensive databaseof mass public shootings using public data, with the shooters coded on over 200 different variables, including location and racial profile. For the purposes of our database, mass public shootings are defined as incidents in which four or more victims are murdered with at least one of those homicides taking place in a public location and with no connection to underlying criminal activity, such as gangs or drugs.Our database shows that since 1966, when our database timeline begins, there have been 13 such shootings at schools across the U.S – the first inStockton, California, in 1989.Four of those shootings – including the one at Robb Elementary School – involved a killing at another location, always a family member at a residence. The most recent perpetratorshot his grandmotherprior to going to the school in Uvalde.The majority of mass school shootings were carried out by a lone gunman, with just two – Columbine and the1998 shooting at Westside School in Jonesboro, Arkansas – carried out by two gunmen. In all, some 146 people were killed in the attacks and at least 182 victims injured.The choice of “gunmen” to describe the perpetrators is accurate – all of the mass school shootings in our database werecarried out by men or boys. And the average age of those involved in carrying out the attacks was 18.This fits with the picture that has emerged of theshooter in the Robb Elementary School attack. He turned 18 just days ago and reportedlypurchased two military-style weapons. It is believed that the shooter used one miltary-style weapon in the attack, authorities said May 25, 2022.Police haveyet to release key informationon the shooter, including what motivated him to kill the children and adults at Robb Elementary School. The picture of the shooter that has emerged conforms to the profile we have built up from past perpetrators in some ways, but diverges in others.We know that most school shooters have a connection to the school they target. Twelve of the 14 school shooters in our database prior to the most recent attack in Texas were either current or former students of the school. Any prior connection between the latest shooter and Robb Elementary School has not been released to the public.And school shooters tend to preempt their attacks by leaving posts, messages or videos warning of their intent.James Densley is a professor of Criminal Justice at Metropolitan State University.

suffolknewsherald_2022_243,"Published 8:38 pm Friday, October 14, 2022ByJimmy LaRoueIf sorry seems to be the hardest word, as Elton John sang, then goodbye is trying to cut in line.Friday was my last day at the Suffolk News-Herald after nearly four years, and as that day got closer, it didn’t get easier to admit I was indeed leaving. I’m not good at goodbyes, and my parents refuse to say the word. With them, it’s “hasta la vista,” until I see you again, or “ciao,” see you later.When I drop my daughter off at school every morning, I wait until I see her enter the school building before leaving, even though she has already said goodbye for the day and walked away. I do this even when I’m running late, and I’ll no doubt continue to do this.So when I knew I was going to be leaving, and I informed people at the paper of my plans, it was difficult even then, but at least at that moment, there were still two weeks to say goodbye.But as those two weeks came to an end, I still couldn’t bring myself to say it.And as I covered events and spoke to various people in recent days, I couldn’t bring myself to tell them I was leaving.Then, as illness took over my apartment, slowly working its way from my wife, to myself and now my daughter, it has cut into the time I expected to have to visit places and speak with people I haven’t spoken to recently. I’m not sure I would have been able to say goodbye in those moments either, but I would have felt more at peace.It reminds me of the last episode of M*A*S*H*, “Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,” in which one of the characters, B.J. Hunnicutt, played by Mike Farrell, has difficulty saying goodbye to his bunkmate, Hawkeye, played by Alan Alda, when, in the show, the Korean War ended and they were all preparing to go home.Hawkeye kept trying to get B.J. to say the word, but he wouldn’t, all the way up to the end, when, as Hawkeye got into the helicopter to begin his journey home, B.J. pointed to a message he left in the rocks with a simple, poignant message.Goodbye.But, there’s also a lyric to another, older song, Goodbye Girl — the song itself isn’t quite relevant to what I’m trying to convey — that gets to the essence of how I feel about Suffolk and the people I’ve met along the way.“So remember goodbye doesn’t mean forever/Let me tell you goodbye doesn’t mean/We’ll never be together again/Though we may be so far apart/You’ll always be in my heart.”And I put that heart into everything I wrote, every photo and video I took and every chance I had to learn something new that I could share with all of you. To everyone who entrusted me with their stories, and who listened to some of mine, I offer my gratitude.Really, I’m not going too far away. I’m staying in the region, and I’ll no doubt be in Suffolk often. My wife and I just closed on our first home, and though I’m not fond of packing, it’ll still be easier to say goodbye to the apartment I’ve called home over the past four years, than to say goodbye to everyone in Suffolk.Consider this, then, my goodbye in the rocks.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_76,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Our news screens were erupting with breaking news of yet another mass shooting. But this time the news that began with a barrage of bullets also became something special — a tale of battlefield heroics on the homefront of a nightspot in Colorado Springs.A brave military veteran, Richard Fierro, had rushed toward the first flashes of light as he had been trained to do. He smashed the gunman to the ground and pummeled. Mercifully and miraculously, a horrific fatality count of five innocent souls never became 50.A day later we saw yet another godawful newsbreak. This one should have sent scores of famous-name Republican veterans of America’s political wars rushing instinctively and instantly toward the news flash. Yet it didn’t. But it may not be too late for scores of Republicans to once again show they can be a Grand Old Party. After all, we know that sometimes it takes a while before words of political incitement trigger warped individuals to commit horrific acts. We still shudder at the tragic attack following the repeated political incitement slogan of “Fire Pelosi!”Now we have heard what sounded sickeningly like another political battle call — and we are all smart enough to sense the danger that could follow.Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump’s former secretary of state and CIA director, made precisely the news he wanted to make Monday. In an interview with Semafor correspondents David Weigel and Shelby Talcott, Pompeo, a conservative Republican who used to be a Kansas congressman, issued a carefully politically calculated pronouncement about an individual most Americans probably think they never heard of: “The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call.”Pompeo was talking about the president of the American Federation of Teachers. Indeed, he was so intent upon making his attack on Weingarten the headline of his story that he asked himself a question he hadn’t been asked — just to attack the teachers union leader. He said:“I get asked ‘Who’s the most dangerous person in the world. Is it Chairman Kim, is it Xi Jinping?’ The most dangerous person in the world is Randi Weingarten. It’s not a close call. If you ask, ‘Who’s the most likely to take this republic down?’ It would be the teachers’ unions, and the filth that they’re teaching our kids, and the fact that they don’t know math and reading or writing.”Pompeo did not just stumble into this populist name-calling demagoguery out of ignorance. He graduated first in his class at West Point, then went to Harvard to get his law degree. He’s been traveling the country to see if he can generate his own groundswell of Trump-like loyal voter support if he chooses to run for president in 2024 against his former boss and others.Indeed, Pompeo is trying to play the Trump demagoguery card well before 2024, just as Trump found a way to make headlines long before his 2016 campaign. Remember Trump got himself on TV by initially repeating his blatantly false claim that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States, but Kenya, which would mean he was never eligible to be president.Now Pompeo is trying to lure Trump’s base by demonizing the teachers and their union. But the Republican Party that once stood for patriotism, law and order, still has many prominent political leaders who understand that Pompeo’s self-serving political PR ploy can spin horribly out of control. Pompeo’s words can inflame any of the many warped minds who have access to weapons. He could endanger not only the teachers union president, but all teachers, in all schools, who go to work each day, are woefully underpaid — but represent the infrastructure that is building America’s next generations.On Wednesday, Weingarten appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” whose host, Joe Scarborough, was a former conservative Republican congressman from Florida who broke with his party over its support of Trump. Scarborough told her “It’s not just an attack on you, it’s an attack on all teachers.”“You and I both know the history of incitement,” Weingarten told her host, “And what happens when you start with words that get increasingly demagogic — and what that then does. … Do we need to have a mass shooting every night? Every day? … This is intended incitement. … What I’m concerned about is what it does for teachers in classrooms. And for parents. And for kids. … What does that do in terms of bringing people together.”Perhaps the ultimate point is that Pompeo’s attack on Weingarten and teachers must do just that. Pompeo’s demagogic words must bring together all the sane patriots who still call themselves Republicans. They must unite to condemn his message — and tell Americans we must work with our teachers to help them build the infrastructure that will be America’s ultimate bridge to tomorrow.Martin Schram, an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service, is a veteran Washington journalist, author and TV documentary executive.

Two years into the pandemic, these findings are raising concerns about the long-term impacts the coronavirus might have on biological processes such as aging.As a cognitive neuroscientist, I have focused inmy past researchon understanding how normal brain changes related to aging affect people’s ability to think and move — particularly in middle age and beyond.But as evidence came in showing that COVID-19 couldaffect the body and brain for months following infection, my research team shifted some of its focus to better understanding how the illness might influence the natural process of aging. This was motivated in large part by compelling new work from the United Kingdom investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the human brain.In the study, researchers relied on a database called theUK Biobank, which contains brain imaging data from over 45,000 people in the U.K.going back to 2014. This means that there was baseline data and brain imaging of all of those people from before the pandemic.The research team compared people who had experienced COVID-19 with participants who had not, carefully matching the groups based on age, sex, baseline test date and study location, as well as common risk factors for disease, such as health variables and socioeconomic status.The team found marked differences in gray matter — or the neurons that process information in the brain — between those who had been infected with COVID-19 and those who had not. Specifically, the thickness of the gray matter tissue in brain regions known as the frontal and temporal lobes was reduced in the COVID-19 group, differing from the typical patterns seen in the people who hadn’t had a COVID-19 infection.In the general population, it is normal to see some change in gray matter volume or thickness over time as people age. But the changes were more extensive than normal in those who had been infected with COVID-19.Interestingly, when the researchers separated the individuals who had severe enough illness to require hospitalization, the results were the same as for those who had experienced milder COVID-19. That is, people who had been infected with COVID-19 showed a loss of brain volume even when the disease was not severe enough to require hospitalization.Finally, researchers also investigated changes in performance on cognitive tasks and found that those who had contracted COVID-19 were slower in processing information than those who had not. This processing ability was correlated with volume in a region of the brain known as the cerebellum, indicating a link between brain tissue volume and cognitive performance in those with COVID-19.This study is particularly valuable and insightful because of its large sample sizes both before and after illness in the same people, as well as its careful matching with people who had not had COVID-19.Strikingly, the brain regions that the U.K. researchers found to be affected by COVID-19 are all linked to the olfactory bulb, a structure near the front of the brain that passes signals about smells from the nose to other brain regions. The olfactory bulb has connections to regions of the temporal lobe. Researchers often talk about the temporal lobe in the context of aging and Alzheimer’s disease, because it iswhere the hippocampus is located. The hippocampus is likely to play a key role in aging, given its involvement in memory and cognitive processes.The sense of smell is also important to Alzheimer’s research, as some data has suggested that those at risk for the diseasehave a reduced sense of smell. While it is too early to draw any conclusions about the long-term impacts of COVID-related effects on the sense of smell, investigating possible connections between COVID-19-related brain changes and memory is of great interest – particularly given the regions implicated and their importance in memory and Alzheimer’s disease.The study also highlights a potentially important role for the cerebellum, an area of the brain that is involved in cognitive and motor processes; importantly,it too is affected in aging. There is also an emerging line of workimplicating the cerebellum in Alzheimer’s disease.These are active and open areas of research we are beginning to tackle in my laboratory in conjunction with our ongoing work investigating brain aging.Our lab’s work demonstrates that as people age, the brain thinks andprocesses information differently. In addition, we’ve observed changes over time in howpeople’s bodies moveand how people learn new motor skills.Several decades of workhave demonstrated that older adults have a harder time processing and manipulating information — such as updating a mental grocery list — but they typically maintain their knowledge of facts and vocabulary. With respect to motor skills, we know thatolder adults still learn, but they do so moreslowly then young adults.When it comes to brain structure, we typically see a decrease in the size of the brain in adults over age 65. This decrease is not just localized to one area. Differences can be seen across many regions of the brain. There is also typically an increase in cerebrospinal fluid that fills space due to the loss of brain tissue. In addition, white matter, the insulation on axons — long cables that carry electrical impulses between nerve cells — is alsoless intact in older adults.Life expectancy has increased in the past decades. The goal is for all to live long and healthy lives, but even in the best-case scenario where one ages without disease or disability, older adulthood brings on changes in how we think and move.Learning how all of these puzzle pieces fit together will help us unravel the mysteries of aging so that we can help improve quality of life and function for aging individuals. And now, in the context of COVID-19, it will help us understand the degree to which the brain may recover after illness as well.Jessica Bernard is an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Texas A&M University.This commentary originally was published byThe Conversationand is republished here under Creative Commons.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_99,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Inflation is a hot-button issue, and its political fallout can be huge. Some think that the hyperinflation during Germany’s Weimar Republic in the 1920s — when, at a trillion to the dollar, the German mark literally was not worth the paper it was printed on — contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler. Current U.S. inflation is not remotely comparable, but pollsters say it helped to sway voters in the midterm elections in favor of the Republicans.We hear that inflation is “soaring” not only on Fox News but also in the pages of the New York Times. We are told that the inflation rate has remained “stubbornly high” at 8.2% over the past 12 months.Yet the inflation rate in recent months tells a very different story. From the beginning of July to the end of September, prices rose by only 0.5% — equivalent to an annual rate of about 2%.Why the difference in numbers? Imagine that you’ve been speeding down the highway at 75 miles per hour for 45 minutes, then you turn onto congested city streets and have been averaging 15 mph for the last 15 minutes. How fast are you driving now? The common-sense answer is that you’re doing 15 mph. But measured over the last hour, you’re doing 60.The arithmetic of 12-month inflation rates is more stubborn than inflation has been. Even after slowing down, it takes time for your speed over the last hour to come down, too. But it makes no more sense to claim that inflation is “soaring” now than it would to say that you are accelerating through stop-and-go traffic.The 12-month inflation rate is a useful measure for some purposes, like comparing trends across countries or over long time periods. What doesn’t make sense is to use the 12-month rate to claim that the current level of inflation is either rising or falling.The causes of this year’s inflation are a legitimate matter for debate. Supply-chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, have played a role worldwide. The power of mega-corporations to raise not only their prices but also their profit margins, now at their highest level in 70 years, added fuel to the fire.Stimulus spending under the Biden administration has raised inflation, too, though an extra bump in prices may have been worthwhile to support hard-pressed families, rebuild our decrepit infrastructure, and possibly head off a depression.The reasons that inflation has cooled off in recent months are also open to debate.The Biden administration’s decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had an impact: Gasoline prices fell more than 20% from the beginning of July to the end of September. Interest rate hikes by the Fed began to dampen demand — which, although not the ideal fix for supply shortages, is the main inflation-fighting tool the Fed has at its disposal, recalling the old adage about every problem looking like a nail when the only tool you’ve got is a hammer.But whatever the causes, we ought to be able to get the facts straight.And the fact is that rather than soaring, inflation has actually eased — and eased a lot — in recent months. Fevered reports of runaway inflation are misleading, with political repercussions that could go well beyond number games.James K.

minnpost_2022_56,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Hennepin Avenue is the historic artery in the middle of Minneapolis, and Uptown has been the beating cultural and activity heart of the city for a long time. However, the proposed Hennepin Avenue redesign that the city is barreling toward will be an unnecessary repeat of another failed Uptown project.At this critical moment, we must remind city leaders, as well as those who disagree with us; it is possible to want changes to Hennepin Avenue, but also feel that the proposed plan is not the answer. The city must do better.Many of us remember the recent “Phase One” of the Hennepin project that stretched southward from Lake Street to Lakewood Cemetery. It altered Hennepin Avenue radically in terms of its design and abruptly in terms of its implementation. By many accounts, it was a failure in many different ways. Given the disastrous outcomes of Phase One, the city owes all stakeholders residents, businesses and visitors a better plan, not a repeat of the last one.While people of many differing viewpoints have been getting more involved recently, our organization has been involved since the beginning of the Public Works participation process. We’ve spent hours in meetings, corresponded with Public Works staff many times, suggested our own concerns and those of our neighbors, as well as proposed other options and suggestions to Public Works staff.Just as was the case with Phase One, our concerns have not been heard, and have not beenIncorporated. When asked, Public Works staff have not sufficiently provided answers to a host of critical questions that are at the heart of the goals they are claiming to be pursuing.Since “prosperity” is one of the City’s Transportation Action Plan goals, how does the evidence from Phase One (such as reduced revenue for the businesses, decreased property values, increased assessments, job losses from closed or diminished businesses inform the decision-making this time? What are the specifics of the climate benefits, from a plan that will likely create gridlock and idling cars on the avenue? How does this project incorporate the “new normal” that we might have once the pandemic recedes? For example, how does this plan incorporate potentially different downtown commuting patterns? What are the time benefits of 24/7 bus lanes, compared to other measures such as the current cyclical bus lanes that share with parking, the fewer stops they are proposing as part of BRT (bus, rapid transit traffic signal timing, locations of stops, etc.? Why can’t this project accommodate electric cars, which will be a critical part of changing America’s fossil-fuel consumption patterns? Isn’t that a more realistic vision of the future than exponential increases in year-round bike ridership in the Minnesota climate?Annually, thousands of visitors spend millions of dollars in Uptown. To date, Public Works staff has not taken the time to understand the economic impacts, talked to individual business owners on the avenue, or been transparent about the economic and environmental impacts. They have shown through their words, processes and, ultimately, this plan, that they just don’t want to hear ideas different from their own.The stakes couldn’t be higher. A survey we conducted in 2021 of Hennepin retailers showed that more than 30 independent, locally-owned businesses said they would seriously consider leaving the avenue if such a radical and abrupt plan is adopted.Many city policies have laudable goals. But implementation of those policies is critical, and theimplementation of this project is missing the mark, just as it did before. The path we are on, which looks remarkably like a repeat of Phase One on a much larger scale, is a disastrous course for this vibrant commercial district unless Public Works staff realize they must meaningfully incorporate other ideas, or the leaders in the mayor’s office or city council intervene.Many of us have new ideas for Hennepin Avenue that are different from what it is today, and have expressed them over the past year and half. The design that Minneapolis Public Works staff has produced is not the right solution.Rather than take a victory lap now as some are suggesting, it’s time for those at Public Works to roll up their sleeves and meaningfully incorporate other ideas into their plans for a more holistic Hennepin redesign. Hennepin Avenue cannot handle another massive Public Works mistake. We cannot repeat another Phase One.Aaron Meyers is president of the board of theUptown Association, a nonprofit organization of about 100 members that also produces the Uptown Art Fair.

minnpost_2022_152,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We’ve all experienced it at some point: Coming down with nasty cold symptoms that leave you exhausted and unable to focus on a single task. Hiding your worry or fear as you care for a chronically ill loved one. Waking up to your young child who complains of a sore throat and sports a matching fever, prompting the quick realization that your day will go the complete opposite direction of what you had planned.These situations are a common, unavoidable part of life that nobody can escape. And that’s okay – it’s a part of being human. Nobody should be penalized for it. There should be built-in safety nets that guarantee employment and financial security through these unanticipated and difficult times.The past two years have been one big unanticipated, difficult time for everyone, myself included. As a small business owner, the COVID-19 pandemic created many different challenges in my world – the primary concern being to operate my business while simultaneously ensuring my employees (many of whom are parents have access to what they need to stay healthy and take care of themselves and their families.I’ve also faced serious personal health challenges during this time. A year ago I was in a car accident that left me with chronic back pain. Despite attempting to take some time off from running my business to heal and care for myself, it simply wasn’t possible financially. By laboring through the recommended recovery period, fully healing was never possible. My doctor is now recommending surgery.This process repeated itself when I contracted COVID in 2020, along with my sons, daughter and grandchild, making it practically impossible for us to sustain my often family-run business. When I got COVID for the second time in January 2021, total shop closure was inevitable: I had to make the tough decision to close it completely for four weeks to protect myself, my family, my employees and my community, which resulted in significant income loss I can never gain back.While nobody can prepare for the once-in-a-century pandemic like COVID, we can absolutely prepare for the more common, inevitable parts of life, like getting sick or caregiving, through pre-planned safety nets through a public government-administered program likePaid Family & Medical Leave(PFML .Over the past two years, this resource would have been a complete gamechanger for the small business world, which was taking pandemic-related hit after hit. In addition to giving us business owners the operational and financial stability needed to better plan and prepare for the future, supporting business growth, it would have given me the ability to offer my employees quality, reliable time to pause and care for themselves and their loved ones.PFML would keep small businesses vibrant and people secure in the local jobs they’re passionate about. Our current way of tailoring special credits and processes like PFML at a price point comfortable to larger businesses is unhelpful and unsustainable. So many Minnesotans want to work for their local mom and pop business that are staffed by the people they care about who live in their communities. Small employers keep these much-loved neighborhoods safe and vibrant, ensuring access to community resources and a thriving local economy.When we are all able to access the care we need, our entire community benefits. It is extremely hard to work when you don’t feel good. Nobody benefits. Giving everyone the ability to practice some form of self-care without restrictions – without having to make a choice between putting food on the table or proactively resting to avoid burnout; between paying rent or taking time to recover following a serious illness – is critical for the well-being of our world.These are not the sort of choices we should have to make. By implementing PFML for Minnesota’s small business owners and employees to easily access, we wouldn’t have to.Tabota Seyon is the owner ofInfused Life Plant Based Emporiumin Minneapolis and a member of the nonprofit Main Street Alliance, a network of small business owners working towards an equitable and resilient small business economy by creating strong communities."

leoweekly_2022_42,"I don’t know what to say. It’s not that I don’t have anything to say about Club Q shooting in Colorado Springs. I have too much to say, and there are too many people I want to say it to.But I’ll try.I’ll start with straight readers. Think back to your teens and 20s. If you’re in your mid-40s like I am, even your 30s have started to feel like a faraway land. Now, remember that one place: that one shop. That one store, that one diner ­— maybe it was a beloved Louisville landmark like Ear X-tacy, or maybe it was a late night place like Steak and Shake — unremarkable except for the friends you spent time with there, talking and bullshitting into the wee hours of the morning. How did it smell? How did it look? What sort of music is usually played there? No matter how old you are, I bet you still remember that time in your life when there was only one place you felt like you belonged. Now, just to twist the knife, imagine that it was also the only place where people didn’t yell insults at you. The one place where it was safe to tell someone you had a crush on them without the fear that they might beat the shit out of you. And if you were in love already, this was the one place you could safely be in love. Think about that one place, picture it, put yourself there, feel loved, feel accepted, feel safe. Now picture someone who hates you walks in and starts shooting people.Long before any of the churches in the country started accepting us, the Queer community had places like Club Q. In my 20s, I lived in Dayton Ohio and there was only one Queer club, one place where my roommate and I felt safe dancing. We literally called it church. He’d ask, “Are we going to church tonight?”To the Queer community, I want to say, our churches have been invaded and attacked before.Like marginalized and persecuted minorities across history, when we are attacked, we take the energy created by violence, and we turn it into fuel for our independence. Picture the brick that Marsha P. Johnson threw, starting the Stonewall riots after the New York City police broke into the Stonewall Inn and assaulted us in one of the few places where we felt safe. It kicked off the modern fight for Queer rights.We can take this attack and use it to fuel the fight for safety, justice and equity. In Colorado Springs, the world discovered that the mythical“good guy with a gun,” isn’t some cis-het, square-jawed action hero. It’s two pissed off people with nothing but their fists and high heels launching into action to protect their chosen family, because they knew they coudn’t wait for someone else to save them. They knew their safe and sacred space was worth fighting for.I’ve been contemplating why I find this shooting so hard to move past, why it is still sitting on me. And I think what’s making it so impossible to grapple with or even articulate how it feels, is the amount of time I’ve spent in the last few years trying to make spaces feel safe for Queer people.Queer people from all walks of life work hard to kick down doors and erase barriers, making the world safe for our chosen families, and for the generation of Queer people that comes next. I have trans friends who’ve fought public battles with chicken joints and sued nursing schools. I’ve seen artists work behind the scenes to encourage Queer representation onstage — drag queens reading books to kids and performing during brunch. Queer athelets, Queer writers , Queer middle management, Queer Shakespearians, Queer baristas, Queer DJs, Queer business owners, Queer artistic directors, all working to make places feel safe for Queer people. I try to do my part. I put a lot of Queer performers onstage in the last five years. I’ve tried to make make my classrooms a space that the increasing number of Queer kids who feel safe, and have room to bring their identity to their work.When I woke up on Nov. 20, and read that a hate-filled, white, male terrorist named named Anderson Lee Aldrich had opened fire in one of my community’s safe spaces, walked into one of our churches and killed five people, injuring many more, it felt like I had failed.I’m not alone in that either, many of my Queer friends also feel like we’ve failed.But we haven’t. We just haven’t won yet. And while I haven’t been able to shake that feeling of failing, I’ve been reminding myself of our victories, and reminding myself that those victories add up. I think about all the Queer couples legally married, Queer families able to adopt, Queer kids that I teach and all the cities in Kentucky that have passed fairness ordinances. The terrorist act in Colorado Springs at Club Q isn’t a sign we failed, it’s a reminder that we need to keep fighting. This isn’t our failure. It’s one more battle in a war.So keep fighting, keep working to make safe spaces and keep your bricks and your high heels close by.•. ( ."

eugeneweekly_2022_11,"We ve got issues. You may not have heard of the Black Cultural Festival. It’s a festival unique to the Pacific Northwest. Now in its second year, the Black Cultural Festival promises to be an event nearly unrivaled in Eugene’s festival culture. This unique event was created to provide the local Black community with a place of belonging and opportunities to bridge access gaps, wrapped up in exciting festival attractions. The list of the Black Cultural Festival’s offerings is appealing and varied, including aerial silks with Bounce Gymnastics, an outdoor Museum Without Walls sponsored in part by the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, an Instrument Petting Zoo with the Eugene Symphony, free yoga and meditation classes, art workshops led by professional artists, a six-person African drum and dance troupe from Ghana, Paddling 101 lessons and guided river tours with Willamette Riverkeeper, local Black artisans, soul food, chess, and so much more! However, more than what ’joyments can be found at this year’s Black Cultural Festival, we should focus on the significance of the event, and how it is evidence of the communal growth and beauty Eugene desires to achieve. To understand this festival as more than a chance to be entertained, we must look at founder Talicia Brown-Crowell’s reason for creating it. When Oregon was admitted to the Union, it was the only state with a Black exclusion law. Interestingly, Oregon was anti-slavery — but it was also anti-Black. The first of our state’s exclusion laws banned slavery, but also banned freed Black people from remaining within the state. The idea was that Oregon was removing a “troublesome class,” which was the cause of “evil” in other parts of the country. Doubling down on its collective racism, in 1869 Oregon rescinded its ratification of the 14th Amendment. Just 80 years ago, Oregon had a higher per capita ratio of KKK members than any other state. This means, if you are this author’s age, your grandparents grew up in that era; your parents may have been raised by persons with those mindsets. You may have been one of the first to peek outside of the cloud of racism.Your childrenmay be the first generation raised with overarching inclusive attitudes toward race. Eugene’s white population forged a troubled history with the local Black community. Being Black in our city was effectively illegal for several generations. The police kept a book with photos of Black men who dared to stay in the city more than a week, crosses were burned, Black bodies were violently segregated. “The land called Alton Baker Park in 2022 is where the Black community in Eugene started. It was referred to as ‘across the bridge’ when Eugene was a sundown town. At the end of the work day, the Black employees had to be back across the river by sundown, so as not to be caught in the city after dark. Alton Baker Park is where they resided,” says festival advisor Kokayi Nosakhere. The Black community in Eugene will be congregating at Alton Baker Park in August — not because we are forced to be there, but because wechooseto be for the Black Cultural Festival in honor of those who had no choice. Generations of abuse and violence damaged something in the souls of many Black people in Eugene. Black people learned to ignore each other. They lost the sense of community most of the American Black population has. There seems to be an understanding that it is not safe to be grouped, it is not desired. If you are not Black, you cannot understand what it means to see another Black person on the street, in a restaurant, at school, or at a store — and once your eyes meet, they quickly turn away. In our culture, we always acknowledge each other. We let each other know, you have been seen and I am here, too. It’s a sign of love and understanding amongst our people. … but not in Eugene. Here, it almost seems much of the Black population has been taught that it is dangerous to even acknowledge another Black person is nearby. To get the local Black community together en masse is a near impossible feat. And yet, that is exactly what the Black Cultural Festival aims to do. It aims to gather our local Black population and encourage them to be a community and heal together. The theme of this year’s festival is “Our Mental Health Matters.” In addition to the obvious festival offerings, there are practical connections to services that support the well-being of the local Black populace. We are happy to see allies within the local community showing their support. While the festival is for persons of Afro-descent, our close friends and families, we welcome ally support through donations and volunteering. Irene Rasheed is a consultant and activist of Gullah Geechee descent, author of Afro-centric K-12 history curriculums, a mother and wife. She is also the sponsorship coordinator for the Black Cultural Festival. The festival would like to give a special thanks to its sponsors and partners.

minnpost_2022_144,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Sadly, and similarly to the COVID-19 pandemic, these impacts disproportionately impact lower-income communities and communities of color, which are more likely to be located near busy highways and other high-traffic corridors, such as ports and international bridges. We know that life expectancy ismore impacted by the zip code of a child than by their genetic code, and that climate change is exacerbating these health inequities.This issue hits close to home. I grew up with a younger sister with asthma. Hot days were particularly hard for her, and I have many memories of her up with a nebulizer when she couldn’t breathe. She was also limited in sports and physical activity and often wheezing when we were outside playing during ragweed season.According to the2021 State of the Air Report authored by the American Lung Associationin a comparison of metropolitan areas across the country, Hennepin County was among the cleanest counties for short-term particle and ozone air pollution. It is my aim to keep it this way and continue to protect the health of the most populous county in Minnesota.Fortunately, we know how to improve air quality in the most vulnerable communities and combat the climate crisis that is amplifying all of these challenges. Tailpipe pollution is the biggest problem, and we can reduce the harmful pollutants that are coming out of tailpipes now, and work to get rid of tailpipes altogether by putting the nation’s automotive fleets on a clear pathway to 100% zero emission electric vehicles.This is why the Biden administration and the EPA must work urgently to develop the next round of long-term clean car standards to ensure that nothing but pollution-free light duty cars and trucks are being sold by 2035. The EPA deserves our gratitude for their swift work in undoing the damage done by the previous administration, which had rolled back clean car standards and allowed more polluting vehicles on the roads. But now their attention must turn towards this critical next round of standards, or we’ll risk losing precious time to clean up the transportation sector as a whole.The strongest possible clean car standards aren’t only a good thing for my sister with asthma or my patients in our communities, but they are also good for our economy. The transition to cleaner, zero-emission vehicles will create good jobs in a growing industry and will also save drivers money in fuel costs every single day.Bottom line; long term clean car standards will help our most vulnerable communities who are the most exposed to air pollution and the hardest hit by the impacts of climate change. Strong emissions standards are the best tool that our policymakers have for reducing dangerous and deadly air pollution, and for combatting the climate crisis.As a nurse, I’m at the bedside, helping care for patients every day. But nurses cannot do it alone. Discharging patients into the very environments that compromise their health gets us nowhere. We need to stop people from ever becoming patients, and we can do that through strong clean car standards.Jessica Fisher is a nurse with the University of Minnesota Physicians."
minnpost_2022_40,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .COVID, crime and the economy loom at the top voting issues for Minnesotans in a newSurveyUSA pollfrom KSTP news.That survey, conducted from Jan. 25 to Jan. 30, indicates Gov. Tim Walz faces theprospect of a competitive racefor reelection against any one of several possible Republican opponents.The poll’s credibility level of responses for its 690 adults is plus or minus 3.3 percent, for its 592 registered voters plus or minus 4.8 percent and for its 501 likely voters plus or minus 5.7 percent. SurveyUSA’s methods receive an “A” grade from Nate Silver’s 538 analysis site. The site has found no detectable bias toward Democrats and Republicans in the pollster’s surveys.How is Walz faring with Minnesotans? It depends on which question you ask and to whom you ask it. His reelection number among registered voters is a healthy 52 percent, but his personal approval among likely voters slumps to 45 percent. That may suggest that the 2022 Minnesota electorate will not be so Walz friendly.Walz, however, fares better in the survey than does President Biden. Biden’s job approval among registered voters is only 41 percent. A mere 36 percent of that group approve of Biden’s performance on the economy and just 40 percent of adults approve of Biden’s COVID management. Walz’s approval on economic performance is 49 percent among registered voters and 49 percent among adults on addressing COVID.These are middling numbers for Walz, indicating the right Republican challenger could make the governor’s race a competitive one. In match races with six GOP gubernatorial candidates – not including Rich Stanek, who declared after the polling concluded – Walz received between 42 and 45 percent support, with leads of between three and eight points. Physician and former State Sen. Scott Jensen, who recently won the Republican caucus straw poll, only trails Walz 43 to 40 percent. Jensen declared the earliest and has raised the most money among the GOP gubernatorial candidates, but his skepticism of COVID vaccines might work against him in a statewide race. Seventy percent of adults in the survey are vaccinated and a previous KSTP poll revealed that 54 percent of Minnesota adults favored the Biden administration’s vaccination mandate for all businesses with at least 100 workers.The key tea leaves for the future of the 2022 Minnesota elections appear in the survey responses of the two groups that determine statewide elections – political independents (29 percent of the survey sample and suburbanites (45 percent of the sample . The likely voters in both groups rate crime as a higher priority in their voting than do other voters. Twenty-six percent of independents and 19 percent of suburbanites rate crime as a top voting issue, compared to only 16 percent of the sample as a whole. GOP candidates are already emphasizing this issue and it is a top agenda item of Republican state legislators in this year’s legislative session.The preponderance of poll evidence, then, suggests that 45 percent personal approval probably catches Walz’s standing with the likely Minnesota electorate better than his 52 percent job approval among registered voters. He steadily received 40-45 percent in match races against potential opponents and his economy and COVID approval percentages are also just below 50 percent.Here is the big question: Can the GOP make this a competitive race? For that to happen, they must accomplish three major tasks. First, they must reduce the great financial advantage the DFL and Walz now have in campaign funds. Second, they must nominate a quality candidate with wide appeal. Third, they must run a campaign that persuades Minnesotans that Republican solutions to their top concerns deserve their vote. They have not succeeded at these tasks in a statewide race since 2006. Will they this time?Steven Schier is the emeritus Congdon professor of Political Science at Carleton College in Northfield."

eugeneweekly_2022_46,"We ve got issues. Steven Ray Scott was beaten and left for dead during a senseless argument over a crack pipe in Springfield. The reason his known killers are still free is best described in hyperbole. Hypothetically, a police officer is smashed in the head with a golf club during a dispute and left for dead. Soon after, Eugene Springfield emergency service (EMS personnel intubate the unconscious but alive officer and transport him to Riverbend Hospital, where he dies. A woman and her adult son are arrested by Springfield police, charged with intentional murder. Later, an autopsy confirms the suspected cause of death: “blunt force trauma.” Still later, in a rare court motion, the Lane County district attorney dismissed the murder charges, the killers released on their own recognizance, pending, according to a statement released by the DA, further investigation because of information discovered at autopsy. The autopsy discovery: a snarl of entangled gastrointestinal tubing in the back of the throat; easily of size and proximity to have contributed to death by asphyxia. The unintended result of mal-inserted intubation by EMS personnel during on-scene life saving measures. Truth: This all happened Sept. 3, 2017. The known suspects remain free today, but the victim was no cop. Reality: Cop killers would experience justice and it would come swiftly. Regardless of complications or mitigating circumstances discovered at autopsy. Harsh reality: The actual murder victim in this hypothetical example was really a homeless, meth influenced Black man. But there is nothing made up about the circumstances of his death. Hypothetically, if someone you loved met a similar fate, their attackers would see justice from the Lane County DA. The reality is that not all lives carry the same value for justice by practice of the Lane County DA. The police officer example is rhetorical hyperbole to emphasize the disparate treatment in the murder of Steven Scott by the Lane County criminal justice system. What possible discovery at autopsy would ever throw off course the criminal prosecution of known and arrested suspects in the murder of a police officer? The erroneous placement of intubation by EMS personnel in good-faith life-saving measures does not erase the intentionally criminal blows to the head that lead to the murder of this human — cop or civilian, Black or otherwise. Fact: Every human deserves to be treated with dignity and respect at death regardless of the circumstances of their life. The dead cannot demand justice. The unpunished murder of Steven Scott is a travesty. A bigger one will be when the unpunished strike again. Perhaps next time they kill it will be someone whose life matters to the Lane County district attorney. Email or phone your elected Lane County district attorney and demand justice for Steven Scott. There is no statute of limitations for murder, but four years is long enough. Scott McKee, who is a private investigator, licensed in Oregon, is a 34-year police veteran in the state. You can watch the two-part October 2020 “Special Report: The Death of Steven Scott” on KEZI for more on this case."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_37,"The release of WNBA star Brittney Griner after 10 months of Russian detention is cause for justifiable celebration. It has spared Griner from the possibility of years in a Russian penal colony, a punishment that far exceeded her alleged offense, and reunited her with friends and family. President Joe Biden deserves credit for his commitment to bringing her home. That doesn’t mean the deal to secure her freedom was a good one. Griner’s release came after months of negotiations, held amid escalating tensions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. She had been arrested in February at a Moscow airport on charges of possessing small amounts of cannabis oil. Despite admitting guilt and issuing a public apology, she was sentenced to nine years and transferred to one of Russia’s notorious prison camps, where inmates are typically subjected to brutal living conditions and forced labor.Welcome as Griner’s release may be, though, much about this process gives cause for concern.One worry is the deal itself. In exchange for Griner, the U.S. agreed to pardon Viktor Bout, a convicted arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in Illinois. Bout was responsible for supplying weapons to rogues and terrorists around the world — many committed to killing Americans — from the Taliban to Colombia’s leftist FARC rebels to former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. He’s believed to have links to the Russian intelligence apparatus and to members of President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. A Kremlin spokesperson called Bout’s release from U.S. custody “ a true Christmas present.”Given the intense public interest in Griner’s case, Biden had considerable motivation to make a deal. Yet on balance the U.S. got the worst of it. Bout’s conviction in 2011 came after years of painstaking effort by U.S. intelligence, diplomatic and law-enforcement agencies; exchanging such a dangerous criminal for an athlete with no discernible intelligence value to Russia is, unavoidably, an affront to the U.S. justice system. The Biden administration also dropped its insistence that the Kremlin include Paul Whelan, the former U.S. Marine serving a 16-year sentence for alleged espionage.It’s also fair to question the administration’s priorities. By one estimate, 60 U.S. citizens are currently held as hostages or otherwise wrongfully detained overseas. Given the administration’s self-congratulatory social-media barrage following the release, it’s hard to escape the conclusion that Griner’s celebrity was a major reason her cause was treated with outsized urgency. Whelan’s family gave a generous statement celebrating Griner’s release — while also noting that it was “a catastrophe for Paul.”A final concern is about the precedent this case sets. In its almost desperate willingness to do a deal, the Biden administration has risked emboldening other regimes to detain prominent Western citizens and use them as leverage. Going forward, Biden needs to make clear to America’s adversaries — and to the public — that while the U.S. remains committed to seeking the release of all citizens held unjustly abroad, it will not come at the expense of the country’s national security.America should welcome Brittney Griner’s return unreservedly. But it needs to take a hard look at the process that brought her home.— Bloomberg OpinionNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_8,"The older I get, the more I find myself drawn to the Christmas songs that have a touch of melancholy to them. Songs that acknowledge the complexity of Christmas emotions. “I’ll Be Home for Christmas.” “Christmastime Is Here.” And, of course, “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”Sure, it’s the most wonderful time of the year. A time of joy and celebration, holiday parties and family fun. But it’s also a time of prayer and reflection, a time to take stock of where we are and what’s happened in the past year. We’ve all grown a little older. Babies were born. Loved ones have passed away.My wife lost two of her four older brothers this fall, in quick succession. Both were surprises. Too young. Out of the blue.Someday soon we all will be togetherIf the fates allow …It’s an unusual conditional for a Christmas song — “If the fates allow” — but it’s an acknowledgment of how things change. Some things are beyond our control. You may have everyone together for Christmas one year. And then the next, you may not. People move. Family members have fallings-out. Some people get jobs that require them to work on holidays. Those in the military are deployed overseas.And in the course of a year, alas, loved ones sometimes pass away.“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” first sung by Judy Garland, debuted in the 1944 film “Meet Me in St. Louis.” In the film, Garland’s character sings the song on Christmas Eve to comfort her little sister, who is sad that the family is moving away from its cherished home.The original lyrics, as sung by Garland, contained the line, “Until then we’ll have to muddle through somehow.” As the story goes, Frank Sinatra later requested that the song be lightened up so it wouldn’t be so morose, so most versions you hear these days substituted that line with “Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.” Some years, though, “muddling through” is an apt description.My brother-in-law Brian was a mainstay at Christmas family gatherings for years. He had a raspy voice that let you know he’d done some living. He was never afraid to share his opinions on anything from politics to music to movies to the Blackhawks. He could be gruff. He liked to crack jokes. He liked to ruffle feathers.He also loved Christmas. He loved the boisterous family gatherings. And, above all, he loved his three kids. Loved doing things with them. Going out into the world, seeing things, skiing, hiking, biking, going to concerts. His kids are all young adults now. In fact, he was at his eldest daughter’s wedding this fall, just one week before his heart attack happened. He was 59.My wife, Joanne, and I hosted a family gathering last Christmas Eve. After dinner, three generations of her family were still talking and laughing around the dinner table, the wine and the Irish coffee flowing. There were Christmas cookies and pies to nibble on.Here we are as in olden days,Happy golden days of yore.While the adults were still chatting, I slipped off to the family room to join my three kids to watch “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” Two teens and a grade schooler. Growing up too fast, as all kids do. We still watch the Charlie Brown special every year on Christmas Eve. We practically know it by heart.Brian came into the room, whiskey tumbler in hand. For a couple of minutes, he watched us, curled up on the couch under cozy blankets, quoting lines, making quips about the Peanuts gang.“This,” he said, looking at me, “is the best time in your life.”It was unusually sincere from him, so it took me aback. But it was spot-on.Life doesn’t get much better than moments like this. Sitting around with your family, sharing laughs, sharing traditions, sharing the Christmas joy. It is fleeting. It comes but once a year. And things can change. We don’t know what next year will bring.But when you feel it, the Christmas joy, there’s nothing else quite like it. Cherish it. Hold it tight.Someday soon we all will be togetherIf the fates allowUntil then we’ll have to muddle through somehowSo have yourself a merry little Christmas now.John Biemer, a physician and former Tribune reporter, lives in Oak Park, Illinois.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2022_15,"Daniel Cameron is a failed experiment. He’s the exact example of someone given an opportunity and placed in a position to do something good by the people of the state, yet, he’s pouring his energy into affairs that do not benefit the citizens of Kentucky. In fact, I would call his behavior and attention to his job a dereliction of duties, particularly in the case of Breonna Taylor. Failing to acknowledge civil rights violations as a Black man in America? Give me a fucking break. The irony here is too much. Cameron is wearing blinders of the most heinous kind. To say that Cameron is frankly another sell-out to special interests and Republican hyperbole is too mild a statement when one looks at the absolute failure of his tenure as attorney general of Kentucky.“President Trump is a fighter,” Cameron recently wrote on his Twitter page. “No raid at Mar-a-Lago is going to stop him from working hard for the American people. Folks here in Kentucky will always support someone the media despises and the left hates, because it means that person is standing up for their values.”I’m not even going to touch how absolutely, mind-numbingly sycophantic this is, but just come on this journey of words with me.“Folks here in Kentucky will always support someone the media despises and the left hates…”Dude, grow up.Cameron has fallen into the trap of equating all Kentuckians with the stereotype of the brainless yahoo. Sure, Kentuckians love an underdog but Trump isn’t any underdog. He’s a rich white fool who plays on the sentiment of true underdogs by hyping them up on racism and blatant lies. He sells a fantasy that many Kentuckians, some poor… some racist as fuck, want to buy into — if they step on others, they might be like Trump, too.The funny part of this statement is that Cameron isn’t even really talking about Trump here. He’s talking about himself. He’s hoping that how the media ‘hates him’ makes him more palatable to Trump’s audience, and therefore ensures that Kentuckians will elect him as their first “Black” leader.But what qualifications does Cameron have to lead Kentucky through a continued pandemic, widespread poverty, a neglected Eastern Kentucky primed for growth but suffering from flood damage?This should be what Cameron is selling — skills and leadership qualifications — not the hopes that Kentucky will accept his Black face because he aligns himself with Trump. It’s such a thin attempt to be palatable. Cameron is a sad, sad and tired trope.Can you blame a brother for trying? It works for Clarence Thomas, at least it has until Ginni Thomas’ shenanigans start to get in the way. Cameron is on the same razor’s edge where success for him hinges on selling himself to the tastes of white people. In Kentucky, I guess that means shouting out for Trump and doing whatever the Senate Minority Skeksis Mitch McConnell asks of you.It’s embarrassing and it is a prison. What Cameron should be doing as attorney general is performing the basic duties given to him by Kentuckians and diligently dealing with the bad policing in the state that caused Breonna Taylor to lose her life.He could have done this and still held fast to his “support” for the police. Cleaning out the criminal cops would seem to indicate that he both supported a transparent and strong force while also caring that citizens’ rights were protected.Who am I fooling? That’s a fantasy just like Cameron’s bid for governor.He doesn’t deserve to be attorney general. And the state’s governor? Hard pass. He’s an opportunist like the rest of his party, maybe worse because he’s proven that he would ignore the civil rights of his own people.All chatter, no substance and nothing to show Kentuckians that he is worthy to hold the highest office in the state. Alignment with Trump and McConnell doesn’t feed, clothe or keep Kentuckians safe.“I don’t care what anybody says in the national media, when it comes to supporting and defending law enforcement, we are going to do that. We are going to back the blue,” Cameron said at Fancy Farm.Your job, Cameron, is to back Kentuckians — and making law enforcement transparent, honest and safe should be a priority.You failed at that and, in turn, your friends in blue have to bear the dishonor of the FBI arresting members that you should have taken care of yourself.Kentucky owes you nothing and really, just enjoy these last months of your AG job, then step off and disappear. I’d certainly rather the votes of my friends and family go to a qualified candidate, and one day, a qualified and sensible Black one. •. ( ."
minnpost_2022_17,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In January, consumer prices in the United States jumped by more than seven percent, the highest increase since 1982. Inflation is here and our families’ budgets will be increasingly squeezed. Home heating costs have increased significantly this winter and more hikes are in store, as Xcel Energy and Minnesota Power are seeking double digit rate increases over the next few years. Gasoline prices are up nearly 50 percent in the last year. Another less-discussed area where Minnesotans have experienced large increases is trash collection.Why is trash collection so expensive in the Twin Cities metro area?One of the primary drivers is the reliance on trash-burning incinerators. While politicians and lobbyists tout the benefits of “waste to energy” from incinerators, the reality is the cost of burning trash is extremely expensive. In fact, burning trash costs $8.33 per megawatt hour, nearly double the cost of coal and nuclear, which are the second and third most expensive forms of energy.Yet, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington Counties have long subsidized incinerators with taxpayer dollars. Not only are these incinerators expensive to operate, but in reality, they also produce little energy. On top of that, in Minnesota, a trash “hierarchy” exists in law that prioritizes burning of trash and then subsidizes it as “renewable” energy – much like benefits granted to truly renewable energy like wind and solar.In addition to the costly economic argument, burning trash is equally troubling from a public health and environmental perspective. Recent reports have expressed concerns with incinerators emitting air pollution that includes per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (more commonly called PFAS or “forever chemicals” . The EPA has issued astrategic roadmapto address increasing concerns with PFAS.By forcing trash to be transported to incinerators, there are many more trucks on the road, driving greater distances. Meanwhile, the average tipping fee in Minnesota to an incinerator is $83.20/ton compared to an average cost of $63.52/ton for landfilling waste in the state. In Ramsey and Washington Counties, tipping fees have increased 25 percent in the last five years. Why are we subsidizing this dirty, expensive practice and paying more?In an era of heightened political polarization, this may be a rare opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to come together to enact sensible policy changes. Lawmakers should acknowledge that burning trash is neither “clean” nor “renewable” energy and stop the taxpayer subsidies. Rather than burning more trash, the focus should be shifted to recycling and composting programs that continue to utilize new technology to save consumers money and protect the environment at the same time.With the legislative session now underway, policymakers should tackle this important issue in a bipartisan manner. In a time of exploding inflation, this will not only help Minnesota families’ pocketbooks but it will also limit unnecessary pollution from trash-burning incinerators.Kelly Fentonis a former state representative who represented Woodbury.

suffolknewsherald_2022_193,"Published 10:07 pm Wednesday, January 26, 2022ByStaff ReportsWe are anxiously awaiting the results of a new infusion of cash to the Nansemond Indian Nation.Since the Nansemond received federal recognition about four years ago, they have made many strides on a number of fronts.The latest development is that the nation has received $998,250 through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Indian Community Development Block Grant program, extended under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.The money will be used to expand its community center at Mattanock Town, the tribe’s land in Chuckatuck. The community center there has been used to distribute COVID-19 tests, vaccines and food during the pandemic. Even before the pandemic started, the community center sorely needed expansion and renovation.Tribe Chief Keith Anderson told reporter Jimmy LaRoue last week that the money will be used to enlarge the lodge, which currently holds just 50 people safely, create a commercial kitchen to provide meals, add food storage spaces, conduct medical services and install solar panels and battery storage for energy efficiency. He credited interim tribal administrator Tom Badamo, tribal historian and cultural preservationist Nikki Bass, grant writer Joel Haspel and chief emeritus and Mattanock Town groundskeeper Sam Bass with making the grant award a reality.In a joint statement, Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said the money going to the Nansemond Indian Nation, and the $1 million going to the Chickahominy Eastern Division to rehabilitate homes to improve air quality is instrumental for Native American communities hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.“As the Omicron variant continues to create challenges for people across the Commonwealth, we’re glad to see that these federal dollars will provide critical relief for communities hit hard by the pandemic,” the senators said in a joint statement. “This funding will help provide these tribes with services necessary to protect their health and safety.”The Nansemond Indian Nation, its people, its heritage, and its cultural education and events are vitally important resources for Suffolk. We should protect them at all costs going forward. That’s why we applaud this monetary award and look forward to its results.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_113,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The month of May is AANHPI Heritage Month — an opportunity to recognize the histories and cultural contributions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in our state. May also marks the final weeks of the legislative session, and this year state lawmakers have the chance to invest in the urgent needs of Minnesota’s Asian American communities.Like my family, many Asian Minnesotans are struggling with the ongoing consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates of COVID-19 mortality have been high,particularly in Hmong, Karen, and Karenni communities in our state. Job losses have touched many families. Asian American women, who are overrepresented in the frontline workforce, have faced anunusually high rate of long-term unemploymentas a result of the pandemic. And our small businesses have suffered. A survey of small businesses conducted by CAAL found that nearly half of Asian Minnesotan small business owners were unable to pay bills during the pandemic.The economic hardship of the pandemic has been exacerbated bya disturbing increase in hate and violenceagainst Asian Americans. Since the pandemic began, Asian Minnesotans — ranging from children in schools to elders in our community — have been targeted with racial slurs, verbal harassment and physical assault. These incidents of hate ripple through entire communities. Ina survey on the impact of the pandemic, Asian business owners reported experiencing verbal harassment, threats of violence, declines in customers, and the need to change operations to protect the safety of themselves and their employees.In the coming weeks, the Minnesotan Legislature has the opportunity to invest in the economic recovery of Asian Minnesotan communities. A provision in the Minnesota House Jobs omnibus bill, which is now in conference committee, allocates resources to support Asian small businesses and nonprofits to recover and rebuild from the pandemic. This proposal — which has bipartisan support — would help to address the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 and anti-Asian hate on Asian Minnesotan businesses and nonprofits, ensuring that they have the resources they need to recover.Investments in Asian Minnesotans would strengthen the state’s overall recovery. Asian Americans are an essential and growing part of our state and its economy. Minnesota is home to over 350,000 Asian Americans. According to Pew Research, Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the United States. Asian entrepreneurs own over 15,000 businesses in Minnesota that together reach $4 billion in annual sales. Asian-owned businesses employ 27,000 Minnesotans with a combined annual payroll of $700 million.With Minnesota’s $9 billion budget surplus, now is the time for bold leadership and meaningful investments in the economic well-being of Asian Minnesotans. States like Wisconsin, New York, and California have already started targeted investments in their Asian American communities. As we proudly recognize and celebrate AANHPI Heritage Month, we urge Gov. Tim Walz and our state lawmakers to recognize the need to invest in Minnesota’s growing Asian American community.ThaoMee Xiong is the executive and network director of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders"
suffolknewsherald_2022_255,"Published 6:29 pm Tuesday, September 27, 2022ByStaff ReportsMy eyes blinked open as a new day began. I turned off the alarm and stretched as I prepared to exit the bed. The stretch to loosen my joints from a night’s sleep reminded me of the pain in the center of my chest. I winced and grabbed the knife protruding from the center of my torso.I couldn’t remove the painful object, and I knew staying in bed wouldn’t be helpful, so I began my day as usual. I prepared for the day and got dressed for work. I went to my car, shed a few tears, said a prayer, and drove to the office.“Smile,” I told myself as I entered the office, forcing a grin upon my face. I greeted others with a happy “Good morning” and worked through the day without anyone knowing about the pain that seared through my being. I had hidden the knife well.The knife in my chest was not, of course, a literal knife. It is, however, a good description of how I felt that day. I have battled depression for a long time, and depression landed a good hit on that day.I share this brief story for two reasons.First, October is National Depression Awareness Month. It’s a good time to remind those who have never battled depression that there is no stereotypical look for those who face depression. Not everyone who fights depression lies in bed all day unable or is unable to participate in life. Many who fight depression are hardworking individuals who hold a steady job, volunteer for charity organizations, and otherwise contribute to their society. Many fight the battle silently, and you would never suspect that they are working beside you with an unseen wound.Next, I hope my openness with my battle can encourage some who face the same enemy. Not everyone will understand what we face. There will always be misunderstandings about what we fight, but that doesn’t mean these false ideas are true or that no one wants to better understand the battle we face.In the same way, don’t let the misconceptions of some make you think that you are weak because of the battle you face. It’s the opposite. Those who battle depression but continue to work and live good lives are strong. Not everyone would put in a full day’s work with a knife in their chest! Not everyone will understand, but we cannot allow the misconceptions of others to define you. Stay strong and continue to fight.I’ve battled depression for decades. I’ve written many columns chronicling my fight and heard from others who went through similar things. Nevertheless, I continue to learn more about my battle and the battles that others face.This October, I encourage those who battle depression to stay strong in the fight. You are valued, you are loved, and you are needed. I encourage those who have never fought this terrible monster to continue to learn about the battle and to support those who do.The suicide and crisis hotline is 988.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_80,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I was recently interviewed about the war in Ukraine and President Biden’s label of “genocide,” which I support.I was then asked about the genocides in Rwanda and Bosnia. Why did the United States engage in former Yugoslavia but do nothing about Rwanda, where nearly a million people were slaughtered in a hundred days? Those genocides both occurred in the 1990s, and the American responses could not have been more different.I hesitated. It’s painful to talk about the fundamental bias to our geopolitics. We see the opening of hearts, homes and wallets, of military arsenals and aid budgets for Ukraine and Ukrainians — but what about the Uyghurs in China? The Rohingya in Myanmar and Bangladesh? The millions at risk in Ethiopia, Syria, Darfur, Yemen and Afghanistan?The victims have something in common: They are not white.A Uyghur friend of mine sent me a poignant note.“If the world was as united for the Uyghurs as they are for the Ukrainians, the Uyghur genocide would have stopped. I am amazed how the global community has come together for Ukrainians but ignores the others. Not only the governments around the world but also civilians showed their humanity. Almost every celebrity in Hollywood is standing up for the Ukrainians, which makes me happy, but they choose sides. When it comes to the Uyghurs, they are all mute. So sad. The Uyghurs, Syrians, Yemenis, Rohinga are ignored. At least the world is standing up for Ukrainians, so we have not lost our humanity. This gives me some hope.”A research team from World Without Genocide is speaking with Uyghurs in the U.S. diaspora. Uyghurs are a Turkic Muslim people located largely in Xinjiang, a province in western China. Many have come to the U.S. fleeing a genocide perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party, the CCP.Since 2017, more than a million Uyghurs have been incarcerated in concentration-camp-like facilities. People are tortured and raped. Some detainees are released — only to be sent to prison for up to 20 years for alleged offenses such as reading a Koran. Their children have been forcibly taken from their homes and placed in “boarding schools.”Women are sterilized at rates that show a fertility drop of 60 percent over the past few years. Men and women have had their bodily organs forcibly harvested. Uyghurs have been sent throughout China to be used as slave labor in factories making goods for Abercrombie, Gap, and more than 80 other international companies.What has been the global response? A few Chinese officials have been sanctioned. A U.S. bill has been passed to prevent importing goods made with slave labor — but the bill only applies to goods made in Xinjiang, while factories with forced labor exist across China.The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and several countries label the CCP’s atrocities as genocide. A tribunal without any legal authority has declared that the CCP is perpetrating genocide. And that’s it.By contrast, the United Nations censured Russia and removed Russia from the prestigious Human Rights Council. The U.N. has delivered millions of dollars of food, water and shelter to thousands of Ukrainians. Nations around the world have sent billions of dollars of weapons and humanitarian aid. Both President and Dr. Biden have visited Ukraine. The U.S. increased the quota for Ukrainian refugees to 100,000 and has fast-tracked their admission.The Uyghurs we have spoken to have loved ones in China who are in fear for their lives. Uyghurs in the U.S. who speak out against the persecution facing their parents and siblings in China are harassed by the long arm of the CCP in what is called transnational repression.

Children should get vaccinated during their next doctor’s visit or at their local Virginia Department of Health office, the coalition says.“The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many disruptions in families’ lives. In some cases, it has meant that children have missed or delayed their wellness checkups and critical vaccines,” said Dr. Michael Martin, president of the Virginia Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “Vaccines are critical to ensuring children stay healthy.”Infants, small children and pregnant women should catch up on missed vaccinations to protect themselves and their communities before returning to school, summer camp and other in-person settings, the experts advise.The 2021 Virginia Annual Immunization Survey saw a significant decrease in kindergarten entry vaccination rates, according to ImmunizeVA. From 2019 to 2020, the percentage of immunizations required for school entry decreased from 84.8% to 80.4%, VDH reports. “Kindergarten readiness includes being immunized and healthy, ready to learn,” said Dr. Jane Elyce Glasgow, executive director of the EVMS Minus 9 to 5 program. The organization’s 2022 Hampton Roads Early Childhood COVID-19 response/recovery agenda prioritizes educating families about the importance of on-time, well-child visits and immunizations.According to the Georgetown Center for Children and Families, if vaccination rates decline below levels required to maintain herd immunity, which protects vulnerable members of society who are too old or too sick to get vaccinated, dangerous outbreaks of preventable diseases could follow.During a time when many once-trusted institutions such as health care face over-the-top skepticism, we urge parents to listen to public health professionals.“Virginia has a goal to protect children from vaccine-preventable disease, and we can only accomplish this with the support of parents, guardians, and healthcare providers,” said Rebecca Epstein, ImmunizeVA senior program manager. “Parents are encouraged to ask pediatricians how to ensure their child stays updated on their vaccinations. It’s important to talk to pediatricians or trusted health care professionals to get the facts. Vaccine trust is built through millions of conversations between parents, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and community members.”The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

Gino’s dedication to finding a cure for Alzheimer’s and his efforts toward increasing resources for the caregiving community cannot only be measured in monetary value.In 1995, estimates were that 4.5 million people in the U.S. were suffering with Alzheimer’s, and federal research funding was significantly lower than other diseases. Gino’s advocacy has helped increase federal research funding to $3.4 billion. This increase, along with passing of legislation such as the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, has been instrumental in efforts toward finding a cure.Unfortunately, today there are more than 6 million Americans living with Alzheimer’s and 11 million unpaid caregivers. Gino’s legacy is one of raising awareness, increasing contributions, building advocacy and so much more. We can only hope the impact we have over the next 27 years will be as great as Gino’s accomplishments during his tenure.Perhaps you know someone who is impacted by Alzheimer’s and related dementias?

suffolknewsherald_2022_0,"Published 4:41 pm Friday, December 30, 2022ByStaff ReportsWasn’t it just the other day that Virginians were shaking our heads in dismay at a motionless cordon of traffic tens of miles long stranded overnight in brutal, subfreezing temperatures on a stretch of Interstate 95 north and south of Fredericksburg?That was the first head-turning news event of 2022, when the year was still in its infancy. Plenty has happened in the days, weeks and months since then. Some of it was encouraging. Some of it was discouraging.It may feel a bit unseemly to read the obituary for 2022 while it’s in its final hours and not yet officially consigned to the ages. But unseemly is what I do. It’s my job.Here’s my take on the big moments of the past year.Beleaguered from almost two years of COVID-19 pandemic privations, the term of Gov. Ralph Northam was just a week from its end when a snowstorm of unexpected severity left more than 800 vehicles gridlocked on a bitterly cold 40-mile stretch of the freeway for up to a day and a half.Among the drivers encamped overnight in the frozen hellscape was U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, whose normal two-and-a-half-hour commute to Capitol Hill for the resumption of Congress turned into a frigid 27-hour in-car bivouac. The same was true for unknown hundreds of shivering travelers.An after-action report blamed a freakish storm that began as a blustery rain after an unusually balmy holiday but unexpectedly turned into a serious winter storm that slammed the region with sleet and snow. The assessment faulted poor communications and a torpid initial response by Northam’s administration, but conceded that the rain beforehand made it impossible to pre-treat the road with brine or salt. Miraculously, there were no deaths or serious injuries in vehicles parked overnight and unreachable by first responders or even the National Guard.In the aftermath, Northam’s Republican successor, Glenn Youngkin, has issued preemptive emergency declarations seemingly every time weather forecasts have called for a heavy frost.After two years of total Democratic hegemony in Virginia government, voters acted in 2021 to return to divided government to Richmond. They put Republicans in the top three statewide elective offices and gave them a narrow House of Delegates majority.The result: a legislative session that passed a state budget at the last minute to head off a partial shutdown of state services when the old budget expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30. The task of appointing two justices to fill vacancies on the short-handed state Supreme Court as it struggled with a growing backlog of cases also stretched out for interminable months. And they never got around to filling a vacancy on the State Corporation Commission, which will be down to just one of its three judges after Judith Jagdmann resigns effective the end of this month.Along the way, legislators buried partisan differences and did dog lovers like me a huge solid: they put new restrictions on a cramped, corporate beagle-breeding mill in Cumberland County that bred beagles as medical experimentation subjects. The facility finally closed this year after a series of damning federal reports on its conditions. The pups were released to shelters, and many are spending this holiday curled up with their adoring adoptive humans.The Virginia Employment Commission finally made significant inroads into mountains of unemployment compensation claims that had languished for months on end from the early months of the pandemic. But it’s still not over.The agency was unprepared for an avalanche of unemployment claims resulting from layoffs and business failures starting in the spring of 2020. A withering report from the General Assembly’s investigative arm faulted poor management of the agency, scant oversight by Northam’s administration and outmoded technology for the failures.According to data the VEC provided last week, the agency removed or completed just over 900,000 cases in 2022, or 88% of what it received during the year. About 700,000 of those matters awaited the agency on Jan. 15 when Youngkin took office and sacked the agency’s previous leadership. Nearly 333,000 new matters came in since then. Of the 127,282 cases still pending, three-fourths are appeals of denied claims, 18% are potential fraud claims and just 6% are claims awaiting adjudication.Slightly more than 90% of the 258,320 potential fraud claims with an aggregate monetary value of $1.56 billion in January have been investigated, according to VEC. The current dollar value of the 24,170 potential fraud claims awaiting investigation as of last week was just over $160 million.The rate at which Virginians are killing one another with firearms has climbed at an unsustainable rate the past three years. And it was driven home mercilessly by several mass killings that have shocked the conscience of the commonwealth.With nine days left in this year, 20 separate mass shootings have killed 37 people and wounded 75 in Virginia in 2022, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. The GVA, a nonprofit online database of firearm violence collected from law enforcement, government, media and commercial sources nationally, defines mass shootings as events in which four or more people are shot or killed.For 2022, Virginia ranks fourth nationally in mass shootings, trailing Texas (86 deaths, 193 wounded , California (60 dead, 190 wounded and Illinois (51 dead, 254 wounded . As if that ranking isn’t damning enough, the number of mass shooting fatalities thus far this year is already more than double Virginia’s 2021 total of 16. In 2020, three were killed and 46 were injured in Virginia mass shootings.Nearly half of 2022’s deaths occurred this fall. They include the Nov. 13 slaying of three University of Virginia football players on a bus returning from a class trip to Washington. A fourth player was wounded and a female student was also injured. On Nov. 22, seven people were fatally shot and six others were wounded in a Chesapeake Walmart.Finally, something unambiguously good: Virginia’s 2022 midterm congressional election.I don’t laud it because of who won and who didn’t. For the record, Republicans flipped one Democratic U.S. House seat in Virginia.What made this election good was it worked. Candidates ran hard, but when the votes were tallied, they accepted that the results expressed the will of the voters. The election wasn’t without warts. None ever are. But it was clean and it was well-run, affirming the faith I and others who have closely watched state elections for decades have in Virginia’s system of elections.Bob Lewis covered Virginia government and politics for 20 years for The Associated Press.

suffolknewsherald_2022_153,"Published 12:48 pm Wednesday, March 2, 2022ByStaff ReportsSuffolk’s City Council could teach the state of Virginia a little about redistricting.The city’s once-a-decade redrawing of borough boundaries to reflect population shifts revealed by the U.S. Census ended last month with unanimous agreement on a new map. Significantly, the final product addressed, with little fuss, concerns by Black leaders about the fairness of early drafts.We couldn’t help but contrast the conciliatory, efficient approach of city officials with the partisan toxicity that put state legislative and congressional redistricting in the hands of the Virginia Supreme Court.Voters had amended the state constitution to take redistricting responsibilities away from lawmakers and turn the task over to a “bipartisan” citizen commission. Unfortunately, legislators on both sides of the political aisle appointed people to the commission to do their partisan bidding instead of the independent map drawing that voters intended. When the commission reached a hopeless impasse, the state Supreme Court took over and did an admirable job with General Assembly and congressional boundaries.City of Suffolk redistricting was not so congenial a decade ago, when the then-council ignored objections from African American leaders and approved a plan that met U.S. Department of Justice muster.Current Councilman Lue Ward was president of the local NAACP chapter at the time. Now an elected official, Ward was insistent in the new round of redistricting that Black neighborhoods be kept whole instead of split into two or even three different voting boroughs.Ward’s alternative to early versions presented by a consultant contained three majority-minority districts, three majority-white districts and one that is a toss-up. It came to be known as Proposal C and won unanimous approval last month after some tense moments in earlier discussions.“I ain’t mad with nobody no more,” Ward told the News-Herald’s Jimmy LaRoue, “because I feel good I did something for a community that deserves much more than what they have, but now they’re together.”Ward’s advocacy was not lost on Councilman Tim Johnson.“Lue, you were right to be insistent,” Johnson said at the meeting where the final map was approved. “I think the map that came back, map C, pulls everything into vision. The districts are set really well. Communities are together. I’m impressed. It serves me well in Holy Neck and I think, Whaleyville, and I think we all are where we belong on the map.”On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_18,"The decision of the House Jan. 6 committee to recommend that the Justice Department pursue potential criminal charges against Donald J. Trump is not binding on the department, which in any case is already investigating “whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election” under the leadership of a special counsel.Still, the panel’s recommendation Monday that the department pursue four potential charges against Trump — including inciting, aiding or giving aid and comfort to an insurrection — is a powerful statement. Equally important, it is based on a voluminous and damning record amassed in hearings at which some of the most damaging witnesses were Trump’s own appointees.For anyone not blinded by partisanship or in thrall to the cult of Trump, the facts assembled by the panel, and contained in an executive summary of its report released on Monday, are shocking and shameful. They fully justify the dramatic step of a criminal referral of a former president.Yes, such a recommendation is revolutionary, but as Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee chairman, aptly explained, “We’ve never had a president of the United States stir up a violent attempt to block the transfer of power.”To its credit, the panel — launched after Senate Republicans stymied the creation of an independent commission to investigate the insurrection — viewed its mandate as more than a forensic investigation of the violent events of a uniquely dark day in American history. Horrific as it was, the violence on Jan. 6 was the culmination of a prolonged and multifaceted effort by Trump and his enablers to seize on spurious claims of voter fraud to maintain Trump’s hold on the White House.Led by Thompson and Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, a Republican with impeccable conservative credentials, the panel rightly placed the riot at the Capitol and Trump’s dereliction of duty on that day in that broader context. In doing so it compiled a historical record that will be of inestimable value to prosecutors as well as the public.The scheme to overturn the election collapsed when Vice President Mike Pence rejected the idea that he could refuse to count electoral votes fairly won by President-elect Joe Biden. But it was a sprawling conspiracy and, the committee persuasively suggests, a criminal one.The breadth of the campaign to overturn the 2020 election is reflected in the charges the committee asked the Justice Department to consider. The committee filed criminal referrals for Trump on three charges in addition to insurrection: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to make a false statement and conspiracy to defraud the United States.The insurrection charge is the most dramatic. The House in 2021 impeached Trump, accusing him of “incitement of insurrection” (the Senate failed to convict . A criminal incitement conviction might be harder to secure because Trump may claim that his statements were protected by the 1st Amendment and that he never advocated violence.Still, the committee has established a powerful case for pursuing prosecution on that and the other charges. The Justice Department already has successfully prosecuted foot soldiers in the Trump-orchestrated war on democracy. As we observed in an earlier editorial, it’s critical that the ringleader who exhorted his followers to march to the Capitol to “take back our country” also be held accountable.-The LA TimesDuring the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track. Contractor Nan Inc. began construction on the project in Dec. 2023, following a design and planning process that started in 2017."
suffolknewsherald_2022_33,"Published 5:55 pm Tuesday, July 19, 2022ByStaff ReportsWe’re heartened by current citizen engagement in important planning and zoning decisions awaiting city leaders. See Christy Cordova’s letter to the editor elsewhere on this page as an example of thoughtful input and activism.The system is working just as it should, with both appointed leaders (the Planning Commission and elected leaders (City Council required to listen to citizens at public hearings before making decisions that will forever affect Suffolk and its citizenry.However, we must reiterate a point made previously in this space. It’s easy to get citizens to fill the room for a public hearing on a controversial rezoning or conditional use permit. We get it. Few of us want anything in our neighborhood that would detract from our quality of life, much less potentially harm our property’s value.Yet, citizen engagement is much less robust when it comes time for a community to update its comprehensive plan — arguably the time to have a much more meaningful impact on land use decisions.In fact, the best time to have a say on how and where Suffolk grows is right now, as city leaders work on the first update of the community’s comprehensive plan in seven years.The 20-year plan, according to Planner Alexis Baker, is designed to be a long-range guide for a number of areas, including land use, housing, transportation, parks and open spaces, public safety, schools and economic development.To their credit, leaders are actively seeking participation from the citizenry.“You know your city and community the best,” Baker said in May when the process began. “Your input is essential to our work and will help shape the plan.”The process has the noble goal of producing a roadmap “that will maintain Suffolk’s quality of life while allowing for growth,” Baker said.There are lots of opportunities for citizens to get involved: in-person focus groups on specific topics, and online through the project’s website,www.Suffolk2045.org.It’s human nature to get worked up over a specific commercial or residential development, and the citizens who let their voices be heard during related public hearings are certainly within their rights to do so. They often fail, though, getting a hard civics lesson in the process.The new comprehensive plan is a much more important opportunity for citizen input. To say that a community is at a crossroads is an overused metaphor, but it’s safe to say that city leaders’ planning decisions, including the content of the new comprehensive plan, will be consequential long beyond their time in office. Officeholders come and go, but citizens remain to enjoy the successes or cope with the errors of elected and appointed leadership.If you’ve had only a casual interest in local government over the years but care deeply about the future of Suffolk, this is the time to get more engaged.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_38,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The relationship between Jeff Zucker and Allison Gollust that got Zucker fired/forced to resign as CNN’s president made me think, for several reasons, about the late Cosmopolitan editor, Helen Gurley Brown.Brown, of course, was renowned for talking about freely enjoying sex with a great many men before she married. Still, the author of 1962’s “Sex and the Single Girl” was opposed to women having sexual relationships with male bosses (with no mention in those “Mad Men” days of female bosses . In her 1965 sequel “Sex and the Office,”Brown wrote, “I think it’s better to keep this darling as a friend, someone who may from time to time advise you about other men.”Brown’s philosophies may cause 21stcentury inhabitants to think her far, far ahead of early 1960s society or a disturbing relic promoting romance counseling between bosses and employees. But her advice for women to avoid sexual relationships with male superiors was almost certainly correct at a time when consensual or (sometimes forced relationships between women and their male bosses almost always resulted in the woman being sacked once the boss’ interest dulled or his wife threatened divorce. One wonders what Brown might think about Zucker (whose nine years at CNN were mostly quite successful losing his job whileGollust, CNN’s chief marketing officer, gets to stay.While Gollust’s current job retention might represent a sort of progress to some, others might think she also should leave CNN since she apparently willingly participated in a relationship that was supposed to be forbidden for Zucker, someone for whom she might hold a good measure of care as well as respect as her supervisor. If Gollust had been Zucker’s supervisor, might they both have been required to leave? I don’t think so. But I strongly suspect Gollust might have been tossed out much earlier than Zucker.What I do know is that romantic relationships that form and sometimes end at work is something that has been going on for decades and will continue for decades more, in places ranging from corner diners to multi-national conglomerates. It’s probably fair to say that many of these relationships don’t violate any workplace prohibitions or marital vows.Still, one big factor not getting enough attention in the Zucker/Gollust debriefing is the fact that these two apparently had some sort of seriously platonic, possibly romantic relationship going on for many years before they admitted to any romance. Some (including former NBC “Today” anchor Katie Couric suggest Gollust’s rapid rise through the ranks at NBC and then CNN may have occurred because of her relationship with Zucker. Subtract sexual frisson and one can easily see how closely beneficial platonic friendships between more everyday supervisors and subordinates also can be matters of significant workplace difficulty.Such cronyism has been cited by more than one expert as a top reason managers lose productive employees.If anything is learned from the Zucker and Gollust situation, it is that romances between supervisors and subordinates are still not advisable, whether the players are paid many millions or just a few thousand per year. And if we can start examining the problems that can ensue when employers are unduly influenced by their great friend employees (and vice versa , that might be a good thing.In the end, the old saying (sanitized for a family readership , “don’t soil where you romantically or platonically eat” might be the best lesson gained from this case.A lesson even Helen Gurley Brown almost certainly could have endorsed with ease.Mary Stanik, a writer and public-relations professional, recently moved from St. Paul to Arizona.

Glenn YoungkinVirginia has made great strides in fighting the devastating COVID-19 pandemic that swept the globe over the past two years.More than 6 million people are fully vaccinated and our vaccination rate of 72% means we have one of the better vaccination rates in the country. As we work toward returning to normal, Virginians deserve to have the best health care tools and resources to make informed decisions for themselves and their families.However, the progress we have made is uneven throughout the commonwealth and underscores the need to update our COVID-19 plan. Many Virginians remain unvaccinated, and many of them reside in Southwest and Southside Virginia. There are a variety of reasons for their hesitancy, some due to the lack of information and lack of easy access to vaccines. We must do better, and we will.Under my administration, the Virginia Department of Health has redoubled its efforts, particularly in under vaccinated parts of Virginia to reinforce the importance of taking a vaccination against this virus. My administration’s campaign to increase vaccination rates is taking a different approach than in the past.Freedom of choice is a fundamental right in this nation and this commonwealth. We are going to empower the individual with information, provide facts to counter misinformation, and increase access to vaccinations to give each Virginian the ability to decide whether the vaccine is right for them. We will not rely on the government mandating individuals what they shall do, using the power of laws, regulations or executive orders.In the commonwealth, local health districts and community leaders are closest to their communities. Local public health leaders need to develop additional vaccination campaigns. Local public health physicians and staff are your friends and neighbors, and they know your communities intimately. No two districts are identical, so we will be reaching out to rural and urban communities through a variety of means.We want each person to be equipped with the facts about the decades-long history of the research that established the scientific foundation that went into the successful development of these vaccines during the previous administration’s successful Operation Warp Speed.I am a believer in the science behind these vaccines. My family, and I have been vaccinated and boosted. We have done so out of concern, not just for our health, but for that of our friends, vulnerable members of our community, and the greater society.While I will not be mandating the vaccine, I hope we can convince as many Virginians who are eligible for the vaccine to get it. I ask you as your neighbor to please get vaccinated. We are going to continue to provide access to necessary resources and information; by joining hands as a community, we can fully return to normal.Glenn Youngkin is governor of Virginia.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_3,"Another election is upon us, and I’m not sure what else there is to say to Americans about taking part in the electoral process. It’s hard to continue to encourage people to vote when it feels like the creep of radical conservatism and fascism continues to ooze its way across the nation. We’ve been fighting and we’re all tired. Here’s two things. One, I still believe voting should be mandatory and two, I think that every adult should run for an office (at any level just once in their lives. There are organizations to help with fees and honestly, after watching the Republican party of the last 20 years, no amount of dirty past should stop anyone. Fuck it, air your dirt and get the win. We just need to make sure that no seat in this nation goes unopposed.In , I wrote an article for LEO on the precipice of Bevin winning the governor’s seat and Jack Conway floundering yet another campaign. I spoke about why I believed voting should be mandatory for all adults in the nation. If you live, work and pay taxes in the nation, your participation in the workings of the government should also be compulsory. Perhaps then, we’d have less pointing fingers because we’d all be on the hook.I said then, “Even in a mandated system, people could have the right to refrain from casting a vote; at the very least, if regulated in a fashion similar to jury duty, with potential fines or jail time, it forces the public to show up and be counted even if simply to cast a vote for none of the above. It sounds punitive, but eligible Americans refusing to participate in national and state elections that have real consequences for all, is likewise penalizing those who vote but are underrepresented.”But, I don’t believe in jail time or fines because most Americans can’t afford that. I think I must have been writing through my exasperation. Still, just as men must register for selective service and just as we must submit our infants to certain tests and medicines at birth, I believe asking each adult American to take five minutes to cast a vote isn’t a big ask.But everyone can’t get to the polls.In the way so many countries around the world have modernized their voting systems, America is long overdue. Something as simple as easier access to ballots and electronic options could help. Modernization would also help to eliminate the Republican talking point of “fraudulent” elections. Certainly, the amount of fraud is so miniscule in the current system (virtually nonexistent and often simple mistakes in lieu of malice that simple modernizations would eradicate even the occasional times when someone makes a mistake in voting.Why do I think we need to vote? Because I believe that a truly representative government needs to really be chosen by all the people and not just people with access. The barriers that continue to be erected against voters, particularly poor voters and voters of color, must be eliminated for the election process to be a level playing field.There isn’t much more to elaborate on. We need to vote. We need to vote in large numbers. If you’re a person feeling “ho-hum” about this election, remember that level of apathy got us Trump and those were four really hard years. Our nation, our children, our environment and our ability to make a living cannot continue on “ho-hum.” The privilege to vote should be one that we’re as passionate about as getting a refund on a bad purchase. We can’t afford to waste money on damaged goods and we can’t afford to be the damaged goods because of bad government. Get your ass to the polls. Take a photo, tag LEO Weekly. We will see you there!“Corporations and lobbyists hold too much influence over our politics. We allow the richest individuals in the country to tell those of us who are not how we should live,” I said in my previous article. “Too often we are then hurt by bad policies made by ineffective and dishonest politicians. Because we fail to vote, we are electing people to office who are not representative of the way our nation looks. Too often those Americans who don’t vote are the ones who need to be represented most.”So many people can’t vote because of the folks who hold power in this country. The lobbyists and corporations have turned our political system into a marionette show with the separation between the parties only a small curtain. Giving all Americans access and an impetus to vote (via mandate or other mechanism might help shift that power dynamic back to the ground some. Ugh, I’m already imagining the amount of spending these corporations and lobbyists would do trying to continue influencing American politics.

philinquirer_2022_5,"People from historically underserved communities don’t just rarely utilize medical aid in dying; they also are less likely to utilize hospice and other palliative care options.Since New Jersey’s “Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act”took effectthree years ago, not one Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian,Pacific Islander, or Native American state resident has used the law to gently end their suffering.The question is: Why?According tostate Health Department reports, 89 of the 95 New Jerseyans who have used the law were white (94% , four were Asian, and two were of an unspecified single race. This racial disparity is similar to what’s seen inannual reports in eightof the10 other jurisdictions that authorize medical aid in dying.» READ MORE:Just 33 used New Jersey’s medical-aid-in-dying law last year. Pandemic health access could be one reason.As to why white people are more likely to use this option, some suggest it is because white people mostly are the ones who want it. But that is not true.A recent national surveyshowed that 62% of Black voters, 70% of Hispanic/Latino voters, and 65% of voters from all other ethnic groups surveyed would want the option of medical aid in dying if they became terminally ill, compared with 67% of white voters.Reducing New Jersey’s15-day waiting period, or waiving it when necessary, would improve access to medical aid in dying statewide. Other states such asCalifornia, New Mexico, and Oregonhave reduced their waiting period;Oregon also waived its residency requirement. New Jersey should also authorize the state’s share of Medicaid to pay for medical aid in dying, asCalifornia,Hawai’i, andOregondo. After all,New Jersey’s Medicaid program covers hospice care; it also should cover the end-of-life care that patients want, including medical aid in dying.But these revisions alone would not be enough to reduce the racial gap.Everyone deserves equal access to all types of end-of-life care.The reality is people from historically underserved communities don’t just rarely utilize medical aid in dying; they also are less likely to utilize hospice and otherpalliative care options.As anyone whose loved one has entered hospice can tell you, it is an invaluable resource, which gives peace and comfort to the dying person, as well as to loved ones.There are likely a variety of reasons why people of color are not getting this care at the end of their lives. They may tend to prefer aggressive treatments, and may not be offered palliative options, due to institutional racism, cultural and language barriers, lack of access, and economic and insurance hurdles. These facts have been documented by researchers, who found that people of color with end-stage kidney diseasewere less likely to receive referrals for palliative carethan white patients. Other reasons may include mistrust of the health-care system, lack of in-home resources, influences of cultural and religious beliefs, lack of knowledge about available services, and misconceptions about hospice and palliative care.Indeed, the racial disparities in use of hospice and end-of-life care areconsistent with a broad range of racial disparities in the use of health care, as well as health outcomes.» READ MORE:My mother didn’t get the death she wanted. Pennsylvania can change that for others. | OpinionEveryone deserves equal access to all types of end-of-life care. So how do we make that happen?It will take time, cultural andreligious sensitivity (e.g., understanding the importance and impact of faith, spirituality, and culture on end-of-life care decisions in communities of color , and trusted voices to empower and inform diverse communities about the quality-of-life benefits of hospice and palliative care.Health-care professionals should initiate conversations with all of their patients, no matter their background, about the importance of discussing their end-of-life care options with their doctors and loved ones, documenting their preferences in writing by completing an advance directive, and appointing a health-care proxy to carry them out if they are unable to speak for themselves. This information can be a source of enormous comfort for terminally ill patients and their loved ones.Just as we fight for everyone to have equal access to what options people want in life, so too should we fight for equal access to options they want when it comes to death.Brandi Alexanderis the national director of community engagement for Compassion & Choices, where she leads outreach to African American, Latino, faith, and LGBTQ communities."
suffolknewsherald_2022_283,"Published 9:13 pm Friday, December 16, 2022ByStaff ReportsThe year 2022 will soon be ending and become a historical narrative. We will remember some of the happenings, while others will be forgotten.December means Christmas, a tradition celebrated annually with lots of activity, never forgotten. Sadly, the estimate of how many believe the Christmas story is very low, but the tradition seems to take hold of us as soon as Thanksgiving is over.By December we find the stores are fully stocked with any new items we might enjoy. This year the grocery stores seem to have an overstock of alcoholic beverages. I hear it is often used to diminish fears and anxieties.A true understanding of Christmas can do a better job. Beautiful lights are strung around the neighborhood, a reminder Christ is the Light of the world.The meaning of the word, Christ-mas may be less known and less honored than another well-known one, Santa Claus, which shares its fame, but both bring to mind the idea of gifts and giving. Beautiful trees, lights, Christmas cards and family and friends getting together are also a part of the annual celebration.How, when and where did we get this tradition which makes us want to celebrate? How do celebrations differ today? My earliest memories are when I was only about age three. My brother, who was in the Navy, came home from California with his new wife. They bought my sister and me a small table and chairs. After that, the only gifts I remember were articles of clothing.When snow suits became a popular item, we each got one for Christmas. Other than the bike my younger brother got, I don’t recall any Christmas “toys.”Many things have changed or been “updated” as time and ideas have passed. In my childhood, the tree was cut from the back woods, decorated with a few breakable gold and colored balls my mom kept from year to year, strands of silver lining its branches, a tinsel star at the top. Later, an angelic creation topped it — each thing a silent reminder wise men were guided by a star when they went in search of Jesus, and an Angel was “over the place where Jesus lay.” In Sunday school and church, we always heard the story of Mary and Joseph and Bethlehem.I was much older when the word “Christmas” began to have a deeper meaning for me. We were living overseas in a different religious culture.We had children and I knew I needed to teach them why we celebrate. Christ had to be the center of our celebrations. The -mas is a shortened term for mass, a time of worship.I wanted my children to know who Jesus is, the son of God, and why he came.Since that time, I have had a different feeling about the way Jesus’ birth is observed. We all have an appreciation for the artistry, a beautiful picture of the baby in a cradle, everything clean and bright, but it was not like that on the night when Jesus was born. He was in the cattle stall, placed in the manger for a bed — a very humbling experience. This was poverty, and yet the one who lay there had come from the royalty of heaven.Six to seven hundred years earlier the prophets had written about him, more than 100 references in the Old Testament. Isaiah writes in chapters 7 and 9, “Unto us a child is born…the government will be upon his shoulders, his name shall be called wonderful, counselor, mighty God…” and then in chapter 53 “but he was wounded for our transgressions…bruised for our iniquities and by his stripes we are healed.”There was no Santa to bring him gifts, but there were “wise men” who followed a star, who gave gold, frankincense and myrrh, expensive gifts the young parents would need when they had to flee from Herod’s edict that all boy babies should be killed to preserve his own dynastic rule.The family fled to Egypt in the middle of the night. The God who was giving his son provided the means for the trip. Mary, Joseph and the baby Jesus did not stay long in Egypt. It was an idolatrous country. The prophet wrote, “out of Egypt have I called my son.” His home would be the land of Israel.Today’s more prosperous lifestyle will likely miss these details of Christmas, but they need to be regarded as “Christ-most” to remind us how God can meet us in our need.If the alcoholic beverages I see stacked in the stores are any indication, I see a world that needs to hear and believe they can have a new life in Christ. Without the Savior, there is no other helper. He’s not a baby anymore.Let’s give our hearts and lives to him this Christmas and find the new life he offers us.Myrtle V.

eugeneweekly_2022_28,"We ve got issues. I often find the discussion concerning House Bill 2001 hard to watch. The disagreeableness, coupled with competing facts, make the city of Eugene’s proposal confusing. Let’s agree to two things. The first is HB 2001’s stated purpose — to increase “housing choices” that “all people can afford” (Oregon.Gov Urban Planning, Housing Choices . Second, both sides — those who think what is being proposed is too much, and those who think it is just right — are equally correct. I have lived experiences that validate both. My first housing in Eugene was on 17th Alley, exactly what the proponents are envisioning: a unit in a fourplex, in a bungalow’s backyard. But my experiences mirrored the opponent’s worst fears. Because my two-story middle housing was squished against a three-story middle housing on the north, and another two-story on the south, light and air was limited, as was vegetation. Sleep was difficult because, whether the dumpster was locked or not, dumpster divers loudly scrounged for pickings throughout the night. And even though cheaply made with hear-through walls, rent was over market-rate. Yet the proponents are also correct: We are in desperate need of housing. And as one who has been housing precarious for big chunks of my life, I understand the impossible choices limited low-cost housing creates. But here’s the thing: Density — even with no parking, no trees and 50-foot towers — while a sure bet to get us more market-rate housing, can never alone provide housing that all of us can afford. Because creating the missing housing choices for the close to 50 percent of us who can’t afford market-rate requires purposefulness (Eugene-Springfield 2020 Consolidated Plan . And let’s additionally be clear, even though it is fashionable to say that building anything helps — it does not. The law of supply and demand doesn’t work because the demand is for affordable, not market-rate. Too, the concept of “filtering” (trickle-down affordability , first floated by 1920s developers as a painless answer to unaffordability, also won’t deliver. Consistent with current research, a study at that time on the effects of increased market-rate production found that while top end rents fell a tad, at the hurting lower economic levels, rents actually continued to rise(Modern Housing For America, Policy Struggles in the New Deal Era, Gail Radford, Pages 53-55 . Here are three suggestions that might get us closer to the goals of HB 2001: With diligence, it still may be possible for our community to unite around HB 2001, if only we remember the original intent: housing for all of us. Diana Bilovsky is a writer and longtime advocate for the preservation of low-income housing, including authoring two preservation laws for residential hotels."

They’re now part of our life narratives and world histories to look back to.God knows, we’ve tried, or probably we didn’t try harder, to solve some of our problems that came our way. We’ve tried to be upright and righteous, civil and civic-minded. We’ve tried to reach out to others, extending our acts of service, brotherhood and fraternity, charity, generosity and kindness, and love to all who believed in us and who reciprocated our love back in return. It seemed we didn’t do much or we’re inadequate to please everyone we came in contact with. That’s alright now. The past is the past, anyway.We have a new year 2023 (the year of the Chinese zodiac Water Rabbit to look forward to and, henceforth, we welcome it with excitement, hope and optimism.

minnpost_2022_96,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Winona, Minnesota is a college town. The educational landscape of our city has long been defined by the existence of three very different institutions: a public, regional university (Winona State University , a two-year technical and community college (Minnesota State College Southeast and a small, private, liberal-arts college on the hill (St. Mary’s University of Minnesota . These three institutions helped to shape Winona into a culturally vibrant hub for the arts. Without such a robust higher education presence, it is unlikely that Winona would be able to sustain its music, theatre and arts festivals including the Frozen River Film Festival, the Great River Shakespeare Festival, the Beethoven Festival, and the Midwest Music Fest.However, on May 11, St. Mary’s announced the closure of 11 academic programs and the layoff of more than a dozen faculty members. The list of closing programs at St. Mary’s rang like a death knell through the city of Winona and the halls of Winona State University. St. Mary’s is cutting nearly every department that contributes to Winona’s vibrant art scene (including Art, Music, Music Industry, and Theatre . They are also no longer supporting fields in the humanities (such as English, History, Spanish, and Theology that play a central role in a liberal arts education. St. Mary’s press release justifies cutting these programs by referring to declining enrollments and their decision to support a new program portfolio that “is concentrated in business, technology, and the sciences.” But it is difficult to square these stated priorities with their recent cuts to programs like Human Services, International Business, Scientific Computing and Actuarial Science.Especially odd, given the particular programs being cut, was the explanation given by St. Mary’s president, Father James Burns.“We are aligning the programs we offer with our mission as we answer the question: how can we best prepare our students for work, for a life of ethical service, to pursue the greater good and the truth in all things while answering their questions about meaning and purpose?,” said Burns. “The goal is for our graduates to excel in their early careers, become future leaders in their fields, and use their special gifts to impact humanity.”The rhetoric seemed out of step with a decision to eliminate the arts and humanities from the curriculum, transforming a liberal arts college into, what looks to an outsider, like a very expensive technical school.As members of the faculty at a public institution, we have long been subject to the political whims of state legislatures who aren’t always friendly to the arts and humanities. We too have heard administrators rely on the tired (and false trope that employers only want science and technology skills. But it is especially disturbing to see this same rhetoric being used at a private institution like St. Mary’s. With their independence from government, their financial endowments, beautiful campus spaces, and histories of support for arts and humanities programs, private schools like St. Mary’s always seemed immune to the idea that the sole purpose of the university is “workforce development.” They appeared to be (and presented themselves as a beacon for the real mission of liberal arts colleges: to educate the whole person and create citizens who are ethical, responsible, hard-working, and knowledgeable with a diverse, flexible set of skills. But if the onslaught against the liberal arts in higher education can happen here, it can happen anywhere.We invited the administration of St. Mary’s to a public forum so that they could answer questions from the community about the changes in their direction. They declined to participate, but more than 50 community members and alumni attended. We have learned since then that St. Mary’s is also planning on phasing out their minors in Entrepreneurship, Global Studies, Leadership, Physics, Political Science, Sociology and Statistics.Given the impact of St. Mary’s cuts, it is no surprise that alumni and community members have expressed outrage over social media and raised a number of very important questions. Is St. Mary’s considering any administrative cuts? Can the St. Mary’s administration provide evidence of the kind of financial exigency that would warrant the revocation of tenure or the closure of programs? Where was shared governance in this decision-making? How was the campus community involved in finding solutions for tough budgetary challenges? How exactly does eliminating training in art, music, poetry and prose, dance and theatre produce graduates who can “use their special gifts to impact humanity?” What does the administration of St. Mary’s think it means to impact humanity?We hope that the administration of St. Mary’s University of Minnesota will reflect on these questions and provide answers as they come available. But while they do so up on the hill, we in the valley will continue to grieve. We grieve for our colleagues at St. Mary’s who have lost careers. And we grieve for their institution, which seems to have lost its soul.Jenna Chernega, PhD, is the faculty association president at Winona State University and a professor of Sociology.Patrick Clipsham, PhD, is the faculty association vice president and president-elect at Winona State University and a professor of Philosophy."

In stark contrast, the current administration’s Justice Department is holding the insurrectionists accountable.While televised hearings by the congressional Jan. 6 Committee have galvanized public attention, it’s in the legal trenches that federal prosecutors have been building careful criminal cases. Tuesday, a jury found Oath Keepers head Stewart Rhodes and another top member of his organization guilty of the high crime of seditious conspiracy. (Three other Oath Keepers were acquitted on this highest charge but found guilty of other felonies. The U.S. Code defines that crime as when two or more people “conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof.”The description suits Jan. 6 plotters to a tee. Rhodes and his minions, outfitted in combat-type gear, stashed weapons at a Virginia hotel as part of a “Quick Reaction Force” they could activate if necessary on Jan. 6. Then they descended on the Capitol with the intention of intimidating the Congress.Quite properly, the charge of seditious conspiracy, which dates to federal attempts to quash Confederate rebels during the Civil War, should be wielded quite rarely.Puerto Rican nationalists were convicted in 1954. In 1995, Islamic militants including Omar Abdel-Rahman were found guilty for plotting to blow up NYC landmarks including the United Nations, a federal building, two tunnels and a bridge.The masterminds of the attack on the Capitol qualify.

minnpost_2022_79,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The U.S. Supreme Court’s June ruling on school vouchers,Carson v. Makin,is a step in the right direction and removes yet another possible hurdle to making vouchers legal in Minnesota. In that ruling, the Supreme Court said parents in Maine could not be denied the ability to partake in the state’s tuition assistance program if their children attend private schools.School vouchers come in different forms. The most common is the traditional voucher, which allows parents to use education funding to apply to private school tuition. There are also Education Savings Accounts (ESA , which set aside money that parents can then use to pay for their children to attend a private school. And finally, there are tax credit scholarships, which let corporations or individuals donate money otherwise earmarked for taxes to create scholarships at private schools.All three are very strong options to allow parents and their children to choose what school they want to attend regardless of whether it’s public or private.Abillin the Minnesota Legislature this past session would have established ESAs. I testified before the House Education Committee a few years ago in support ofabillthat would have created tax credit scholarships. Any form of voucher should be based on financial needs and represents an opportunity to expand choice when it comes to access to quality, results-driven education in Minnesota.Ascension Catholic School in north Minneapolis, where I am principal, has been part of the neighborhood since 1897.Since 2013, the vast majority of the school’s graduates have gone on to graduate from high school.No scholar is turned away from attending Ascension for financial reasons thanks to our generous supporters. However, the same is not necessarily true at all Catholic and other religious schools. Just think what a voucher program in Minnesota could do to enhance a family’s ability to have unrestricted choices for their children’s education.Vouchers, contrary to the opinions of those who oppose them, will not destroy public education. That’s evident in states where vouchers are already used.Anempirical studydone by the Friedman Foundation found vouchers created a win-win for public and private schools. A strong public school system is vital to society’s growth.Minnesota has a great opportunity to create an even stronger education system statewide with school vouchers. The U.S. Supreme Court has spoken loudly in support of vouchers. Let’s hope the Minnesota Legislature does the same during its next session and passes legislation to make some form of vouchers legal in Minnesota.Benito Matias is principal at Ascension Catholic School, which is one of four Minneapolis and St. Paul schools in Ascension Catholic Academy."
philinquirer_2022_16,"Democrats who try to give an edge to a more extreme opponent during primaries are betting on winning in the fall. They shouldn t count on it, given that this strategy often doesn t work.Last week in Michigan, incumbent RepublicanRep. Peter Meijer narrowly lost to his primary challenger, John Gibbs. The main point of contention between the two Republicans was support for former President Donald Trump; Gibbs had Trump’s enthusiastic backing, while Meijer was one of 10 Republicans who had voted to impeach the president after the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.In victory, the conservative challenger had an unlikely ally: the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The DCCC believed that a more extreme Republican nominee would give them a better chance of taking the seat, so while calling the challenger someone who wants to “peddle Trump’s Big Lie,” it also bankrolled him with a $435,000 ad campaign. This is, asMeijer noted in an opinionpiece publishedbefore the primary, far more support than the amount Meijer says Trump’s own super PAC gave Gibbs: a paltry $5,000.Why should Trump give more if the Democrats are willing to do his work for him?Only time will tell if the strategy pays off for Michigan Democrats. Either way, their victory in November is no slam dunk: Michigan’s 3rd Congressional Districthas not elected a Democrat since 1990. The election there in 2020 was closer than some, but even in that good year for Democrats, Meijer defeated Democrat Hillary Scholten by 6 percentage points. The district’s boundaries changed somewhat in redistricting, but the Cook Partisan Voting Index stillrates it as nearly evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.Now in 2022, as Scholten prepares for a second try at the seat, now against Gibbs, will she do any better? Maybe there are some voters who would have voted for one Republican but not the other. But in these hyperpartisan times, withPresident Joe Biden’s net approval rating 13points underwater in the state, it’s just as likely that Democrats are helping replace a moderate Republican with a more conservative one.Democrats who try to give an edge to a more extreme opponent during primaries are playing a risky game — and it could backfire on them. Including here in Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor, sohe decided to “help” Republicans pick his opponentwithan $840,000 ad purchase. Shapiro’s campaign characterized State Sen. Doug Mastriano as “one of Donald Trump’s strongest supporters” — although couched as a warning to voters, a link to Trump is not a negative in a Republican primary.Mastrianowon the GOP primary by a wide margin.» READ MORE:Josh Shapiro just made it clear which Republican he wants to run against in the Pa. governor’s raceAfter the primary,the Shapiro campaign sent out mailers, too, delivering the same fake-scary message. (Some of them appeared in my mailbox. And they displayed the same too-clever-by-half message:Oh, you wouldn’t like this guy, he’s way too conservative.Mastriano might have won anyway — he was on top in many polls andhad Trump’s (albeit last-minute endorsement, not to mention a sizable statewide following that grew from his Facebook live videos during the COVID-19 lockdowns. But Shapiro’s “warnings” surely helped consolidate the undecided conservatives around him.Shapiro and the Pennsylvania Democratic leadership got what they asked for. But will they get what they want?Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign team famously believed that Trump as an opponent offered them the best chance to win by focusing the campaign on their base with just a “dash of outreach” to centrist Republicans who feared a Trump presidency, according to Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, the authors of a2017 book on that campaign.We recall how that worked out.Republicans can be guilty of the same mistakes. I remember the 1999 Philadelphia mayoral primary, in which many Republicans hoped fervently that Democrats would nominate John Street — then seen as a polarizing figure — rather than one of his main opponents, John White and Marty Weinberg. The presumptive Republican nominee, Sam Katz, evenran ads against White and Weinberg.“Republicans can be guilty of the same mistakes.”Katz and the GOP got what they asked for — Street was nominated — but not what they wanted: The Democratic City Council president defeated the Republican businessman byjust over 7,000 votes.What Shapiro has done in Pennsylvania and what the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did in Michigan is particularly disingenuous given their rhetoric about what it would mean for the country if the Republicans they helped nominate would win their elections in November. If they truly believed that democratic government itself is at risk, why engage in tactical gamesmanship? Is this an existential crisis or not?Democrats are playing the same games in Maryland, where theDemocratic Governors Association spent nearly $2 millionin the Republican primary to help nominate the most right-wing candidate in the race: a man who was also involved in the Jan. 6 riot. Democrats did the same in Illinois,spending $30 million against a moderate Republican mayor from Aurorain the hopes of nominating his far more conservative opponent. In both cases, as in Pennsylvania and Michigan, the scheme worked.In the long term, this all calls the primary process itself into question. In the short term, it just shows us what a dangerous and disingenuous game Democrats are playing.Kyle Sammin is editor-at-large at Broad + Liberty."
minnpost_2022_106,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I am a very indecisive person. I remember as a college freshman everybody would ask, “So what is your major?” And I wouldn’t have anything to tell them except that I was currently undecided. I took intro to psychology, intro to peace studies, a theology class, and more. It wasn’t until I took intro to environmental studies that I felt an immediate connection. We discussed a variety of topics from renewable energy to plant-based diets to sustainable living and climate change. No matter what we were talking about, everything felt important to me. As I progressed in the major, I learned about environmental justice and its connection to racial, gender, and food justice. It was this interest in justice that led me to an internship at MN350, where I learned about the East Phillips neighborhood and their goal of creating an indoor urban farm.The East Phillips neighborhood is a very diverse place made up of a majority BIPOC population. The neighborhood is overburdened with pollution, and residents experience disproportionate rates of asthma and other health issues. East Phillips is resilient, and the neighborhood has a plan to turn the abandoned Roof Depot building into an indoor urban farm. The urban farm would bring many benefits to the community including an urban farm, farmer’s market, world café, affordable housing, a bike shop on the greenway, solar panels and more. The East Phillips Neighborhood Institute (EPNI has been fighting for eight years to make the vision of a community-owned indoor urban farm a reality, but the City of Minneapolis bought the Roof Depot building out from under the community and has plans to turn it into a service yard. The city’s project would increase pollution and arsenic contamination in East Phillips, an already overburdened area. This is environmental racism. EPNI’s plan, by contrast, would not only bring environmental justice to East Phillips, but racial, economic, and food justice as well.Addressing the climate crisis can seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be when you remember that we already have solutions for creating a sustainable climate future. The envisioned indoor urban farm in East Phillips is exactly what would belong in a just and sustainable future. It would provide access to local nutritious food, green transportation, clean energy, green jobs and community-ownership. This would increase social capital, wealth, equity and contribute to environmental, racial, economic and food justice.I am still an indecisive person, and with graduation this past spring came the other dreaded question, “So what are you doing after college?” Though I cannot give a precise answer, I do know that I will continue to learn and fight for environmental justice, to contribute to the sustainable world I want to see. I encourage you to take action today and support your fellow Minnesotans fighting for justice by donating to the East Phillips Neighborhood Institute. We can begin creating a just future today, starting in our own backyard.Megan Greenberg is a recent graduate with a degree in environmental studies. She is a volunteer for MN350."

In issuing its decision, CMS has the audacity to cite the Alzheimer’s Association 2021 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures report on the challenges and barriers underrepresented communities have in participating in clinical trials, and then turn around and propose to impose those very barriers.For decades, millions of Americans and their loved ones have waited for access to a new, more effective treatment as they have faced this relentless disease. They, including my family, deserve the same access to therapies given to those living with other conditions like cancer, heart disease and HIV/AIDS.

eugeneweekly_2022_53,"We ve got issues. We in Eugene are witnessing the slow murder of our daily newspaper. But maybe, just maybe, what’s rapidly becoming too thin to wrap fish and line the birdcage, can still be saved. When I moved here a dozen years ago to join the faculty at the University of Oregon,TheRegister-Guardwas a crucial member of the community. Owned by the very local Baker family, the paper was packed with local news reported by its hometown news staff. Its pages were a veritable art gallery, displaying vibrant images captured by its award-winning photojournalists. Its op-ed section came alive with the voices of my new neighbors. I periodically wrote op-eds for the paper, pleased with the opportunity to add my ideas to that very local chorus. When what’s now the Gannett Company — the corporate monster that owns more U.S. newspapers than any other — bought theRG, butchery began: de facto pink slips to venerable reporters and editors and photographers in the form of buyouts, and local news coverage replaced with outdated reporting from elsewhere via Gannett’s USA TODAY network. The latest blow is the paper’s announcement that it’s silencing the op-ed ensemble. Earlier this month, theRG’s then-editor Michelle Maxwell tried to find an ethical excuse for punching “delete” on readers’ opinions. “The time to edit and ensure accuracy and fairness before publishing opinion content is a time-consuming responsibility that this newsroom’s resources can no longer bear,” she complained. “And to publish the opinion page without that oversight would be irresponsible.” Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Days later she was out the door herself, along with, in just the last few months, hundreds of Gannett newsroom employees while, according to the industry trade magazineEditor & Publisher, Gannett’s CEO Mike Reed banks a $900,000 annual salary. What does that mean for us in Eugene? These headquarters slash-and-burn tactics translate to a thin rag staggering off presses and out of screens with a few of yesterday’s news stories wrapped with advertising. Gannett is in the extraction business, mining as much local wealth as it can with minimal investment. It wants no op-eds that might upset potential advertisers and interfere with its access to our local and its national advertising dollars. Public service is no longer on its corporate agenda. Before the RG lets out its last proverbial death rattle, there might be a fix that could serve both the corporate monster and our local public university. Gannett has sold a couple dozen of its newspapers back to local ownership. While Eugene is not a news desert, since both KLCC and theEugene Weeklyprovide local coverage, the lack of a rigorous daily newspaper is detrimental to our community. How about Gannett donates theRGto our local UO School of Journalism and Communication? The paper can operate in the teaching hospital model — a not-for-profit re-invented to serve the community as both an independent news source and an education laboratory. The paper draws on the resources of the UO student body and faculty, an experiment that gains support from the public and from the business community. This concept is not without precedent.The Oglethorpe (County Echo, operating near the University of Georgia in Athens, was recently donated to the university’s journalism school. Students now create the newspaper content. Subscriptions, advertising, and donations help pay the bills. A professor is managing editor. The award-winningColumbia Missourianstaff are University of Missouri journalism students. University of Kansas students staff theEudora Timesand Northeastern University creates a variation on the theme with Boston’sThe Scope. The time seems ripe — to use our Oregon cliché — to just do it, Gannett. Journalist Peter Laufer is the James Wallace chair professor of journalism at the University of Oregon."
suffolknewsherald_2022_169,"Published 5:45 pm Tuesday, February 15, 2022ByTracy AgnewIn late summer, 15 and a half years ago, I walked into theSuffolk News-Herald’s building on South Saratoga Street for a job interview. The editor at the time, Douglas Grant, took a leap of faith on a very recent Longwood University graduate with a small collection of clips from the college newspaper. He told me I needed to talk to the publisher before I was hired, and the publisher would ask two questions. The answer to one had to be yes, and the answer to the other had to be no.The two questions: “Can you type? And have you ever been convicted of a felony?”Needless to say, I managed to answer the questions correctly. I started in late August or early September, working an odd assortment of hours to add up to full-time while at the same time taking a heavy load of classes for my master’s degree at Old Dominion University, which I completed in three semesters. At first, I did only page layout for the paper. That only lasted about a week before I got my first story assignment — a report on the upcoming flu season.From there, the stories kept coming and never stopped. I did almost every sort of story imaginable and covered just about any topic of concern in Suffolk. But most of all, my job was about telling the stories of people. So many amazing people in Suffolk welcomed me into a slice of their life and shared their hearts, their dreams and their experiences with me. For that, I am eternally grateful.Way back in 2010, my editor at the time, Res Spears, had enough faith in me to promote me to news editor, which allowed me to continue writing stories while also learning about and contributing to newsroom management. His leadership had a profound effect on my professional and personal life, and for that, too, I am eternally grateful.When Res left in late 2017 to pursue a new career in the ministry, I was blessed to be promoted to editor of theSuffolk News-Herald. And in spring 2020, just as the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic had thrown us all into what came to be known as “unprecedented times,” I accepted a promotion to regional editor, which placed me in the editor’s chair not only for the Suffolk News-Herald but also forThe Smithfield Times,The Tidewater NewsandWindsor Weekly, building a regional reporting team from a handful of previously distinct newsrooms.Easily the best part of my journalism career was meeting my husband. Troy Cooper came to work at theSuffolk News-Heraldin late 2007 as our first full-time graphic designer, and by the end of May 2008, we were dating. It wasn’t long until we had fallen in love, and in February 2015, we had a beautiful wedding on a snowy Saturday, after which everyone else on our staff had to rush back to the office to finish Sunday’s paper.Indeed, it has been an incredible career in journalism for me. However, there comes a season for change in everyone’s life, and for me, that season is now. I am embarking on a new career as a copyeditor for a marketing agency, and this week will be my last with the paper.If I filled this entire edition, I could never adequately thank the thousands and thousands of people who helped me in some way throughout the course of my career. As such, I will make no attempt to even begin such a list. Some of them picked up the phone when I called hundreds of times in the last 15 years. Some I met only in a brief moment, when I took their photo or got a quote from them about an event I was covering, and that was that. However, every single person I met during this career, and the city in which we all live, has come to be a treasure in my heart.There’s also no way to adequately encompass every memory, every emotion and every moment that has defined the last 15.5 years for me in this short space, so I’ll not try to do that, either. I am filled with lots of different emotions during this season of my life, but gratefulness tops them all. I am extraordinarily grateful to have had the opportunity to learn so much, meet so many amazing people, and stay consistently employed in a difficult industry for so long. So I will leave on this simple note:Thank you.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_22,"Nuclear fusion, the combining of the tiniest element, hydrogen atoms, to produce tremendous amounts of clean energy, isn’t far fetched. The sun (like all stars has been doing it for a few billion years and humans have achieved fusion reactions for several decades, known as H bombs. The trick is to use fusion to generate power without destroying the building housing the machinery and city it’s sitting in.The failed “cold fusion” episode from 1989 was junk science, but the rigorously peer-reviewed work of researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory shows that they produced about 3 megajoules of energy by bombarding a hydrogen pellet with just over 2 megajoules of energy, in the form of 192 laser beams, a net gain.There remain endless challenges of replicating this controlled experiment on a larger scale, much less plugging it into the electric grid. Still, scientists see the breakthrough as potentially unlocking a future of clean, plentiful energy, exactly what is needed when greenhouse gas emissions are heating the planet.Fission energy, the less potent and dirtier cousin of fusion, is already a reliable zero-emissions power source.Sadly, America and New York have turned away from it even as we’ve set ambitious emissions reduction targets that call for electrifying everything under the sun. The shortsighted decommissioning of Indian Point, which just a few years ago provided 25% of New York City’s power without emitting any carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, continues apace.Fission has sizable downsides, including radioactive waste no one wants to shoulder. Fusion, if it works, is far cleaner — and orders of magnitude more powerful.In the middle of last century, the chair of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission said “our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter,” which even then many knew was a laughably pollyannish promise. While we’d be naive today to predict those who, science willing, develop fusion power won’t charge plenty for it, here’s hoping brilliant minds can find a way to produce it.

suffolknewsherald_2022_240,"Published 4:33 pm Tuesday, October 18, 2022ByStaff ReportsBY CHARLES QUALLSThink back over your life for a moment. Have you ever had a neighbor you liked so much that you didn’t want to disappoint them? Stories of the troublesome neighbor are all too easy to come by. It’s tough sometimes to share a property border with someone else, especially if they don’t share your same values. Or if they don’t care about anyone other than themselves.Phil was a different sort of dude. He and his wife were our backyard neighbors in another city. The neighborhood was full of rumors that Phil stayed about half-lit all the time. Turns out, it wasn’t just rumor.I’m not going to kid you. We did encounter Phil a time or so and could tell that he was working on a good buzz. Here’s the thing though: he never caused us any trouble. Not one bit that I can recall.He was an extremely nice guy. We learned over time that he would offer to help you with anything you could need help with. We even learned that Phil was so handy, I’m pretty sure there was nothing around the house he didn’t know how to do.If they had stayed long, I would’ve done just about anything in the world for them. They were likable. But one day, he and his wife listed their house for sale. It sold quickly and some noisy college girls moved in.They partied like young girls who had a wealthy suburban Dad who bought them a house in the city and turned them loose. One particularly troublesome night, I remarked to my wife, “I sure do miss Phil and his wife. He stayed drunk, but they were great neighbors!”So, I want you to get in your mind the person you have loved as much as you do yourself. The truth about being faithful to God is that it’s all about caring for someone other than yourself. If that’s a problem for you or me, we’re really going to struggle with everything that comes next.Our scripture this week was from Exodus 20. The much revered Ten Commandments are found there. Amy Erickson in her writing notices that these beloved Ten Commandments are framed like this. God begins by saying, “I am Yahweh your god…” and ends by talking about, “…your neighbor”That is, God starts by telling us to worship, remember and to revere God. Then ends by telling us to respect and care for our neighbor. If you don’t remember anything else I say here, then please just take with you this one thing. When the driving force in my life or yours is our inner voice that screams “I want…!,” then the driving force in our lives is not God. It’s us.God said to us, “I am the Lord your God.” That’s the truth about being faithful. This will probably be engraved as the epitaph on my tombstone one day because I’ve said it a million times. “The best news is that God is God, and you’re not. Which means you don’t have to be.”We live in a world where millions of people profess a loyalty and a love for the Ten Commandments. But I’m not sure a whole lot of them have actually read them lately. I’m glad that morals or ethics are important to believers. They should be.But wielding God’s words against other people wasn’t the central intent behind the Ten Commandments. Faithfulness was. God wanted us to be faithful.Let me ask you this. In your company, your family or in your community, who stands out as being faithful? I mean, you know who is faithful and who isn’t. In a healthy relationship, the parties are faithful. They care about and give for each other. In an unhealthy relationship, they aren’t. God wanted, and still does, for us to live, love and serve in faithful ways.A truth about faithfulness just might be this. That in God’s commandments, the thing we learn the most about is God. They tell us what’s important to God. They show us the heart of God. Their goal is to help us be faithful.God knows when we are faithful, because it shows. Not that we live out our beliefs for show. It just does show when we do. Or, when we don’t. Another truth is that others know when we are faithful, too. Because like the neighbors, they are on the receiving end of whatever we do. Faithful or not.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

minnpost_2022_55,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Concerned aboutpotential problems during the next election when Congress counts presidential votes, somelegislators areinterested in reforming the federal law that governs that process: the Electoral Count Act.Reforming the act, which sets the procedures for how votes for president are counted in the Electoral College, means identifying what it’s supposed to do, the areas that need reform and any other problems with it.As a scholar of election law, I recognize that presidential elections in the United States are complicated.Voters do not directly elect the president. After Election Day, and based on the popular vote, each state chooses presidential electors who formally meet and cast votes for president that are then relayed to Congress.There are 538 electoral votes, and after Congress counts them and verifies that one candidate has received a majority — at least 270 — the winner of the presidential election is declared.In theory, a rule about how to count votes seems easy enough. But it’s hardly been easy.DuringReconstruction, the period after the Civil War, Congress faced contentious questions over whether Southern states appropriately appointed presidential electors. At other times, two sets of competing electors for different candidates were sent to Congress.The Electoral Count Act wasenacted in 1887to streamline rules after thedisputed presidential election of 1876.But in recent years, the act has revealed some weaknesses.The act allowsmembers of Congressto object to counting votes from a state. They can do that if one member of the House and one U.S. senator write an objection. The Electoral Count Act does not list what kind of objections are proper, leaving it to Congress to decide if objections are appropriate or not. If this kind of dispute arises, Congress can debate what to do with the electoral votes.The objection mechanism was used just once in the first 100 years of the act.Butin 2005, members of Congress objected to counting Ohio’s electoral votes cast for George W. Bush, alleging the results were inaccurate because of voter suppression and faulty voting machines. Congress spent two hours debating whether to count the votes. Other members of Congress unsuccessfully attempted to object in2001and2017to other states’ electoral votes — no senator joined those objections. In2021, members of Congress again objected to counting Arizona’s and Pennsylvania’s electoral votes for Joe Biden, alleging a variety of claims, including fraud, which forced Congress to spend more time in debate.These objections have undermined confidence in the outcome of presidential elections. Members of Congresspublicly aired baseless claims that the election results were in doubt.There was no serious reasonfor Congress to doubtthe outcome of the 2020 election.One reform might simply increase the threshold required to file an objection, from one member of each chamber to, say, one-fifth or one-third of the members. That would speed up counting and reduce opportunities for members of Congress to take grievances to the floor.Another problem that has emerged relates to the vice president’s role in counting electoral votes.An impetus for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was a mistaken belief that Vice President Mike Pence could ignore the Electoral Count Act andunilaterally refuseto count electoral votes from some states or indefinitely delay counting.The Constitution mandatesthat the president of the Senate — typically the vice president — open the certificates of electoral votes from each state. In addition, under the current Electoral Count Act, the president of the Senate presides over the meeting, calls for objections and generally moves the process along.Pence did so,despite intense pressure from President Donald Trump to reject the Electoral College votesthat would formally make Democratic candidate Joe Biden president.But there areworries among some members of Congress that another vice president might be tempted to assert power that does not exist. A vice president might create chaos by claiming that some votes should not count, or telling Congress what it can or cannot do, setting off a fierce debate in the middle of the count.So another reform to the act might make it clear that the vice president has no role over the meeting except ministerial acts like opening the envelopes from presidential electors. That clarity reduces opportunities for mischief in the future.These two concerns reflect the narrow role of Congress in counting votes and the mechanics of that meeting.There are more ambitious changes to federal law that Congress might examine, but these also raise thorny problems.For instance, some Republican state legislators in 2020 — encouraged by Trump — suggested they couldappoint their own electors well after Election Dayif they were dissatisfied with the results certified by the state’s election officials.Some cited a provision in federal law that if the state “failed to make a choice” for choosing presidential electors on Election Day, the state legislature could appoint them later. But this provision was designed for states that required majority winners in presidential elections and might hold a runoff after Election Day if no candidate received a majority.Congress could repeal this “failed to make a choice” provision and insist that Election Day is Election Day, with no opportunity under the statute to second-guess the results. But there are complications that arise with even a simple reform like this.A state might suffer aterrorist attackon Election Day or be hit by a hurricane the night before. Should the state have a chance to hold its election a week or two later? And if so, how does Congress define the circumstances when a state could hold a later election?But that can invite additional questions.Elections are run by states, and states already have extensive procedures in the canvass,recountand audit of their votes.When and how should federal courts get involved? It’s not clear that courts could do anything differently — or, more importantly, better — than they already do. And it may invite every presidential election — close or not — to end up in federal court, inviting a dozenBush v. Goreseach election.One benefit of Electoral Count Act reform is that it lends itself toward bipartisanship. No one knows what future presidential elections will bring. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have both expressed disapproval of some states’ presidential election outcomes over the last 25 years, and it’s not clear who will be disappointed next.Congress cannot prevent all mischief, but it can reduce the possibility of mischief in the future. Congress can address some of the easier questions, like the threshold for objections and the role of the vice president. It can also have serious conversations about some of the more controversial questions. It can determine if an amended law can make things better — or just invite more complexity and controversy.Derek T.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_75,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°There is a long tradition of authoritarian states using soccer’s World Cup to distract attention — domestic and foreign alike — from their tyranny. The Islamic Republic milked buckets of self-serving propaganda out of the national team’s participation in the quadrennial competition, never more than in 1998 when Iran beat the “Great Satan” in Lyon, France.Iranians, like much of the rest of the world, are soccer mad; the country comes to a halt when Team Melli, as the national squad is known, plays in the World Cup. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself stayed up late to watch the famous win in Lyon. When the team returned home, he reportedly invited Hamid Estili, who scored the first of two goals against the U.S., to his residence and kissed him on the forehead.The regime played up the win as a symbol of its resistance against American perfidy and the wild celebrations across Iran as proof that the nation was united, not just behind Team Melli but also the government.That won’t work this time, no matter how the Iranian team fares against the U.S. when they clash in Doha next Tuesday.For one thing, the streets are now a stage for protest, not celebration. For another, Team Melli isn’t playing along with the propaganda this time. Any hope the regime in Tehran may have harbored of using the World Cup to distract attention from its brutal attempts to put down a sustained protest movement were dashed when Iran’s players refused to sing the national anthem before their opening game against England, the theocrats’ second-choice Western bugaboo.Afterward, soccer captain Ehsan Hajsafi was blunt: “We have to accept the conditions in our country are not right and our people are not happy,” he said. “We are here but it does not mean we should not be their voice or we should not respect them.”Team Melli’s defiance is doubly remarkable because officials had warned the players not to express solidarity with the protests. Khamenei himself had admonished them not to “disrespect” the country. Ahead of the tournament, the team met with President Ebrahim Raisi and gave him the No. 12 jersey.This had earned them the scorn of the protesters, some of whom took to calling them “Team Mullah” in street chants and on social media. Some Iranian fans at the stadium in Doha were heard to shout “Shameless! Shameless!” at the players.Since Iranian state TV didn’t show the team’s mute protest, their solidarity with the protesters didn’t immediately register back home.After the game, videos posted on social media platforms showed some Iranians celebrating the national team’s defeat by honking car horns. In one especially remarkable video, a couple is seen waving the Union Jack.Has Team Melli redeemed itself in the eyes of the protesters by refusing to sing the anthem?The behavior of the players and the fans before their next game, against Wales on Friday, will be instructive.Meanwhile, you can bet that Iranian officials will be putting enormous pressure on players to sing lustily before their game against the Americans — if nothing else, then to push the narrative that Iranians hate the U.S. more than they despise their own rulers.

leoweekly_2022_57,"Editor s Note: On Thursday, Kentucky s medical marijuana bill passed in the House. It now heads before the Senate. PTSD is no longer a covered illness under the bill.It doesn’t take a policy wonk or even a jaded journalist to understand that the Republican supermajority that holds all of the cards in the Kentucky legislature is intent on playing their heavy hand toward regressive, grandstanding bills to attack issues like LGBTQ rights, abortion and schools.The old-school Republican hardliners and the new-age terrifying fringe right-wingers are, like always, looking to tear down existing structures — and make up problems where there aren’t any — just to enhance their tactics of fear, appease their base, then rinse and repeat.The one surprising outcome from this year’s session so far is that a real, yet narrow, path has seemed to emerge for medical marijuana, although not exactly a super progressive one.Rep. Jason Nemes, a Republican from Louisville, who has been championing Kentucky medical marijuana legislation for the past few years, recently achieved his biggest breakthrough yet —support from a powerful Senator who once opposed his bill.For the 2022 General Assembly, Nemes filedHouse Bill 136, a restrictive, 138-page piece of legislation that would allow medical marijuana only for certain conditions, including cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, nausea or vomiting and post traumatic stress disorder.He introduced a similar bill during the 2020 session. It passed the House, but was never considered in the Senate, with several members of the chamber’s leadership skeptical of it.Sen. Whitney Westerfield, a Republican from Hopkinsville, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was against Nemes’ medical marijuana bill that year — during the 2020 session, Westerfield told the Courier Journal, “I know it won’t get a hearing until I’m OK with it, and for sure I’ve still got questions right now.”Last week, Westerfield tweeted out a statement saying that he will now support this year’s HB136, after several conversations with Nemes.“I continue to have concerns about the risk of increased access to marijuana, particularly among youth and young adults for whom it remains a recreational and gateway drug,” Westerfield wrote. “However, I’ve heard too many stories, in my district and out, from those long suffering and their loved ones left behind, that marijuana brought comfort and relief when nothing else worked.”Nemes told LEO that during the last year and a half, he and Westerfield have met several times — including every other week this past summer — to read the bill together, address concerns and do research.“He decided, after a lot of study and meeting with his constituents and reading the bill, literally line by line with me, he supports the bill and that’s a massively important development for the bill’s chances to pass the Senate,” Nemes said.As I type this, the bill is still sitting in the House, where it is expected to pass, but the Senate will be the challenge. And it’s borderline laughable that this is so heavily contested, with 37 states currently providing some form of medical marijuana access, while 18 also allow legal access to recreational. There are other,much better — and profitable — billssurrounding marijuana sitting in the General Assembly, but they are sponsored by Democrats, meaning they probably don’t have a shot in hell. House Bill 136 wouldn’t end all of Kentucky’s issues surrounding marijuana — most pressingly that people continue to get arrested and sit in jail for the same drug that is legally dispensed for fun one state over. Moving forward, we could also use the tax money from complete legalization. But, for now, HB 136, is probably Kentucky’s best chance for people in pain to have a safe and effective avenue to something they need.As Nemes told LEO: “I’ve said a number of times, if my child’s doctor said that medical marijuana would be helpful to them, I know what my wife and I would do: We would do what thousands of Kentuckians are already doing. And that is break the law.”. ( ."

suffolknewsherald_2022_48,"Published 6:09 pm Tuesday, June 28, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Stephen D. HanerGuest columnistVirginia’s auto industry overlords in California have a new set of proposed mandates for both electric and internal combustion vehicles that, once adopted, will automatically apply here in the commonwealth.They do not advance the date for banning the sale of new gasoline and diesel vehicles earlier than 2035 but do increase the incremental targets for percentage of EV sales in earlier years.The California Air Resources Board regulatory process is well advanced, with a revised draft coming out soon, setting up a second round of comments and a final hearing in August. Virginia’s dying news media cannot cover this state anymore, so don’t expect coverage of actions in Sacramento. And, of course, the corporate media is now dominated by editors, writers and owners committed to the war on fossil fuels.Adding to that, Virginia’s auto dealers themselves (big advertisers and campaign donors played a huge role in supporting the decision by former Gov. Ralph Northam and the then-majority Democrats in the legislature to pass the 2021 bill putting Virginia under California’s control. A 2022 bill to reverse that passed the House with its new Republican majority, but it failed on a party-line vote in a Senate committee controlled by Democrats.A recent CARB PowerPoint slide deck on the proposal includes one showing all the states that have decided to follow California’s rather than federal vehicle regulations, and claims they account for 40% of all U.S. vehicle sales. Starting with the 2026 model year, 35% of all new vehicle sales would have to be zero-emission vehicles in Virginia, not the previous target of 26% under the current regulation.Given the price differentials and the investment it is making in EV conversion, the auto industry is probably ecstatic. The CARB claims that 300-mile range battery vehicles will achieve cost parity with the older technology by 2033, and offers illustrations of lower lifetime costs, but the initial sticker prices are likely to remain high and the industry really wants to sell the larger cars, SUVs and light trucks, too. See what the Ford F-150 version costs.If you have any skin in this game, the slide deck and an accompanying description of all the related regulatory proposals are important to review. The depth and breadth of the proposal is impressive. Responding to known elements of consumer resistance to EVs, the rules dive into charging technology, battery life and labeling, and maintenance and warranty requirements.One goal is to maintain 75%-80% of the initial range of the vehicles for their whole useful life, an admission, apparently, that many of the vehicles now being sold lose substantial range over time. That doesn’t happen to a well-maintained internal combustion engine.Plug-in hybrids will have to go at least 50 miles on a charge (they don’t now? . And, recognizing that internal combustion vehicles will remain on the road for decades, California will impose new fleet standards on them and seek to reduce aggressive driving and cold starts, impose new design standards to prevent evaporation of fuel, and in general remake the industry to its liking.Starting in 2025, the fleet fuel economy requirements will be calculated with EV’s removed from the equation, and they are totally disregarded from the calculation after 2029. That will force changes with the internal combustion vehicles still being sold.Even the towing industry is in for some changes.The claim is that adopting this will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2040, which is conceivable only if the claim applies solely to motor vehicle emissions. The slide also shows vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG emissions going down about 20% in that period if these regulations are not imposed. The regulations have even less impact on vehicle nitrous oxide (NOx emissions, also dropping on their own.California claims the savings to the state and consumers exceed the cost without considering “health benefits or the social cost of carbon.” The health benefits are always exaggerated, if not imagined, and the social cost of carbon is definitely a made-up number.There is an environmental justice component, “to reward direct automaker action.” Plans include discounted EVs for community programs, lower retail prices and more used EVs being directed to participating dealerships. Whether those elements of California’s plan will also apply in Virginia is not clear. If they are tied into the carrot and stick methods California uses to manage dealer and automaker behavior, it is likely they will.The 2021 General Assembly majority completely surrendered (some might suspect sold the sovereignty of their constituents. If they didn’t anticipate California was just getting started and would double down, they should have.Bowing under federal regulations is one thing, as Virginians get to vote for members of Congress and the president.

minnpost_2022_147,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When President Biden met with troops in Poland on March 25, he called Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal,” a term he has used since to describe the Ukraine invading president. But what, exactly, is a war criminal? And does the definition fit Putin?War crimes were defined in the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Hague and Geneva Conventions and at the Nuremberg Trials after World War II that adjudicated the worst of the Nazi perpetrators.In 1998 the Rome Statute was ratified, the legal basis of the International Criminal Court. Article 8 updates the definition of war crimes, which are actions that can occur during either international armed conflict, such as in Ukraine, or in an armed conflict not of an international nature, such as Darfur.Defining war crimesThe definition is a litany of the most heinous violations perpetrated on innocent human beings. It includes intentionally directing attacks on civilians, like Putin’s attacks on children, attacks on hospitals and humanitarian providers, like Putin’s attacks on maternity hospitals, bombarding towns, villages and buildings that are not military objectives, like Putin’s wanton destruction of thousands of homes in Kyiv and Mariupol and intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, and historic monuments, like the destruction of Kyiv’s Freedom Square.War crimes also include using weapons that are outlawed because of their inhumane effects on victims – like Putin’s use of thermobaric bombs.These crimes are occurring in Ukraine every day, every hour, every minute under Vladimir Putin’s leadership.Putin is a war criminal.His crimes violate our most deeply-held need to believe in a moral universe.His unprovoked attack on Ukraine has forced 4 million people, nearly all of them women and children, to abandon their homeland and to flee, with nothing for safety in a strange country. Husbands, fathers, brothers and sons remain behind to fight – along with the elderly, who are too old and too frightened to run and the ill, who cannot leave. Another 6.5 million people are displaced from their homes but remain within the borders of Ukraine.Putin has destroyed everything. There is no medicine, no food, no water, no sanitation. Soon massive starvation and a public health catastrophe will claim yet more lives of those still in Ukraine.A Ukrainian friend of mine in the United States said, “What if they bomb the cemetery where my parents are buried?”No one is safe. Not even the dead.What happens to war criminals after a war?Prosecuting war criminalsSome war criminals found guilty at Nuremberg were hanged. Since then, international tribunals have abolished the death penalty. Convicted war criminals from former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Congo, Cambodia, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, Syria and other places spend between 15-30 years in prison. There is no statute of limitations on war crimes, and perpetrators can be arrested and prosecuted in international or domestic courts long after committing the offenses.Investigating war crimesWar crimes are happening in many places. International laws hold war criminals to account and provide some deterrence, retribution and dignity and honor for millions of victims and victim-survivors of these atrocities. There cannot be lasting peace without justice.Current investigations include the following:Ethiopia: Fatou Bensouda, former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, is leading the UN International Commission of Inquiry into Ethiopia. The war that began in November 2020 led to a UN report of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity.Syria: The UN established the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic in 2011 to investigate alleged violations of international human rights law, particularly war crimes. The goal is to identify those responsible and to bring perpetrators to account.Afghanistan: The International Criminal Court officially opened an investigation on March 5 into war crimes in Afghanistan carried out by the Taliban and Islamic State – Khorasan (IS-K since 2002.Georgia and Ukraine: On March 10 the International Criminal Court announced applications for arrest warrants of three people for war crimes in connection with Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008. And the investigation into Russia’s crimes perpetrated in Ukraine since 2013 is underway now.Taking actionAs Cicero wrote, “Money provides the sinews of war.” Without it, weapons can’t be made, soldiers can’t be fed, bombs can’t be dropped. In addition to extreme federal financial sanctions on Russia, U.S. states, cities, colleges and organizations are now divesting their funds from companies complicit with the invasion in Ukraine, an action with precedent in divestment from Sudan and Iran.But as important as divestment is, the corollary is equally as important:investment. Minnesota State Sen. Sandy Pappas (DFL-St. Paul introduced SF 4373, Sen. Kari Dziedzic (DFL-Minneapolis introduced SF 4368, and State Rep. Sydney Jordan (DFL-Minneapolis has a companion bill in the House to provide $10 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine. In light of the state budget surplus of $9.3 billion, this is a small gesture: 0.1 percent of that surplus.Pappas said, “We can show Ukrainians that we see you, we care, and we are with you in your struggle for independence and democracy.” Support Minnesotans’ aid to Ukraine and Ukrainians – now.Ellen J.

Then, the sun garnished with another halo of light. It is hard toappreciate it; almost hard to see it.A mind conditioned for yet more bad news about this wiliest of invisible viruses has to make a leap to admit the good. I’ve felt like I’m standing on a waterbed, floating on an ocean, with a rip current adding to the slightly nauseating sensation of uncertainty.Observing that this new addition to the invisible microscopic world doesn’t justattack the lungs — it attacks the essence of people-dom. Honing in on our creativekingdoms of theater, singing, dancing, athletics, restaurants and taprooms.

eugeneweekly_2022_12,"We ve got issues. Some years ago a friend said to me, “Remember, everyone’s heart is broken.” A so-called “age of grief” didn’t set in yesterday, or with the pandemic. As Freud noted inCivilization and its Discontents, a fundamental disquiet or sadness is a function of civilization itself, because domestication is not a natural human condition. This seems to worsen as late-stage civilization goes on; probably why German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk called modernity “a leap into the monstrous.” But this generalized trauma and loss pale in comparison, I would say, with specific personal loss, which is acute and particular. In hisMourning and Melancholia, Freud pondered the depth of personal bereavement. He wondered why “each single one of the memories and hopes” that is connected to the lost loved one “should be so extraordinarily painful.” This past March, the American Psychiatric Association declared prolonged grief a mental health disorder. The implication would seem to be “just get over it.” A misguided and misinformed response to Rebecca Cadenhead’sHarvard Magazinequery, “I have been wondering what I’m supposed to do with all my grief.” In Megan Devine’s eloquent assessment, “the way we deal with grief in our culture is broken… We see it as something to overcome, something to fix, rather than something to tend or support,” she writes in her bookIt’s OK That You’re Not OK: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn’t Understand. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Michael Cholbi may be helpful, with his “There is Consolation in a Philosophical Approach to Grief,” published inAeon, July 22, 2022. He discusses grief as a way to understand loss, asserting that “not experiencing grief at all would be worse than experiencing grief.” In this stricken world, Max Horkheimer wrote, we become “more innocent” through grief. We apprehend a reality deeper than the everyday realm of the commonplace, the symbolic. InEarth Emotions, Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht sees the environmental crisis as an opportunity to foster new feelings in place of all-too-prevalent depression. Equally grounded is Darcia Narvaez’s short filmBreaking the Cycle, which draws upon our thousands of generations living in face-to-face band societies, before domestication. She refers to our heritage of cooperative community, compared to today’s dominant outlook of competitive detachment. A transition is clearly needed, for ours is a time not only of post-traumatic stress disorder but of ongoing stress disorder. In the words of Ward Churchill, “We can’t achieve the healing until we stop the wounding.” To me the silver lining, the grounds for hope, is that people are realizing that the system we live within — a global civilization — is broken. When we see how much is needed, each of us may wonder what we can do. But this awareness can be liberatory. Each one of us has a contribution to make. I see people coming together, seeking to find healing ways forward. We need to renew the face-to-face, and draw on Indigenous knowledge and life-ways, past and present. Events, gatherings, conversations, creative expressions emerge; an encouraging energy."
suffolknewsherald_2022_128,"Published 6:47 pm Tuesday, March 29, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Julia Cozen HammondAccording to Virginia’s constitution, lawmakers have 60 days to finish business. However, earlier this month, the legislature gaveled out before passing a budget and failing to address key issues concerning one of the most vulnerable sectors in Virginia’s economy: small business.Here’s what Virginia’s hard-working and job-creating entrepreneurs need once legislators finally get back to business: Make sure small-business owners have the resources they need to move Virginia’s economy forward during the recovery.At the beginning of session, NFIB, or the National Federation of Independent Business, launched a statewide campaign highlighting the challenges facing Virginia small businesses. There have been successes: Virginia’s Worker Safety board removed unnecessary COVID-19 worker restrictions, and bipartisan legislation preventing small-business owners from a costly and time-consuming government mandated program, allowing employers to voluntarily purchase private insurance family leave plans. The third victory, HB 971, conforms Virginia’s tax code to the federal American Rescue Plan Act, allowing hard-hit business owners who took out Paycheck Protection Program loans to deduct their expenses.However, there’s plenty left on the table.As the most recent NFIB data shows, most small-business owners reported their local economy remains below pre-crisis levels of economic activity. Another 39% don’t expect conditions to fully improve until 2023 or later.That’s why it’s so important for Virginia legislators to provide additional tax relief to help small businesses recover faster, keep and hire employees, and bolster their communities. Most Virginia small businesses file individually. This priority would increase the state deduction rate of $9,000 per couple to the federal rate of $25,000. Virginia is late to the game on this issue: most other states have already passed this common-sense legislation.Small businesses are also concerned about Virginia’s increased fuel tax; most are heavily reliant upon gas to deliver goods and get to places to perform services. It’s another punch in the gut: According to the latest NFIB Small Business Optimism Index, 26% of small-business owners nationwide said inflation is the single most important problem in operating their business, the highest since 1981.Earlier this session, the governor pushed to suspend that increased rate for one year. Lawmakers need to do the same.Lastly, small business needs unemployment insurance reform. If lawmakers don’t act now, Virginia entrepreneurs could face another hit in the form of higher payroll taxes. It’s simple: Replenish the unemployment trust fund with unused federal relief money to shield small businesses from significant payroll tax increases.There’s no question Virginia has the capacity to do it using some of the $4.3 billion in federal government money. Again, many other states have taken this sensible step to protect our mom-and-pop businesses from closing. Why hasn’t Virginia done the same?Here’s the takeaway: Main Street businesses are suffering. While lawmakers have taken some steps to provide relief, there’s other simple, no-brainer bills to pass when they get back to Richmond next month that will not only save your favorite small business from going under, but bolster the entire state’s economy.Julia Cozen Hammond is the state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, with more than 8,000 members across Virginia.

leoweekly_2022_41,"I’ve neverbeen to the Derby. I went to the track once a decade ago, but only as part of an elaborate, extended mating ritual. It served its purpose: I eventually married and sired offspring with my date. But I don’t think I’ll ever go again.A couple of years before my successful bid to find a breeding partner, a filly namedEight Belleswas euthanized just after finishing second in the Derby. Generations of Mendelian tinkering had made her leg bones so thin that they snapped an eighth of a mile from the finish line. She couldn’t be moved from where she fell. Horse ambulances and horse trailers pulled up so horse doctors could administer horse poison. No longer visible to the barrels of higher primates stumbling to ticket windows and limousines, the great black beast heaved, sighed and finally expired right there on the track.Eight Belles was mourned more bitterly and more extravagantly than most humans. Her trainer said in a documentary that he believed “the good Lord has a plan for all things,” but he couldn’t understand this one, and that the filly’s death left him with a “hole in his heart.”An Oaks Day raceis named after her. There is a sleek Gallopalooza statue of her in her idealized form, mercury mane in a headwind, ebony legs perfectly intact. She is conspicuously buried at the Kentucky Derby Museum.We are approaching 14 Derbys from the death of Eight Belles, and the horse racing industry continues without apparent revision or shame.Hundreds of thoroughbreds still suffer injuries on tracksevery year. Most of them have to be killed right then and there because their legs are like toothpicks propping up a deluxe Christmas ham. Once those legs break, they’ll get broken again and again every time they are used. The vast majority of those horses don’t end up in museums, and a number of those who survive their racing days end up as food; thousands per year are sold for slaughter.On the whole, though, racehorses have it far better than most domesticated creatures. Millions of unwanted baby chickens are fed alive into meat grinders just after birth. Factory-farmed birds who manage to make it to adulthood are too grotesquely large to move; they can only sit and wait to be mashed into sandwiches. Pigs, who are much smarter than dogs and cats, have their tails, testicles, teeth and other stray parts removed so they can be crammed into closer quarters. Cows frantically search for their babies, bellowing in grief long after calves have been converted into veal.Sorry to be such a downer. You see why I can’t go to the Derby. This time of year makes me into the quintessential killjoy, a role I relish, loathe and relish loathing. Listen: Eat what you want, I’m not here to judge. I, too, enjoy the occasional fried flesh nugget because I am a product of a culture that has convinced itself it is entitled to take every liberty with every non-human entity on the planet. But some moral bargains must be struck, and I’m just not sure that two minutes of watching beautiful, confused hulks get whipped to run in a circle as fast as they can is worth the price. We can still dress up in pastels and collapse under the weight of our enormous hats and drink cocktails with leaves hanging out of them. We can still dump megatons of munitions into the Ohio River and pretend like warplanes are attacking us. We can still roll in the mud and fight with broken whiskey bottles and drench each other in vomit and copulate in the infield. We can do all this without creating 20,000 new lives each year for us to exploit and discard.In this pre-civil war era, most readers will recognize the gravity of dehumanizing language. History shows that comparing groups of people to rats or cockroaches is the precursor to some Very Bad Shit. When a former presidentreferred to some immigrants as “animals,”pundits rightly sat up and took notice. “It took an animal,” explained the former press secretary, “to stab a man a hundred times and decapitate him and rip his heart out,” so chill out liberal media, these are real animals we’re talking about. The implication is that once something is less than human, we have license to treat it however we might like: We may kill it for the sake of convenience, we may dismember it just for fun, we may cage it, burn it, stomp on it, eat it, whatever.It is, therefore, a mortal sin to downgrade the biological status of any human being. But I wonder if it might be worth examining the other side of the equation, too, viz. Can’t we think a little kindlier of all the creeping things that creepeth upon the earth? Horses, for example,can read facial expressionsand other emotional cues.They nuzzle and protect their young, andthey mourn lost companions. They will not stab you a hundred times, or decapitate you, or rip your heart out, or murder your family with machetes, or bomb your hospitals, or put you in death camps. No animal is capable of such atrocities (with one notable exception . Perhaps we owe them more dignity than making them run for our drunken pleasure until their limbs snap in half.That Gandhi quote, the one about judging a society by how it treats its animals? It’s bullshit. Gandhi never said it. No one takes it seriously, so I suppose it doesn’t matter. But I suspect there is an as-yet-unknown cost for the millennia of harsh dominion we’ve exercised over the beasts of the sea, air and land, the methodical mutilation of flora and fauna, the bleaching of all the green things, the demolition of entire ecosystems and the top-speed ruining of muscular marvels just for the hell of it. Our species has long bet that we are entitled to an unlimited number of such abuses, and that we would never have to pay for any of them.

This is a recipe for car crashes.Happily, there was mass civil disobedience at the prime viewing area (which is just a little past the Maunakea Access Road on Tuesday night, because hundreds of cars decided to be safe and pulled completely off the roadway to see the stunning sight, which is possible in this area.If safety is the concern, then rescind that order, and let people view the lava. You can create more safety by greatly lowering the speed limit in the viewing area at night.If the lava crosses the highway, the county plans to block the road to eliminate all eruption-viewing. What is the matter with you all?This would be a wonderful chance to let people view the once-in-a-lifetime sight — both residents and tourists. Instead, create a plan for viewing access, as was commonly and safely done in the past.Robin McDuffHiloLychee trees felledOur grandfather, Wong Hing, sailed from Canton, China, to Hawaii in the early 1900s to start a new life.He married Ah Tai Chock, which was an arranged marriage, and they raised 15 children together. “Goong Goong” worked as a cook and houseboy for 1o years at the Hilo Boarding School for the Lyman family.On his journey from China, he carried several lychee seeds with him, which produced four seedlings.Wong Hing later purchased Planter’s Meat Market in Ola‘a (now called Keaau from two Chinese men in 1917. The four lychee trees were planted on the property that year.In 1932, our dad, Harry T.P. Wong, bought Planter’s Meat Market from Goong Goong. Our dad and mom (Lani P.H. Wong expanded that business and had six children.To this day, we can vividly remember seeing the lychee trees laden with red bunches.

suffolknewsherald_2022_201,"Published 4:16 pm Tuesday, November 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsHappy Thanksgiving!Are you one who will celebrate Thanksgiving by using those two words? If so, will you also spend a few moments during this special season to express thanks to God for the blessings we have had this past year?There are many problems, but we have had plenty of food, water to drink — and for a bath — a job, a means of transportation, including school buses for the kids, friendships, relative safety from those who would harm us, help from those who serve us- police, firemen, trash collectors… And there are so many more things we take for granted. Many countries do not have these riches.Will you encourage your children to be thankful for these blessings?Or, do you have a hard time expressing thankfulness?Are you one who would quickly say, “How can I give thanks when I see all that is happening in the world? I am fearful, lonely, hearing and hating those awful, ugly, negative and sometimes untrue remarks and sarcastic words flying back and forth by those sparring for power?”If any of this is keeping you from being thankful, let me encourage you to read the book of Psalms in the Bible. The writer’s words will often remind us that long ago the whole world experienced a dark side because of sin.The same demonic forces which ruled in the ancient world are at work today in this “modern” age. There is nothing new. Words in the Old Testament verify that.The psalmist understood those feelings but then inspired us with words that lift our hearts by reminding us God loves his creation and has given us the gifts we enjoy today. No evil entity could do that. We are a sinful people who need to ask forgiveness and then to praise and thank God by worshiping him.The book of Psalms can give us a light to challenge any darkness we may be feeling. In Psalm 90, the psalmist tells us to “number our days so that we may apply our hearts to wisdom.”With these ancient words the psalmist says, “It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy Name, O most high…” (Psalm 92. Psalm100 reminds us to “make a joyful noise unto the Lord… to enter his gates with thanksgiving.” In Psalm 103 we are told to “Bless the Lord and forget not all his benefits…” Psalm 106 reminds us to praise the Lord for he is good.”Giving loving thanks to God for all the blessings we enjoy can change our lives. Let’s remember to do this during this THANKS-giving season.Myrtle V. Thompson, writer, author, age 94+, asking you to join in praying for America to become a thankful nation.

minnpost_2022_14,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Ever since the police murder of George Floyd in May 2020, Rep. Ilhan Omar has been a strong and admirable advocate for the rights of the accused and for reining in the abuses of U.S. law enforcement.It therefore came a surprise when Omar brushed offblatant violations of due processandsaid the U.S. should not help the hero ofHotel RwandaPaul Rusesabaginamerely because he had been accused of a crime by a totalitarian regime well-known for assassinating and jailing its critics.The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a resolution Feb. 8 calling for Rusesabagina’s release from a Rwandan prison. Omar was one of the voices against it.“While I acknowledge the reports of serious concerns related to due process relating to his arrest and trial,” she said. “This man is credibly accused of terrorism, tried and convicted.”“Serious concerns” is an understatement, given what happened to Rusesabagina. On Aug. 29, 2020, he was lured away from his home in Texas and tricked into boarding a flight to Rwanda’s capital where he was then tortured and put on a show trial for phony charges of “terrorism” in which no credible evidence was presented, and coerced witnesses even recanted their accusations. He was sentenced to 25 years.His only crime was speaking out. Ever since his heroism during the 1994 genocide received global attention, Rusesabagina used his platform to draw attention to the rampant human rights abuses of the dictatorship in his home nation, the routine kidnapping and murders of dissidents that causedFreedom House to rate the country a dismal 22 out of 100.Rwanda’s dictator, Paul Kagame, has long considered him an enemy.Omar’s vote came after a visit she made to Rwanda on Oct. 9, 2021 where she attended a meeting at Kagame’s office. The visit prefigured her shift in attitude from a congresswoman who has previously been fearless at denouncing human rights abuses – the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, China’s treatment of its ethnic Uyghur people, Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories – into one that excuses an illegal kidnapping by a despotic regime that the State Department says has been proficient at “unlawful or arbitrary arrests and detentions, killings, and enforced disappearances.”Rwanda is eager to do business with the U.S. It hosts a branch campus of Carnegie Mellon University and a startup minor league of the National Basketball Association. Goldman Sachs funds a women’s education program there and electric car manufacturers are eyeing the tin and tungsten produced from its Rutungo mines.The regime’s 2020 kidnapping of their most prominent critic, Paul Rusesabagina, was a bit of a test: How much can they get away with? Can they silence a critic who happens to be a U.S. lawful permanent resident and a winner of thePresidential Medal of Freedom? If they can get away with this, imagine what they can do – and have done – to humble people without such standing.Omar’s position on Rusesabagina comes with domestic complications, threatening to throw her entire stance on the U.S. criminal justice system into a light of hypocrisy. Is she saying that police abuses not acceptable in America are okay so long as they are carried out in Africa?What is clear is that she can’t have it both ways. She can’t be a human rights champion while carrying the water of a brutal human rights abuser.Tom Zoellner is the co-author of Paul Rusesabagina’s memoir “An Ordinary Man.” David Himbara is a former economic advisor to the Rwandan government now living in exile in Canada."

When we shop at a local business we are doing more than supporting that business, we are supporting our community.Did you know that the majority of dollars spent at a small business in our communiy stays in our community? Studies have shown that for every $100 spent at a locally owned small business, $64 stays in the local economy, creating jobs and expanding the tax base. For every $100 spent at a national chain or franchise store, only $14 remains in the community. Shopping local is a domino effect that we should all get behind!Small Business Saturday is officially a program of American Express. Started in 2010 the idea (a great one in my opinion is to shop at a local, independently-owned small businesses on Saturday during the holiday weekend.Shopping at local businesses was down in 2020 and 2021 most likely due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Stay-at-home ordering, easy one-click buys, and free shipping deals stole the holiday shopping thunder in both 2020 and 2021, and unfortunately are now part of the new norm. As a result, sales to small businesses have decreased which has had a significant impact on their ability to remain open or be profitable.Let’s buck that trend this year and create our own domino effect by shopping at a small business in our community — on Saturday and on a regular basis.

minnpost_2022_110,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The letter that follows is from former City of Minneapolis Race & Equity Director Joy Marsh. Her letter addresses her experience as the city’s first Director of Race & Equity and the efforts of current and former City Coordinators Office hold leadership accountable for creating an anti-racist and safe workplace.Mayor Frey, Council President Jenkins and City Council, and Minneapolis Community Members,I joined the City of Minneapolis’ City Coordinator’s Office (CCO late fall 2015 filled with excitement about the opportunity to lead racial equity work in a city I loved. It was clear in the interview process that the people I would look most directly to for leadership, the city coordinator and deputy city coordinator, had little to offer by way of wisdom on how to accomplish the work, but I was undeterred. I had transferable skills leading similar efforts in far larger and more complex organizations. Also, I interpreted their lack of clarity on how to support my work effectively and the promise of a blank canvas upon which I could create to, in fact, mean that my leadership and expertise would be trusted. I believed I would be listened to and even consulted on matters related to racial equity in ways commensurate with my leadership role. The stark contrast between the vision painted for me and my lived experience in the Coordinator’s Office for six years is illustrative of the most insidious and toxic work environment I have experienced in nearly three decades of professional work.There were no signs in the interview process to warn me of the amount of gaslighting, marginalization and tokenism I would experience or the toll it would all take on my mental and emotional health. I could not have planned for the professional cost these actions would take on my self-confidence, or the weight of the doubt I would experience. I had to operate under a significant degree of cognitive dissonance in those early years as I tried to make sense of the stated equity values of the city. These stated values along with hollow public praise I might receive from city leadership on one hand was in stark contrast with the harm I experienced behind closed doors. My reputation for being a transformational leader was growing locally and nationally, but within the confines of the city, most notably, the Coordinator’s Office, my efforts were regularly dismissed or co-opted by others to build their public profile.What is incredibly important to note is that my experience is not unique to me, nor is it tied to a single city coordinator, mayor or city council. The culture is one of harm and toxicity serving those who pledge allegiance to it and few others. I point to my experience to contribute my voice to the growing numbers of city staff from across the enterprise who are organizing at their own risk in pursuit of justice. I speculated for a long time why such a movement never happened before, particularly considering how many staff, past and present in my tenure, had experiences like mine. How were people leaving silently, not reaching back and saying something? How could we allow this culture of harm go unchecked at the cost of BIPOC employees and those white staff who dared to leverage their privilege to speak boldly for justice?The culture is toxic and city leadership can either honor the voices of the oppressed and do something to change it. Or you can continue to operate with benign neglect treating BIPOC staff as interchangeable cogs that can be replaced with those who may be more accommodating, when the last crew, weary of the toll of the harm, chooses to leave.Today feels different though. Today feels like a moment when some especially brave staff have chosen to set aside their comfort and speak out in the face of inequities. These staff are embodying the city’s racial equity value by calling for justice, even if there are those in a position to take action to disrupt the system of harm opt to ignore these cries. Today is, in fact, a moment to simply lean into the discomfort of recognizing the city culture, as with every other organization that is built upon policy and practice that centers whiteness, does in fact cause harm to BIPOC staff. The harm happens in the culture and there is a doubling down of that harm when we shine a light on it and blame or marginalize the victim. Simply put, moving on as if growing numbers of staff, past and present, have not called for disrupting the status, isn’t a good look for the city.To those who are putting their bodies, jobs, and professional futures on the line to lead this effort, I applaud you. Your leadership in this moment is an inspiration and compelled me to act first as someone committed to people-led movement, secondly as a strong champion of so many of you individually, and as a resident of Minneapolis. You are who the residents of Minneapolis and employees of the city deserve. Your willingness to act not only in this effort but in the work you do every day to move more equitable policy and practice is sowing seeds for true transformation in the city, not because words match deeds at the highest levels as often as they should, but in spite of that.I offer my thoughts here not because I believe the mayor or council will act in accordance with the demands set forth by staff. Quite the contrary, history has shown that in the face of clear evidence, the city will operate against the interest of the people. None of it is personal. It is all about a culture that continues to benefit some at the expense of so many. I offer my thoughts here because I believe in the people and I could not let their sacrifice go without support in whatever way I could offer it. I offer it because regardless of how the city responds, the very fact that we are having this conversation now is a win for these staff. For that I am deeply grateful to have called many of them colleagues, some of them friends, and all of them tremendous assets to the advancement of racial justice in Minneapolis and beyond.Joy Marsh is the former City of Minneapolis Race & Equity director."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_34,"As Christmas approaches, not everyone is celebrating. American families — hit hard by inflation, wage stagnation and layoffs — must confront another challenge: an expired child tax credit.The program, which provides cash handouts to parents and is vociferously backed by President Joe Biden, has been hailed as instrumental in reducing child poverty. But renewing the child tax credit has proved challenging. Now, with a few weeks remaining before a new Congress takes office, advocates of the child tax credit are pushing for a renewal in an end-of-year tax package.The political pain point comes down to work. Republicans want parental toil in exchange for government cash. Democrats, not so much. Republicans say labor force participation is a reasonable ask. Democrats aren’t convinced, instead viewing the credit as more of an entitlement program, one that should be extended to all Americans, regardless of their employment status.Sen. Marco Rubio is having none of it. “Sending $250/$350 per month/per child to everyone, with no work requirement, is welfare,” Rubio argues.I sympathize with the senator and more broadly, the party of Lincoln. Americans may find meaning in work. We may value the act of contributing our labor toward a greater good. But we value cold, hard cash a lot more. For the masses, work is a means to an end, and that end is the almighty dollar. If the government just hands out cash willy nilly, why would otherwise hardworking parents toil at all?It’s a powerful argument and one backed up by hard data. But contrary to the Republican mantra, the Child Tax Credit doesn’t reward work. It never has.Numbers bear this out. In 2020, claiming $1 of child tax credit required an income of $2,506. Claiming $2,000 of credit (the maximum allowed under law required upward of $24,000. This pattern — more benefits in exchange for higher earnings — has stayed consistent over time and sends one, unequivocal message: the child tax credit rewards income, not work.Earning more, not working more, delivers more benefits. This distinction may seem moot. Intuition dictates that work and income are inextricably linked. But intuition isn’t always right. And where poor Americans are concerned, intuition is dead wrong.The reason comes down to wages. Middle-class Americans can earn $24,000 (the income threshold required to claim the full child tax credit after a few months’ work. Poor Americans, less so. At the federal minimum wage, a parent working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would only earn $15,080, far short of the $24,000 threshold needed to claim the full credit.Put another way, higher wages mean working less to claim the full benefit. Lower wages entail working more. And if wages are low enough, you can work till you drop and still be out of luck.In many ways, Washington’s wrangling over parental work requirements is misguided. The real question isn’t whether parents should work but rather how much should they work? What is a reasonable amount of toil in exchange for a check from Uncle Sam? Trading elbow grease for cash is reasonable. The global economy is based on these trades. But a government program touted as rewarding work that so consistently excludes people who do, is to put it mildly, absurd.Questions should be asked about why millions of blue-collar parents cannot claim a benefit touted as benefiting, well, blue-collar parents. The work requirement should be called out for what it truly is: a political red herring that detracts from the real challenge millions of Americans face — wages so low that they exclude participation in government-run programs.Fixing this inequity admittedly entails raising wages. But I realize winning that fight seems unlikely at best. Efforts to boost wages have been marred by labor conflict and political struggle. The federal minimum wage hasn’t budged for over a decade. Consequently, a more politically palatable way forward on the child tax credit is lowering the income required to levels that include — rather than exclude — hardworking American families.This too won’t be easy. Some Republicans will resist these efforts citing concerns over reduced labor force participation. After all, if a benefit is easier to claim, why work as much? Some Democrats will argue that any income requirement excludes Americans unable to work. Neither side is wrong. But two truths can coexist.Public policy is an imperfect compromise, and compromise should be seen for what it really is. Not a dirty word, but the bedrock of American democracy."
leoweekly_2022_16,"Asthe area continues to bake in the summer heat, it can be difficult to think that cooler temperatures are around the corner. Soon, however, we’ll be right back to the tailgating, Huber’s apple picking, craft beer sipping, pumpkin spiced glory known as fall. The change of the season also signifies the beginning of the collegiate academic year for millions of students nationwide.While students brim with the excitement of returning to campus, university sexual misconduct prevention practitioners prepare their campuses for “The Red Zone” — a period ranging from the start of the semester to Thanksgiving when the highest amount of collegiate sexual assaults occur. A 2007 report prepared for the National Institute of Justice found that around 50% of sexual violence incidents on college campuses happen in The Red Zone. With the new semester on the horizon, two Kentuckiana universities are going well beyond the bare minimum of compliance in preparing proactive education for their students.In addition to Green Dot, Mudd says the university will be working to infuse sexual misconduct education into campus life using methods beyond typical workshops. “We’re trying to look at ways we can get in front of students in ways that maybe aren’t presentations,” says Mudd. These methods include resources that Mudd has developed for resident assistants to use as educational components on the information boards in the resident halls. Mudd looks optimistically forward to both Green Dot training and her office’s other efforts saying, “This type of education aligns perfectly with UofL’s Cardinal Principles of being a community of care and respect.”The Greek Law program will extend into the spring semester’s “Breaking Bread” sessions, where chapters will intentionally engage in conversations on a variety of topics including dating violence, masculinity and current events. Chapters that fully participate in the program will be recognized at the Student Awards ceremony in April. With less than a month away, students are already excited about the program. “I think Greek Law will really help bring awareness to topics that can be difficult to discuss,” says Panhellenic Council President Kaylee Brown. Brown hopes the program will not only help students become knowledgeable, but also accountable for their actions. Meanwhile, Dean Chaleunphonh believes the lessons learned through Greek Law will ultimately contribute to the students’ personal development while instilling lifelong values.. ( ."
eugeneweekly_2022_45,"We ve got issues. Plop. The first indication that there would not be a tectonic shift in the political geosphere this election came from Pennsylvania. “The wizard of New Jersey” was not quite able to convince voters that the man behind the curtain really was one of them. Turns out “let them eat crudités” was not such a good campaign slogan. Meanwhile, not since FDR’s rarely seen wheelchair has a candidate so deftly worked around his disability as did the now Senator-elect John Fetterman. Call that a stroke of good luck. Plop. The SCOTUSDobbsdecision appears to be for Democrats the gift that keeps on giving. Wherever reproductive choice was on the ballot, it proved to be what voters wanted. In Kentucky — where even the grass grows red and no one would bet against Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky Derby, even if he were riding a dead horse — the pro-life vote was DOA. In many other states it was often the issue that most gave the Ds new life. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Fizz. That other Florida guy won big in his state while a good many of those endorsed by He Who Must Not Be Named came up short. The much vaulted “red wave” elsewhere turned out to be more of a pink puddle that could not even lift a Heisman winner from Georgia to senatorial glory in the Nov. 8 general election. True, Kevin McCarthy surely will win the coveted speaker’s chair, which means we will soon see what happens when the dog succeeds in catching the car. It likely won’t be pretty. Good luck Val! Fizz. Speaking of fizzle, what the heck happened in Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District? Lauren Boebert, that gun-toting representative from the community of Rifle (I kid you not , was given a rating of 97 out of 100 by FiveThirtyEight. When all the legal votes and nothing but the legal votes had been counted, Rep. Boebert had the smallest margin in the country with just 554 votes. If only we had a president who would call up Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold and say, “Jena, I just need you to find 555 votes…” Nah, no president would ever do anything so illegal as that. And then there is Arizona. It does not take a rocket scientist to tell us when an election is fair and honest, but it sure helps to have an astronaut on the ticket to ground an election denier. Can we change that unofficial anthem of the U.S. to “God Bless Maricopa County?” In so many ways not just Democrats but democracy was the real winner in this election. Plop, plop. Fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief… It is, and now it is up to us to do the hard work to make sure democracy remains strong and healthy for years to come.

In doing so, this will lower the cost of goods, bolster domestic production, provide good paying jobs, and mitigate supply chain issues. As a result of this legislation, companies have already announced nearly $50 billion in additional investments in chip manufacturing.We are working hard to ensure Virginia receives its fair share of federal funding and to attract manufacturers to consider Virginia for its new facilities, which would help create more jobs in our district and across the Commonwealth.The PACT Act was a major accomplishment to support our brave veterans. This long overdue legislation honors our commitment to our veterans who risk their lives to protect our freedom and, unfortunately, have been exposed to toxic chemicals while in service to our nation.The PACT Act will expand health care benefits for millions of soldiers exposed to burn pits during their service. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs projects up to 3.5 million veterans may benefit from this legislation.I also joined my House colleagues in passing the Inflation Reduction Act last month.The IRA will take meaningful steps to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs, combat inflation, reduce the federal deficit, and provide robust investments in our continued fight against the climate crisis.Here in Virginia, energy bills will go down, air will be cleaner and families will be able to live healthier lives.I am also proud to say that the IRA includes notable environmental justice priorities I have advocated for since my time in Congress. These include billions for clean energy tax provisions to incentivize families to buy electric vehicles and retrofit their homes, urban forestry and tree planting, the electrification of our school buses, air pollution monitoring and mitigation, and so much more.This legislation represents the largest federal investment to combat climate change in our nation’s history. There were some provisions in the bill that I would not have supported on their own, including opening up lands to drilling and attempts to weaken environmental review laws; however, I am still excited about this legislation and was proud to support it.Finally, I was honored to participate in a forum put together by the Digital Dialogue Forum, a nonpartisan policy coalition comprised of the world’s leading technology companies. This was an excellent opportunity to touch on the importance of equal access to high-speed broadband and the work to close the digital divide.In my time in Congress, I have been working diligently to connect more Americans, and particularly Virginians, to affordable, high-speed internet.

suffolknewsherald_2022_221,"Published 5:59 pm Tuesday, November 15, 2022ByStaff ReportsWhat do you have the right to know about what your state government is doing?In Virginia, not a lot.Virginia, like the federal government and all 49 other states, has a freedom of information law that rests on the idea that the public’s business should be accessible to the public. Governments are allowed to keep certain sensitive business secret, but it’s on them to justify why the secrecy is important enough to deviate from the norm of giving the public access to public information.We don’t do it that way, and if we’re being honest, everyone in Richmond knows that. In practice, Virginia government too frequently operates as if the Freedom of Information Act were reversed: Secrecy is the norm, and it’s the public who has the burden of justifying why the state should deviate from that and make documents open and accessible.Here’s how it stands in Virginia.The General Assembly isn’t subject to FOIA laws. You have no right to see lawmakers’ emails, correspondence or other internal business.Judges aren’t subject to FOIA.The State Corporation Commission, which oversees utilities, banking, insurance and other business-related sectors, isn’t subject to FOIA.The governor’s office and the Office of the Attorney General technically are, but secrecy exemptions written into FOIA have been construed so broadly that they routinely block the release of information on tenuous grounds.Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration’s recent refusal to release 87 of 90 records related to the crafting of the Virginia Department of Education’s abrupt policy shift on the treatment of transgender students is a case in point.Ben Paviour, a reporter at public radio station and NPR affiliate VPM News, recently requested all drafts of the new model policies, any email correspondence related to those drafts and records that include the words “trans” or “transgender” in emails with Superintendent Jillian Balow between Aug. 1 and Sept. 19 of this year.The Virginia Department of Education acknowledged it had 90 records responsive to his request. But it chose to withhold 87 of them — a chunk that amounted to 315 pages of documents — citing the “Governor’s Confidential Working Papers” exemption in FOIA.The transgender issue isn’t the point here. The point is that if you’re going to construe correspondence and documents related to public policy changes within the executive branch as “confidential working papers,” then you’re basically saying the public doesn’t have the right to know what decisions are based on. You just want them to trust you.Youngkin isn’t the only Virginia governor to use the working papers exemption as a shield, although his administration does appear to be leaning into it with enthusiasm. Former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe cited the same exemption to claim he didn’t have to release a list of the roughly 206,000 felons whose rights he restored in one fell swoop.Virginia’s FOIA Council said McAuliffe did — but the FOIA Council is advisory only and can’t make anyone do anything. McAuliffe didn’t agree to release the list until he was sued by Loudoun County’s commonwealth’s attorney and a civil settlement was reached. By that time, the whole issue was moot because the Supreme Court of Virginia had decided the governor hadn’t had the power to carry out a mass rights restoration that way.There’s an important lesson Virginia’s government sends here: We might be denying access to documents unlawfully, but you’ll have to sue us to make us reverse course. That will be expensive, and it will take a very long time, and probably by the time it is resolved, the information will be largely irrelevant.The General Assembly sometimes will pull itself together to make vague noises of concern, but again, its members aren’t subject to FOIA themselves. And they’re hardly models of transparency either.Let’s not forget that the legislature’s system of crafting the state budget via conference committee means small groups of legislators end up negotiating billions in spending behind closed doors.All too often officials will tell you, striking a tone of wistful regret, that their hands are tied when it comes to exemptions.They aren’t. The exemptions are not absolute prohibitions. State and local governments can choose to withhold records under the FOIA exemptions — and while sometimes that choice is clearly the responsible and right decision, it is indeed a choice, one that is supposed to rest on whether the need for secrecy outweighs the norm that the business being done for the public should be open to the public.Politicians of all parties like to tout transparency. So let’s be transparent here: In Virginia, more often than not, the government doesn’t actually think you have the right to know what it’s doing.Sarah Vogelsong is Editor-in-Chief of the Mercury and previously its environment and energy reporter.

She owns it and does not have to answer to anyone about her choice to harvest her timber to sell at the going market price. Not all laws may be ethical, and not all that is ethical may be part of the law. We only asked her to consider our concerns over how the winds would come, threatening our homes if there was no buffer of trees left standing. We only asked to hear out our concerns. The laws written by timber companies didn’t force her to discuss her plans to clearcut her property with her neighbors. She wasn’t required to mitigate the impacts of the wind and leave a buffer of safety to keep previously protected trees still standing. No one could make her care that trees on her neighbor’s properties would be exposed to winds and the effects of drought and global warming and the increased stress that would expose these trees to invasive species causing them to have root failure and fall. Winds are an “act of God,” after all, but that wasn’t any of her concern. The trees were hers and she could cut them down if, how and when she wanted and nothing, by God, would change her mind. So, my wife and I lay awake in our bed all night, waiting for the winds to come. It was early March when 65 mph wind gusts ripped through the valley from the northwest, taking down countless previously protected 100-foot tall firs on both sides of the property line. Winds came ripping through, uprooting thickly trunked trees with root balls 15 feet across. Trees came crashing down onto fences and pastures and lawns and trails and driveways and gardens and sheds, narrowly missing the homes of her neighbors, thank God, the homes and properties of neighbors whom she wasn’t required by Oregon laws to be responsible to consider when she took down her trees. For most of us neighbors, the clean up continues, and so does our fear for what happens when the winds come again. And so when we woke on a recent Sunday morning to warnings of high winds forecast to blow throughout the Willamette Valley, we re-lived that night all over again. We spent the day worrying about which trees might fall when the winds came that night, this time from the south/southwest. Looking up at the 40 or more 100-foot trees still standing 50 feet from our home, we wondered which one or three might come down on us when the winds would come, and what could we do to stop it? We had already been told by one local tree service that we were looking at many tens of thousands of dollars that we don’t have to remove our trees that we don’t want to take down, but now they are exposed to the winds we could not stop from coming. So, we parked our cars down the driveway pointed away from our home so we could drive away fast if we needed to. We positioned flashlights and got food ready for our dogs and took pictures of our home and its contents, just in case, and we held each other, awake and afraid in our bed all night, praying that angels would protect us and our trees. And the winds did come, with the rain, whipping the trees around until morning. Gratefully, there was no damage that night, and we were able to leave home safely the next morning. But the trees remain and the winds will return and our fears are real for what happens next time the winds come. How can we protect our home with money we don’t have from trees that we love but now threaten our safety because they aren’t protected from winds that will come because trees were cut down by a neighbor who couldn’t be made to care and wouldn’t hear our concerns ? And we’re waiting for the winds to come, again. Jim Evangelista lives with his wife in a small neighborhood on five acres just south of the Spencer Creek Grange."

leoweekly_2022_61,"If there’s one takeaway from the 2022 judicial races in Jefferson County, it’s that women will always win judicial races against men. It’s well established that a candidate’s perceived gender is an important factor in nonpartisan races, and Louisville voters have decided that women make better judges. Simple as that.Ah, wait. The low-dollar district court matchup between public defender Anthony Jones and elder law attorney Emily Korfhage Monarch disproves that rule. Jones won by almost 4,000 votes. Okay then, this indicates that people want defense lawyers and other candidates who are dedicated to reforming our criminal legal system. Louisville’s voting population was energized by the Breonna Taylor protests, and they are more engaged than ever in these judicial races, so they’ve done their homework this time.Hold on, that’s not it either. Lisa Langford, a former prosecutor, trounced former public defender Justin Brown. Ted Shouse, a high-profile criminal defense lawyer who has been on the front lines of nearly every social justice legal battle in Louisville for more than a decade, suffered a 20,000-vote defeat to a mostly unknown insurance defense lawyer who had the backing of the GOP and the FOP. And the “people’s lawyers” running for Court of Appeals — State Representative McKenzie Cantrell and Tricia Lister — both lost to sitting judges who have gotten plenty of bad press.We can at least say that incumbent judges have a major advantage. Oh, except that Tracy Davis beat out Judge Mary Shaw, who was the only incumbent challenged at the Circuit Court level. That must be because Shaw signed the bogus search warrant that led to Breonna Taylor’s death. So voters want judges who are more in touch with social justice — no, no, sorry. We already debunked that one. Fuck! This is hard.My law professor brain wants a framework for understanding voters, a formula for winning elections, or at least some stable measure of predictability that could be used in future elections, but no such thing exists. Propose a marker, any marker, to predict voter behavior in this last election, and it can be discarded by the judicial results in Jefferson County. Experience? No. Ethnicity? No. Endorsements? No. Fundraising? Close, but not quite. No single factor, or even combination of factors, yields a satisfactory answer.In looking at these results, it might be tempting to conclude that judicial campaigns just don’t matter that much. A candidate could put their name on a ballot, never knock on a single door or put up a single yard sign, kick back, and wait for the results. In fact, it seems like that’s exactly what a few of them did this cycle. Meanwhile, highly recognizable candidates like Shouse and Cantrell campaigned hard and still lost.The truth is that party identification is the single most important factor in predicting voter behavior, and when you take that away, we know diddly/squat about what motivates voters. Research on voting behavior is focused almost entirely on high-level elections, and most of that on presidential races. There hasn’t been much in the way of empirical research on nonpartisan races for the last 20 years.The best we can do are little glimpses into ways that voters might behave with stylus in hand. In one of the more recent studies on the matter, political scientists Chris Bonneau and Damon Cann theorize that people will sniff out (and sometimes invent party affiliations where none are listed. That’s fine for highly-informed voters, but most of the people who show up to vote for the top of the ticket won’t know anything about judicial candidates before Election Day. We also know that uninformed voters tend not to vote at all on the down-ballot races. That seems to have been the case in Louisville; 277,343 votes were counted in the mayoral race, and most of the judicial races had less than 200,000. When you start to look at uninformed voters who do vote, that’s where things get fuzzy. Some folks will vote along perceived gender or ethnicity lines, or on general name recognition, but many will simply vote for the name that’s at the top of the ticket. In any event, no published studies offer any helpful explanation for the baffling array of results in Jefferson County this year.The lack of meaningful data is troubling. Somewhere around half of all U.S. elections are nonpartisan. In many states, the state supreme court and court of appeals judges will control important aspects of reproductive rights, public education, voter maps and more. District and circuit court judges determine property rights, child custody issues, how full the jails are and honest-to-god-life-and-death matters. And yet we know almost nothing concrete about how candidates in these races might successfully sway voters.Given this dearth of knowledge, a candidate in a nonpartisan race has to do… well, whatever it takes. An electoral win becomes an exceedingly complicated calculus that takes a bajillion factors into account. Circuit Judge-elect Julie Kaelin told me: “Endorsements, name recognition, gender, getting out and meeting voters in the community, engaging on social media platforms, etc. are all important factors in the final calculation. A good candidate is cognizant of this, chooses their race wisely, and then works hard to leave nothing to chance.”Beth Thorpe, a digital strategist who has worked on several judicial campaigns, explains that strategies are more complicated in nonpartisan races because “partisan identification and stance on issues are the main ways the voting public understands who they should vote for. Judicial candidates also sign pledges here to not negatively campaign against their opponent. In partisan races there is often a negative contrast that you push on your opponent. So you are left with a few things, and the absolute biggest is name identification.” That’s where vigorous campaigning comes in. “People seeing the judicial candidate names over and over again matters. Meeting the candidate personally matters. Developing a really good narrative for why the candidate is the right one with videos, graphics and speeches that tell that candidate’s story is absolutely essential for connecting with the voter.”Essentially, you’re scrambling to reach as many low-information voters as you can, so you can keep them from casting an arbitrary vote, or not voting at all.So while the 2022 election results might look like chaos to the casual observer, the answer is not to write off judicial campaigns as ineffective. To the contrary, Thorpe says: “People who volunteer, donate and publicly back candidates as well as organizations who run voter outreach programs in judicial races make a massive difference in outcomes. Running countywide takes a village, and I encourage people to reach out to candidates and see how they can be a part of their campaign.” •.You Filthy Man Sl*** Better Watch Your Mouths."

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_43,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°Is slovenliness an index of genius? This is one of the questions raised by the downfall of “crypto wunderkind” Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF, as he is known.Before his fall, Bankman-Fried was hailed as the next Warren Buffett, perhaps destined to become the world’s first trillionaire. At just 30, as founder of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, he “amassed more wealth in a shorter period of time than anyone else, ever,” said a glowing profile on the website of Sequoia Capital, a venture capital fund that invested more than $200 million in his schemes.V.C. investors generally consider themselves smart people, but SBF struck quite a few of them as being in a class of his own. He had a “reputation as a genius — a slightly awkward space cadet, but a genius nonetheless,” wrote the authors of a denouement on Vice. This perception of being a prodigy was critical to the fact that Silicon Valley titans handed him billions.Central to his mythos was also his sartorial style, his “shambolic wardrobe,” as it was referred to in The New York Times. “The unkempt millennial,” cooed The Wall Street Journal. He “would only be photographed in shorts, a T-shirt or hoodie, and untied shoes,” noted The Guardian.Elsewhere he has been described as part of “a loose intellectual confederation of scruffy, young STEM-oriented freethinkers” — STEM being the acronym for “science, technology, engineering and mathematics.”Flouting business dress codes became a marker of Bankman-Fried’s supposed brilliance.In this respect he follows in a tradition laid out by some of the most legendary figures in tech, among them Steve Wozniak, who co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs. Where Jobs is famous for the fanatical control of his appearance — and that of Apple devices — Woz, as Wozniak is fondly known, is rumpled and bearlike.And here’s a critical point: Jobs may have been the marketing genius who propelled Apple to a central place in contemporary culture, but Woz is the engineering genius who made the original Apple computers work. For several generations of computer engineers, his genial scruffiness has served as an inspiration.Comparing Bankman-Fried to the founder of Facebook, the authors of the Vice article described him as “a schlubby Zuckerberg-type.”This is unfair to Mark Zuckerberg. Zuck and SBF have in common their stratospheric business ascents and embrace of the T-shirt as a kind of monkish habit. Yet these days Zuckerberg is anything but shambolic. His hair is so flat it seems spray-painted on, and the crispness of the T-shirts on his honed body makes you wonder if they’re ever worn twice. He’s so squeaky clean, it’s as if he’s been a character in the virtual reality realm of his beloved metaverse all along. No scruff there!Whatever the differences between Zuckerberg and Bankman-Fried, they share the attribute of a Y chromosome and this affords them fashion options not open to women.On Twitter, Emily Peck, a journalist at Axios, has noted the gendered dimension of SBF’s wardrobe choices: “It’s not a new point but I can’t help repeating. No female founder could show up dressed like this in public and expect to get handed billions of dollars.”Peck’s post has generated more than 35,000 likes, many from women like me who work in STEM fields and have witnessed in person how women, no matter how brilliant, are harshly judged by our appearance and presentation. One female chief executive tweeted back “a woman can’t show up in a t-shirt (even for the internal team stuff ” — let alone meetings with funders.The only female tech founder most people have heard of, Elizabeth Holmes, has just been sentenced to prison as a result of her own startup meltdown. During her also meteoric rise, Holmes was impeccably turned out. Perfect hair, flawless makeup, elegant clothes — often modeled on Jobs’ black-turtleneck look — she was the Vogue ideal of a tech mogul. This is no coincidence.And the point expands beyond women. “Imagine if a black or female founder, overseeing tens of billions, showed up like this,” tweeted New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway, alongside a photo of SBF in crushed shorts and limp T-shirt at a cryptocurrency conference.Of course, the mythos of the unkempt male genius extends beyond the tech industry — one thinks of the philosopher Slavoy Zizek, the physicist Albert Einstein and early Richard Branson. In physics in particular, for men, a rumpled demeanor is often viewed as a sign of commitment to higher thoughts.Einstein’s unruly hair has indeed become a cultural symbol of genius, the untamed thatch iconically representing the untrammeled intellect beneath.I do not mean to imply here that anyone should have to dress “well.” I’m just saying that men are allowed to disregard their appearance in ways women cannot contemplate if we wish to keep our jobs or get them in the first place, to say nothing of starting billion-dollar companies. We will not have an equal society until women have the same right to sartorial carelessness.Margaret Wertheim is a science writer, curator and artist.

suffolknewsherald_2022_68,"Published 5:24 pm Friday, December 9, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardWe’ve long bemoaned Western Tidewater’s declining influence in Richmond.Mills Godwin’s two tenures as governor in the 1960s and 1970s ushered in a four-decade run of prominence in state government for our rural region. Legislative giants like Richard Holland, Paul Councill, Bill Barlow, Fred Quayle and, most recently, Chris Jones made sure Western Tidewater never went lacking as state funds were doled.After a dry spell, legislative redistricting might just help us flex our muscle again. The battle for control of the state Senate in the 2023 elections could be won or lost in Suffolk, Isle of Wight, Franklin and Southampton, and the winner will be poised to hold an outsized share of power over the coming four years.According to the Virginia Public Access Project, the newly created 17th Senate District was the most evenly divided in last month’s midterm elections, with 50% voting Democratic and 50% voting Republican. Two experts hired by the state Supreme Court to draw new legislative maps after a bipartisan commission failed to do so listed the seat as leaning Democratic based on votes cast in the 2017 Virginia attorney general election. By the 2021 governor’s race, the 17th was leaning red, but 2022 midterms suggest it’s dead even.State Del. Clinton Jenkins of Suffolk isn’t expected to draw major opposition for the Senate district’s Democratic nomination, so he’ll sit back, conserve his funds and maybe munch on some popcorn while watching a doozy of a Republican primary.Del. Emily Brewer, R-Isle of Wight, whom many assumed would be the GOP’s choice to take on Jenkins, will face retired NASCAR driver Hermie Sadler of Emporia on June 20. Sadler, who had been rumored to have interest in the race, announced his candidacy Nov. 9, positioning himself as a “conservative outsider” in the race.Sadler is deep-pocketed and could force Brewer to spend a ton of money she’d otherwise have spent running against Jenkins. It will be interesting to see whether the Republican establishment picks sides (and invests money in the primary or chooses to sit on the sidelines. A few local leaders, including Isle of Wight Supervisor William McCarty, have endorsed Brewer, as has former Gov. Bob McDonnell. But Republican bigwigs have been mostly silent since Sadler’s announcement.The 17th District includes all of Isle of Wight, Southampton, Greensville and Brunswick counties, the cities of Suffolk, Franklin and Emporia, and parts of Portsmouth and Dinwiddie County. The district’s population is heavily weighted to the east, a fact that seemingly favors Brewer, a popular state delegate, in the primary. But Sadler’s name recognition from his NASCAR days could help him make inroads east of the I-95 corridor.With control of the narrowly divided state Senate hanging in the balance, all eyes will be on Western Tidewater in 2023.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_63,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We have seen intense diplomatic activity during the past week about the fate of Ukraine, a large European country bordering on Russia and four members of the West’s security alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO . As the current round of talks conclude, the issues remain dead serious, the stakes high and the choice of war or peace far from settled.Senior diplomats held crisis talks in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna because Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, moved more than 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s border to underline his demands. Those demands are complicated, but in effect, he wants NATO to guarantee that it will not expand further, particularly into Ukraine.The United States and its allies say that’s a non-starter, that Ukraine, like every other independent country, must be free to decide what is in its national interest, including security arrangements. NATO, for its part, is committed to offering membership to interested parties that meet its qualifications.Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, NATO has taken in 14 new members, starting with Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in 1999, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the alliance. Most of the new members were formerly part of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact or of the Soviet Union itself before it collapsed in 1991.As a foreign service officer assigned to our embassies in Romania and Poland in the ’90s, I worked on the NATO expansion issue; it was seen as the answer to the security vacuum created in the region as countries broke free from a relationship with Moscow that had been forced on them a half century earlier by the Russian Army and ratified by the Yalta agreement most East Europeans saw as a Western sellout.Putin says that insisting NATO stay out of his neighbor Ukraine is no more than what the United States did during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 when we risked nuclear war to get Soviet missiles removed fromourdoorstep in Cuba. Putin is here indulging in a blatant bit of false equivalency, since NATO is not about to install offensive nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as Moscow was doing in Cuba in 1962.Ukrainians and most other residents of Eastern and Central Europe would regard capitulating to Putin now as another Yalta, as allowing Russia’s security concerns to outweigh yet again those of other countries. They feel threatened by his quest to return to the glory days of the Russian empire — at their expense.These issues were thrust front and center in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea, a part of Ukraine, and eventually annexed the territory following a sham election. Russia also sent irregular forces into sections of eastern Ukraine where a substantial portion of the country is ethnically Russian. More than 13,000 people have died in the resulting armed conflict between separatists and the legitimate government.How far the United States and its NATO allies should go in arming Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s proxy attacks remains a contentious matter in Western capitals and Kiev. The United States sent about $450 million in military assistance in 2021 and some $2.5 billion since 2014. Critics say that’s not nearly enough, while others contend Ukraine cannot conceivably defeat Russia militarily, so a diplomatic settlement is the only viable choice.No one can be sure exactly what Putin wants in Ukraine or whether he’ll invade the country if he doesn’t get it. President Biden says the United States would respond strongly to an invasion with severe economic and other sanctions as well as more aid to Ukraine. He has, however, ruled out dispatching American combat forces.The pivotal decisions in this crisis will be made at a higher pay grade — by the president and secretary of state — but a resident ambassador can help assess the state of mind of Ukrainian leaders and their constituents. That person will also be needed to help persuade Ukrainians to sign on to any peace deal. President Biden has clearly had a crowded agenda, but he should have long since designated a special envoy to Kiev, bypassing the formal Senate approval process because of the urgency of the situation.The days and weeks ahead will test the skill of the West’s diplomats as well as the determination of its leaders to defeat Putin’s aggressive campaign to dictate Ukraine’s future and impose his will on Russia’s neighbors. Appeasement would only delay a reckoning.Dick Virden, Plymouth, is a retired senior foreign service officer. His diplomatic assignments included three tours of duty in Eastern Europe."

Motorists are advised to wait until the red flashing lights are off, the stop arm is withdrawn and the bus begins to move before resuming driving.Each year approximately 450,000 public school buses transport 23.5 million students to and from school and related activities, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Heralded as one of the safest modes of transportation, buses are 70 times more likely to get children to school safely than cars. Buses are designed to be safer than passenger vehicles in preventing crashes and injuries.However, the latest statistics available from the Virginia Department of Education show that there were 138 collisions in the 2019-20 school year, resulting in 26 injuries to bus occupants. Readers might also be surprised to learn that the greatest risk to a child isn’t riding a bus but approaching or leaving one. According to the NHTSA, in the past 10 years, 264 school-age children were killed in school transportation-related crashes — 203 of whom were walking, waiting for the bus, biking or in another vehicle.When waiting for the bus, students and parents should arrive at least five minutes before the scheduled pickup time and:On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_14,"It’s been one year since the last monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC payment was issued.For six months in 2021, these payments reached more than 61 million children. They lifted nearly 4 million children above the poverty line, reducing hunger and housing insecurity while improving household health and well-being.But when lawmakers refused to extend the program and those payments ended, these gains were swiftly undone. Child poverty shot back up and many families again went hungry.Despite a final push by progressives to revive the expansion before Republicans take control in the House, congressional leaders left the measure out of their final spending proposal for the year.That is unacceptable. Reviving this program should be a top priority for three reasons:1. When anti-poverty policies are more inclusive, they’re more effective — and more popular.When it was first enacted in 1997, the CTC imposed income requirements that excluded nearly one-third of children from receiving full benefits. The poorest households received nothing because they did not have an income to offset with a tax credit.The American Rescue Plan Act changed this by making the CTC “fully refundable,” extending the full value to children whose parents hadn’t earned enough before.The legislation increased the amount of these payments without imposing any work requirements.These monthly payments helped low-income parents continue working by filling the gap between their low wages and what they needed in order to provide for their families.In 2021, the United States saw the lowest child poverty rates on record. And the credit’s broad inclusivity, supporting the poorest to middle-income families, contributed to its popularity across party lines.2. Policies that prioritize the poor are good for the whole economy.Families spent their monthly payments on basic needs like food, utilities, rent and education, putting billions of dollars into local economies. New research shows that an expanded CTC could generate nearly 10 times more in social benefits than it costs each year.3. Programs like the expanded CTC can revive our democracy.Before the pandemic, there were 140 million poor and low-income people in the country.Programs like the CTC helped bring that number down to 112 million.After the payments ended, Pam Garrison, a leader in the West Virginia Poor People’s Campaign, told her senators, including Manchin: “My daughter’s got an 8-year-old son she’s raising … For a few months she got a $300 a month child tax credit, she wasn’t getting notices about getting her utilities cut off anymore.“But now you’re cutting her off, before Christmas?” Garrison decried. “You didn’t care about the deficit and inflation when you gave out trillions of dollars to the banks. The only time you care about it is when it goes to us poor and working people.”Proving that the government can work for everyday people is essential to defending our democracy, which remains on fragile ground as we head into 2023.For now, our elected representatives have another chance to show that democracy is about caring for one another.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2022_36,"Editor’s Note: Before the May 17 primary, LEO asked both Attica Scott and Morgan McGarvey — the two leading Democrats running for the U.S. House seat that will be open after Rep. John Yarmuth retires — to write about what they think are the three biggest issues facing our community. You can read Scott s columnhere.Almost 11 years ago today, my wife Chris was pregnant. I was terrified when her water broke 14 weeks early, and awestruck when, 10 days later, she gave birth to our beautiful twins, Clara and Wilson. Each baby weighed less than two pounds, and they stayed in the NICU for months. We spent countless hours there as well, sleeping in uncomfortable hospital chairs and worrying in hallways. We just wanted our babies to survive and come home safe.In the midst of our twins battling for their lives, Chris and I had to go to war ourselves: with our insurance company. They didn’t want to cover the life-saving nutrients that extremely low birthweight babies need in order to survive. We were lucky that eventually our babies came home healthy. But, once we had made it through that ordeal, Chris and I promised that we would do whatever we could to ensure that other families didn’t have to go through a similar fight during the most terrifying moments of their lives.Three months later, my state senator retired. I ran for his seat in a four-way primary, and I won. In my first year in office, I authored a law that requires insurance companies to cover life-saving nutrients for premature babies. It was the first bill I passed into law, and the first new insurance mandate in over 20 years in Kentucky. It was also a reminder that the government can be a force for good, and that good policy has a real impact.Since taking office in 2012, I have continued to serve Louisville and all of Kentucky in the same way: by standing firm on my progressive values in a chamber controlled by conservative Republicans, while also building coalitions to win real policy gains that help people in their everyday lives. Today, I’m running for Congress to bring that same leadership to Washington.I continue to serve as a legislator because I believe that government can be a force for good in peoples’ lives. I’m running for Congress to work to solve the challenges that our city, state and country face.I am running to expand quality, affordablehealth careto every American. I believe health care is a basic human right. The Affordable Care Act brought health insurance coverage to over 440,000 Kentuckians for the first time. I’ve talked to people whose lives changed because they could finally afford to go to the doctor. They’ve told me what a game changer it’s been for their families that they are able to take care of themselves.That’s why we have to build on the success of the ACA and work toward a single-payer health care system like Medicare for All. Every Kentuckian should be able to regularly see a doctor, access affordable prescription medication and survive a catastrophic health event without risking financial ruin. No one should receive a diagnosis and have to worry about going bankrupt, or be forced to choose between their prescription medications and paying for groceries.It is time to broaden our concept ofpublic educationfrom K-12 to age 3 through 20. Every child in America should have access to pre-K instruction, and every high school graduate should have access to free community college. My wife and I are products of public schools, our kids go to public schools, and I have spent the entirety of my time in Frankfort championing the interests of our hard-working teachers and public school employees.I know what it means to fight for education access. I was elected leader of the Senate Democrats when Matt Bevin was our Governor, and I led the fights in Frankfort against his conservative, anti-teacher agenda – especially the fight to prevent Bevin’s illegal gutting of the teacher retirement system. I am proud to have the backing of the Jefferson County Teachers Association, the KEA and the NEA in my campaign for Congress.There’s more work to do. We must guarantee that every child has access to the transformative tools of education, regardless of their ZIP code. We must sufficiently fund our public universities to make them affordable for all Americans. And, now more than ever, our teachers and public education employees — who have taken care of our loved ones and risked their own health and safety during the pandemic — deserve our gratitude, and a raise.We have to act now to address the existential threat ofclimate changeso that future generations have a livable planet. The UN released a report this spring titled “Now or Never.” As a father of three young kids who will inherit the planet we leave behind, I am running for Congress to make sure we act now. Our children deserve to live in a world that isn’t haunted by ever-more-frequent natural disasters like last December’s tornadoes that devastated Western Kentucky. They deserve better; we all deserve better.That’s why I support extensive federal investment to overhaul our energy system and dramatically increase our use of renewable energy, through wind and solar tax credits, incentive structures for investor-owned utilities, and forgivable loans for rural electric cooperatives to get out of coal-related debt and invest in renewable sources of power. Gov. Beshear has done a fantastic job attracting over $7 billion of economic investment in Kentucky for battery manufacturing that will make Kentucky a national hub for the technology that will power our transportation system’s transition to electric vehicles. Congress needs to act to build on that success.Across these issues and others, I believe that it is the federal government’s duty to address the racial wealth gap — and the racial health gap — between white communities and Black and Brown communities. Racial disparities in our economy, our criminal justice system, housing, health outcomes, banking, voter participation and more are all the result of centuries of racist policies in the United States, from slavery to poll taxes to redlining to Jim Crow voting laws. Problems created by bad policy need policy solutions.In my decade as a legislator, I have learned that the two most powerful phrases in government are “I don’t know” and “What do you think?” I have spent my career as a public servant never backing down from the hardest fights in Frankfort, while working with communities, listening to constituents, and building coalitions to get big things done. I will take that same approach to my role in Congress. To get there, I’m asking for your vote on May 17.Morgan McGarvey is currently theminority floor leader of the Kentucky ( ."
minnpost_2022_34,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It is an ugly reality of adult life that people make mistakes, and as a result of those mistakes, people die. It happens all the time.Military operations end with unintended casualties because mistakes were made. Industrial accidents resulting in the loss of human life happen because mistakes were made.In 2016, Johns Hopkins Medicinereleased a studywhich concluded that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Those experts estimated that 250,000 people in the U.S. die every year due to medical errors. Multiple studies suggest that only about 10 percent of all medical errors are ever reported. Yes, there are some medical malpractice lawsuits that are covered by insurance. But rarely do the medical professionals involved ever get fired, or lose their license to practice medicine, or get charged with a crime, or get sent to prison for making mistakes that result in the deaths of other people.Tens of thousands of people have died unnecessarily because self-serving politicians, talk show hosts, and political pundits have intentionally spread misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccinations. How many of these people who intentionally spread misinformation about COVID-19 have been charged with a crime, or have even been sued. It is not a free speech issue. “Shouting fire in a crowded theater” causing harm to others is not protected free speech.Given what is publicly known about Officer Kimberly Potter’s actions that resulted in the wrongful death of Daunte Wright, there appears to be zero evidence of any bad intent on the part of Potter. If this is so, then one is left to wonder what “good intent,” empathy and forgiveness there could possibly have been, in public demands that she be charged with murder and be sent to prison for the rest of her life.One is left to wonder what “good intent” and good judgment the prosecutors used in their decision to charge Kimberly Potter with a crime at all. Just because a case is thought to be winnable, doesn’t necessarily mean that the case should be prosecuted. Prosecutors have a lot of latitude in making these judgment calls.Then to add salt to the wound after her conviction, the prosecution succeeded in convincing the judge to revoke her bail, send her to prison from court, and then promised to seek prison time beyond the sentencing guidelines? With no evidence of bad intent or pre-meditation? With no criminal history? With her lifelong commitment to law and order and doing the right thing? With her family ties? What’s wrong with this picture?In criminal court there is a difference between justice and vengeance. Criminal court is not supposed to be a place where vengeance is served. It is not supposed to be a place where politics or public opinion influence the prosecution, the defense, or the outcome. And the people who probably best know what a court should not be, are people of color who for generations, have known the meaning of justice denied.Time will tell if the celebration of Potter’s conviction (outside the courtroom represents a step forward toward much, much needed ethnicity-based criminal justice reforms. Why? Because in the courtroom, the trial and conviction of Kimberly Potter was not about ethnicity. She was never charged with or convicted of a hate crime. Unfortunately, the rightful cause of criminal justice reform may not have moved forward with the conviction of Potter, if the trial about the wrongful death of Wright was not a trial about ethnicity at all.John A.

minnpost_2022_130,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It’s about time that we call out the current Minneapolis Federation of Teachers (MFT union leadership for what it is: Racist.As part of the BIPOC Caucus within MFT, we at the Coalition of Truth are fed up with the lies and the gas-lighting that gets thrown in our faces when we point out that there are real systemic issues with how teachers of color are treated in the district and by current union leaders. The recent grievance that was filed against Greta Callahan, president of Minneapolis Federation of Teachers’ teacher chapter cited “cruelties,” which “set a precedent that racism and white supremacy can exist and persist in our union.”We do not take this action lightly. Teachers of color were lied to throughout the strike to keep our voices and use our bodies for public fodder. We were constantly reassured that protections for our jobs, through the Memorandum of Action, were part of negotiations when in reality they were not even introduced at the negotiating table with the district. When the teachers at Patrick Henry spoke up against the lies from MFT leadership, those teachers were ostracized and shunned from all union activity.The union went as far as to send white union members to a Black board members’ house without thinking about the trauma and optics surrounding their actions. This was considered OK because “non-white strike captains” were OK with the decision. As educators and as a union, we need to understand that diversity does not equal inclusion.A union is supposed to be a team. When we work together we win. This strike was not a win. Years of experience is still a factor when determining layoffs for many teachers of color and as a whole we have only achieved a 2% salary raise. Inflation is at 8%. That amount isn’t even a drop in the bucket and we could have achieved that without losing three weeks of pay, and without keeping our students out of the supportive school environment. Additionally, the funding that is necessary is simply not there. What is our union doing to leverage their power to pressure the Minnesota legislature to allocate funds towards education?We support the House Education Omnibus Bill HF3401 and the supplemental budget bill, HF3400, because of what they do to appropriately and equitably allocate funds to our district and solve systemic gaps in spending on special education services and English learners. Why is it that legislators at the state level can recognize the need for more professional support for teachers of color but our union cannot? In the Omnibus’ current form, the “Grow Your Own” program gets funded so that those who want to become licensed education support professionals (ESPs or school counselors have a pathway. Many of us were ESPs before we became teachers.Our current leadership is suggesting that we “cut from the top” instead of cutting teachers to account for the cost of the contract the union agreed to.The reality is, even if we did that, a well-run school system still needs an administration. Taking from Peter to pay Paul never did anyone any good; the shortage is still there and the state is still responsible for providing adequate funds. Attacking our administrators with non-collaborative and divisive rhetoric does not solve the problem.Our union should know better and should be lobbying our state legislators to pass this bill. Instead they waste time by pointing fingers in the wrong direction and sitting on their laurels.Alexis Mann, Charles Luter, Sharita Benson, Marcus Washington, Steven Montgomery, Arielle Rocca, and Alvin Johnson are members of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers and running for leadership positions within the governing board of the union."
minnpost_2022_1,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’ve always known that food is powerful. It can bridge. It can unite. It can heal. When I share a meal with others, there’s an instant and real connection. In these moments, I’ve also come to learn just how deep food inequity runs in our state.Food inequity is one result of larger systems in our world and communities designed to benefit some at the expense of others. Systemic injustices are built into our food system and most often unfairly affect people in marginalized communities and those who don’t have easy access to grocery stores or the means to afford nourishing food.Here in Minnesota, we have one of the worst disparities in the country. We live in a place where people of color were prevented from owning homes in certain Twin Cities neighborhoods just decades ago. These rules are still affecting us today.Your race and your zip code directly impact your access to fresh, affordable food. More people of color are living below the poverty line and the average household income for people of color remains significantly less than that of white families. For many people, a single trip to the grocery store might take two bus rides, if not more. For those in rural communities, the closest affordable grocery store could be miles away.We cannot accept this. Food is a basic human right. The world produces enough food to feed every human being, yet so many people are going hungry because our food system does not allow access to it.And now, inflation is pushing food prices to levels we haven’t seen in 40 years. Just this week we learned that inflation reached a new 40-year high of 9.1% nationwide and 9.5% in the Midwest, with food prices among the top categories.The cost of groceries is up 14% in the Twin Cities from just over a year ago. All of this is once again hurting BIPOC and rural communities and those on limited budgets the most.At The Food Group, we are working toward a more just and equitable food system for all. Food equity means everyone has the option to grow and eat nutritious, affordable and culturally connected foods. Everyone.We know racial and economic injustice are major roots of hunger today. Which means the only way to truly end hunger is to end racial injustice.I know the model we created at The Food Group works. We’re reaching across the food system, from production to distribution, to make it more equitable.We can’t solve food inequity overnight, but I believe if we strengthen our commitment at this pivotal moment, it can one day be possible. We must do this together.That might mean donating to organizations like ours to help those most in need. It might mean inviting your neighbors over for a meal, since we know food really does have the power to heal. And it might mean taking the time to understand why food injustices exists in the first place.Only then can we truly achieve food equity.Sophia Lenarz-Coy is the executive director of The Food Group, a local food equitynonprofit.

suffolknewsherald_2022_260,"Published 8:29 pm Friday, September 23, 2022ByStaff ReportsFew topics are of more interest today than diet. A shortage of food no longer seems to be an issue for most of us.While millions in the world are on starvation’s row, our problem is given over to the things we chose to eat. There is something for everyone, but reading the labels is important. I started with the frozen foods section in the grocery store.I found the Keto products, the Mediterranean Diet and others that have been on the market for a longer that were all presenting their claims. The makers featured packaging contents and the calorie count. Allergies are worthy of note, nuts and wheat being a problem for some people. I am thankful I grew up when peanut butter on a slice of bread was a treat.These days bread and bread products appear to be anathema for the serious dieter. In its place are the mixtures of (mostly fresh fruits and veggies, sometimes blended to form a special drink one can sip on the way to work. Not a “too bad idea,” just a question of where all this is leading us.The kitchen table used to be the gathering place where everyone started the day, maybe with a prayer of thanksgiving, then with breakfast. The family got any necessary instructions, then at night heard their news of the day.Family time today is different, and at a premium. We turn on the TV to get the news that is so often taken up with abrasive, angry or hostile talk — news about climate control and change, or the fast-rising debt neither we nor our children can afford and probably never be able to repay. One other item has to do with why we will need to have a car we cannot afford and that will run without fossil fuels that will have been decimated.“What’s eating you?” may not have been the exact words brought to the table of the day, but they are notable because we sometimes need to carefully choose what we say when a coworker, a family member or close friend is having “a bad day.”Choosing good and kind words will provide a diet for a healthier lifestyle.The God of the Bible has invited us to his table. A “good breakfast” of spiritual food and hearing his instructions for the day will help prepare us for whatever is coming our way before going out in the morning. Scripture reminds us often to commit our way to the Lord. We can have a “bread and water diet” and be spiritually healthy, prepared for the harsh words and difficult people who may say and do things that disturb us. Jesus called himself the “bread of life and the water of life.” We partake of that bread and water when we spend time with him. Jesus also warned us about our need, but he has been ignored, often disbelieved and his promises repudiated.There is a serious need today for a “climate” change in our attitude, and an appetite for truth as it is found biblically would help that a lot.When we want God’s “diet plan” and desire to sit at the table of the only one who can satisfy the longing heart and “fill the hungry soul with good things” (Psalm 107:9 our confession will change from angry words and lamentable actions to what Jesus taught in Matthew 5-7 when he began his ministry.Recognizing God’s blessings can change both our lives and the lives of all those who desire to sit at His “dinner table.” We may even find words of kindness instead of harsh words will make a better day for all concerned.Myrtle V.

Count us among their many fans.Led by a strong team effort, the King’s Fork girls beat Manor 60-53 in the state semifinals Monday night and will play mighty Millbrook at 12:30 p.m. Thursday in the Class 4 state championship game at the Siegel Center.Hardwood success is becoming something of a tradition for the Bulldogs, who reached the state championship game in 2017 before falling to Monacan. Even on a weekday, when work obligations prevent many fans from going to Richmond, we hope a large contingent will make the drive to Richmond to support the Bulldogs.We salute the countless coaches, parents and others who have helped them reach the state title game. News-Herald reporter Jimmy LaRoue, on today’s front page, gives a detailed account of the Bulldogs’ semifinal win. We were inspired by the postgame words of Coach Maurice Fofana, who told LaRoue: “It’s huge, man, it’s huge. I can’t put it into words on how proud I am. The kids played their last game on their home court. You can’t ask for no more than that. They left it all on the floor. They played hard, and we’re just looking forward to Thursday.”The Bulldogs’ determination reminds us of the 2020 Lakeland High boys and King’s Fork’s boys, who were both declared co-state champions in their respective classifications. Team sports, for all the unsavory things you read about in the pros and even major colleges, can bring out the best in student-athletes and entire communities.

leoweekly_2022_20,"I know this isn’t exactly a Louisville story, but after the mall shooting in Indianapolis at the Greenwood Park Mall, I feel obligated to say something that might not be said in the midst of the chatter surrounding this incident. There were three people shot and killed by a gunman with a long gun and many rounds of ammunition. The gunman was stopped, killed by another person, the mythical “good guy with a gun.” The type of gun hasn’t been identified just yet, but no matter; here we are with another shooting. In just hours, we’ll be on to the next and will let this one fade like all the others into memory with inaction from our politicians and citizens.The gun nuts and their weapons are instruments of the tyranny they claim to fear. Yes, I said it. It bears repeating: the gun nuts and their weapons are instruments of the tyranny they claim to fear.I’ll address the “good guy with a gun” later.The American attraction to guns borders on obsession and is a kink like no other in this country, fed by the neofascism of the modern Republican party. If Republicans feed the kink, they don’t fear it being used against them. They get to be the dom while their subs get to hold the weapons and point it where their masters tell them. Coincidentally, it is never pointed at their masters.Modern Republicanism is the sort of oppressive, rights-stealing, fake morality pimping, herd-mentality leading that creates the perfect framework for their brand of fascism to slide in undetected as “tyrannical,” or as it is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, “the cruel, unreasonable, or arbitrary use of power or control.”The way that Republicans will say that “guns don’t kill people” and turn the argument to the person and the type of control necessary for “those kinds of people,” is simply a dogwhistle that their belief system is about the control of the body, and not the instrument of deadly force.So, in the Greenwood Park Mall shooting, we have a shooter with a long gun and 100 rounds of ammo, and we have the “good guy with a gun” who shot and killed the shooter. On the surface we have “danger” and the “stoppage of danger” by another with a weapon. It looks like a very simple scenario until we realize both shooter and good guy are one in the same, instruments of the same side. Let me clarify that I am not villainizing the man who stopped the mass shooter. He thought he was doing his duty and hedidlikely save lives.What I mean by this statement — that they are instruments of the same side — is that neither of their weapons were used or available to fight tyranny; they were both used against another citizen. One citizen, of course, putting many others in danger, sold on the idea that guns can solve problems. The “good guy” used his weapon as judge, jury and executioner for the state, sold on the same idea — that guns can solve problems.Do you see where I’m going?This is deeper than the surface of this situation. On a very basic level, we have two people who likely share some very simple core beliefs about guns and the rights to bear arms.Both shooter and “good guy” get their information from the same source, the idea that their guns are within their rights and that they are for personal protection or to fight against the appearance of being oppressed.This situation certainly seems to fit that plotline. Except that while these two gunmen were shooting it out in the mall, the people who made this event possible in the first place —gun-pimping modern Republicans —were actively passing laws to make both of their lives less truly free.Modern Republicans call themselves the right or even the “hard right,” which is directly linked to ideology that we were taught is dangerous when we learned history as children.This ideology brands itself as moral, for the people, et cetera, but in practice its functions are restrictive and inhumane. Voting restrictions, healthcare restrictions, nativism — except in the practice of material support for the citizens. This ideology increases militarization of the police and heavily funds the military, and while the citizens in America are also able to be armed (ahem, some citizens , the level of personal gun ownership and access will always be below the level to truly subvert the risk of totalitarianism. “Pew pew” vs. tanks, planes and bombs.The truth is, on the backside of this shooting at Greenwood Park Mall, we’re left with bodies and no accountability. Why? Because for accountability to be achieved, we would need to restrict personal gun ownership which would start a landslide of citizens truly asking for the return of power to them from their government. Less tanks, planes and bombs… because if we can’t have them, neither can you.And, what we know is that the government isn’t relinquishing any control. So blood on American streets will continue to be spilled and nothing will happen with guns because as long as we are fighting and killing each other under the guise of personal protection, freedom and “tyranny,” those in power are safe to truly do whatever they wish to restrict our freedom, movement, ability to reproduce or not…We’re doing their job for them. We’re the tyranny for the tyrant.Capiche? •. ( ."
philinquirer_2022_9,"People making a quarter-million dollars a year do not need government handouts. I have student loans and meet the requirements for debt relief, but it s not fair to ask taxpayers to pick up the tab.Just before Christmas a few years back, I was waiting in line at a busy South Philly bakery. When I reached the counter and placed an order for a dozen cannolis, the clerk informed me that, regrettably, the price of the cannoli had been increased that day by 25 cents.“Money goes to money,” she said with a shrug.That world-weary sentiment rings in my ears these days as I read about the Biden administration’s efforts to give free money to people who already have an advantage in life.Yes, I’m talking about student loan forgiveness.» READ MORE:How Biden’s student-debt relief is helping Philly-area borrowers: ‘I can pay rent and utilities’Forgiving student debtwon’t fix our higher education system, won’t make college more affordable, and won’t help the neediest members of society. But it will let President Joe Biden give a handout to some of his most loyal supporters — the college-educated middle class — while thumbing his nose at the working people who never went to college and those graduates who already paid their loans as promised.From the isolation of the Oval Office, handing out $10,000 or $20,000 of someone else’s money might look like a bright idea. Surrounded as he is by bright young people with elite diplomas, Biden might be forgiven for thinking that student debt is a widespread and pressing problem. Indeed,many of those clever young politicos stand to benefit personallyfrom this policy.Perhaps we have become so used to the welfare state that we don’t think about these things very deeply anymore, but the point of government intervention — of handing out the taxpayers’ money — was supposed to be to help those poor and disadvantaged people who could not help themselves. We can debate the best means of doing that, but there is a nobility in the sentiment behind the New Deal and the Great Society, one of a wealthy nation trying to lift up those who might get left behind.In what world does that description apply to college graduates who voluntarily made a deal to borrow money, received the educational benefit of that bargain, and now don’t want to hold up their end of the deal? Who in their right mind could call college-educated people disadvantaged when it has been proven time and again thatpeople with college degrees make far more over their lifetimes than people without? These excess earnings far exceed the cost of the education and credentials that makes them possible. Even people who did not finish college earn more than those who never went, though not by nearly as much as if they had finished their degrees.Biden’s decree looks even more bizarre when we see thatthe relief is available to people making up to $125,000 a year — or $250,000 for a married couple. This seems like something that we didn’t use to have to argue about, butpeople making a quarter-million dollars a year do not need government handouts.Even more debt relief is available for people who received Pell Grants when they went to school, a program designed to help kids from low-income households get their degrees. If you got a Pell Grant 15 years ago and you now make $100,000 a year: Congratulations! The system worked for you! You shouldn’t need any more government help.I will pay my own student loans this month, as I have for the last 17 years. I would rather keep the money — who wouldn’t? But even though I meet Biden’s requirements for relief, I can’t see how making the taxpayer pick up the tab is fair. Thefederal government ran a $2.77 trillion deficitlast year. Now, with the stroke of a pen, Biden wants to reduce future federal revenue bya further $395 billion. Biden will be out of office by the time that debt comes due, but we and our children and grandchildren will have to pay for all of it, eventually.Perhaps the biggest flaw of this jubilee is that it does not fix anything about our college system, and may make things worse. No one will be less likely to borrow because of this — if anything, students will probably borrow more, hoping that the next round of middle-class amnesty will help them pay it off. Colleges won’t lower tuition — why would they when Uncle Sam keeps throwing money at them?“Loan forgiveness does not fix anything about our college system, and may make things worse.”Real reform would take effort. Congress would have to think about the problem and even change the laws. But the only change they have made recently has been to make it harder for people to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy —a policy Biden voted for while a member of the Senate.For real change, Congress should do the opposite: have the bankruptcy code treat student loans like any other debt. Bankruptcy is not a pain-free fix: it has real consequences for a person’s finances. But it would offer a way out for those who are in genuine need while adding financial rigor to the system by making lenders think twice about giving an 18-year-old $100,000 of unsecured credit. That will, in turn, give colleges a real reason to reduce costs.Biden helped to close off that possibility but now wants to shower money indiscriminately on college-educated people, including many who are doing just fine in life. That rewards his voter base but fixes nothing about the system and shifts a financial burden onto taxpayers, which include people who never went to college and likely have fewer opportunities to earn as much as those who did.Alas, money goes to money.Kyle Sammin is editor-at-large at Broad + Liberty."

minnpost_2022_126,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Currently in America, abortion rights are in a more precarious position than they have been in a generation. The most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in decades will be ruling on newly enacted laws in bothTexasandMississippi, with the potential of overturningRoe v Wade.Unrestricted access to reproductive health care, including abortions is extremely important, and losing that access will hurt some communities more than others. Particularly vulnerable communities include people of a low socio-economic status, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community and people living in rural areas. I urge Minnesota lawmakers to move to invest in reproductive health care and abortion clinics in our state regardless of the Supreme Court decisions.Minnesota law will not be directly impacted by the decisions handed down by the courts regarding the Texas and Mississippi laws as a1995 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling gives constitutional protection to abortion in Minnesota. Given the current political make-up of Minnesota and our Supreme Court, it is unlikely that that ruling will be overturned anytime soon. Multiple states bordering Minnesota would immediately outlaw abortion however, and many reproductive health clinics will be forced to shut down as a result. This will lead to decreased access to abortion for Minnesota residents living on the border of those states. There will also be anincreased number of residents from other states traveling to Minnesota to access abortionand other health care. This increased demand will likely put a strain on providers in Minnesota, and could lead to increased waiting times, difficulty finding appointments and more. These obstacles will hamper access to health care for people who cannot travel or take time off from work, and those who must rely on clinics like Planned Parenthood the most. Minnesotans and residents of surrounding states who can afford to go to specialists or more expensive clinics, and those who can afford to travel and spend time waiting for abortion access will be less impacted, although it will still be an undue burden for them as well.The conversation about socio-economic status and health equity in Minnesota cannot be had without acknowledging the huge ethnic disparities in our state. People of color are muchmore likely to be in a lower socio-economic status in Minnesotaand are also less likely to have the ability to take time off from work to access an abortion. They also continue to experienceworse health outcomesacross the board than white Minnesotans. Ethnic disparities are also large in surrounding states, and there will be a similar impact for residents of those states.Although some would argue that a reduction in access to abortion would have a positive impact, and even save lives, research shows that reducing access to reproductive health care leads to increasedmaternal mortality, unsafe and unregulated abortions, reductions in preventative care treatment for other reproductive issues and anoverall decline in health outcomes. These impacts will be most felt by populations that rely on community clinics for overall reproductive health care and will exacerbate existing inequities. Without access to health care for all people, free of government interference, we are doomed to continue perpetuating harm onto vulnerable populations, and equity in health care and other areas of life cannot be achieved. It is a moral imperative that laws restricting access to reproductive health care and abortion are not allowed to go into effect.Kelsey Einertson is a masters of Public Health candidate at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health"
minnpost_2022_22,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We are approaching a breaking point in our communities. In every city neighborhood and in many of our suburbs, carjackings, armed assaults and shootings are daily occurrences.Teenagers should not be losing their lives at the hands of other teenagers with guns. Nobody should be afraid to go to the grocery store or drop their kids off at school. Parents should not be losing their children or loved ones because of police misconduct.We’re facing violence in all directions and we need leadership to respond with real, meaningful solutions. We need to pull together the people and the organizations in our communities who can help stop the violence – and we need to do it now.The issue with leadership is clear: We’re experiencing a failure of governance over the police department in our largest city. There are many ideas being thrown on the table, but we haven’t seen tangible action to address the shortcomings of the Minneapolis Police Department. The policies of city leaders are not being carried through in daily practice and that is one of the reasons we’re seeing so much distrust in the community.That distrust creates cracks in our foundation of justice and public safety – further-undermining confidence in our institutions and allowing violence to fester and grow. And too often, young people and families of color are paying the price for that ineptitude.In February, we had two 15-year-olds killed by other community members – and near school buildings, which should be the safest places for our youth. A 22-year-old was killed by the Minneapolis police, and a 17-year-old was arrested for the murder that led to the 22-year-old’s death. Tragedies like these only compound each other.To break this cycle of senseless violence, improve the safety of our communities, restore trust in our institutions of public safety, and break down the bias that has warped our justice system for far too long, we must work together.First, we need to empower the work and voices of community leaders who are deeply engaged in finding real solutions. We’ve seen incredible leadership from community groups who have taken the initiative to provide community-based prevention methods and solutions for rising crime. While community member engagement makes a difference, these groups can only do so much without city, county and state leaders providing additional resources.Our elected leaders must build better partnerships with the organizations that are intervening to stop violence daily, and who provide a pathway out for troubled young people. These partnerships should provide avenues for civic leaders to listen to community members and then provide with what’s needed for success and for communities to thrive.In concert, the Department of Public Safety should convene a metro-wide gun violence and armed-assault task force to address the rise in violence and save lives. That task force must include community leaders – nobody knows our communities better than the people who live in them.Working hand-in-hand with community organizations, judges, prosecutors, law enforcement, and others should sit at the same table, identify problems, find the resources for prevention and solutions, and act together.As we do the urgently-needed work of changing our public safety systems, it is still the responsibility of law enforcement to protect and serve residents. We need to enforce the law and make individuals accountable when they hurt others. But we can’t try to recycle a repressive system and hope for better results.That’s why the state needs to support efforts to recruit anewgeneration of police officers with a proven commitment to community service. Communities are looking for more diverse officers. We need a joint effort by public safety leaders and community members to recruit, train, and support those diverse candidates.We can also look to successful, community-oriented police departments – like inNewark, N.J., or New Haven, Conn.– who have regained the respect and trust of their communities as models. All of this reinforces the need for stronger leadership that delivers results, not just prepared remarks.Most importantly, prosperous communities are safe communities. We need to break down barriers for the small businesses, homeowners, civic and cultural organizations, and religious and community leaders who are the foundations of community prosperity. The parts of our community which have received the least investment should be our priority for support and growth.We cannot continue as we have been going. There are so many people doing amazing work right now and we need leaders who can find the money to support their work for our whole community. None of us can do this work alone.Ryan Winkler is the Minnesota House Majority Leader, an attorney, and a candidate for Hennepin County Attorney."

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_55,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°The dismantling of CNN as the Democrats’ leading network could be on the way with layoffs and cutbacks putting the once-dominant media outlet in decline.CNN began notifying staffers on Wednesday that there would be major layoffs of paid contributors and others “as part of a recalibrated reporting strategy,” according to a memo published by The Hollywood Reporter.“It will be a difficult time for everyone,” CNN CEO Chris Licht wrote in the memo. “Our people are the heart and soul of this organization. It is incredibly hard to say goodbye to any one member of the CNN team, much less many.”The cable giant has long been the leading anti-Trump media outlet with a relentless attack on the former president even after he left office. During Trump’s presidency, CNN reveled in being part of the “resistance” and saw its ratings jump.But lately the network’s ratings have lagged behind Fox News and even MSNBC. Now that’s embarrassing.The anti-Trump fervor could change with the new owner, Warner Bros. Discovery, whose CEO has indicated he wants more of a balance at the station.Trump-hating media reporter Brian Stelter, legal reporter Jeffrey Toobin and left-leaning White House correspondent John Harwood have already departed the network and more will be leaving soon.Licht described the changes as a “gut punch” and the network began informing employees Thursday of the layoffs.“Let’s take care of each other this week,” Licht wrote.The layoffs are not a surprise – they have been planned for months as part of CNN’s effort to restructure and vastly reduce spending.Most of the network’s leading anchors will not be affected by the cuts yet, according to The New York Times.But the network plans to slash about $100 million in spending, which undoubtedly will affect the news gathering operations.Licht earlier this year cut CNN’s original programming and documentaries” and killed the cable network’s streaming service after just weeks.One network insider told Fox News that “morale is as low as it’s ever been” though staffers who are laid off will get severance.What the “recalibrated reporting strategy” means is unclear, but that could signal CNN will have less paid Democratic talking heads."
suffolknewsherald_2022_91,"Published 8:00 pm Tuesday, May 10, 2022ByStaff ReportsIt’s easy to get citizens to fill the room for a public hearing on a controversial rezoning or conditional use permit. We get it. Few of us want anything in our neighborhood that would detract from our quality of life, much less potentially harm our property’s value.Yet, citizen engagement is much less robust when it comes time for a city or county to update its comprehensive plan — arguably the time to have a much more meaningful impact on land use decisions.In fact, the best time to have a say on how and where Suffolk grows is right now, as city leaders begin the first update of the community’s comprehensive plan in seven years.The 20-year plan, according to Planner Alexis Baker, is designed to be a long-range guide for a number of areas, including land use, housing, transportation, parks and open spaces, public safety, schools and economic development.To their credit, leaders are actively seeking participation from the citizenry.“You know your city and community the best,” Baker said. “Your input is essential to our work and will help shape the plan.”The process has the noble goal of producing a roadmap “that will maintain Suffolk’s quality of life while allowing for growth,” Baker said.There will be lots of opportunities for citizens to get involved: in-person focus groups on specific topics, and online through the project’s website,www.Suffolk2045.org, which will launch this month.It’s human nature to get worked up over a specific commercial or residential development, and the citizens who let their voices be heard during related public hearings are certainly within their rights to do so. They ultimately fail, though, getting a hard civics lesson in the process.The new comprehensive plan is a much more important opportunity for citizen input. To say that a community is at a crossroads is an overused metaphor, but it’s safe to say that city leaders’ planning decisions, including the content of the new comprehensive plan, will be consequential long beyond their time in office. Officeholders come and go, but citizens remain to enjoy the successes or cope with the errors of elected and appointed leadership.If you’ve had only a casual interest in local government over the years but care deeply about the future of Suffolk, this is the time to get more engaged.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

minnpost_2022_75,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The International Military Tribunal, comprised of jurists and judges from the World War II Allied nations of France, the U.K., the U.S. and the Soviet Union, prosecuted 24 leaders for the worst human rights abuses of the war. Julius Streicher was one of them.Streicher had never been a member of the Nazi Party. He had never killed anyone. He had never worked at concentration camps or rounded up Jews and others for deportation to their deaths.His crime? He disseminated information. He published and wrote Der Stürmer, a hate-filled weekly tabloid newspaper read by 480,000 people throughout Germany and available in huge public display cases in town squares in cities large and small. Der Stürmer printed invective about Jews and called for their extermination. Streicher had become a multimillionaire through this paper.His conviction established a precedent: incitement to commit genocide became a crime under international law.Fifty years later, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, created by the United Nations, prosecuted the people most responsible for the murders in 1994 of 800,000 innocent Tutsis and moderate Hutus.Three Rwandan men were indicted for incitement to genocide. These three men, like Streicher, didn’t kill anyone.Two were the founders of Radio Des Milles Collines, which spread anti-Tutsi hate over the air waves, inciting Rwandans to kill their friends, neighbors, co-workers and even family members. The third person was the founder, publisher and editor, like Streicher, of a tabloid that dehumanized and vilified the targeted group.All three men in the “media trial” were sentenced to more than 30 years in prison for incitement. The judges in that trial declared, “Without a firearm, machete, or any physical weapon, you caused the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians.”In 2010, the internet in Myanmar meant “Facebook.” Facebook was the only connection most people had with the electronic world. But Facebook had entered the Myanmar market woefully understaffed with speakers of the local languages and with few people to monitor the spike in users.What happened next was genocide by social media posts.A systematic Facebook campaign was begun to target the Rohingya, Myanmar’s small Muslim population that the U.N. calls “the most persecuted people on earth.” The operatives were members of the Myanmar military. Their anti-Rohingya propaganda incited murders, rapes, and the largest forced human migration in recent history — 750,000 Rohingya fled the army’s violence for safety in neighboring Bangladesh.The online campaign was carried out by hundreds of military personnel who created troll accounts, news and celebrity pages on Facebook and then flooded them with incendiary comments and posts timed for peak viewership.Facebook admitted that it was used to incite “offline violence.” Although the company took down the official accounts of senior Myanmar military leaders in August 2018, the breadth and details of the propaganda campaign apparently went undetected.The U.N. determined in 2018 that Facebook played a “determining role” in violence against the Rohingya, inciting widespread violence and amplifying hateful content through its algorithms.This is genocide by cell phone, an authoritarian government using a social network against its own people.The American complaint is on behalf of all Rohingya in the U.S. The case seeks at least $150 billion in compensation for “wrongful death, personal injury, pain and suffering, and loss of property.”U.S. internet companies are typically shielded from liability for their content. However, this case uses Burmese law for the damages done in Myanmar.The judges in that media trial in Rwanda said, “The power of the media to create and destroy fundamental human values comes with great responsibility. Those who control the media are accountable for its consequences.”Facebook must be held accountable.Ellen J. Kennedy, Ph.D., is the executive director of World Without Genocide, a human rights organization located at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, and an adjunct professor of law."
eugeneweekly_2022_2,"We ve got issues. First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a communist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak for me. The quote is well known, but how many know the story behind it? Martin Niemöller served his country as a U-boat captain during WWI and entered the ministry after the war.His autobiography,From U-Boat to Pulpit, became a best seller when published in 1933 and received positive reviews in Nazi papers. A very patriotic German and a religious conservative, Niemöller initially supported Hitler. He believed Hitler would bring a revival to the country and trusted his assurances that he would honor the independence of the church and respect Christian values. Like most German pastors of the time, Niemöller held anti-Semitic views. Nazi propaganda targeting Jews as the enemy of the Germany did not concern him. He drew the line, however, when it came to Christian converts of Jewish descent. For Niemöller, they were no different from any other member of the church. He therefore opposed the infamous “Aryan paragraph” that would deny Jews the rights of citizenship. In 1933 Niemöller organized pastors to provide support to the members of their congregations targeted as Jewish. Then working with Swiss theologian Karl Barth, he helped form the Confessing Church movement that stood in opposition to Hitler’s efforts to co-opt the German church into the Nazi program. Though the Confessing Church did not officially oppose Hitler, a few of its members were involved in resistance efforts, including Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the famed Christian martyr executed shortly before the end of the war. Niemöller’s sermons provide insight into the movement. His criticism of the Nazi regime is very scant at first and often in coded language. But as time went on and more of his colleagues were arrested, you can see his growing concern and anger. Never, however, does he express concern for Jewish citizens. He truly did not speak out. Nevertheless, Niemöller’s criticism of Hitler was too direct, and he was sent to the concentration camp outside of Berlin in 1937 where he remained until 1945. He escaped execution only because the SS lost control of the concentration camp in the final days of the war. The experience in that camp was revelatory. For the first time Niemöller could identify with the persecution of Jews and others under Nazi rule. He recognized that his resistance through the church was not enough and that he, and other patriotic citizens like him, had made the rise of Hitler possible. Once freed, he began working for a national confession of guilt, known as the “Stuttgart Confession,” issued by the German church in 1945. He became one of the most widely recognized leaders of the church and an outspoken peace activist. What is it they say about those ignorant of history who are doomed to repeat it? Niemöller offers the history lesson that we ignore at our own peril. The greatest threat to democracy comes not from outside our borders, but from within. Niemöller was a good patriot who loved his country, and along with so many others like him, naïvely voted for the man who brought the Holocaust and destroyed much of Europe. When Niemöller realized his error, it was too late. From the three years I lived in Germany, I learned that the German people are really not that different from us. And if someone like Hitler could take control of that country in the 1930s, it can also happen here today. Our only hope may be whether or not the Niemöllers of our generation will not be so deceived as he. Sadly, even after the Jan. 6 attack on democracy, too many seem all too willing to keep the blinders on. I fear for our future. On June 27, 1937, Niemöller told his congregation after speaking of the many colleagues who had been arrested: “It is a case of deciding whether we shall believe or not believe, whether we shall stand or fall, whether we shall choose salvation or perdition, life or death, and this decision must be made not in the future, but here and now.” They came for him four days later, and there was no one left to speak for him. ν"

Many of the boys’ parents want them to become things like doctors, lawyers and accountants and are pushing them toward those careers, to the serious detriment of the mental health of some of the teens.In a quiet moment in his classroom, with the students’ rapt attention, Keating tells the boys, “We don’t read and write poetry because it’s cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.”Keating’s passion for art doesn’t win him any friends among the boys’ parents — nor, for that matter, among the school’s administration.Thankfully, we’ve progressed beyond the point where most schools have seen the value in artistic pursuits, but with so many priorities, many schools in America still struggle to find the time and resources for arts education.Thankfully, Suffolk Public Schools provides a variety of arts education options, and there is also a nonprofit organization in town that holds an annual gala supporting the arts. That gala is coming up soon, and we hope you’ll support it.The Suffolk Education Foundation is holding its seventh annual gala from 6 to 8:30 p.m. on March 16, at the Hilton Garden Inn Riverfront, 100 E. Constance Road. Over the years, it has returned more than $40,000 to support music, theater and visual arts programs in Suffolk Public Schools.The theme for this year’s gala is “American Road Trip.” Folks can enjoy music performed by the Northern Shores Elementary School Chorus, Nansemond River High School Jazz Band, John Yeates Middle School Chorus, King’s Fork High School Orchestra, John Yeates Middle School Jazz Band and King’s Fork High School Chorus as they play songs that highlight highways, cities, states, landmarks and natural beauty across America.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_96,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Despite all the misread tea leaves by pollsters ahead of the Nov. 8 election, one pre-election poll offered signals about the influences affecting the choices of Republicans and Democrats as well as the ever-important independents who now dominate national election results. Americans headed into the election deeply concerned about rising political violence and feared an upswing in the months following last week’s vote.In spite of eye-popping spectacles of right-wing violence — including the Oct. 24 hammer attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband and the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection — only a slight plurality of respondents in a Nov. 2 Washington Post-ABC News poll believed Republicans were solely responsible for the current climate. Most respondents said that both parties are to blame.Asked if political tensions have reached the point that there’s an increased risk of violence, a whopping 88% said they were very or somewhat concerned. Republicans were blamed by 31% or respondents versus 25% who blamed Democrats, while 32% blamed both parties equally.Nevertheless, Republicans joking about the Pelosi attack and the threat of a militant response to a GOP loss last Tuesday may have helped drive independents into the Democratic camp and prevent a Republican sweep. What’s absolutely clear is that 2020 rage and threats of violence did not sell with voters in 2022.More than half of respondents in the Nov. 2 poll said they were only somewhat or not at all interested in last Tuesday’s election, but overwhelming majorities were attuned to violence.Asked which party does a better job with the major issues of the day, Democrats held an edge on addressing abortion and climate change, but Republicans heavily dominated regarding the economy and crime. As for addressing threats to democracy, registered voters gave Democrats only a 4 percentage-point preference over Republicans — 47% to 43%. That result might help explain why the Capitol insurrection could unfold live on television and dominate the news through months of investigations and congressional hearings, yet voters still didn’t massively punish Republican candidates for it on Tuesday.It appears that public attention to the insurrection and threats to democracy has waned considerably while the more immediate issues of crime and the economy weighed more heavily on voters’ minds. The Capitol Hill violence may have wound up being overshadowed by inflation and the fear of violent crime in voters’ everyday lives.And no matter how much the pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine have sent worldwide inflation soaring, voters still tend to blame the party in power when things aren’t working right.Among respondents, 39% identified as independents, while 27% sided each with the Republican and Democratic parties. Ultimately, it appears, independents chose not to punish Democrats as much as other pre-election polls indicated they would. The party that stops trying to play to the base with messages of rage and instead focuses on winning over independents is the party most likely to prevail in 2024.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"

minnpost_2022_59,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I have been a lifelong “biblioholic;” I began collecting boys’ sports books by age 7. Even if I lived to the biblical Methuselah’s 969 years, I could never read all the thousands of books scattered throughout my home.During my adult life, it has been a rare week when I did not visit at least one new and a couple of used bookstores. As author Tom Raabe put it, I have “the habitual longing to purchase, read, store, admire and consume books in excess.” I have always been steadfast in resisting treatment for my unquenchable passion.In my younger days, whenever I traveled to an academic conference, I took along an empty suitcase. I always had a shifting list in my mind of 700 to 800 books that I sought. I devoted at least one day perusing the cities’ best used bookstores. The internet ruined that pleasure. Now I can order any book I desire from anywhere in the world with a click of the mouse.Twelve years ago, on my 65th birthday, I was diagnosed with a rare terminal cancer, carrying a medium survival rate of 14 months. I am long past my expiration date. That brush with mortality awakened me to the reality that neither I, nor my library, were immortal. It was time to begin gifting my books.Pre-COVID, I held an annual book-gifting event. I invited a few hundred former students and friends to my home for two days of book scavenging. Each year, they took home between 600 and 800 books. Once a hungry, young mind found more than 100 volumes, another time someone gathered 75 worthy gifts. COVID willing, next spring I will resume my weekend event, offering at least 1,000 gifts.Health issues have again plagued me during the past six months. I had heart surgery last summer, with three new stents inserted and two old ones unclogged. A couple of weeks later, I had a major epileptic seizure resulting in a 90-day hold on my driving privileges. The risk of a stroke is nearly three times higher in older patients who have a late-onset of epilepsy.The Angel of Death has been my constant, menacing companion for 12 years. Now his rancid breath grows closer. In the back of my mind, I have always been collecting and curating books for the Metropolitan State University’s Library and Learning Center where I taught for nearly four decades. I retired last spring at age 76 as a professor emeritus. Originally a college without walls, they only built a library in 2004. For a university, it has a bare-bones collection.Some university-library faculty colleagues are regularly coming to my home to cull roughly 2,500 rare and hard-to-find hardcover editions of classic works. I can think of no finer way to celebrate and honor my beloved Metro State’s 50th anniversary. With each volume bearing my donor’s stamp, I and my library will fittingly live on in a public sanctuary.Monte Bute has been a bookish activist, writer and gadfly in Minnesota for 55 years."

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_79,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Nonstop cable news presenters were agog and aghast. They warned us, last Wednesday, that we were about to witness an epic moment. Their news worlds were about to collide.Unprecedented and seemingly unrelated mega-news stories, foreign and domestic, were careening at us simultaneously, anchors explained. They all might suddenly gush out of our Great News Funnel – and into our living rooms – at once. Just imagine it:NEWS GUSH: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was secretly flying to Washington hoping to save his fledgling democracy from Vladimir Putin’s invaders. In a few hours, Zelenskyy would meet with President Joe Biden, and then address Congress. A day earlier, Zelenskyy was at the bloody front line, boosting his troops’ morale.NEWS GUSH: For the first time ever, a House committee has urged the Justice Department to criminally prosecute a former U.S. president for insurrection. The select House committee probing the Jan. 6 riot and insurrection said it was releasing its report detailing evidence of crimes former President Donald Trump committed to prevent Congress from certifying his 2020 election defeat. Including that Trump did “incite,” “assist,” “aid and comfort” an insurrection – violating the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.NEWS GUSH: A House committee was finally making public Trump’s income tax returns and that Trump’s IRS never conducted the required audit of the president’s tax returns (which it did on every president since Richard Nixon . Trump paid virtually no taxes in three years since 2016. (How much did you pay in those years? So TV’s anchors were fretting aloud – what should they do if all the news gushes out at once? But lo, it all happened quite manageably. The historic mega-news arrived in a steady but orderly mainstream flow. (Partly because the Jan. 6 panel delayed its report a day. Zelenskyy’s Wednesday night addressed to Congress was unlike anything ever seen. Imagine a presidential State of the Union address – except the speaker Congress is repeatedly standing to applaud is a dark-bearded man in olive green army combat pants and sweater. Zelenskyy, determined to speak in English, effusively thanked Congress and Americans for their aid.And his message led us to see the true big picture of our time: “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”Indeed, we are investing in our democracy when we, and NATO, invest in Ukraine’s democracy. We must stop those autocrats who for their own egos seek to gain or maintain power by using force or fraud to overthrow democracies. This week’s breaking news reminded us that Putin and Trump, two autocrats of our era, have used force, fraud and Big Lies to try to topple both the world’s iconic and fledgling democracies.Any chronicling of our times must include the assaults on democracies undertaken by Putin and Trump – whether just to stay in power, or just empower their egos. Or maybe a little of both. If a book will someday chronicle their misbegotten conduct, it could be titled: “Autocracy’s War on Democracy.”Putin and Trump are two very different figures who seem to have a bizarre affinity for one another. Both operate on shared assumptions that truth, facts and commitments can always be bent, discarded or deep sixed – and human lives can be treated with equal disregard. Just to fuel their high-octane egos. Putin and Trump could be the Marxists of our times – not Karl, but Groucho and Harpo doing their mirror scene. Except this is deadly serious.Consider Putin’s children of Ukraine: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported that 408 children are included in the 6,557 Ukraine citizens who Putin’s troops, bombs and missiles have killed since Putin began his war against the fledgling democracy of Ukraine. And the actual numbers are far higher, because the surveyors lacked access to many devastated sites.But also consider Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump ordered his Secret Service to turn off the magnetometer weapons searches of the rally he was sending to the Capitol to stop the election certification. Why? Trump reportedly said many with guns were entering his rally – but they weren’t going to shoot him, so let them keep their guns. And when that mob broke and entered and overran the Capitol, Trump watched for hours on TV, ignoring pleas that he tell his faithful to go home..7 p.m. update:The Central Pacific Hurricane Center reports as of 5 p.m., Tropical Storm Hone is 125 miles southeast of Hilo with sustained winds of 65 mph moving west at 14 mph. Modest strengthening is expected over the next 24 to 36 hours, with Hone peaking just below hurricane"
philinquirer_2022_20,"We should base our criminal justice policies on reliable data and not, as was the case in the U.S. Senate campaign, on raw appeals to fear.The recent campaign for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania was marked by a highly contentious attack on John Fetterman’s role in rejuvenating a dormant commutation process for persons serving life sentences without parole. He wasaccused of releasing dangerous murderersat a time when there has been a spike in homicides in Philadelphia.As is often the case on politically divisive issues, the rhetoric ignored reality. We understand the differing viewpoints on criminal punishment, but those beliefs cannot justify the intentional distortion of reform programs. There is strong empirical evidence that rigid life without parole sentencing in Pennsylvania does not provide for greater public safety. To the contrary, this practice has long resulted in disproportionate punishment, no greater public safety, and large economic costs to imprison older and nondangerous persons.The great majority of statesimpose life sentences with the possibility of parole. For the crime of felony murder, where one can be convicted without causing or intending a death, Pennsylvania is one of only six states that have a mandatory sentence of life without parole for offenses other than intentional and deliberate first-degree murder.In Pennsylvania, the only “safety valve” is commutation, which permits the governor to make persons eligible for parole. For the period of 1950 through the late 1970s, that process worked well, with the commutation of a majority of persons initially sentenced to life without parole, and no discernible impact on violent crime rates.However, with the advent of the war on crime, governors in Pennsylvania rarely commuted life sentences, and a state constitutional amendment required an unanimous vote of the Board of Pardons for the governor to act. As a result, the number of persons serving life without parole and “virtual” life sentences of 50 or more years quickly increased to 8,242,a number higher than any other state other than Florida.At the same time, the state prison population increased exponentially from about 7,500 in the late 1970s to50,000 in 2019, even as the violent crime rates of the 1980s and 1990s were reversed. For the period 1979-2015, there wasan average of only one commutation a year, which meant that almost all persons sentenced to life died in prison.» READ MORE:From one victim’s family, a call to abolish life sentences for second-degree murder | OpinionDid public safety require these extreme sentences and the virtual end to commutation? Two recent developments provide powerful evidence to the contrary. First, the increase in commutations generated by Fetterman as a member of the Board of Pardons, while very modest, has proven to be an absolute success.For the period 2019-2022, there were 40 commutations, and not a single person in this group has returned to prison for the commission of another crime.Second, as a result of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that juveniles may not be sentenced to life without parole, in thepast several years 269 juvenileswho had served decades in prison were resentenced and released on parole. To date,only two have been rearrested on felony charges, a recidivism rate comparable with the nonprison population.Similar results have been seen among federal prisoners granted early release from long drug sentences by President Barack Obama in the closing years of his administration.These results were not a matter of luck. Fetterman made commutation a central issue of reform. With community and academic support, he encouraged applications from incarcerated persons deserving of commutation, and he established a more effective and reliable process in securing and presenting pertinent information to the Pardons Board.Equally important, all persons released were provided with necessary transitional housing and social worker assistance with respect to employment and other crucial needs for those reentering society after so many years in confinement.The same is true for the juvenile lifers. A coordinated effort of reentry support by the Juvenile Law Center, the Defender Association of Philadelphia, and other pro bono attorneys assisted in their becoming law-abiding and productive members of our community.The recent election campaign focused on the increase in shootings and homicides in Pennsylvania. These troubling developments must be addressed with fair and effective law enforcement and attention to the root social causes of violence. We should base our criminal justice policies on reliable data and not, as was the case in the Senate campaign, on false claims of releases of dangerous persons and raw appeals to fear.In the end, there is no reason why we cannot have fairness, equal treatment, and public safety. Gov.-elect Josh Shapiro, who served as a member of the Board of Pardons, should continue the commutation process, and the General Assembly should pass reform legislation providing for life with parole.David Rudovsky is a senior fellow at the Penn Carey School of Law and a civil rights lawyer in Philadelphia.

suffolknewsherald_2022_44,"Published 11:43 pm Tuesday, July 5, 2022ByStaff ReportsWith more revitalization coming to its western side, downtown Suffolk is brimming with potential. The new Festival Park at Washington and Saratoga streets could be transformative as an outdoor event space that brings foot traffic to support neighboring businesses.Amid a wave of violent crime in the downtown area, such potential is fragile, however, and decisions by city leaders are fraught with the risk of ruining a good thing before it ever gets started.That’s why we appreciate Suffolk City Council’s go-slow approach as downtown establishments clamor to extend live entertainment hours until 2 a.m.As Mayor Mike Duman noted: “The worst we can do is be premature in extending these hours and then there turns out to be a couple of unfortunate incidents. And then what’ll happen is there will be a perception that it’s not safe to go to downtown Suffolk, and that is the last thing that we want. So I think we’re all working toward a common goal.”There’s an old saying that not much good happens after midnight, but lots of bad can happen. Thus the need to proceed cautiously in creating the vibrant nightlife that most agree is needed downtown.The controversy over live entertainment came to a head when the owners of two restaurants, Renneé’s Restaurant and Lounge at 156 W. Washington St. and High Tide Restaurant & Raw Bar at 130 N. Commerce St., received notices of violation for allowing live entertainment without a conditional use permit. Both would like to see downtown live entertainment hours extended until at least 2 a.m.The owners of High Tide — open 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily — had requested a conditional use permit to allow for live entertainment indoors from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to midnight on Friday and Saturday. It had also requested outdoor entertainment hours from 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. to allow for acoustic music on its patio. The Planning Commission modified High Tide’s hours of outside entertainment to Fridays through Sundays only from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m., and it will allow live entertainment to begin at 9 a.m.In a 7-1 vote, with Donald Goldberg voting no, City Council approved High Tide’s permit request, but modified the outdoor entertainment hours to go between noon and 6 p.m. The vote for Renneé’s permit request, which had the same recommended hours from the city’s planning department, was also 7-1, with Goldberg in opposition.The city’s unified development ordinance requires businesses to obtain a conditional use permit to establish a bar and nightclub within the central business district. As defined by the city, a bar and nightclub is a restaurant or similar establishment in which there is a dance floor or live entertainment.Restaurants and bars can stay open until midnight Sundays through Thursdays and until 2 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, by right, but if they offer live entertainment, it has to end at 11 on weeknights and midnight on weekends, with noise being the primary factor in that, according to Planning and Community Development Director Kevin Wyne.Councilman Tim Johnson, who agreed with Duman that weekend entertainment hours will eventually be extended to 2 a.m., called the council’s action “the right decision for right now for our growing city.”We agree.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_80,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Inappropriate bookInappropriate bookI am a retired airline pilot of 25 years, father of two amazing young men, and grandpa of a beautiful little girl.I was appalled to discover there is a sexually graphic book in the children’s section in many of Hawaii’s libraries, including Hawaii State Library, Hilo Public Library, Lihue library and many more!This book is entitled, “Let’s Talk About It: The Teen’s Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human (A Graphic Novel .”This book not only describes sex acts but graphically shows cartoon images of minors in both hetero and gay sex positions!I remember having to be 18 years old to get a “Playboy,” and now a 10-year-old and younger can check out a graphic novel at the local library. This is not OK!When do morals and protecting our keiki come into play?When children are exposed to sex too soon, it affects who they become and the kinds of intimate relationships they have. Books like this only confuse children who cannot truly comprehend what they are reading and the images they are looking at.What happened to the standards of what books are allowed in our public libraries? Who is in charge of putting these sexually explicit books on the shelves for our keiki, and why?As a father and grandparent, I feel the parent is responsible for educating their children about sex. I believe the library should have a section where parents can check out books about sex and share it with their keiki as they see fit.However, in this book, the pictures are cartoons of children performing sex acts which each other, and that is not appropriate. It is like child pornography, which is illegal!Because of that, this book should be taken out of all Hawaii libraries immediately!Vincent JahnKailua-KonaPGV concernsI wasn’t able to attend the recent Puna Geothermal Venture meeting, but from the information I just received, PGV and Hawaiian Electric are grasping at straws.Recently, they had an average output of 18 megawatts and somehow believe adding three more wells will increase production output. It all comes from the same source, so where do they get get the idea that three more wells in the same limited area well field will provide an increase in production?That would require an increase in magma, which doesn’t appear to be happening.We have had a population explosion from the continent, probably where they have geothermal and believe it’s the same here as there.Where there are geysers, it’s a natural phenomena, whereas here in Puna it’s unnatural.There, they rely on the planetary tectonics to generate steam, but here cold water must be forced onto hot rock.When the foreign-owned corporation lobbied the U.S. government, they claimed it was clean, green and sustainable. Clean does not release hydrogen sulfide and a number of other toxic subterranean gasses. Green would not require pentane in any stage of production, and sustainable means they could provide a continuous level of power necessary to supply a good share of the island.Depending on nature to do what you want nature to do for you is risky at best. Then there’s the fragile East Rift Zone that PGV depends upon for permeability. Without going into further detail on that, look up the Hilina Slump.Dave KisorPahoa"
suffolknewsherald_2022_124,"Published 8:26 pm Friday, December 2, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThe News-Herald has been pleased to carry on an annual tradition that has special meaning to many of our readers — printing Suffolk children’s letters to Santa Claus.Ever since an editor at The (New York Sun penned the most popular editorial of all time, “Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus,” in 1897, newspapers and Father Christmas have been indelibly linked.The opinion piece, the most reprinted editorial in the English language, was written in response to a letter from 8-year-old Virginia O’Hanlon inquiring about Santa Claus’ existence after hearing from her friends that he wasn’t real.“Papa says, ‘If you see it in The Sun it’s so,’” she famously wrote.Perhaps it’s their brutal honesty, hilarious requests or the simple fact that reading their letters takes us back to our own childhoods, but of the thousands of pages of content we publish each year, the letters in our Santa Letter section seemingly outshine them all when it comes to community goodwill. We believe it’s a good way to wrap up the year on a positive note.We are proud of this annual staple of the season that you can return to with your kids when they are grown and have small letter-writers of your own. It is a perfect way to make a memento you can hold onto forever.We’ve put the call out to all the schools, so some of your kids may have already been writing — and dreaming — away. Teachers should get us their students’ letters no later than noon Tuesday, Dec. 6. Letters should be submitted to the child’s teacher, as all letters are handed through local schools for delivery to the newspaper. Students in preschool, kindergarten and first and second grades in both public and private schools are encouraged to share their wishes for this year’s letters to Santa.Important note to both young and old: We make sure that every letter we receive before the deadline is transcribed before we responsibly forward them to the North Pole to the Jolly Old Elf himself.This year the annual Christmas Greetings special section will be published in the Dec. 21 edition.It’s our way of saying Merry Christmas from Your Hometown Newspaper.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_13,"Published 9:10 pm Friday, December 16, 2022ByLetters to the EditorEditor:Last week, City Council voted to restrict through truck traffic on several streets in North Suffolk, including Shoulders Hill and Suffolk Meadows Boulevard. I appreciate Council responding to citizen concerns about the increase in tractor-trailer problems in that area.Whenever I drive that way I get a clear picture of what we need to prevent right outside downtown Suffolk. I recently wrote a letter about this, which I’d like to expand on by sharing some observations from the city’s planning documents that make me scratch my head.I had never read a staff report, reviewed a Traffic Impact Study, or heard of a Comprehensive Plan until recently—when I learned that a developer wants to rezone parcels on both Lake Kilby/Lake Cohoon and Manning Roads to allow for over 200 and 300 homes, respectively.It was a new experience for me to request documents from the City, but I have since looked at multiple residential rezoning requests. Some interesting trends have jumped out at me. First, is that the staff reports presented to the Planning Commission and City Council only note new peak hour vehicle trips projected by traffic studies, but not the projected new trips for the entire day. In the example of Lake Kilby Road, the difference is 300-plus peak hour trips verses more than 2,000 for a whole day. There is also no mention of projected vehicle trips for other upcoming nearby developments. In the case of Manning Road, the projected new peak hour trips are more than 500 while the daily trip number is more than 2,800. Of course, peak hour traffic is important, but these daily totals are no small matter for our quality of life and roads.The 2035 Comprehensive Plan (written in 2015 is a very important planning document used to inform growth and development decisions. Several policies from the plan are commonly used to help justify residential rezoning, but Policy 4-1 is one that especially struck me. It states: “Provide opportunities for residents to adopt a lifestyle that is less dependent on auto travel.”Let the irony of that sink in while you imagine an extra 2,000 daily vehicle trips on rural, ditch-lined roads combined with thousands of new tractor-trailers driving throughout the city.Citizens are now speaking out about what is happening on our roads. Their actual experiences and concerns should hold the most weight in these large-scale decisions that cost the city a lot of money and potentially disrupt the way of life so many people enjoy.Suffolk is currently working on a 2045 Comprehensive Plan, but we need a pause on much of this rezoning now before our road situation gets any worse. We need to ensure that future development is more compatible with reality than a plan written seven years ago.Bryan HarrisSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_18,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Women’s History Month had its origins in the early 1900s with the declaration of one global day per year, International Women’s Day on March 8, to celebrate the social, political, economic and cultural achievements of women and to highlight the inequalities that still plague women’s full emancipation.In 1981, Congress expanded recognition of women to one whole week, “Women’s History Week.” And since 1995, presidents have issued annual proclamations designating the entire month of March as “Women’s History Month.”At what point will we stop celebrating a day, a week or month to acknowledge the contributions women make every day? Women should simply be included equally in our history.The fact that there is no formal guarantee of sex equality in our Constitution is a glaring omission that needs immediate rectification. Every other democracy in the world has some provision of sex equality in their founding document, but not the United States.Congress has plenary power to declare that all the requirements to adopt the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA as the 28thAmendment have been achieved. Congress also has the power to create time limits, delete them or simply ignore them.Never in the history of this country has an amendment to the Constitution, having achieved all constitutional requirements set out by Article V, that is adopted by two-thirds of Congress and ratified by three-fourths of states, been stopped in its tracks by an arbitrary time limit until women’s rights were on the docket.The House chose last year to remove the time limit on the ERA. And now the Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to act on companion language to highlight the 50thanniversary of the Senate’s final passage of the amendment.The ERA is spectacularly contemporaneous. Today women are disproportionally disadvantaged by the lack of paid family leave and dearth of affordable childcare; they are a majority of workers paid at or below minimum wage; women on average make 79 cents to a man’s dollar, a wage gap that is much more severe for Black, Indigenous, Latina, Asian, women of color and disabled women; two-thirds of seniors living below the poverty level are women; and today women fight and die for their country and still don’t have equal rights. These inequities have only been exacerbated by the effects of the COVID pandemic.Some opponents worry about states recissions. Just look to the 14th& 15thAmendments for examples of states attempting to rescind and being turned back by the Supreme Court. No recissions have ever been recognized by the courts.Here in Minnesota, we have legislation to add an ERA to our state constitution. It is sailing through the Minnesota House, but the bottleneck for the past several years has been Minnesota Senate leadership. Minnesota is part of a minority of states that still do not recognize gender equality in their state constitutions.We’re simply asking to let the people vote on whether to add gender equality into our state constitution.This International Women’s Day, in honor of Women’s History Month, ERA Minnesota will be presenting a petition to Minnesota Senate leaders called “Minnesotans for Equality.” Let the people vote.Help us unblock the bottleneck.

eugeneweekly_2022_49,"We ve got issues. The term “Iconoclasm” stems from the Greek description of the movement to destroy cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious (Oxford English Dictionary . It is typically associated with opposition to the use of religious images (I.e., “icons” as objects of veneration, but is equally applicable to cultural, political and other societal norms in general. We are witnessing political iconoclasm today, as the Republican Party methodically embarks on a mission to demolish traditional norms and principles en route to completing the execution of democracy in the birthplace of modern democracy — the United States — and its over two centuries of Constitutional government. Over the past five years, this anti-Constitutional momentum has accelerated at a breakneck pace. If I had to select a defining moment from a cast of thousands, it would be when Donald Trump stoked the idea during a 2016 campaign rally that if his opponent won the election there was nothing his supporters could do to keep their guns except perhaps “Second Amendment” solutions. Thus was introduced the concept of violence against one’s political opposition (and frankly his thinly veiled cover of subtlety has never risen higher than middle school level . This remark, coming from no less than a candidate for the highest office in the nation, was an unmistakable warning sign of what was to befall our political system after the election. And, predictably, we were indeed treated to barely disguised threats against political opponents, against media critics and against those who placed duty above the demands of the Party leader — such as whistleblowers and honest election officials — and overt undisguised threats and acts of violence by his followers became common grist on nightly news. For the first time in memory we experienced election overseers and volunteers at voting polls seeking police protection while they did their patriotic duty. This new order of political non-etiquette reached its zenith on Jan. 6 (another date joining Dec. 7 on the calendar as historical days of infamy when a mob was incited to storm the Capitol to prevent the transition of power to the president overwhelmingly chosen by the people to replace the rejected incumbent and his increasingly authoritarian agenda. As this essay is being written, an ongoing Congressional investigation into this violent insurrection is unearthing evidence that the planning surrounding the Jan. 6 violence included a powerpoint presentation by highly placed officials and advisers occupying sensitive positions with access to the White House regarding details on exactly how the election results were to be nullified to allow the losing incumbent to remain in office indefinitely. The insurrectionists included those contemplating physical harm to targeted political representatives, which even involved executing some on a gallows erected nearby on Capitol grounds. In the wake of this violent uprising against democracy we now are hearing talk about the looming spectre of civil war, secession and bloody internecine conflict as party members flash military weaponry in their Christmas greetings to constituents, asking Santa to bring more ammo (smashing the icons of peace and goodwill in a season that’s sacred to many and that’s already wounded by another mass school shooting at a high school in Michigan . Beyond normalizing a violent motif, disparagement of certain racial, ethnic, religious and sexual identity has flamed like wildfire. Acceptance or even tolerance of the disfavored categories is scorned as “woke” sentimentality. As to what remains of the Constitution after four years of pillage, the answer is very little. The rule of law has been effectively riddled with corrupt exceptions, the emoluments clause swept into the trash, the appropriations clause and its authorized spending pirated away to build a symbolic Great Wall or dangled before a foreign potentate to extort a black eye optic investigation of a domestic political opponent of the party leader. Worst of all, the impeachment process which the founders envisioned to be protection against the tyrant they foresaw as our democracy’s greatest danger has been shelved, as that prophesied tyrant proved too strong for the branch of government the founders trusted with the task. The founders never dreamed that its carefully constructed political system would produce a party so subservient and lacking in principles that it would slavishly adopt a platform consisting not of fulfilling the will of the people — but only the whims of the party’s leader. Indeed, the party is now at work to coordinate voter suppression, gerrymandering and a major facelift to the Electoral College system to create a model wherein the popular vote in the next presidential election cycle will be reduced to a mockery, entirely subordinated to the manipulation of party apparatchiks in state legislatures. Thus, in the event the party’s candidate is again soundly rejected by a majority of the people who actually vote or who are eligible to vote, but who are denied the opportunity by the party’s suppression tactics, their voices will be irrelevant. This is truly the ultimate disassembling of the principles and foundational values of our Constitutional democratic system of government. Steve Bannon, one of the architects hoping to contribute to the new order that will emerge from the rubble of the old, refers to this demolition process as the “deconstruction” of the state. That is much too polite a term, and perhaps so is “Iconoclasm.” Yet mine is accurate enough to make the point. The party being diagnosed and soon to be judged by history is no longer attached to the guiding principles it once espoused. It is instead tearing down that venerated heritage and turning its direction towards what it previously regarded as heresy or treason — and in so doing it is destroying what our nation used to proudly represent. Lastly, I do not want to overlook another “deconstructed” icon — the Supreme Court. The party obstructed the President’s prerogative of nominating candidates to fill vacancies on the court in President Barack Obama’s last year of office on the basis that it was an election year, yet hypocritically reversed that premise in President Trump’s last few months in office. This maneuver changed the composition of the court to a supermajority conservative court for possibly decades. Another norm was shattered, and the collateral consequences from this disrespect of tradition was the implosion of the court’s image as a non-partisan impartial tribunal above the fray of political ideology. In the public’s eye, and even in the words of some of the justices, the integrity of their decisions is at substantial risk. This is no small blow to our Constitutional system of government. If we are not viewed as being governed under the rule of law, and if we lose the confidence that the law is being applied equally and correctly to all the people, we become a fake democracy where liberty is fragile and our Constitution negotiable. If the court were to suffer the loss of its institutional respect, the nation would lose its guiding compass. The party is no longer recognizable. It has turned against the principles it used to embrace. It has become the Party of Iconoclasm, and we need to open our eyes to its transformation. That is the reality of Jan. 6. To save democracy we must, at a minimum, recognize that truth. We must also have a sobering discussion with ourselves. Do we really want our political and ideological differences to lead us down a path that culminates in totalitarianism? If anyone harbors any doubt about where the party desires to take America, please ponder its admiration for the policies of Hungary under strongman Victor Orban, who has transformed that country from democratic ideals to a de facto white supremacist authoritarian regime. A conservative political delegation from America headed by former Vice President Mike Pence paid homage to Orban recently by making a pilgrimage to Budapest to do him honor at an ultra right wing nationalistic conference focusing on authoritarian anti-democratic agenda. Orban, some of us may recall, is notable for once having unilaterally dismissed his country’s parliament, which then later conferred virtually absolute power on Orban, including authority to imprison members of the media for criticizing him. The European Union has considered declassifying Hungary as a democracy. And the Iconoclast Party sitting at Orban’s throne to take notes and learn from him is a frightening portent of its intended final destination. ν Thomas Coffin is a retired United States magistrate judge.

I walked into my classes to be met with empty desks and substitute teachers. This is not just a problem at Nansemond River though, many other schools in Suffolk are also suffering from this. As mentioned in the article, four schools went virtual temporarily “due to a high number of COVID-19 cases at those schools forcing many staff and students to be in quarantine.” It is clear that covid is still a prominent issue that is also affecting the education of our community’s children.Though some may disagree, I believe this decision was made with the safety of students and staff in mind. Many staff members and students were and still are uncomfortable with the possibility of being around others without masks.Sydni PolkSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_7,"It’s the time of year when we see a lot more mail trucks trundling through neighborhoods as letter carriers work hard to deliver everyone’s holiday cards and packages on time.It’s the time of year when we see a lot more mail trucks trundling through neighborhoods as letter carriers work hard to deliver everyone’s holiday cards and packages on time.But this season we have something new to celebrate: The U.S. Postal Service’s announcement this week that it will spend billions of dollars to buy tens of thousands of electric delivery vehicles over the next few years. It’s a victory in the fight against climate change and a welcome shift by an agency that until recently had intended to update its huge, aging fleet with another generation of gas guzzlers. It’s also a win for public health, as a growing number of zero-emission mail trucks will soon start to deliver not only letters and packages, but cleaner air to every corner of the nation.The Postal Service will buy 106,000 delivery vehicles by 2028, of which 66,000 will be electric, and plans to purchase zero-emission delivery trucks exclusively by 2026. The $9.6 billion plan is a dramatic change from earlier this year, when Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who was appointed during the Trump administration, planned to make only 10% of the next-generation fleet electric and add as many as 165,000 new gas-guzzling delivery trucks over the next decade that get less than 9 miles per gallon. That would have been a huge mistake considering these vehicles last 30 years and could be on the roads polluting the air and warming the climate into the 2060s.The Biden administration, which does not have direct control over the Postal Service, pushed back nonetheless. California, New York and more than a dozen other states filed suit in April to halt the purchase of gas-powered trucks, joining environmental groups in demanding investments in clean, zero-emission vehicles instead.California’s intervention “played a big part in stopping USPS from committing to decades of air pollution around the nation,” said Liane Randolph, who chairs the state Air Resources Board.While the Postal Service will need to do more to fully electrify its aging fleet of more than 220,000 vehicles, this move helps put us closer to achieving President Biden’s climate goals, including an order he issued last year for the federal government to purchase only zero-emission vehicles by 2035, and to do so by 2027 for light-duty vehicles. The nation’s largest vehicle fleet now has the potential to become its largest electric one too. Instead of lagging behind private-sector companies such as Amazon and FedEx, the Postal Service can help lead the way toward a zero-emission future.Mail delivery trucks are especially well-suited for electrification because they run defined, local routes with low daily mileage and have hours of operation that allow them to be easily recharged. Because these vehicles serve virtually every community, electrifying them will bring widespread benefits, curbing air pollution while reducing fuel and maintenance costs and our dependence on oil.It seems especially significant that something as ordinary and ubiquitous as the white mail truck will now help the nation blaze a trail toward a fossil-free future through every neighborhood in the country. And we won’t have to wait for years either. The new vehicles are expected to go into service on postal routes in late 2023.That’s a gift we should all welcome this holiday season and enjoy for years to come.— Los Angeles Times."

I’ve been donating to that organization for years, either by donating nonperishable food at drop-off points or through payroll deductions.My adult daughter used The Food Basket when she was struggling with trying to put food on the table for herself and her young family.I hope that you will continue to be generous the person that you are, Mr. Akamine. And, please know that you are truly appreciated even if there is no acknowledgement.Kevin ThompsonKeaauA great charityI had to sit right down and refute the letter from Bob Akamine complaining about not receiving acknowledgment from The Food Basket (Your Views, Dec. 7 .As it’s my “favorite” charity, and I personally see the tremendous and direct benefits provided to our community by stretching their donated funds, I must take issue with his comments on two points.Firstly, I did (and do , in fact, receive letters of thanks and receipt. I have no reason not to believe Mr. Akamine’s claim of not receiving one, but it may just not have arrived by the time he felt it should have.Secondly, even if an acknowledgment never was sent, I also send a check which, after it’s been cancelled, would serve just fine as a receipt for tax purposes.The Food Basket is one of the hardest-working, efficient and necessary charities serving our island and certainly does not deserve to be “thrown out with the bath water” because they’re slow with the paperwork. A phone call would surely speed that up, if paperwork is so critical.Mary SerionAinaloaGuns in publicTo carry or not to carry a gun? I can see both sides of this issue, good points and bad points. So many restrictive places where carrying a firearm is not allowed. Public buildings, parks, schools, churches, elderly homes, even commercial establishments, if they choose not to have firearms upon their property.Then why bother to get a carry permit with all these restrictions?Crime has and does happen in these named restricted areas, not just here, but worldwide. Many may have recalled an incident where a school teacher on Oahu was casually eating her saimin at a strip mall and was suddenly attacked by a male unknown to her with a knife, and sadly she died from her wounds.Maybe the outcome would have been different if there was a bystander who had a permit to carry and reacted in time, saving this woman’s life. Not only is carrying in public meant for self-protection, but it can apply for defending others.We can create hundreds of scenarios of where and when to shoot and not to shoot, but great responsibility lies upon the individual who chooses to carry a firearm in public. This permit is not for intimidating anyone.One worst case scenario? “Sir, thank you for saving the life of this victim from a brutal attack. However, you are hereby under arrest for carrying in a restricted area, and your permit to carry may be revoked.”If this happens to a person who has a permit to carry, do not argue with the police. They have a job to do.Rick LaMontagneHiloPolice are investigating a two-vehicle traffic collision Thursday afternoon in Pahoa that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with critical injuries.Who knew that studying espionage history is a thing?

The project for the building of warehouses in a tax-free zone will bring construction jobs, but I do not think they will be for Suffolkians. I’ve seen the Hispanic gentlemen that are working on the new warehouse infrastructure on Carolina Road and it brought to mind the deaths of two Guatemalan men at the Amazon warehouse. So, it would appear it is standard practice to bring in the construction crews.Jobs that will come will be for warehouse workers. These warehouses are not fulfillment centers, but tax-free storage till the contents are sold.If this project is allowed, I think we will wait many years to ever be in the black from taxes because we the citizens will be the ones footing the majority of the road infrastructure that will widen U.S. Route 460 (eminent domain? , Pitchkettle and no, not Murphy’s Mill and not Kings Fork.

minnpost_2022_19,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Ukraine has been a tortured place.It is located between two previously totalitarian governments – the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Ukraine is called the “bloodlands” because so much loss of life occurred there before, during and after World War II. And now horrific devastation is in these bloodlands yet again.Beginning in the 18thcentury, Ukrainian territories were divided between the Austrian and Russian empires. In 1918, after World War I, Ukraine declared independence. However, independence was short-lived; the country was forcibly absorbed into the Soviet Union in 1922.Stalin’s famineUnder Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, the USSR implemented a system of collectivization of Ukraine’s fertile farmlands. Ukrainian farmers were unwilling to cede their independence and their farms to the government. In brutal retaliation for the farmers’ refusal to cooperate with his mandates,Stalin implemented a famineto break Ukrainian resistance.To escape starving to death, people in the villages ate anything that was edible; grass, acorns, even cats and dogs … and each other. Mass graves appeared all across the countryside.Estimates are that at the height of the Holodomor – murder by hunger – in June 1933, Ukrainians were dying at a rate of 28,000 people a day, 1,167 an hour, 19 people every single minute.As many as 3.5 million Ukrainians perished from starvation from 1932-1933 in this intentional genocide that not only created physical destruction, but also devastated the culture and traditions of the Ukrainian people.Raphael Lemkin, Polish and Jewish, who fled from the Holocaust, coined the word genocide and authored the 1948 UN Genocide Convention. He named the Holodomor as genocide, the intentional destruction of a group and of a culture and a nation.Lemkin identified four integral components in the genocide in Ukraine:The Cover-upThere was total impunity for these millions of deaths. No one was ever held accountable. In fact, the Soviets covered it up, abetted by incomplete andbiased reporting by Walter Duranty, then Moscow bureau chief forThe New York Times, who falsely wrote that nothing of consequence was happening. Welsh journalist Gareth Jones traveled to the USSR, and, despite grave danger, entered Ukraine illegally and saw the truth – piles of emaciated bodies, dead and dying people everywhere he looked. Jones’ reporting was publicly discredited while Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for his work, whichthe Times has publicly regretted.Stalin’s Holodomor crushed Ukraine.The NazisLess than a decade later, the Nazis invaded Ukraine. Mobile killing squads known as theEinsatzgruppenmurdered a million and a half Ukrainian Jewish and thousands of non-Jewish Ukrainians. Leaders of theEinsatzgruppenwere prosecuted at Nuremberg, but most of the perpetrators of terrible violence in Ukraine, including the killing of 33,000 Jewish Ukrainians at Babi Yar outside of Kyiv, never were held to account. The memorial at Babi Yar was shelled by Russian troops on March 1 – this past Tuesday.Soviet RepressionThe decades after World War II saw increasing Soviet “Russification,” suppression of the Ukrainian language, culture, religion and traditions. Dissidents were imprisoned by the thousands, and fear and persecution were constant.The Soviets – Independence AgainUkrainians never lost their longing for autonomy. In January 1990, more than 300,000 Ukrainians formed a human chain to advocate for independence. The line stretched 335 miles, from the capital city Kyiv to Lviv in the west.Less than a year later, Ukraine declared independence with a vote supported by 90 percent of the people.War with RussiaIn 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. Vladimir Putin has viewed this as the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20thcentury,” according to author Kati Marton. He has installed himself as Russia’s leader until 2036 with a goal to re-create the old Soviet sphere of influence.Putin has already invaded the former Soviet republic of Georgia, supported ade factopuppet government in Belarus and Russian troops are now permanently stationed in Azerbaijan, another former Soviet republic.In 2014 Putin invaded and occupied the Donbas and Crimea regions of eastern Ukraine in full violation of all international laws of war. More than 1.4 million people became displaced, 13,000 people were killed and 30,000 were wounded.He is emboldened by receiving very little resistance so far.Now, Putin is trying to finish what he started in 2014 – the re-absorption of Ukraine into Russia. He wants to eliminate the Ukrainians, push back against an eastern expansion of NATO, which he views as Russia’s enemy, and regain Russia’s lost power on the world stage.Ending ImpunityUkraine’s government is fighting back … in the streets and in the courts.The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands is the world’s only permanent court with a mandate to prosecute individuals for these most heinous human rights offenses. The Court has a nearly-global jurisdiction.In 2014, Ukraine requested that the Court investigate alleged crimes committed in Ukraine during Russia’s 2014 invasion. On Feb. 28, Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the court, announced that the court will investigate the current situation in Ukraine as well.The suit asks the Court to rule on genocide and Russia’s claim to legal authority for military action in Ukraine. Ukraine also asked judges to order “provisional measures” to protect Ukraine, an extraordinary step to force Russia’s cessation of hostilities.There must be an end to impunity in the bloodlands. There certainly must be an end to this war.World Without Genocide will hold a webinar Thursday, March 10 from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. CST on “Ukraine: Genocide, Repression and War.” Those interested may register athttp: www.worldwithoutgenocide.org/ukraine.

eugeneweekly_2022_48,"We ve got issues. Thousands of majestic old trees in the mountains east of Eugene will soon be headed for lumber mills. On the heels of the 2020 post-fire salvage logging of millions of trees, the Forest Service is selling yet more timber. The Quartzville-Middle Santiam timber sale, planned for the Willamette National Forest between Sweet Home and Santiam Canyon, covers almost 90,000 acres, borders on wilderness, and will decimate some of the most scenic places in the western Cascades. Dense stands of previously logged younger trees might benefit from thinning, but the vast scale of the planned project is troubling. Most alarming are plans to clearcut mature and old growth trees. Older forests throughout the Pacific Northwest are becoming increasingly rare, with only 10 percent of Oregon’s original old growth forests still standing. Without a shift in our business as usual priorities, we are in danger of losing these heritage trees forever. That’s not the only danger we face when we clearcut older forests. These forests play a critical role in protecting all of us from the ravages of climate change. Recent research has documented that older forests in the Cascade Mountains provide some of the highest carbon sequestration on the planet. Climate scientists say that decreasing logging on national forests in the Pacific Northwest is one of the most effective land-use strategies to mitigate climate change. In fact, older trees are able to store carbon for 800 years or more. Tragically, Oregon’s forest carbon stocks have been severely depleted by large-scale industrial logging. With each new timber sale, they are increasingly compromised. The rapid rate of clearcutting in Oregon mountains has resulted in a sharp increase in carbon sequestration “dead zones,” wastelands that emit more carbon than they absorb. In fact, a report released by the Center for Sustainable Economy and Geos Institute shows that the forestry sector is Oregon’s second largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, research shows that cutting mature trees makes forests more vulnerable to drought and wildfire. Large, old trees of fire-resistant species are the ones most likely to survive a fire. No scientific justification exists for logging or thinning our mature forests. As last summer’s heat dome and the devastating 2020 wildfires demonstrated, catastrophic climate change is already occurring. Protecting the stability of the climate is the most urgent task our world faces. If we are to have a sustainable future, our endangered natural forests — forests that serve as huge carbon sinks — should be protected. We urge the Forest Service to choose “Alternative 4” in the draft Environmental Assessment. This alternative would provide 50 to 60 million board feet of timber, supporting schools and roads in timber communities. Most importantly, it would focus solely on thinning previously logged, younger forests and eliminate logging in old growth stands. All trees more than 80 years old should be excluded from the project. Tell the Sweet Home Ranger District to provide stewardship that responds to our unprecedented planetary climate crisis. Older trees in the Quartzville-Middle Santiam project should not be reduced to shingles, shelving or decks. They have a critical role to play in sequestering and storing carbon, and they are the last remnant of a magnificent heritage. They are worth far more standing.

She and her partner, Patty Hine, lead 350 Eugene, a grassroots climate justice organization dedicated to confronting the root causes of the climate emergency and working locally for bold, science-based policies to address it."
suffolknewsherald_2022_172,"Published 7:02 pm Friday, February 11, 2022ByStaff ReportsWith rapid expansion of inflation this year, people’s paychecks aren’t going as far as they used to. For people with lower income, the effect of inflation is magnified as they try to make their paychecks stretch into rent, utilities, food, childcare and other necessary expenses.If these folks commute through the Downtown or Midtown Tunnels for work, there’s one more expense to pay for — tolls.For a daily commuter who is able to commute during off-peak hours, they will be paying just over $1,000 per year just for tolls. For those who must commute during peak hours, it’s even more expensive — more than $1,300 of their annual income just for tolls.Thankfully, there’s a toll relief program, but it sorely needs to be expanded to assist more people who are burdened by these tolls.Currently, people who are Norfolk or Portsmouth residents and make less than $30,000 are eligible. Some lawmakers this year proposed to expand the eligibility to those who make $45,000 or less.Sen. L. Louise Lucas, a Democratic legislator from Portsmouth, hit the nail on the head recently when she noted that the preferable action would be to permanently eliminate these tolls. However, in lieu of that, helping our area’s lower-income residents would be nice.The bill is somewhat stalled in the General Assembly, though, while lawmakers evaluate funding options. We would like to see it picked back up and passed as soon as possible, and also to see it include all local residents, as those living in Norfolk and Portsmouth are not the only ones that must use these tunnels.For those who were unaware of this program and are eligible under the current guidelines, you can visit one of the E-ZPass Customer Service Centers to apply and provide proof of income and residency at the time of application.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_39,"Now that the U.S. Senate race in Georgia is over, the 2022 elections have finally ended. It is time to recognize that youth are voting to save our democracy. In the midterm elections in November, youth and women, because of the abortion issue and ongoing worries about the state of our democracy, voted in unprecedented numbers.My first political experiences came in civil rights demonstrations in 1961 when I was a college student in Texas. I remember the role that I, along with fellow demonstrators, played in the broader youth movements of the 1960s. While their actions are different now, youth are acting once again.For too many years, youth were marginalized, their voices and their idealism muted by adults who claimed to know better but didn’t. In the Philadelphia Inquirer last month, columnist Will Bunch wrote, “If democracy was on the ballot in 2022, as President Joe Biden and so many others had warned, then it was young Americans … who just saved it. Shocked into action by the loss of their reproductive rights and repulsed by candidates who threatened not to count their votes going forward, Millennials and Gen Z put down their books (or their beers to make sure any ‘red wave’ was subsumed by the deep blue sea.”This was especially true at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The number of registered UIC student voters was 23,670 in 2020, up from 19,656 in 2016. Now 81% of UIC students are registered to vote, a much higher proportion than other Chicagoans. And 65% of UIC students who were registered voted in 2020. At UIC, we have more than doubled the student voting rate since 2012. This is also true in midterm elections.Bright Line Watch, an organization of political scientists which surveys nationally both political scientist experts and the general public, finds both groups more pessimistic about the fate of American democracy in the next five years. But I find the role that youth are now playing a cause for hope that our democracy can be renewed.High schools and universities are making a sustained effort to increase civic literacy and education. iCivics and the U.S. Department of Education have issued “Educating for Democracy,” a new framework for teaching modern day civics in K-12 schools. The Civics Secures Democracy Act with bipartisan support pending in Congress would provide $1 billion to better teach history and political science in the same K-12 schools.Clearly, regardless of the outcome of individual contests, the 2022 election is a turnout success story, and is due to more women and youth entering the political arena to carry on the fight for democracy. What Thomas Jefferson called “the spirit of democracy” that spawned the 1776 revolution has not died. Our schools and universities are beginning to take up the task of educating for democracy. But today our youth are the heroes, even when adults fail to recognize their contributions and ignore their voices.Young people deserve a seat at the table of government as well as a role in elections. As I spell out in detail in my new book “Democracy’s Rebirth: The View from Chicago,” we must reform our representative democracy, and create new forms of participatory democratic government. While adults can offer advice, only the youth can carry forward the movement that we began more than 60 years ago."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_6,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee were so busy patting themselves on the back after Wednesday’s partisan vote to publicly release former President Donald Trump’s tax returns that they forgot one thing: explaining why this is legally necessary or proper.The vote wasn’t an attempt to uphold the law or demonstrate illegality but rather to satisfy the curiosity of millions of Americans who just want to view a billionaire ex-president’s tax returns.It’s almost prurient, as if Congress has agreed to release tax porn for public viewing. Just because the committee chairman, Rep. Richard Neal, praised his colleagues for not being “punitive” or “malicious” doesn’t make their decision right.When reporters pressed members to explain why the release was necessary, they appeared to struggle for a legal justification.That’s probably because existing federal law doesn’t require prospective, sitting or former presidents to release their returns.Such release is strictly voluntary, which all major-party candidates since the Nixon administration have done as a way of demonstrating they have nothing to hide.Trump chose not to. Any implication that he had something to hide was a political risk he was willing to take.Trump was within his legal right not to release his returns, regardless of the bogus excuse he gave that he couldn’t as long as an Internal Revenue Service audit was underway.The Ways and Means Committee short-circuited his right to privacy.Several states have passed laws requiring candidates to publicly release their tax returns or be denied a place on the ballot. Congress should consider a similar federal law or, more to the point, one that requires all presidential candidates as well as past or current presidents to release their tax returns. But because Congress hasn’t done that, Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee had to concoct a legal standard regarding Trump.In all likelihood, the six years of returns now being prepared for release contain lots of salacious details.In all likelihood, Trump skirted the law and bilked the U.S. Treasury out of millions — even hundreds of millions — of dollars in taxes owed.If so, let the Internal Revenue Service prove it.On that score, the IRS did fail glaringly in its legal requirement to audit Trump as a sitting president.For his first two years in office, no such audit occurred — in violation of the law.Why that happened, whether through dereliction of duty or pressure from Trump, are legitimate questions Congress should seek to answer.The job of Congress is to uphold the law, which is where Republicans fell down when it came to investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.Democrats prove themselves no less prone to putting politics above the law when they deny a citizen — even if he was the president — a right to tax-reporting privacy.This decision doesn’t pass the smell test.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch."
suffolknewsherald_2022_45,"Published 6:10 pm Tuesday, June 28, 2022ByStaff ReportsAs we approach another Independence Day, we’re reminded of the words of this country’s first president, George Washington: “Government is not reason; it is not eloquence. It is power. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearsome master.”Yet only the most radical of us would argue that government isn’t necessary. The Bible itself instructs Christians to pay taxes and pray for government leaders.On Monday, we will celebrate the 246th anniversary of this nation’s Declaration of Independence – the prelude to the establishment of our government. While all of us can find fault with certain government leaders and policies, few of us would trade our system for any other in the world.Independence Day is a good time to reflect upon and rededicate ourselves to the principles upon which this nation and our government were founded.When our forefathers severed ties with England in 1776, it was a declaration of war for which the signers paid dearly. They enunciated this inspiring principle, the words of which are as true today as they were then:“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.“Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.”And so it was that the world’s first democratic republic came into being and thus inspired freedom-loving people the world over.For more than two centuries, the United States has been an example of freedom, self-government and justice, despite our flaws, some of which have been laid bare in recent months. Yet, if they were around to assess their creation, this experiment in self-government probably has succeeded far beyond the wildest expectations of our nation’s founders.This great land of ours can remain free only so long as we Americans steadfastly uphold the principles enunciated by those founders 246 years ago. It is far easier today, because we now have a tradition of freedom that then was only a dream.But let us not be complacent. We must remain vigilant against the forces of oppression and intolerance. We must not stop striving to become a better version of ourselves. Freedom must be exercised and defended by those who enjoy it.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_125,"Published 7:08 pm Friday, April 1, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Stephen D. HanerA major European voice for climate and energy rationality told a small Charlottesville audience Wednesday that his home, the United Kingdom, and the rest of Europe face an immediate energy crisis that was brewing long before the war in Ukraine.Benny Peiser of the Global Warming Policy Foundation said prices in Britain jumped as of Friday. Householders are seeing the rising electricity and natural gas costs suddenly double, from about 1,000 pounds to 2,000 pounds annually. By the end of the year another jump to 3,000 pounds annually (almost $4,000 is predicted. The parallel impact on business and transportation will push up food and other commodity prices.Peiser noted the irony that only continued supplies of energy from Russia are keeping the lights on. Knowing how Russia needs the cash, nobody expects that to change until Europe finds other sources. The United States has saved Europe before and is likely to be one savior now, at least in the short term.The idea that Europe will save itself by building more wind, solar and related battery facilities is utopian, but that is the prescription being offered by many in a political environment where even most of Europe’s conservative parties are afraid to advocate fossil fuels.“Don’t follow our path. Don’t copy the Europeans. It will end in tears,” Peiser said. “Pragmatism and realism have to come back.”Global Warming Policy Foundation, founded in England in 2009, and the related communications outlet Net Zero Watch, publish several writers and researchers who challenge the climate catastrophe narrative. It has a U.S. branch headed by Francis Menton, also known as the nom de plume Manhattan Contrarian, and he was also at the gathering that evening.Peiser and Menton have been on a speaking tour of the U.S. and Canada, not producing much news coverage that will turn up in a search. They spoke at the Jefferson Room of a Charlottesville country club, the Blue Ridge bathed in sunset outside the window. Had they taken the message to Jefferson’s Rotunda on the University of Virginia grounds a few miles to the east, the reception would have been quite different probably.One University of Virginia faculty member who has published similar views was present, and the meeting was hosted by a local attorney, Chris Horner, who files litigation on energy and climate matters through a nonprofit called Government Accountability and Oversight.“We have more to fear from climate policy than we have to fear from climate change,” Horner said. “Man did not take a safe climate and make it dangerous with fossil fuels. We took a dangerous climate and made it safe.”“You are blessed in the U.S. with enormous resources of oil and gas and coal, and some states are using them while some states are not,” Peiser said. Because of that, and because the electricity generated by fossil fuels flows between states, “You don’t feel the same hit that Europeans now face.” California can extol its environmental virtue while buying power across the lines when needed.In Europe, relying on your neighbor to take up any slack has largely meant Russia, which pre-crisis provided 40% of Europe’s natural gas, 50% of its coal and 30% of its oil.For 30 years Europeans have pursued the dream of an economy run mainly on solar and wind production, and they have become dependent on them. They prided themselves on declining fossil fuel emissions, ignoring how they achieved much of the change: by sending manufacturing overseas to counties still burning oil, coal and gas. The U.S. has done the same.There is growing realization that the vision of a modern economy run entirely, or almost entirely, on wind and solar simply will not work without incredible (as in not reasonable levels of storage. That was Fenton’s topic for the evening: “How many turbines does it take at midnight with no wind? It doesn’t matter how many you build because a million times zero is still zero.”Fenton said the cost of the storage is roughly the same as a country’s entire gross domestic product, especially if all vehicles and home energy use go electric. A recent analysis of the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s impact, if implemented as is, reached the same conclusion.Many countries relied on nuclear power as a clean backup for wind and solar, but before this war were closing down that form of generation under pressure from the Green parties. Some have changed their minds now and will retain the nuclear plants and consider more. Even after this shock of the Ukrainian war, however, Germany still plans to shutter its final plants next year. Its own Green Party would prefer to use coal, mainly because Germany has plenty of it.The British Isles, also once known for coal, have a deep supply of the related asset shale gas, same as the U.S. But like most Europeans they have prohibited the newer extraction techniques, derided by critics as “fracking.” The current British government is talking about expanding oil and gas production in the North Sea, but only because “there are no voters living in the North Sea,” Peiser said.Changing the rules and allowing extraction of the shale, “the resource under our feet,” still seems politically untenable. If the dire predictions of energy prices tripling in one year, with all the other inflation that creates, come to pass there could be popular uprisings in Europe similar to the recent Yellow Vest movement in France.“Most people in the U.S. and in Europe have never experienced hardship,” Peiser said. They think the wealth and comfort of the past 30 to 40 years is normal, and the financial means to help those now struggling are infinite. More and more of their leaders see the challenge are seeking alternatives.Peiser is not optimistic that attitudes will change quickly but is encouraged that about 60 British members of Parliament are starting to work together to turn things. “It’s not about solving the problem. It’s actually about acknowledging there is a problem.”Stephen D. Haner is Senior Fellow with the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy.

philinquirer_2022_21,"Our country’s COVID-19, overdose death, and gun homicide rates are the highest in the developed world.The idea of “American exceptionalism” — that the United States is inherently different from other nations — is often debated in political circles. But in public health circles, it’s not controversial at all.OurCOVID-19 death rateis thehighest in the developed worldand higher than all but Greece and Czechia, leavingmore than one million Americans dead. Our overdose death rate is thehighest in the developed world, killingmore than 107,000 people last year— arecord high.Our gun homicide rate is thehighest in the developed world, and 26 times higher than other high-income countries. At the same time, we account forabout 4% of the world’s populationand around35% of gun suicidesglobally.The dark side of American exceptionalism is staring us right in the face, even though many elected officials prefer not to see it.Theleading cause of death in the U.S.is heart disease.Obesity is a major risk factor— and, on this front again, our obesity rate makes us themost obese developed nation in the world.Even before the pandemic, Americans’ life expectancy had stagnated. Then, for the first time in over a century, itfell precipitously, erasingalmost 25 years’worth ofgains. According to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, life expectancy declined again last year to76.1 years, down 2.8 yearsfrom its 2014 peak. The decline has not been uniform, either. Racial and ethnic disparities continue to widen, worsening already shameful inequalities in American society.The U.S. now ranks 40th in life expectancy globally, and that ranking is likely to fall further once more data are available. It doesn’t have to be this way.This week, public health leaders are convening at a summit in Philadelphia organized by theBloomberg American Health Initiative, which we created in 2016in partnership with Johns Hopkins University. We identified five critical threats to American life and health — addiction and overdose, adolescent health, environmental challenges, obesity and the food system, and violence — and set out to find and support innovative new ways of tackling them.Philadelphia exemplifies not just the challenges facing public health today, but also the field’s power to extend and improve millions of lives. The city set a pair of grim records in 2021, as bothgun deathsandoverdose deathsrose to all-time highs. While city officials grapple with those dual crises, more U.S. cities can look to and learn from Philadelphia’s pioneering leadership on healthy food policy.Six years ago,Philadelphia became the first major U.S. cityto adopta tax on sugary drinksto help tackle obesity. The industry tried to overturn it, but Mayor Jim Kenney and the city successfully defended it — a critically important effort I was glad to help support. Now the tax is doing what it was intended to do: reduce sales of sugary drinks (down 35%, in fact while alsofunding universal prekindergartenin the bargain.To help point more policymakers toward effective action, the Bloomberg American Health Initiative is releasing a new report called “Reversing the Decline.”It offers 10 practical steps for addressing underlying causes of the biggest contributing factors to declining life expectancy. Those steps include enacting stronger gun laws, making sure medications to treat opioid use are the standard of care in all medical settings, and reducing sodium in processed foods, among other interventions.Amid a crisis in American health, one silver lining is that there is plenty of room for improvement. The challenges we face are serious and stubborn — but they are not insurmountable. After all, our history is filled with extraordinary successes. Anyone who buckled a seat belt today, or who ate a doughnut without trans fats in a smoke-free diner, has benefited from public health interventions, even if they do not realize it. During my 12 years in New York City Hall, weextended life expectancy by three years.Right now, though, we are not moving fast enough. The antidote to despair is action, and it starts with refusing to accept the dark side of American exceptionalism.Michael R.

But we will survive.Simple First World problems will come about at first. I’ll miss out on a few extra Starbucks runs, but what will people do without the fantastic daily luxury of ordering a quad-shot grande mocha with whip? Much, much, more! And this is the part that is not funny.With an embarrassing crime wave and terrible economy all across the board, the very same Democrat “leaders” who got us to this point remain in power.Much has been said from ignorant folks that Jan. 6 was the day that made them vote blue. I know people lie like rugs when it comes to elections. They will say anything to get you to vote, including telling others they used to be on the other side, but now see a new light! (Right around election time. Uncanny! Very strange that people view Republicans as the party of election-deniers. Very, very ironic to me.With over 150 examples of Democrats denying election results that you can see online, will any of you Democrats reading this take a moment to look at the hypocrisy? I think not, but it is worth my time to cut and paste this very valuable web link for you: https: gop.com/research/over-150-examples-of-democrats-denying-election-results-rsr/.Look at yourselves, and look how the crime and out-of-control border is now. Stop thinking of your party. Think of the children who will grow up in a phony democracy where vote machines are compromised and people have their heads in the sand about their own party obsession. People are dying in the streets from crime due to people wanting a fake democracy over a safe constitutional republic that we already have.Democracy always leads to mob rule in one way or another.

Grande forever!Allen RussellHiloTrust scienceIn response to Roger Schweitzer’s letter in the Oct. 25 Tribune-Herald (“We will survive” , you’re thoroughly mixing your facts, amateur opinions and personal assumptions. For one thing, weather is not the same as climate.The Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers are just two of the world’s 200,000 or so glaciers, distinct from ice sheets, many of which have already melted as never before. No, there is no volcano under those particular two glaciers, it’s what’s commonly called a “hot spot,” where internal heat escapes through tectonic plates in one area, and that’s only one factor in the melting of the glaciers. The Thwaites ice shelf, which supports the glacier, is being undermined by warm ocean waters as well.Anyone with any intelligence listens to qualified scientists in the field of climatology, not politicians or commentators on TV or radio who present their opinion as news, or anyone else unqualified.As for proof, one crucial piece of evidence according to the NOAA: “Prior to the Industrial Revolution, CO2 levels were consistently around 280 ppm for almost 6,000 years of human civilization. Since then, humans have generated an estimated 1.5 trillion tons of CO2 pollution, much of which will continue to warm the atmosphere for thousands of years.”Relatively sudden changes in climate can kill off plants and animals that cannot adapt or migrate fast enough.According to the EPA: “Changes in ozone, greenhouse gases and climate change affect agricultural producers greatly because agriculture and fisheries depend on specific climate conditions. Temperature changes can cause habitat ranges and crop planting dates to shift and droughts and floods due to climate change may hinder farming practices.”If you’re going to expound on a subject, know what you’re talking about.

He quickly and carefully navigated his way behind the frog and bent down to scoop up the amphibian. He held out the frog for me to see, and soon the other 19 first, second and third graders who were a part of our group at the kids’ camp gathered around to see his prized catch.Soon, however, it was time for us to leave the pond and head to our next activity. I told Timothy to put the frog down so that we could go. His face fell, and he refused to put the frog down. “I want to stay here with him,” he said. I explained that we had to leave and that the frog needed to stay with his family at the pond.We continued this discussion as the other kids packed up and followed their other adult leader to the next adventure. I tried all I knew how to do to get Timothy to put the frog down. I told him again the frog needed to return to his home and family, spoke of the fun he would miss if he didn’t go with the group, and then spoke sternly, sharing the consequences if he continued to disobey.His face went from defiant to sad, and I could almost see him thinking of his next move. Thankfully, another leader asked Timothy if he needed a break. He replied with a sad, “Yeah.” The leader offered to take him to an indoor space for a moment to cool down, have some water and take a break for a few minutes.He placed the frog down as he said, “I’ll never forget you, Trayaurus.” The newly named frog hopped away, and Timothy departed with the camp leader for a break from the day. It wasn’t long before Timothy arrived back at his group of campers, happy, energetic and ready to continue the day.This event can help us see that sometimes children need a rest more than anything else. I could have kept trying to get him to put down the frog by talking about how it can’t live in his hands forever, but it wouldn’t have been what his tired body, heart and mind needed. I could have gone to discipline because of his refusal to set down the frog, but it wouldn’t have been the most effective resolution.He was tired, and he needed a break. He may not have realized it, but his voice, face and body language demonstrated that he needed to rest for a few moments.We tend to understand that infants may be tired when they are fussy or crying, but if we aren’t careful, we can miss the clues that older children show when they are tired. There will be times when they need a positive talk, and there will be times when they need discipline, but there will also be times when they just need a break.Sometimes a rest can be the most effective solution.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_58,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The fact Minnesota can be recognized widely as being a good place for environmental protection and yet still fail to deliver in a number of important areas shows many parallels with the paradox that the state is simultaneously both good and bad for Black people in which to live.The two connect.Despite the environmental accolades, there are some serious challenges for this state; surface waters that fail to support beneficial uses, soils that are contaminated with forever chemicals, atmospheric pollution from wildfires and vehicles and problems in homes with contaminants like lead in paint and pipes. Those living in older properties and without health insurance are more at risk from environmental contaminants than the rest.To address these anomalies three areas need attention – more coherent decision-making, more inclusive decision-making and paying more attention to both in responding to funding opportunities.Major barriers to achieving equitably and sustainably are decision-making siloes. There are at least seven state agencies involved in protecting water resources. Responsibilities for safe drinking water change with agency from source to sink, meaning that decisions about if, where and how to treat contaminants are not optimized.Responding to climate change will involve all of the many state agencies and again there are opportunities for confusion.The states’ Environmental Quality Board could provide oversight but needs leadership independent from the constituent agencies to deliver more strategically. A Clean Water Council, set up to administer tax money from the so-called Legacy Amendment to the state Constitution, by definition has focus on water. At the governor’s level there is a sub-cabinet dealing with climate change, but that needs a broader remit, otherwise promoting climate change policy can cause unexpected problems in other sectors. For example, choosing between electrical storage batteries only based on their ability to reduce carbon dioxide ignores the pollution that they can cause to soils and water from chemicals released on disposal.Sustainable environmental policy needs more holistic oversight and that is limited in this state.The state bodies are crammed with technical experts. This is as it should be to address the wickedly complex technical issues associated with environment degradation. But for these kinds of problems there will rarely be just one solution, but rather a set of alternatives. The preferences and priorities of the experts may be different from those of important stakeholders like people living in disadvantaged neighborhoods and those living in the tribal nations.Technical elitism can lead to resentment and has been linked with the rise of populism.Delivering more effectively and equitably is not just about governance; it is also about public investment — and the investments are big. For example, getting rid of lead supply lines from the drinking water system alone would cost this state $4 billion over 20 years with responsibility currently resting with owners. Billions are needed in converting to renewables, upgrading the grid, improving property insulation, electrifying transport and defending against more flooding.The state should have a high-level group for strategic thinking on sustainable environmental policy options, but then decisions on priorities need to be refined by preferences elicited across all the important stakeholders including the tribal nations. There will undoubtedly be urgency and political pressures to act as more funds flow so it will be impractical to ask everybody about options all the time. Community leaders will be important. Increasingly, though, we should involve the power of the internet, big data and crowdsourcing in informing decisions.To deliver for the economy, environment and people taking account of the present and future generations needs a holistic approach. Balancing the inevitable trade-offs in a way that is transparent and sensitive to public preferences is the challenge. The state has a way to go in delivering on this.Peter Calow is a professor in the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota."
suffolknewsherald_2022_133,"Published 6:41 pm Tuesday, March 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceI was looking through old pictures when I stumbled across one of myself from years ago with a small group of kids to my right and left. Every kid in the photo was now grown, but I could still tell you their names.My mind carried me down memory lane, and I reminisced about the children I had worked with over the years. I thought about the lessons I had tried to instill and the hope that the effort I put forth would play a part in helping them break free of some difficult situations.Unfortunately, the children I have worked with were unable to overcome difficult situations. Some tried to do better but could not overcome problems in their lives. Others rejected my advice and went their own way. My heart ached as I looked at the picture, and I asked myself a question that I am sure many of us have asked when our efforts to help others fell short. “Would I do it again?”My initial answer was a no. It wouldn’t make sense to put so much time, effort, money and love into something that would not make a difference. I thought, “If I could go back, it would be foolish to do it again.” Then I paused, gave it some more thought, and changed my answer to yes. Yes, I would do it again.I would do it again because every child deserves someone willing to invest in them regardless of the outcome. They need adults who will do their best to show them that there is a better way of life than the dysfunction they see at home and in the neighborhoods around them. They deserve a chance. They deserve a choice. They may have chosen to discount my advice, but I take comfort in knowing they heard and had an opportunity.I would do it again because I have peace from knowing that I did my best. Many people complain and say nothing will change, but only a few try to make a difference. I have peace knowing that I tried. My efforts may have fallen short, but I hold my head high, knowing that I tried my best.The next time you ask yourself, “Should I even bother,” know that the answer is yes. Yes, you should try to make a difference. I cannot guarantee a positive outcome, but I can tell you that we must not stop trying.Children deserve someone willing to risk their time, effort, talents, and money to help. We cannot stop doing good things because previous results may not have been what we had hoped. We can adjust our strategies, but we cannot stop our attempts to make a difference. When we give what we can and do our best to help, we can have peace knowing that we tried. We cannot control other people’s choices. We cannot control their reactions. We cannot control the results, but we can control our efforts.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_78,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°President Joe Biden has been in an upbeat mood since the Democrats’ best first-term midterm showing in 60 years – and no wonder.For a second straight election, he achieved his presidency’s overriding goal of protecting the nation’s democratic institutions from the Trumpian threat. And the results relieved any immediate party pressure for him to forgo a 2024 re-election bid.In fact, last weekend’s USA TODAY/Ipsos poll showed the percentage of Democrats wanting Biden to run and believing he would win up about 10% since August, though half still opposed his re-election candidacy.Still, as Biden quietly marked his 80th birthday last Sunday, the basic Democratic dilemma remained: Will it be best for the party – and the country – to renominate the nation’s oldest president, even if the alternative is chaos?Biden’s best argument for running again is that, as in 2020, he feels able to do the job and may be the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump. But though Trump still dominates the GOP, its unexpectedly poor 2022 showing has more Republicans saying openly that it is time to move on.Midterm election exit polls showed a higher percentage of voters opposed another race by Trump than opposed a second term bid by Biden.The prospect of a 2020 rerun against Trump apparently animates the president’s thinking. “Don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative,” he likes to say. Of course, with a burgeoning GOP field, almost every alternative is younger and possibly more electable than Trump.On the other hand, just as France’s King Louis XV correctly predicted more than two centuries ago that his departure would prompt a “deluge,” so too do the Democrats face the possibility that a post-Biden free-for-all could undercut their hopes of retaining the presidency.Both parties regard Vice President Kamala Harris, the natural heir to Biden and almost certain to run if he bows out, as a weak candidate who would encounter difficulties in both a nominating race and the general election.But potential rivals need to consider that opposing the first Black, Asian-American and female vice president would be tricky in the increasingly multi-racial Democratic Party. Though Democrats have not yet set their primary calendar, a key early contest will almost certainly again be South Carolina, where the 2020 primary electorate was more than half Black.And if Harris faces impediments, so do her potential rivals. For Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, it’s the glass ceiling for women that contributed to Hillary Clinton’s defeat. For Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, it’s being an openly gay man with a husband. For California Gov. Gavin Newsom, it’s an image as a trendy California liberal. And for the best-known progressives, it’s not only being too far left but too old (Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , too young (New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , too sharp-edged (Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal or too obscure (California Rep. Ro Khanna .Though Biden would be 86 by the end of a second term, he still seems inclined to seek re-election, as has every modern president. But the nation’s oldest president has left the door ajar, if his health deteriorates or he and his family decide it’s time to end his half-century political career.“Our intention is to run again,” Biden told his Nov. 9 post-election news conference. But he said it was “ultimately, a family decision” that would be made sometime early next year, though he added, “I think everybody wants me to run.”Not everybody in the public. The Election Day exit polls showed a majority of independents and nearly half of all Democrats thought Biden should not run again.But the pre-election expectation of post-election Democratic disarray focused on Biden’s future didn’t happen. Instead, Republicans are beset with internal strife after failing to meet their expectations of a “red wave” that would capture the House, the Senate and key governorships.That disarray is providing the Democrats and Biden with a useful respite. If it persists, the House GOP focus on investigating instead of legislating may make him look good by contrast.Still, many Democrats expect a Biden re-election candidacy would face opposition from the party’s progressive wing, which opposed him in 2020 and has often pressured him to act more boldly. But its most prominent leader, Sanders, is even older than Biden.Meanwhile, continued good health may be the best way for Biden to allay concerns about his age, along with occasional videos showing him riding his bike. Though he skipped a dinner at the end of one long day, Biden last week completed an arduous, weeklong round-the-world trip to conferences in Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia that showed him on top of the issues and very much in command.Still, signs of his age show in his often awkward gait, verbal stumbles and sometimes less-than-forceful public speaking. A re-election campaign would be challenging both politically and physically.In 2020, the COVID pandemic enabled Biden to avoid the usually hectic speaking schedule and campaign from his basement. That won’t be possible in 2024.As for a possible Trump rematch, Biden insists he feels no pressure for an early decision “no matter what…my predecessor does.”But the former president’s prospects could ultimately affect Biden’s decision if his principal motivation remains his belief he has the best chance of keeping the 45th president from becoming the 47th.Carl P.

eugeneweekly_2022_3,"We ve got issues. As first-time candidates running for office in a largely rural area, we are concerned about a broken component in our political engine that promotes giving away the power of individual voices to special interests. The monetary and political influence that some endorsing entities hold combined with inappropriate campaign involvement has led to unfortunate consequences in Oregon politics, leading to special interests’ control over candidates, elections and politics at-large. To clarify, not all endorsing entities follow bad practices, but enough do that it warrants voters better understand the endorsement process. Endorsements are cues that help guide voters in making political decisions that reflect their values. In a world where we are politically burnt out and lack an easily navigable system to properly assess candidates, voters often forgo the cumbersome research process and instead rely on endorsements to guide their decisions. Some lose interest in the voting process altogether. This is one of the reasons that candidates rely so heavily on receiving and displaying endorsements on their websites, in mailers and in voter pamphlets: “Vote for me! I’m endorsed by A, B and C!” Endorsements become an issue when special interests occupy a formidable political influence over who is voted into and out of office, especially when our state has no contribution limits. That power should exist solely within the hands of Oregon voters. One subsect of endorsing entities form Political Action Committees (PACs , some of which maintain clever names that seemingly appear to represent the interests of the people rather than corporate money. However, if voters were to do their research, they might find that the endorsing PAC has a strong partisan bias or may not necessarily represent the insinuated agenda in its title. Additionally, some “non-partisan” endorsing entities choose who they will endorse without allowing both all candidates to participate in their formal endorsement process, even when the candidate specifically requests to take part in the process. If voters choose candidates based primarily on endorsements, then they’ve passively allowed those organizations to remove their own voice from their ballot, giving away their vote to special interests. This is why it is so imperative for each voter to vote purposefully, not passively. When voters allow endorsements to serve as the primary influence on their ballots, we strengthen the bond between politicians and the powerful lobbyists who try to buy their votes at the capital. Organizations with disproportionate political power are fully aware of their ability to “make” or “break” candidates. In one case, we’ve heard from a PAC representative who candidly explained they will attempt to take down candidates who accept their money then vote differently than they had agreed. While it is understandable that the organization would feel misled, a legislator shouldn’t feel beholden to organizations in fear of being “taken down” by them. Indeed, legislators should always maintain the ability to cast a vote for policies that improve the lives of their constituents, before furthering the agenda of a well-resourced organization. Additionally, some candidates have refrained from canvassing with other colleagues because politically powerful endorsing entities would not allow them to canvass with candidates from certain political races they had not endorsed. Organizations shouldn’t be dictating how candidates run their campaigns, but there are many candidates who are obligated to do as they are told because the money and support they are given come with explicit expectations. Some voters rely heavily on endorsements for candidate vetting, and for candidates who do not have clear policy stances to share, endorsements replace substantive plans and visions for the communities they aspire to serve with a list of organizations the candidate could be expected to answer to in the form of votes when in office. Those votes will advance the goals of powerful entities, instead of addressing the needs of Oregonians. Curious who might be influencing candidates this election cycle?

suffolknewsherald_2022_164,"Published 4:52 pm Tuesday, February 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsIn this era of bitter partisan divide in Richmond, moments of consensus on important priorities should be celebrated.This is especially true in the realm of public schools, which have become a battleground in national debates over racial justice and gender identity. Some of the angriest voices have suggested that parents abandon public schools entirely, and even that legislators use the threat of defunding as the stick for rooting out divisive instruction in the classroom.Quite the opposite is happening. Gov. Glenn Youngkin and legislative leadership in both parties are proposing historic investments in school construction and teacher pay, both sorely needed if Virginia is to remain competitive with other states in educating tomorrow’s workforce.Some details will need to be negotiated in the weeks ahead, but significant funding for both school construction and teacher pay raises appears certain.House Republicans, who form the majority in that chamber, have proposed $2 billion over the next two years for a school construction loan rebate program that would cover the cost of 80 new school buildings statewide. That’s four times more than even former Gov. Ralph Northam included in his two-year budget proposal in December.House Republicans also have recommended 4% salary increases for teachers and staff each of the next two years, plus a 1% bonus. Northam’s proposal, favored in the Democratic-controlled Senate, calls for 5% raises each year.Youngkin is on board with both school construction funding and teacher pay raises, which would help close a current wide gap between what Virginia K-12 teachers earn and the national average.Debates over equity and inclusion will surely continue, but on more important priorities, both parties have sent clear signals that they are more committed than ever to first-rate public schools.

But watchu gonna do?I was writing a cheerful holiday column, when Mauna Loa erupted. Auwe! But watchu gonna do?No matter who you are, the correct answer is: Drop everything. Then, get out of the way. Once safety is ensured, only then can we think about where to go for the best seats to enjoy Pele’s magnificent performance.In 1959, I remember coming home from school and my parents packing the car. “Volcano erupted.” they said, “We driving up. Put on long pants, grab a sweater and let’s go.”I happily dropped books, changed clothes and off we went. When we got to the crater, we were heartily greeted with a steady blast of heat. When the wind blew, we were gifted with sprays of warm cinders. Both were welcoming signs of a powerful presence.Today, parents take their kids to Disneyland for cheap thrills but in our time, they took us to watch real and towering fountains of lava spewing hundreds of feet in the air. Who needs Magic Mountain when you got Kilauea ‘Iki?Back then, Kilauea was nicknamed “The Friendly Volcano.” This is how she was advertised by the tourist industry in the 1950s and 60s in an attempt to lure visitors to our island, far from the white sandy shores of Waikiki.Only the intrepid came.Kilauea appeared non-threatening because much of the action took place in deep pits, allowing us to tiptoe up to the edge and peek inside. But as if to laugh and say, “Friendly? You talking about me?” Pele gave a good hard slap on the head, bringing us to our senses with Kapoho in 1960, wiping out small towns and farms, along with the popular swimming holes Queen’s Bath and Warm Springs.Other eruptions followed and in 1990, she burst out again with glee, overrunning the new subdivision of Royal Gardens and old Hawaiian communities in Kalapana, including Kaimu, the famous black sand beach.For Hiloans, Kalapana was where we went for a day trip to the ocean. Not too close but not too far. Heading toward Volcano, we turned left at Ola‘a and drove through fields of wild bamboo orchids, pausing in Pahoa town to buy pastry before arriving at Kaimu. Whenever I see old postcards of this famous curving stretch of black sand lined with lofty coconut trees, I grab them. One of the treasured calendar posters of the dazzling beach came from my favorite Hilo supermarket with the caption: Thanks for the memories.And of course, who can forget the 2018 devastation in the riff zone when lava obliterated recently-built houses in Leilani Estates and buried old family homes at Kapoho Bay.In case anyone still thinks Hawai‘i is home to friendly volcanoes, they’re suffering from too much Disneyland. Time for another slap.It arrived last week with the eruption of Mauna Loa. Hoards of locals and visitors are now driving the Saddle Road to catch a glimpse of an active volcano. Chicken skin, yeh? Judging from the many postings on social media, those smart phones are oh-so-handy. Not an hour goes by when another stunning pic arrives in my in-box. Mahalo!Television news, local and national, are filled with these images, as anchors struggle to find adequate phrases to describe our earth-searing event.One of the words we keep hearing is “awesome” which I personally dislike because of its current casual and inappropriate overuse. No, those cookies are not “awesome.” A movie star’s outfit, also not “awesome.” An Olympic medal? Still not “awesome.”But red-hot lava fountains and flows from Mauna Loa? Yes.Awesome.Rochelle delaCruz was born in Hilo, graduated from Hilo High School, then left to go to college. After teaching for 30 years in Seattle, Wash., she retired and returned home to Hawaii.

eugeneweekly_2022_25,"We ve got issues. The newspaper said that I choked back tears as I addressed the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Another said I “broke down.” In truth, the tears came later. It rarely is a good thing when you see your hometown in the news in a foreign country. I was invited to serve as an international delegate to the Scottish assembly, one of two from the U.S. and about 60 from various parts of the world. Sure, it meant five days of church meetings, but who could turn down a chance for an expense-paid trip to Scotland? And so it was that my spouse and I found ourselves sitting in an Edinburgh café in March of 1998 when I noticed “Springfield, Oregon” flashing on the TV screen high above the tables. We watched in horror as the story of the shooting at Thurston High School unfolded before our eyes. Our first reaction was to rush to our bed and breakfast and call home to check on our children under the care of my mother. Though only in grade school and in Eugene, not Springfield, we still had this immediate need to hear their voices and to assure ourselves all was well with them. It was either that or take the next plane home. That night was a restless one. I feared for the safety not only of our children, but every child for whom school should be a place of safety and learning, not a place of terror and violence. When we arrived at the assembly hall the next morning, the hall that would be taken over the following year by the newly formed Scottish Parliament (meeting for the first time since 1707 , I passed a note to the assembly moderator asking for a point of privilege. I didn’t save my hastily written notes and hardly remember what I said to the thousand delegates gathered that morning. Unbeknownst to me, there was a press room full of reporters furiously taking notes. Turns out the Church of Scotland has a sizable following in the media and connecting the Thurston shooting to the Scottish church was prime news. “When I was preparing to come to Scotland, one of my congregants who had recently visited related the bloody Scottish history,” I evidently said. “The irony is I found this country to be very peaceful and loving — it’s my own home that is filled with blood.” And then I made my appeal connecting time and place: “I ask you not to let this tragedy affect your homeland. As you acquire new powers through your Parliament, I pray that you use these powers to keep your children safe.” After a grilling by the Scottish press on gun culture in the U.S., a delegate from the Scottish Churches House (SCH in Dunblane found me and invited us to visit. As it turned out, we already had it on our itinerary, though for an entirely different reason. My mentor in seminary, and member of the Eugene church where I was a pastor at the time, insisted that we visit Dunblane because of the ecumenical work being done there. We learned from the warden at SCH that their most important work of late was of an entirely different nature. Two years earlier, a man with four handguns and 743 rounds of ammunition walked into the primary school of Dunblane and massacred 16 children, ages 5 and 6, and their teacher. For the next two years, the families of those lost children gathered at SCH to process their grief, find what healing they could, and work for change in British law. And change the law they did. Handguns became mostly illegal in Great Britain as a result. We spoke with one of those parents, Charlie Clydesdale, whose five year old was one of the victims. Mr. Clydesdale, with a Scottish accent so thick I had to listen hard to understand him, offered to come to the U.S. to “talk some sense” into our politicians. Those politicians have not listened to the parents of American children, so I doubt they would have listened to Charlie, but God bless him for wanting to try. As a result of the ban on handguns, the number of gun deaths in Great Britain has dropped from 0.42 per 100,000 in 1996 to 0.17 per 100,000 two decades later. In the U.S. it is just under 4 per 100,000 — more than 20 times higher. A year after Thurston, another school shooting drew even greater outrage and calls for action: Columbine. Since then, there have been 16 mass shootings in U.S. schools with four or more deaths, a total of 178 students and their teachers killed on school grounds. Most telling, out of the 28 such massacres that have occurred in the U.S., all of those with 10 or more deaths have occurred since Columbine with the exception of the University of Texas tower shooting in 1966. Perhaps the most troubling statistic I have heard of late is that somewhere between 4 and 8 million children have been subjected to lockdowns in their schools due to an active shooter. Ponder for a moment the impact that has on our children. How is it that the right to buy any gun I choose became a higher priority in this country than the lives and safety of our children? Perhaps, writes Thomas P. Crocker, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, we have reversed the meaning of the Second Amendment, placing the second clause, “The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,” above the first clause: “A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State.” If guns enhance security, why is it that this country with more guns per capita than just about any nation of the world lacks security for its most vulnerable and innocent citizens? Crocker argues in a recent edition ofThe Atlanticthat the Second Amendment requires the opposite of our current practice, namely that “It empowers a free people to regulate weapons as necessary to maintain their security and to protect their freedoms from fear and violence.” Indeed, what we have today is the opposite of a “well regulated Militia,” contrary to the Second Amendment. If we are not going to ban certain weapons, the very least we can do — indeed that we are required by the Constitution to do — is to regulate them. If not for the sake of the Constitution and our free state, then please, for the sake of our children. On our way out of Dunblane, we stopped by the cemetery on the north side of town. A sign at the entrance requested no photographs as a show of respect, and so I took none. We walked silently past the 16 grave markers, many with pictures of a happy child, a teddy bear and other cherished items. Each also with a name, date of birth and the same date of death, and a verse or saying of some kind, all arranged neatly in two semi-circles, as if for class. At one end is a stone under which lies Gwen Mayor, their teacher, lying for all eternity with her young pupils. It reads, “Died 13th March 1996, protecting the children in her care.” It was there that I sat down and wept.

minnpost_2022_74,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Kirk Cousins, the unvaccinated Minnesota Vikings quarterback, tested positive for coronavirus and missed the team’s last hope for making league playoff Sunday night, a winnable game as the Viking proved earlier this year by handing the Green Bay Packers a rare defeat. Instead, Cousins’ backups were clobbered by Aaron Rodgers, also unvaccinated, who cost the Packers an earlier victory by missing a game when he tested positive. Both quarterbacks deserve to be resoundingly booed for failing their teams, their fans, their cities, their sport. And the nation.Vikings fans should be outraged. Cousins apparently cites some religious exemption, yet scour the Bible as one will, one finds nothing requiring selfishness, not to mention the sanctity of an individual body against the general health of the population.Then there’s the subset, of which Rodgers is apparently one, who “do their own research.” What is the point of that fruitless exercise? To disprove what the global health community of experts carefully discovered about coronavirus and the efficacy of vaccines, of which those in circulation have proven effective a billion times over?Or are they part of the increasingly unhinged strain of so-called conservative politics, that if a government led by Democrats is for something, then they’re against it? Yet the odds are excellent that Cousins and Rodgers, as the rest of us, were vaccinated as children, in schools or doctors’ offices, against smallpox, polio, pertussis (whooping cough and diphtheria and others.My sisters and I contracted whooping cough before the pertussis vaccine, and our parents stayed up night after night walking us one by one into the shower so we could breathe the steam. My wife’s grandmother and uncle died from the scourge of diphtheria. No one need worry about these diseases anymore, thanks to Dt and Tdap vaccines administered to us as children. My wife and I both know people who contracted polio in the early 1950s prior to the vaccine, impairing their entire lives, some spending the balance in an iron lung to breathe for them. The greatest relief of our parents’ generation was the discovery and general administration of polio vaccines to a grateful population.How many videos of desperate confessions of dying people do they need to see, pleading with the living to get vaccinated, including prominent anti-vaxers and ordinary fathers crying out, I was stupid, I was wrong, get vaccinated! For the family, for the community, for the team.Public health is also a team game, an entire population only as strong as the successful inoculation of all members against rapidly evolving pathogens like Sars-CoV-2. That is why Cousins and Rodgers and all anti- and non-vaxxers are so wrong. By choosing not to be vaccinated they let down the team of overwhelmed health care workers bound by the Hippocratic oath to care for all comers, and the entire population, only as strong as its ability to defeat a virus and its many possible variants that can multiply in unvaccinated people.So please, Kirk Cousins, Aaron Rodgers and all others opposed or hesitant about vaccines, know that vaccines are the greatest public health invention since Sir Thomas Crapper commercialized the water siphon toilet and ended the scourge of typhoid and cholera and other urban bacterial epidemics. Kirk and Aaron et all, if you flush, get vaccinated! Take a shot for the team.James P. Lenfestey is a former editorial writer for the Star Tribune, covering education, energy and the environment."

I, as a matter of conviction and principle, am unapologetically and unconditionally a pro-life advocate. I am also for the rights of a parent to choose whether or not his or her child wears a mask in school. I would like to explain how you can be both without being a hypocrite or holding women to double standards.There is research that shows masking a child can do more harm than good. It can cause mental harm and delays in communication with young children. Some children have difficulty having their face covered and in return have difficulties with the ability to pay attention in class. Others get easily distracted with the mask on their face, which impairs their learning.Children need to see facial expressions of adults to understand situations better. A smile to know they are doing a great job and other facial expressions. I have two young children who have struggled with learning since masking has been mandated in schools. The CDC has even said cloth masks are not very effective with preventing the spread of the virus.I choose to be an advocate for the voiceless, unborn children inside a woman’s womb. Life should always be the standard and should always prevail over the destruction of life with an abortion. While I am sure there are times when an unwanted pregnancy is difficult for women, choosing life needs to be the moral only standard and that is why wonderful organizations like Tidewater Pregnancy Center are there to help soon-to-be mothers.

leoweekly_2022_21,"After the Supreme Court decision that overturnedRoe v. Wadetriggered Kentucky’s absolutely horrifying and absurd abortion ban, there’s been a lot of talk about how the city of Louisville can stand in defiance.To what degree do our leaders have to enforce the law?Can we become a sanctuary city?But, the real question might be: Do city officials actually have the guts to stand in unison against the state and/or federal government?Recent history suggests no.When similar-size metros across the country declared themselves as sanctuary cities in 2017, refusing to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as then-President Donald Trump intensified deportations, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer used more careful and vague language.He called Louisville “compassionate” and “welcoming.” He claimed that Louisville police already didn’t work with ICE. He downplayed the term sanctuary.“This term sanctuary city has become very politically divisive, and obviously, there is no one place that you register to become a sanctuary city,” the Courier-Journal reported Fischer saying in January 2017 at a pro-immigration rally outside the Muhammad Ali Center.Months later, in the fall of that year, a story from the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting revealed that the LMPD responded to at least 23 requests for assistance from ICE in 2017.The city government scrambled after the news broke, and Fischer announced there would be policy changes.In 2017, Metro Council passed an ordinance saying that LMPD officers cannot work with ICE agents unless a judge signs a warrant or if there’s a risk of danger to the public.Although, under the ordinance, city employees are still allowed to provide information to ICE and other agencies.Some advocates thought it fell short, that it was only partially protective and still had holes.But, either way, people suffered because of a lack of action at the beginning of the problem. The hesitancy to defy the Trump administration, the fear of losing federal funds, caused citizens confusion and harm.In 2019, Metro Council passed an ordinance making investigations, citations and arrests of adults over 21 years old possessing a half ounce of marijuana or less “the city’s lowest law enforcement priority, without superseding existing state or federal law.”In other words, a suggestion to the police. A pinky promise to the public.In a WFPL article titled “LMPD Says Marijuana Decriminalization Ordinance May Not Change Much,” a sponsor of the ordinance, then-District 8 Councilperson Brandon Coan, said:“The officer should confiscate that drug, but send that person on their way instead of putting them through the criminal justice system, and leaving that person with a mark on the record and something that could impact their lives and their family’s life.”But, in the same story, Jessie Halladay, a spokeswoman for the Louisville Metro Police Department, said that the department would follow state law. “I’m not sure exactly that you would see any major changes by this department and how they operate because we follow the state statute,” she said.In 2019, County Attorney Mike O’Connell announced that his office would stop prosecuting people for possession of less than one ounce of marijuana for those over 21 and not in possession of a firearm.In several police citations reviewed by LEO Weekly over the last eight months, Louisville citizens are still being charged with possession of small amounts of marijuana and police are still using the smell of marijuana as probable cause during traffic stops. In one case, a woman who did not show up to her court case for possession of marijuana had a bench warrant put out for her arrest, although her case was ultimately dismissed after she eventually showed up to court. Had she interacted with a police officer while the bench warrant was out, she would have likely ended up in the city’s troubled jail.O’Connell’s move was pretty progressive, but why are cases even still getting to the court system? It’s likely because that Metro Council ordinance is weak, and is given little respect by police.And maybe that encapsulates the heartbeat of Louisville politics — symbolic talk and actions, but very little progressive bite.So, as we enter uncharted territory with a cruel abortion ban, it’s hard to take the calls for sanctuary, and the murmurings about a Metro Council ordinance, seriously.When Democratic mayoral nominee Craig Greenberg recently said that if he is elected mayor, Louisville police “will not be the enforcement arm of a ban on reproductive healthcare, be it abortion or other medical decisions,” it’s hard to actually believe.In a statement to LEO Weekly, Jefferson County Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine said that the potential investigation and prosecution of abortion law violations could go forward even if LMPD is told not to pursue such cases.It’s going to be a long and tedious fight. But, if there’s going to be a pro-choice victory, it will likely come from activist groups in court, and not from city officials. •You Filthy Man Sl*** Better Watch Your Mouths."
philinquirer_2022_8,"The conditions of confinement in our prisons should not be punitive, onerous, or deadly.My son is in a prison in California’s Central Valley, where recently the temperature was 116 degrees. His facility has “swamp coolers,” which use a fan to blow moist air. The temperature inside the prison buildings can reach upwards of 95 degrees, with no respite. He and his fellow inmates can’t catch a breeze outside or have access to ice water to drink. They can’t escape the heat by fleeing topublic pools, the mall, or public libraries.The issue of basic, humane treatment of prison inmates has been pushed aside for too long.Climate change is worsening each year, and prisoners are dying in many Southern states where there is no air-conditioning. At least23 Texas inmates have died from heat-related illnesses since 1998. Much thesame is happening in facilities without air-conditioningin Alabama,Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.The men and women incarcerated in this country were not sentenced to torture and death. Their basic human rights are being ignored. America’s prisons have a “soul-chilling inhumanity,” as one judge put it; he and others have spoken of the structural inadequacies,poor plumbing,space limitations,inadequate dietandhealth care,inadequate exercise and recreation, andinadequate provision for personal hygiene. These are violations of theEighthand14th Amendments, which ban cruel and unusual punishments and protect against discrimination or unequal treatment.I recently interviewed a 60-year-old man who is serving an eight-year sentence in a North Carolina prison. He only agreed to speak with me on the condition of anonymity, as he fears retaliation. “If I was a German shepherd I’d be treated with more basic regard for life,” he told me. “I was just given my dinner at 3 p.m.: a pressed chicken patty with gristle that I had to swallow whole, a small helping of white rice, overly cooked broccoli — just the stems sitting in water — and a small orange the size of a racquetball. I’ve been told we are served food that comes in boxes labeled ‘not fit for human consumption.’” He told me that his next meal would not come for 16 hours.In addition to a lack of adequate nutrition, health care is essentially nonexistent and suffers from a lack of adequate staff. “A month ago, a 52-year-old man was having a heart attack, but the so-called nurse said disdainfully that he was faking and did nothing,” the man told me. “He died.”We need to stop closing our eyes and turning away from suffering. It’s time to blow this issue up, write to governors and legislators, and publish articles in national publications and on social media to make people aware. That’s why I’m writing this op-ed.This is America, not some developing country. We seem to have lost our humanity — especially when compared with manyEuropean prisons that are based on dignity instead of dehumanization.» READ MORE:In prison, a phone was my lifeline.

Since that time, the situation has only gotten worse. The Port 460 project will make it worse yet.Planning for this ill-conceived project appears to have proceeded for the last several months, with no meaningful public input sought by either the developer or the city prior to bringing it up for a vote at the July 19 Suffolk Planning Commission meeting. Sadly, the commission was largely unmoved by the valid concerns of the hundreds who attended, or their request for more time for public review and input. In a split vote, the Commission sent the rezoning request to City Council for approval.I expect this project, once built, to pose serious safety and environmental risks to its neighbors, and to anyone who regularly travels Route 460 through Suffolk. But alas, to this citizen it feels like the fix is in. I can only hope that our City Council will have the wisdom to un-fix it.A big concern raised by citizens at the July 19 Planning Commission meeting is how planning of this massive project got so far downstream with essentially zero public awareness, or opportunity to provide input. During the July 20 City Council meeting, Councilman Tim Johnson (my new hero described what happened at the July 19 Planning Commission meeting, spoke passionately about his disappointment in the lack of public (and City Council awareness of the Port 460 project, and expressed his belief that the process for making such changes needs to be improved to provide for better public awareness and input. But later in the meeting, Mayor Duman responded that the city’s rezoning procedures require neither the rezoning applicant nor the city to make any citizen aware of the proposed change during its development, or to seek any citizen’s input regarding how the change might affect them, or the city. He said that the city’s process leaves the nature and extent of public engagement entirely up to the applicant, who may simply decide, “I think it’s a good idea, and I don’t need to talk to anybody.”If that is truly my city’s process for balancing what a developer wants for himself versus what the people of Suffolk want for their city, then I agree with Mr. Johnson – the process needs to be changed, and the sooner the better. A project of the size, scope and potential impact of the Port 460 Logistics Center should not be allowed to be developed under cover of darkness.Mike HostSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_127,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Volodymyr Zelenskyy is showing the world what bold leadership looks like.When America offered to get him out of Ukraine, Zelenskyy famously replied he needed more ammunition, not a ride. In addition, Zelenskyy chose not to hide in a bunker, but rather go on the streets with his fellow country people and post regular updates letting his people know he’s got their backs and is willing to do the same things he is asking them to do.In contrast, Vladimir Putin is growing more distant by the day, metaphorically and literally. Putin’s inner circle grows smaller daily as his citizens become more and more confused.Both leaders are unknowingly demonstrating the two leadership styles that exist in corporate America as it pertains to a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI .Let me be clear, I am not comparing any CEO to Putin, but rather dissecting the approaches to leadership with the goal of showing the real impact a leader has on an initiative when they’re willing to go on the front lines.President Zelenskyy has galvanized Ukrainians and the global community by leading out loud and going to the front lines to fight against the Russian invasion. President Zelenskyy understands his military is smaller and that there will be casualties and that he may very well be one of them; however, the issue is so important to him that he is willing to take the risk.His actions have contributed to a high “esprit de corps,” which is defined as a feeling of pride, fellowship, and common loyalty shared by the members of a particular group. The impact of morale being so high is that everyday people with no military background are taking up arms. Grandmothers are confronting soldiers. Men are kneeling in front of tanks. Celebrities, athletes, and models are joining the resistance. Everyone is lining up to stand behind President Zelenskyy and willing to go into battle with him.In contrast, Putin governs from a safe distance. Recent photos of Putin sitting at large, grand tables with his generals on the opposite side of the table speak louder than words. His soldiers and country people see this and perceive that Putin is not interested in them or their wellbeing in any form. It kills all semblance of “esprit de corps” within his ranks translating to his soldiers just going through the motions.In the corporate world, releasing a press release from a CEO addressing issues that contribute to the inequity among Black people is the Putin style of leadership. It’s keeping a “safe distance” from any possible danger. Danger in this case is being asked a question one is not prepared for, walking on a DEI landmine during a press conference or team meeting, or being ostracized by the business community for being too loud.Another example of Putin leadership is leaving it to the “generals” to get the message to the front lines. Now, I’m not saying one shouldn’t ever delegate to leaders, but if the objective is to galvanize employees around an issue, one can’t delegate leadership responsibilities to someone else.Perhaps DEI isn’t something a CEO is looking to galvanize employees around, and that is up to them in the end. But if CEOs are saying it’s important, then they must walk the walk and be seen on the frontlines.Analysts report that the Russian soldiers were told they would be welcomed in Ukraine with open arms. Many reports have also come out that Putin was grossly misled into believing the resistance would be a fraction of what it’s been.Online, you can listen to audio clips of Russian soldiers being utterly confused as to why they are being confronted. You can hear the pain in their voices as they confusingly speak with Ukrainians on the streets. Anti-war protests in Russia, fuel shortages on the front lines, logistical mistakes, and slow progress are the consequences of the lack of shared vision exacerbated by how distant Putin is.The same thing happens in corporate America as it pertains to tackling issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion. Board rooms filled primarily with white men discuss how the company should address issues such as the wealth gap among Black employees.This is why it’s critical for leaders to receive information from people who have a real pulse of what’s going on in the community. Corporations must put a stop to getting strategy from executives who rarely spend time in the communities they’re trying to help.If there is one thing we see time and time again, it is that a company’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is directly linked to the investment the CEO puts into it.We know many CEOs have signed pledges and made promises to increase diversity at all levels of their organization. The real question is, which approach are they taking? The Putin model or the Zelenskyy model?That my friends, will tell you everything you need to know.Sharon Smith-Akinsanya is the CEO of the Rae Mackenzie Group and founderof People Of Color Career Fair."
minnpost_2022_23,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Years ago, Metropolitan Council and Ramsey County started their push for the light rail Rush Line (also known as the Purple Line and for a bus to run every 15 minutes … up to 89 buses daily (in each direction between St. Paul and White Bear Lake. The transit line would have 20 stops between the two cities and would operate on the Bruce Vento biking/walking trail, ruining that too.Initially Met Council proceeded without any input from residents. A few years later they “told” city councils what they were going to do. Then they started having “community input meetings.” At those meetings, anyone who was against this Rush Line was shot down at the meetings, and their input was never mentioned again. Their comments/questions didn’t support what the Met Council planned to do with our tax money.Then they came to White Bear Lake and did more meetings, and a survey, to ask “which area would you like the White Bear Lake station to be located?” Not, “Do you want this?” Many people wrote in they didn’t want it all. But again, they didn’t include any of the non-supporting comments in any of their reports to the public. They even claimed everyone wants the Rush Line.The then White Bear Lake City Council didn’t feel they could do anything, except perhaps influence where the station would be. Voters in White Bear Lake totally disagreed with this stance, and in November we voted in a new mayor and a new Ward 2 council person, that ranagainstthe Rush Line/Purple Line.St. Paul also has businesses that have hired a PR firm to help fight this Purple Line. If the Purple Line goes forth, these businesses will lose their customer parking spots, and thus go out of business. Do members of Metropolitan Council not care? The answer clearly is no, Met Council doesn’t care about small businesses.I’m happy to see that more people and cities are fighting these overpriced bus lines and light rail lines, even though to date they haven’t been able to stop Met Council.Another clear example why we should have a Met Council that has members voted in by the people, so we can vote them out when they don’t and won’t listen. Clearly our governor isn’t listening to the people, and lets his Met Council do whatever they want to do to us.Met Council has way too much power, and they don’t seem to answer to anyone. How did they ever get so much power over the people, cities and our tax money? I’m happy to recently hear and read that some of our state politicians are finally looking into things, wanting audits and justifications. I certainly hope they stop this madness. The people will be watching.Peggy Van Sickle lives in White Bear Lake and is a volunteer with the No Rush Line Coalition."
minnpost_2022_0,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Oil and gas prices have been increasingly burdensome for the American family as of late. An issue that has been brewing for well over a year has recently been exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Unfortunately, little has been done to date by the Biden administration to lower these fuel prices that have seriously strained the wallets of Minnesotans, and American families across the country.From his nominations of anti-energy officials to his increasingly restrictive policies against oil and gas development on federal lands, President Biden long ago set the stage for the price run-up we are seeing today. The cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline on Day 1 of his presidency meanwhile, in part due to pressure by environmental activists who alleged the Canadian oil it was supported to transport was too dirty, is indicative of how this administration has been shaping its energy policy.Now with gas prices hovering around $5 per gallon nationally, and $4.75 here in Minnesota, reality has set in for the Biden administration and they are changing their tune. Energy shortages across the world have led the Biden administration to look for oil in places such as Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, that same “dirty” Canadian oil is now finding its way into the U.S. via other modes of transportation, such as freight rail.It is surprising that anadministrationthat speaks out frequently about carbon footprints and claims to be serious about minimizing the environmental risks of oil and gas spills has been so quiet about this development. Freight rail, while an important complement to pipelines for energy transportation, should be a less preferred way to move oil and gas for the Biden administration because it is a more carbon-intensive and accident-prone mode of transportation.These facts, coupled with the strongantitrust bentthe Federal Trade Commission has recently taken under its new Chair Lina Khan, makes it all the more baffling that the Biden administration has not spoken out about the proposed Canadian Pacific-Kansas City Southern railroad mega-merger and that the Surface Transportation Board may push it through without proper oversight.This merger would double rail traffic through residential areas and likely mean more oil running on trains through the neighborhoods and backyards of Minnesotans, rather than underground in safer pipelines. Given that rail is over four times more likely to experience an accident versus pipelines, according to onestudy,this would be an unnecessary risk. Further, the increase inintermodal truck activitygoing to and from these railyards will also increase risk of accidents and increase diesel emissions, directly contradicting the president’s push to lower carbon emissions.A U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportationreview,meanwhile, found that busy at-grade train crossings “can have significant impacts on the quality of life in a community, and can hinder first responder’s timely access to emergency services.” In a Minnesota town like Winona, where train crossing wait times are already a problem with 40-minute delays in some cases, the50 percent increasein train traffic this community is expected to see could be disastrous. The real-life devastating consequences of such delays were also recently on display in Lockland, Ohio, where a home — just300 feet from the rails —sat in flames for eight timeslonger than it should have due to a train that was blocking firefighters from getting to the scene. A 59-second response time became eight minutes, with flames doubling with every passing minute.Congress, for its part,funded a studyregarding the impact longer trains have on safety, grade crossings, freight and passenger service, and the environment, as part of theBipartisan Infrastructure Billsigned into law in November 2021 This is a good start, but more must be done. America has a clear option that would help it meet its energy needs and provide time for the full oversight this merger requires, but it is being ignored. The White House should give both a second look.Amy Koch was the first female majority leader of the Minnesota Senate, where she represented Buffalo."

She was later arrested twice for standing up for her constitutional rights.This month, on Dec. 14, the state put in a motion to dismiss all charges, and the judge approved it with prejudice, which means they can never bring it back again!They dismissed her disobedience of the governor’s proclamation during the emergency management period.The state acknowledges that a governor’s mandates are not laws. To have a law, a legislator creates a bill that the legislative body passes and then the governor signs.The governor has no power to create laws by himself. Americans cannot be mandated unless they agree to be mandated.Levana is taking the governor to court for violating people’s constitutional liberties and depriving us of the right to due process. This is not a communist country, and yet we were treated like it was.The government cannot take healthy people and force them into house arrest against their will. For them to control people, people must forfeit their rights willingly, and Levana Lomma did not do that. She stood up against tyranny and won! Thank God for her!She has shown us the path. If the laws are unjust, it is our duty as Americans to stand up for our freedom.

leoweekly_2022_37,"Editor’s Note: Before the May 17 primary, LEO asked both Attica Scott and Morgan McGarvey — the two leading Democrats running for the U.S. House seat that will be open after Rep. John Yarmuth retires — to write about what they think are the three biggest issues facing our community. You can read McGarvey s columnhere.”Women, if the soul of the nation is to be saved, I believe that you must become its soul.”-Coretta Scott KingHas there been a time in the history of this nation that women were not under attack? Whether it was the women who shepherded people to freedom during enslavement, the nearly 100-year fight for women’s suffrage, the immigrant women who have literally had their breastfeeding babies ripped from their arms, the transgender women whose brutal murders have gone unsolved, and today when the right to an abortion is under attack.If we must center our conversation around the three most pressing issues Louisville and the nation is facing, we must center women who are increasingly in need of unemployment insurance benefits, child care assistance, eldercare assistance, who carry an overwhelming amount of student loan debt, and who are most underrepresented in political office where the decisions on all these issues are being made.POVERTYis painfully real in Louisville. I know. I grew up in the projects of Beecher Terrace where government food commodities fed our family. As a Louisville Metro Councilwoman, I was the primary sponsor of a bill to raise the minimum wage, when it passed, Louisville became the first southern city to raise the $7.25 poverty wage. I’ll continue that charge in DC by supporting a $15 federal minimum wage (which is the floor and supporting Universal Basic Income measures (which I sponsored as a State Representative and supported a pilot program that was recently launched in Louisville .I support extending the refundable Child Tax Credit so that families get a chance to thrive, as well as investing in the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance account and other public policies that address affordable housing for people on fixed incomes. We must do our part to get people into housing who are seeking shelter and support people who are living in the West End who are fearful of gentrification from the tax-increment financing district that was created during the 2021 legislative session. I filed a rent control bill at the request of residents who were seeking policy band-aids on a bill that was passed without their input.As a Louisville Metro Council member, I championed ban-the-box legislation that would remove questions about felonies from job applications so that folks have a chance at a job and can answer those questions during the job interview. We need this kind of second chance legislation at the federal level.HEALTH CAREis a human right that doesn’t often extend to people living in poverty in our city. For years I suffered with endometriosis. I was able to eventually get the needed surgery to alleviate lifelong pain. I’m grateful to have had insurance that covered what would have been an astronomical bill. But there are far too many people who are uninsured and must foot expensive medical bills. In Congress, I will boldly support Medicare for All and the Momnibus bill. We must connect the intersectionality of environmental, financial, mental and physical health, and that is why I have sponsored the Maternal Care Act in our state legislature to address institutional and systemic racism in health care, as well as legislation to require Medicaid reimbursement for doula support services for pregnant people, and doula support for pregnant women who are incarcerated.RACIAL JUSTICEis one of the reasons that I believe we must engage in a radical transformation of government in the United States. We must dismantle the institutions and systems that were never designed with the thought of women in political leadership or Black, Asian, Latinx, Indigenous, or other people of color in political power; or people who grew up in or are currently living in poverty. We desperately need bold agendas because the status quo won’t save us. Congress’ role in advancing racial justice for Black and Indigenous people is to implement policy that removes barriers and access to jobs, education and affordable housing, codify anti-discrimination into law at the federal level, like with The CROWN Act, and hold systems accountable when they fail.We must hold police accountable at the Congressional level with the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. No person deserves immunity from murder, which is why we must end qualified immunity and demand that officers who kill unarmed people are fired, arrested, and charged with those murders.We must completely ban no-knock warrants. I championed this legislation in the Kentucky General Assembly and supported Lexington in its successful efforts to ban no-knock warrants and will champion this ban in Congress. I believe that every neighborhood, from the East End, to the South End, to the West End, needs the social safety nets that exist for the wealthy – access to mental health and addiction services and financial security.I support ending extreme partisan gerrymandering (especially after the General Assembly totally wiped out the district that I serve from the West End of Louisville , passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, and creating term limits to encourage new generations of leadership to engage in political activity.As a public servant, I have fought for policies that will uplift everyone across Kentucky. The experiences of the past few years have shown me that we can’t wait for justice and transformative change at every level of government. We cannot continue to accept the status quo if we are going to see real progress. Washington has the power to allocate to communities the resources that people need to thrive — we need public servants with the courage and political will to fight for us. I am that leader. Our campaign is about building a community where we all win.I believe in an inside-outside partnership between elected officials and our communities. We need folks on the outside who are agitating for change on the inside — that’s how I started. I am a community activist and organizer who continues to advocate for change. It is the communities that I am on the frontlines with that encouraged me to turn my protest into policy and my legwork into legislation. Most of the bills that I have championed have been at the request of grassroots groups. This is the work I’ll continue in Congress for the people of Kentucky.Our campaign is people-powered and not funded by an ungodly amount of crypto-currency dark money. I’m very direct with voters about what I’m motivated to do in Congress. You know what I’ll do, you know how I’ll lead, and you know how to reach me.Attica Scott is currently a state representative.

minnpost_2022_35,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When I was a child living in a refugee camp, I distinctly remember the vacant feeling of going to bed on an empty stomach when my family didn’t have enough food to eat. I remember the weakness, the inability to concentrate and the desperation for it to end.Recently, I heard from Will, a high school student in my Minneapolis district, who faces similar challenges in a very different context. The pandemic exacerbated already tight family finances. As a result, he often goes to school without breakfast and finds it difficult to concentrate. “When I’m in class, my lunch isn’t until 1:00,” he told me. “I’ll just be sitting there like, ‘Oh my gosh, when is lunch gonna come,’ because I haven’t eaten all day.”No child should go through this.But at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, millions of families across the country faced a similar crisis. Schools were closed, and on top of that, many parents were without jobs, income or their regular hours at work. Students who previously qualified for free or reduced price school meals were now home and hungry. Many parents were forced to scrape together the funds to afford an extra meal for their kids, in addition to the burden of lost wages and caring for kids full time.So in March 2020, I proposed a simple solution: Let schools provide meals at no cost to families. I called it the Maintaining Essential Access to Lunch for Students or MEALS Act (we love acronyms in Congress , and in partnership with the House Education and Labor Committee and Congressional Leadership, we were able to negotiate its inclusion in the bipartisan CARES Act, which passed in March 2020.The results were a resounding success in Minnesota and across the country. The MEALS Act gives schools the flexibility to make changes to their meal program to ensure their ability to provide meals to students by allowing the increase of federal costs for the purpose of providing meals. Approximately22 millionkids relied on school meals before the pandemic, and it’s estimated that the MEALS Act and resulting waivers helped an additional10 millionget fed. It also kept people employed preparing and delivering food for kids who need it.But like most issues in Washington, the story isn’t so simple. The program was set to expire at the end of June if Congress didn’t act. Yet, after Senate Republicans threatened to block additional funding for the meals, I was able to work with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and committee chairs on a compromise to extend the meal waivers through the summer. And last Friday the extension passed, ensuring these meals will not expire!In the midst of horrific decision taking away our basic rights, it’s hard to find hope. But this bill was a shining example of the government working at one if its core functions — making sure the American people don’t go hungry. And it was a reminder that our country can do amazing things when our government works as intended.But we cannot stop here. Supply chain issues and the rising cost of food are making the hunger crisis worse. Food prices are expected to increase up to 7.5% this year, stretching already tight family budgets. Some 13 million children already faced hunger in our countrybeforethe pandemic. Three out of every four teachers say they see students regularly come to school hungry, and amajorityof them regularly buy food for students out of their own pockets.And we know that getting nutritious meals doesn’t just prevent hunger. It has benefits for a child’s physical and mental development.Studies showthat students who show up hungry to class lose the ability to concentrate and have worse academic performance. This can have lifelong consequences.The only lasting solution is to provide school meals free of charge to any student who wants it — as many districts have done during the pandemic. This would reduce burdensome paperwork requirements and make sure that no child in the wealthiest country in the world goes hungry at school. It’s alsooverwhelmingly supportedby Democrats, Republicans and independents. That’s why I haveintroduced a bill— along with the support of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Tina Smith and leaders like Valerie Castile — to do just that.We have an opportunity to prove that a government of the people, by the people and for the people can still deliver big things. We can prevent tens of millions of children across the country from going hungry, and ensure that students, teachers and parents all have the support they need in these difficult times.Ilhan Omar represents Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District in the U.S. House."
minnpost_2022_131,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Wage theft is a crime. You may have assumed this to be true, but you probably don’t know that in reality it is not treated like one.Wage theft happens when an employer with intent to defraud, fails to give workers earned wages or benefits. It is not legally different from when a worker steals cash from the register, but the reality of enforcement leads to far different results. An employer who suspects a worker of theft has the benefit of “free” investigators (police and “free” lawyers (prosecutors . Because we have not created the political will and resources to prosecute employers, a worker’s only remedy requires civil litigation and large legal bills.It is not a crime to make a mistake, or fail to make payroll. But in Minnesota, a recent study found that 23% of construction workers suffer some form of wage theft. That’s tens of thousands of workers robbed immediately upon giving their labor to employers. And these employers are virtually never held accountable despite the fact that Minnesota has robust wage-theft laws. Based on discussions with prosecutors and law enforcement, I have not heard of one person in Minnesota who has been convicted solely under our wage theft statute. Not one.Let me describe two instances of alleged theft that I have dealt with as an attorney. A friend of mine found a cell phone while working at one of his two jobs and reported it to his manager who responded with “not my problem.” Unsure of what to do, my friend took the phone home for safekeeping. I should also mention that my friend is African American. When suspicion fell on him of stealing the (recovered phone, he was arrested at his second job. They put cuffs on him at his job explaining to his second employer that he was being arrested as an “‘alleged thief.” We spent the better part of the year getting this charge dismissed. My second client had fulfilled all the requirements of receiving a commission right before he resigned, after two weeks’ notice. My client was owed $7,000 plus commission, but the employer, presumably angry at his departure, refused to pay. Because he is a successful professional, he can afford to hire our firm to litigate.Tens of thousands of Minnesota workers have no disposable income to stand up for the basic principle that employers shouldn’t steal from them.There was a time when domestic violence was not considered a crime that law enforcement could do anything about. Societal views were different; investigation can be difficult and requires additional resources. Thankfully, over time we have developed the will and the resources to better hold perpetrators accountable and sometimes even get them needed help to end their behavior as well as protecting victims (although there is still much work to do . In the city where I am elected, we have hired and partnered with social workers and victim advocates to get more justice for survivors.There is meaningful work taking place between the Hennepin and Ramsey county attorney offices and Attorney General Keith Ellison’s office through the creation of the Labor Advisory Council. Ultimately, in addition to policy work, public servants like me have to raise public consciousness or workers will continue to be routinely robbed with near total impunity.We currently have a crisis of confidence in our system of justice. As the unequal enforcement of employment theft demonstrates, it is not caused just by policies, but by the realities of how people with power and money are often treated differently than those without. To create confidence in our system, and ultimately public safety and real justice, we must reckon with these realities and create the will to do things differently.Simon Trautmann is a Richfield City Council member and a candidate for Hennepin County Attorney"

eugeneweekly_2022_33,"We ve got issues. As the investors and developers of the homes that make up the C Street Co-op — likely the most affordable homeownership opportunities created statewide last year — we are disturbed by the misleading “Big Switch on Middle Housing” mailer and proposed housing code amendments circulated by so-called “neighborhood leaders.” Neither the four-page glossy mailer nor the proposed amendments will advance “Housing and Climate Justice,” which will likely come as a surprise to many of the signatories of the mailer’s petition. This small group of white homeowners argue in essence that middle housing zoning changes will result in big monstrous buildings with no affordability, but then argue we should remove all incentives for smaller, affordable homes. The C Street Co-op created six “micro” homeownership opportunities for a purchase price of only $10,000, total monthly payments of just $790, and built to a scale that matches the neighborhood. While the “neighborhood leaders” behind the mailer have praised C Street as a model of affordable housing, their proposal would ensure fewer projects like it are built, less middle housing is developed overall, and that what is built will be larger, more expensive homes. The misleading rhetoric of these “neighborhood leaders” can sound convincing, so let us address some of their claims. “No affordability requirements” The Eugene Planning Commission recommendations contain modest incentives for smaller and affordable housing but do not “require” it. This is used as an alarmist false flag, followed by a proposal to actually remove affordability incentives. This would obstruct the two-year public process through which the Planning Commission and its advisory panel of 29 lottery-selected, demographically representative community members aligned their recommendations with the community’s needs. If these “neighborhood leaders” truly care about affordability, they would engage this inclusive, transparent process and push for deeper affordability. “No restrictions on demolitions” Do you want the city telling you what you can and can’t do with your existing home? It’s another false flag used to obstruct community process. Old housing gets demolished only when the new housing that replaces it commands a high profit. Developing large luxury homes commands a higher profit than the smaller and affordable homes, which the Planning Commission incentivizes. This does not increase the potential for housing demolitions — it enables housing that meets the needs of Eugeneans. Further, there is a frequent claim that “existing affordable rentals” still exist in this city. That sounds like a claim that could only be made by people who haven’t rented in the last decade. “Increased height and lot coverage” The Planning Commission mostly recommends minimum compliance with state law, maintaining the same building setbacks as current requirements for single-family homes. It takes modest steps to encourage middle housing by allowing an additional five feet of building height compared to the 30 feet currently allowed for single-family homes, and an additional 25 percent lot coverage. These are modest changes to help ensure middle housing will actually get built. “Increased density and bulk” According to Oregon Housing and Community Services, we need to build 584,000 homes statewide in the next decade. We will not get there without increasing density. However, “density” and “bulk” are not the same thing. A fourplex of small affordable units can be the same size as a luxury home, and yet it offers four times the density — four times as much housing opportunity. Incentivizing more smaller housing units increases the potential for affordable housing outcomes and compatibility with existing homes. “No tree protections” It’s yet another false flag. The same tree protection standards that apply to single-family homes will apply to middle housing. Let’s consider how we can bolster the city’s tree canopy, but let’s not use trees as a weapon against homes. Home prices have more than doubled in the past decade, and most Eugene renters have lost access to homeownership. Our neighborhoods have become gated communities. The Eugene Planning Commission is unanimously recommending a step in the right direction. And we should do even more to incentivize what Eugene needs: more smaller affordable homeownership opportunities like Springfield’s C Street Co-op. Let’s talk about that — not just how to obstruct the public process to protect the special interests of a few white homeowners profiting from our crisis. John Fischer and Tom Bowerman are impact investors in the C Street Co-op. Andrew Heben, project director at SquareOne Villages, and Dylan Lamar, architect-developer with Cultivate, Inc. were co-developers of the co-op."
suffolknewsherald_2022_109,"Published 5:41 pm Tuesday, April 19, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Jim GrandfieldIt starts early in your career. You take the July bar exam, and the results come out in October. You are licensed to practice law!If you are truly fortunate, you end up in a public defender office. You are an assistant public defender. You are really a lawyer, with your very own clients. You are tasked with bringing the Sixth Amendment to life, and ensuring that your clients are afforded due process when prosecuted by the government.The first instance usually happens at Thanksgiving. Your parents are simply excited, that after three years of law school and a mountain of student debt, you have a job — any job. You are as well. But within weeks of starting your job, you realize what a truly special job it is.And then, THE QUESTION. Perhaps it’s a well-meaning relative. Perhaps it’s a relative trying to be “cutesy.” Maybe the relative doesn’t understand the adversarial system. Worse, maybe they do, and they ask THE QUESTION, because they truly feel that way.“So, what’s it like representing allthosepeople?” Or maybe it’s the other version: “How do you represent someone you know is guilty?”As a young lawyer, you know that you have entered a profession in which civility is not just encouraged, but required. You also know that the family holiday table is not the time for a civics lesson, even though your relatives could certainly benefit from one. So you smile and answer politely, brushing off the question with a fairly benign, “Everyone is entitled to a defense. Now please pass the potatoes.”The next instance happens about a year or two into your practice. You have mastered the incredibly steep learning curve that comes with being a brand new public defender, and are morphing into an excellent trial lawyer. You zealously represent a client and get a good result. The client is happy and appreciative of your efforts.Intending to compliment you, the client asks, “Hey, you’re pretty good. When are you gonna get promoted and go over to the prosecutor’s office?” The client doesn’t mean anything bad by it. But hundreds of hours of television and movies, with too many episodes of “Law and Order,” have subconsciously ingrained even in the very clients you serve that prosecutors are the good guys and that being one would be a step up.As a public defender, you practice primarily in one jurisdiction. You get to know the prosecutors and the police officers. And as your professional reputation grows, so does the good-natured kidding. “How long you gonna stay on the dark side?” “How do you sleep at night?” “When are you going to come join Team America?”And while all these comments are said in jest, the undertone is clear: A lawyer truly interested in helping society would become a prosecutor. Having found that humor is a far better reaction than taking offense, I have replied to many police officers that public defenders are also in law enforcement (wait long enough for their umbrage to kick in ; we are the quality assurance division.Maybe, just maybe, you don’t spend your whole career as a public defender. One day you find yourself sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee at your confirmation hearing to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Remembering back to those questions at the Thanksgiving table, you keep your composure and answer the questions politely.The following, while not specifically asked during the hearings, are quotes from four U.S. senators in various forums about their views on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and her time as a federal public defender.(The good senator failed to mention that the defendants at Nuremberg were in fact afforded defense counsel. Of the first 22 major actors charged, three were acquitted. Here’s a clue, Senator Grassley: The answer for public defenders would be “just about every case.” Every public defender I know would love to be a victim of our own success. If we could steer clients away from the behaviors that got them in trouble, we’d be the first to do it. Crimeisoffensive. I have represented people on matters from traffic offenses to murder. I condone neither bad driving nor murder. What I do “condone” is a fair system with capable, competent, zealous defense counsel who make sure that the government plays by the rules.Perhaps a better question from the senator might have been this: “Would you have wanted to have been part of legal system in which there was no defense counsel? If you were part of such system, would you have worried that people would have been ‘taken off the street’ with no due process?” Public defenders are like firefighters in representing our clients. The court rings the bell and appoints us, and we come, with lights, sirens and the zealousness the law requires. No judgment, no reservations, no declining the call because you were smoking in bed.The preceding are sadly illustrative but not exhaustive. The Sixth Amendment reads in part, “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.” Like all other amendments, is not self-executing. As the recent confirmation hearings for now Justice Jackson illustrate, it is not just well-meaning relatives or professional colleagues who denigrate what we do. When sitting United States senators make such comments or ask such questions, one can only conclude that the Sixth Amendment, if it is to provide protections to all and not just some, must be vigorously, vocally and publicly defended.The tradition begun by John Adams (successfully representing the British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre is carried out by today’s public defenders. So the next time someone asks you how you sleep at night or invites you to leave the dark side, I invite you to recall (and paraphrase the words of Jack Nicholson as Col. Nathan Jessup in the iconic “A Few Good Men.” Tell your inquisitor that you resent any person who sleeps under the blanket of due processyouprovide, and then questions the manner in which you provide it.Every public defender I know works not just to help the client with their legal case, but to help the client restore their life after involvement with the criminal justice system. A lawyer in my office started a drug treatment courtfrom scratch. Two more lawyers are working on the formation of a mental health docket in General District Court. My mitigation specialist and paralegal have assisted countless clients in signing up for GED prep courses, find mental health placements, obtain substance abuse training, and such seemingly simple but vital tasks as to obtain a valid ID or a driver’s license.It’s not about rooting for murderers, but helping people. Any Virginia public defender, whether just starting out, or 26 years into it like I am, need only look to the Mission Statement of the Virginia Indigent Defense Commission, to find our marching orders: “DEDICATED to protecting and defending the rights and dignity of our clients through zealous, compassionate, high quality legal advocacy.”That is what public defenders do day in and day out: serving both their clientsandtheir community.Jim Grandfield is a veteran public defender in Suffolk.

leoweekly_2022_60,"The first time I ever heard about Delta 8 was coming off a line in a kitchen, when a co-worker handed me a vape pen and offered me a drag or two. When he told me it wasn’t “weed,” I was suspicious. I was aware of Delta 9, everyone knows it s THC that gets you high, so, of course, it would be illegal here in the good ol’ Commonwealth of Kentucky. So what is this Delta 8 I’m hearing about all of a sudden, and how are they able to market it as “legal weed” and sell it if it isn’t synthetic? A month later I took a job as a sales associate for Steel & Leaf LLC and found out exactly that yes, it is legal weed-ish. What happens is manufacturers isolate other aspects of the THC molecule and derive them from CBD instead of cannabis, which, thanks to the 2018 Hemp Act, has made clear that hemp/CBD are a different plant and classification than cannabis.While Kentucky is known for being a farm enterprise state, certain acts by lawmakers come along and work against our interests. Bills such as theSenate Bill 170would make any “intoxicating” hemp-derived THC distillates illegal for purchase, for production or formulation. The national hemp industry is here, in the CBD market, in the derivatives, and if this bill passes into law, there would be virtually no incentive to grow hemp for any reason in the Commonwealth.To understand the difference between cannabinoids is to understand that the THC molecule is like a jigsaw puzzle of tons of deltas, cannabinoids, isomers and molecular components that together complete a picture that looks like THC and work together to make you feel it inside and out. When you smoke cannabis as well as when you take a recommended amount of full spectrum CBD oil, you are smoking and ingesting Delta 8 as well. It’s there, naturally occurring and you may have never known that because why would you need to? Whether you’re taking it for neurological, gastrointestinal, cancer inhibiting reasons or because you may have anxiety, stress and/or depression; it works. It helps! What’s even crazier to me is that despite the name, Delta 8 being a recent concept to our cannabis and hemp markets, it has been known and extensively researched since the 1940s. This isn’t new, just new to consumers. What’s more is that Delta 8, Delta 9, Delta 10, THC-O and HHC are well-documented and researched cannabinoids that have been looked into by U.S. government research in hopes to inhibit cancer cells and neurological disorders previously. It was the crackdown of cannabis in the ‘70s and the move to classify it as a Schedule I controlled substance that halted and buried the years of research that has existed. It wasn’t until states started legalizing cannabis that the research we knew of was able to truly be explored. Ultimately, in a lot of ways, Delta 8 is new but the idea and record of Delta 8 is older than the law to criminalize it.The Commonwealth of Kentucky has a vibrant history in the hemp farming industry. Once upon a time, a vast majority of our farms were growing hemp, and we have a unique opportunity due to the optimal growing conditions that hemp can grow very well here. In fact, the 2018 Hemp Act gave us a blazing green light to begin incentivizing farmers to grow hemp and we as a Commonwealth have made great strides to offer protection for hemp farming. There’s a huge problem though, one I wasn’t totally aware of until I got deeper in the field of CBD and THC derivatives. The state seems to lack the understanding and laws protecting individual farmers who want to produce, process and market THC derivatives and CBD flower.Despite consistent gains across the country in the world of CBD floral farming and hemp derivatives, Kentucky has not budged on efforts to legalize hemp flower, production and marketing. Little by little, it has been undoing any hope we have as producers of hemp from tapping into where the hemp industry is currently seeing the most revenue and where I as a retailer of hemp-derived THC am seeing the industry continue to grow. We could, and by all intents and purposes should, be leading the country in CBD research, discoveries, formulation and processing. Instead we are bordering on being locked out of the nearly $650 million floral and derivative market and may lose hope in hemp thriving in the Commonwealth entirely.Even Ryan Quarles of the Kentucky Department of Agriculture is warning potential hemp farmers to proceed with caution and that the market is unstable, but it isn’t at all. The market is strong, but mostly in an area we refuse to participate in, the floral market. The hemp industry is producing less fiber, grain and seed than recent years and squarely moving forward in formulation of THC derivatives, so why can’t we? Why would our legislature actively hinder our growth with bills like SB170 and take what little hemp we are still producing to be processed and formulated in products we would have no access to and cut us off from the industry at large?To be clear, this fight for hemp is a separate one from the fight to legalize cannabis, and both deserve serious deliberation and research respectively. It is entirely possible to legalize cannabis while letting hemp derivatives continue to be grown, processed and manufactured in Kentucky and it would only stand to benefit us holistically either way. There is nothing to lose in continuing to allow THC derivatives to be produced and a whole lot to gain. If you haven’t tried Delta 8 or any hemp derivatives, I highly recommend you see what the fuss is about, check it out and tell your representatives you do not want to lose this opportunity for the health and economic benefits of cannabinoids and hemp in our Commonwealth.Virginia Lee is theassistant store manager of Steel& Leaf LLC,a Louisville-based hemp dispensary.

It was founded six years ago by foster parents and serves more than 600 children in foster care annually. It has the noble goals of building a population of licensed foster care parents that exceeds the number of children entering care in Hampton Roads; to ensure that foster youth have only one placement between entering and exiting foster care, rather than having to bounce from home to home, and that they exit foster care through successful family reunification and not through aging out; and to afford foster youth the support necessary to transform to successful adulthood.Those goals seek to address some of the most commonly cited criticisms and pitfalls of the foster care system, and we would be hard pressed to think of a more worthy cause than making sure local children, already in a bad situation not of their own making, are able to get the support they need to overcome the hardships they and their birth family are facing. In addition to recruiting more foster parents, Tidewater Friends of Foster Care provides support to youngsters including tutoring, extracurricular activities, birthday and holiday gifts and more.Saturday’s event will seek specifically to increase public awareness of how the community can strengthen the foster care system in the region.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_42,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°Vast stretches of permafrost are melting as the Earth’s polar regions warm, thawing ancient viruses and bacteria that had remained frozen for tens of thousands of years. Behind the lurid headlines about “zombie viruses,” there’s some fascinating science — and a warning.Last month, scientists announced they’d taken a sample of tundra from Siberia, extracted a virus that had been frozen for 50,000 years, and showed it was still capable of infecting its normal host — amoebas. It was not only a virus new to scientists but also a member of an intriguing group of giant viruses. These are shaking up scientists’ understanding of how viruses evolved, representing a sort of missing link with other life forms.So the size and the age of this virus are both scientifically noteworthy — and the fact that it can cause infections after being frozen since the stone age should be a little scary. That’s not because this specific virus will adapt itself to infect humans but because it means other viruses that might be more dangerous to us could also be lurking down there.The virus found in Siberia infects amoebas by mimicking their favorite food — bacteria — said research leader Jean Michele Claverie. It doesn’t infect cells of mammals. He said he isolated this particular virus because it’s unlikely to spur a new pandemic.His concern, he said, is that something more dangerous could emerge as people dig kilometer-deep holes in thawing permafrost for mining operations. As the Earth warms and permafrost thaws, it not only opens up new areas for oil exploration and mining, but might also open a Pandora’s box of pathogens.There’s already enough cause for concern given that we know thawing permafrost is freeing organisms that exhale methane and carbon dioxide, creating a climate feedback loop that will accelerate global warming. Moreover, scientists warned years ago that digging in such areas could release smallpox virus from human bodies buried in the ground.Exploring this environment, carefully, has its upsides. This latest finding is shaking up the way scientists understand viruses. Scientists are still puzzling over where viruses came from and debating whether they are alive or just inanimate bits of stray genetic code. Understanding how to define life is at the core of scientists’ quest to find life elsewhere in the cosmos and understand how it originated on Earth.More than a decade ago, Claverie and his colleagues discovered the first giant virus, dubbed mimivirus because it mimicked bacteria or other more complex organisms. He believed this was not a strange outlier but might represent an ignored branch of the tree of life. Since then he’s found more — including megavirus and pandoravirus.“It has changed the way we look at viruses,” he said. He believes the giant viruses provide evidence that viruses are alive, in part because they have an evolutionary relationship with the rest of the living world. Although they can’t live independently, being a parasite hasn’t disqualified other organisms from being considered alive.Scientists are still debating how giant viruses evolved — whether they grew from smaller virus ancestors, or shrunk from more complex ancestral life forms. Claverie thinks other, normal-sized viruses could have descended from more complex bugs that downsized after taking up a parasitic lifestyle.Why go looking for them in the permafrost? Claverie said he was inspired by a group of scientists who succeeded in growing a plant from seed that had been frozen for 30,000 years. He asked the researchers who made that finding if he could study some of their samples, and in 2014 he announced a virus of record-breaking size had emerged from the sample and infected amoebas in his lab.The virus he just announced is even older, at 50,000 years, which is the limit for measuring age with carbon dating. There’s no known limit for how long viruses can persist in a frozen state.To revive the viruses, he puts material from the permafrost in contact with live amoebas — which he calls “bait.” If they get infected by a virus, they show symptoms — flawed division, abnormal shapes. “Our team of people detect that … uh-oh, those amoebas are not very well.” The viruses meanwhile make many more copies of themselves for the scientists to study.Other researchers I contacted said the viruses themselves are fascinating and important, but they would like to see better evidence that they really came from the frozen tundra and didn’t sneak in later. “Amoebas (and their viruses are ubiquitous in many environments,” wrote Eric Delwart, a microbiologist at the University of California San Francisco, in an email. “Could some giant viruses or infected amoebas simply have drifted or floated onto these samples?”Researchers are also analyzing samples of permafrost more broadly for DNA, using techniques similar to DNA forensics. “We can recognize the traces of everything that was ever in this environment, including other viruses,” Claverie said.There’s no way stop Russia from mining what resources emerge from a melting Siberia, but we should all hope the Russians proceed cautiously.Workers and those who live in mining towns should be monitored for signs of infection. And while some global warming is now inevitable, we should all be invested in keeping it to a minimum.Anything that’s been locked in ice for 50,000 years should probably stay there.Faye Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering science.

suffolknewsherald_2022_69,"Published 6:20 pm Friday, June 3, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Stephen D. HanerGuest columnistEverybody eats. With all the money sloshing around the Virginia treasury for the General Assembly to play with, it is hard to see the logic in continuing the state sales tax on groceries an additional six months, delaying that particular tax cut until Jan. 1.The inflation on everything at the grocery store means more tax revenue is coming in from that source than was expected when the initial budget was prepared last year. If they had allowed the tax cut effective July 1 rather than Jan. 1, inflation on other items people buy (restaurant meals, furniture, electronics, clothing, non-food items would protect the state’s spending in full (necessities and niceties. But no, under the budget conference report adopted by the General Assembly June 1, the state’s 1.5% tax on unprepared foods will continue through the summer and fall of 2022. People will pay the full sales tax on their summer cookouts, packed school lunches and Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday meals. What is an additional dollar or two per week for 26 weeks, after all?Financially, it is not a huge thing. Politically, it ought to prove a headache for legislators.Frankly, it was probably just a power trip for the Democrats in the Senate, who held that position (no change until Jan. 1 through the budget negotiations and think they won something by prevailing. They are also proud of having totally protected the remaining 1% food tax, which goes directly to local governments.On the other hand, a new sales tax exemption for pet medications will go into effect July 1.During the discussions at Wednesday’s session, advocates for the conference report claimed the various elements of tax relief will work out to about $1,100 saved in the coming year for the average Virginia family of four. The biggest part of that is the one-time cash rebate expected to arrive later this summer ($500 for a couple . The second largest part is the increase in the standard deduction, up from $9,000 to $16,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly, reducing their income tax this year and future years by $403.Individual taxes were the focus, receiving the largest adjustments in this period of record state revenue. Only a handful of tax changes to benefit business were made, although both business and individual taxpayers will benefit from the decision to fully conform with the Internal Revenue Service Code changes for 2022.That conformity decision means the many small and large businesses that took money in the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP and were able to convert the loan into a grant will owe no state tax on any of it. That is a big improvement over 2021, when only the first $100,000 in PPP grants were exempted.Legislators will crow about having eliminated the accelerated sales tax rules, requiring certain businesses to remit their July sales tax collections in June. But that move doesn’t save anybody one dollar. It is merely a timing issue, now moving the expense back into the proper fiscal year. That one-time collection date acceleration is a favorite gimmick for quick revenue in a budget crunch (now primed to use again in the next one. And the conferees put $180 million in remaining federal grant funds into the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund, enough to short-circuit what would have been a UI tax increase for calendar year 2023. That and the PPP decision were about the only significant tax-related provisions for business, and the 2022 General Assembly did nothing else to reduce business taxes and make Virginia more competitive.Nobody talks about it, but the state’s flush cash position can still be traced to the 2019 General Assembly session. The full impact of the various federal tax changes under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA was becoming apparent, but the Assembly (then a Republican-controlled body stubbornly refused to make serious adjustments in state tax rules to prevent the windfall. It is that windfall which filled state tax coffers starting in 2020, along with other tax hikes approved under former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.With the standard deduction rising now to $16,000 for a couple (up from $6,000 in 2018 , a substantial portion of the windfall paid by individuals will now be returned. Not so the TCJA windfall coming in from business income taxpayers. Through 10 months of this fiscal year, the state had collected $1.6 billion in corporate income taxes, double the less than $800 million at the same point four years ago.There is much to praise in the final budget. Conferees viewed much of the extra revenue as one-time money, perhaps unlikely to continue, which is certainly true of the flood of federal COVID-related grants. They used it to shore up the Virginia Retirement System with an extra infusion, replace some capital debt with cash payments instead, create a long-demanded school construction fund, and now expect a record $3.8 billion to be held in reserve by the end of the next cycle in June 2024.Don’t doubt they could have found a hundred million or so to relieve Virginians of the state food tax a bit earlier, instead of making them pay the full tax all the way to New Year’s Day, 2023.

minnpost_2022_166,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Instead, the Biden administration in January, and the Walz administration just last month have decided to halt analysis of this company’s application by way of a blanket ban on new mining permits on 230,000 acres of Minnesota for up to 20 years, and by pulling two different leases that the company has held in good standing for more than 50 years and through 11 presidential administrations.Let’s look at the bigger picture. If these actions can happen in this instance, what prevents them from happening in any other? Stated another way, should permitting (an ostensibly objective process change based on the person currently occupying the Oval Office or Governor’s Residence?Permitting is a very important function. Permits can help certify the competency of a business, ensure the safety and effectiveness of products, promote responsible use of natural resources, and even advance broad social goals, such as environmental protections for land, water, and air. They are thorough processes, some of which (as here can take years to complete, across multiple administrations.Before an approval process begins, applicants must design its project, conduct any number of baseline studies, and only after having done its homework, submit a formal plan proposal for review and, ultimately, a decision.It shouldn’t have to be stated so clearly, but an assumed principle by applicants is that the processmust be predictable, impartial and fair.A fair process denied here diminishes a fair process everywhere, which is why we feel compelled to write. The next hospital, widget factory, retail expansion or bridge overpass must now contemplate the political favorability of its project in addition to its objective worthiness. These decisions will be appealed, as they should be, and we hope they are overturned, but not because we’re necessarily rooting for the specific project at issue. It’s because the most predictable consequence of these action is not a happy one – an evenmorepartisan, hyper-political discussion on a subject that should be governed by science and process is now all but assured.In light of the increased importance of these materials following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, perhaps it’s best for policymakers to re-evaluate this process so that if the application is denied, it’s because it was thoughtfully considered, and failed to meet Minnesota’s high standards. Likewise, if approved, Minnesotans can rest assured that the mine will be safe and productive for Minnesotans, and indeed the whole world.Christie Ransom and Brad Gruhot serve as presidents of the Winona Area and Marshall Area Chambers of Commerce, respectively."
minnpost_2022_62,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2019, I got up early and went into my office at St. Paul City Hall before anyone else had arrived.I was there to resign.This was not a decision I made lightly. I had been hired to lead the way on “community-first public safety,” a supposedly visionary transformation away from traditional policing — over-policing, really — and toward real safety in the city. I was honored to serve under Melvin Carter, the city’s first Black mayor, and optimistic about the progress he and others had campaigned on.Unfortunately, it only took 10 months for me to realize that transformation wasn’t actually on the agenda. Carter and the supposedly progressive city council continued to dump money into policing as usual while disregarding and refusing to fund genuinely transformative initiatives from the community or my office. I felt tokenized, used as a prop, as though my role in improving the city started and ended the moment they could announce they’d hired me, a reformed ex-drug dealer and gang member.The timing of my resignation was no accident. That day, the mayor was attending a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day event hosted by Gov. Tim Walz. It was a façade that was going on in many cities around the country, every year: parades, prayer breakfasts, marches. Eventually, someone sings “We Shall Overcome,” someone else quotes from “I Have a Dream,” and everyone pats each other on the back for showing up. Then they go back to business as usual.It’s as sad as it is obvious that we as a nation pride ourselves on celebrating King once a year for a couple of hours and then during the following 364 days we proceed to ignore everything he fought for. It’s less about passing laws and more about photo ops.This country embraces a watered-down, whitewashed version of King because too many of us have a need to remember a man who begged for peace and hoped for a future free of racism. That’s more comfortable to think about, but it erases the man who fought for justice.Everyone remembers the rousing, optimistic, uplifting end to “I Have a Dream.” Fewer will know that just minutes earlier, King called out the “unspeakable horrors of police brutality,” and economic racism that limited Black choices to living in “a small ghetto” or a “larger one.”This was someone who was arrested dozens of times for his role in protests. He sacrificed money, time with his family and the comfortable life his status could have afforded him. The causes he fought for could sometimes seem obscure, even minor; he spent the last days of his life fighting for economic justice for garbagemen in Memphis.After that, his next stated mission was demanding the federal government take steps to end poverty, outright. How many political figures today, even on the progressive left, are comfortable — or willing — to engage ideas that ambitious?King was willing to sacrifice his popularity for that in which he believed. In his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” he called out the white moderates who told Black people to be patient, to be less demanding and disruptive, in the struggle for desegregation and civil rights. We see these same “liberals” still today, the type to talk sympathy out of one side of their mouth while using the other side to summon cops to brutalize peaceful protesters. This happened in Minneapolis, St. Paul and just about everywhere else after the murder of George Floyd.No topic was off-limits for King. He spoke out against the Vietnam War. He told followers to stop drinking Coca-Cola and eating Wonder Bread until they addressed racist practices. He told people to take their money out of big banks and insurance companies and switch it to Black-owned institutions. He called out sheriffs, mayors, presidents and other civil rights activists.That was the King I had in mind when I gave up my job, and the six-figure salary that came with it, to resume the struggle working from outside the walls of St. Paul City Hall. At the time, I wrote to Carter that I had a “knot in my chest that needs to be loosened.”For some old and some new reasons, that knot is still there.Last year, as he campaigned for reelection, Carter was vocal about the fact he had increased police department funding by $10 million over his predecessor. How’s that working out? In 2021, St. Paul saw an all-time homicide record. My analysis, more police equates to less Black people. This analysis continues to fall on deaf ears.In the budget that passed last month, the St. Paul Police Department got more than $120 million. Meanwhile, the Office of Neighborhood Safety, the city’s first real attempt at investing in community-led crime response and prevention, will be funded with … $1.1 million.We don’t honor King’s legacy by holding hands and singing along with people who would order that righteous protesters be beaten, gassed, and dragged off the streets to jail. Those are tactics King would’ve recognized, and I can’t help but wonder how he’d feel to know they’re still here with us five decades later. But I know what he’d do, and that’s organize, strategize, gather his people and fight.A new generation of organizers is asking for the right to live free of state-sanctioned brutality, including state-sanctioned murders, and is instead met with violence in the streets and hollow speeches from behind podiums. Anyone who thinks those setbacks will curb the movement’s energy don’t know the strength of our spirit. And they don’t know the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as well as they think.“Our lives begin to end,” King said, “when we become silent about the things that matter the most.”Jason Sole is the former president of the Minneapolis NAACP and an associate professor of criminal justice at Hamline University."
suffolknewsherald_2022_220,"Published 4:24 pm Friday, November 18, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardWith Thanksgiving upon us, Christmas season will soon move into full gear. Some folks will celebrate the start of the season Thursday by watching football games or putting up their Christmas trees. Others will mark the occasion over the long weekend by taking advantage of Black Friday or Small Business Saturday sales in an effort to get their Christmas shopping done.Clearly, in this season of giving, shopping for gifts will be an important part of just about any observance of Christmas. But for some folks in Suffolk, this Christmas will be an especially painful one. We saw an article in a respected national publication last week reporting that 60% of Americans are living from paycheck to paycheck. For many people in such situations, there will be no Christmas gifts this year.When such situations affect Suffolk families with children, the Cheer Fund is there to help. More than 90 years ago, the Suffolk News-Herald’s Cheer Fund was established to help raise money for toys for underprivileged children throughout the city. For many years, a local advisory board and a few other volunteers have worked together to make sure toys were distributed to those who needed them.Any adult who has ever seen the look of happiness in the eye of a child who has received just the right unexpected gift under the Christmas tree can readily understand the reason that the Cheer Fund exists. But there’s a difference between understanding and supporting.Today, we want to encourage you to lend your full support to the Cheer Fund, which this year has a goal of $40,000 after raising about $42,000 in 2021. To do so requires little in the way of commitment or sacrifice from most folks. Instead, it requires a resolve to write a check and put it in the mail. Whether for a small amount or a large one is almost less important than the simple fact of financially supporting a deserving community-improvement project.Please show you care for your community this year with a donation to the Cheer Fund. The happy faces of many children around Suffolk could depend on your support.To contribute, send a check to Cheer Fund, P.O. Box 1220, Suffolk, VA 23439 or bring it to the newspaper office, 157 N. Main St., from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Friday. We will list your donation in the newspaper, but it can be marked “anonymous” if you like.Donations may be made in honor of or in memory of someone.

minnpost_2022_15,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Though it’s hard to imagine, there will come a day when the federal government declares the COVID-19 pandemic to be “over.” Our current state of public health emergency isset to end on April 16. And once it ends, temporary pandemic-related relief measures will also expire.One of those threatened relief measures is the expansion of federal food assistance for low-income college students. To make matters worse, the “pandemic pause” on student loan repaymentalso expires on May 1, and presidential campaign promises of federal student loan forgivenessremain unfulfilled.Jokes about college students surviving on ramen noodles disguise the truth thatone in every four college students in Minnesota is food insecure, meaning they don’t have enough food to maintain their health. Rates are even higher for students from under-resourced and marginalized communities — for example, 33 percent of first-generation college students and 43 percent of Black students in Minnesota are food insecure. The pandemic created an array of additional economic hardships for students. High unemployment rates for young adults and on-going declines in college enrollment are evidence of that struggle.To help address these challenges, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act in December 2020,temporarily expanding college student eligibility for food assistancethrough the USDA Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP in several key ways. Because of these important expansions, many low-income students in need are now able to receive SNAP benefits. Previously, most able-bodied students enrolled in higher education at least half time were noteligible for benefitsunless they met specific exemption criteria, such as active participation in a government work study program, weekly employment of 20 hours or more, or responsibility for a child dependent.“The expansion of SNAP benefits has been really important for students,” said Catherine Paro, student support manager at St. Cloud Community and Technical College. “Many students who meet the SNAP income guidelines now weren’t previously eligible because they couldn’t add working 20 hours each week in addition to their academic schedule. The pandemic made it even more difficult for these students to stay afloat, and the SNAP expansion has provided much-needed extra grocery money for them and their families each month.”Ending food insecurity during college could have important long-term implications.Research publishedlast yearshowed students who experienced food insecurity during college were 43 percent less likely than their peers to graduate, and the effect of food insecurity on college dropout rates was far worse for first generation college students than for others.Bills now under consideration to address the problemThe temporary expansions to SNAP access for college students should be continued and expanded, and legislators have proposed two noteworthy bills to do so. First,the Student Food Security Act of 2021would make the temporary COVID-19 SNAP student eligibility changes permanent. In addition, it would allow students who meet the financial eligibility criteria to receive the maximum Federal Pell Grant to also be SNAP eligible. Second,theEATS Act of 2021would further extend SNAP and end the eligibility requirements of active participation in work study programs or 20 or more hours of weekly outside employment for most people attending college at least half time.“The EATS Act provides an opportunity to permanently ensure low-income college students have equitable access to SNAP, the nation’s first line of defense against hunger,” said Luis Guardia, president of the Food Research & Action Center, a leading national non-profit organization based in Washington D.C. “Students cannot learn on an empty stomach. It’s time that we fully respond to their economic needs and help students achieve their educational goals.”We need actionAs a country, we need to do the right thing and make sure we support low-income young people in pursuing higher education to help ensure a better future for themselves and their families.Melissa Laska, PhD, RD is a distinguished McKnight University professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health and is an expert in nutrition, food access and health disparities."
minnpost_2022_111,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In moments of crisis, when daily life is upended, we can see more clearly the perils of the status quo and the promises of a better future. Over the past two years, in the midst of the COVID pandemic and the wake of the George Floyd uprising, Minnesotans across ethnicity, income, and geography made clear commitments to make our state a more just and equitable place – and our economy more inclusive.Black, African, Asian, Latinx, Indigenous and immigrant leaders stepped into our power, leveraging our business ingenuity to meet immediate needs and create new opportunities for our communities – and state. With that momentum, more than 20 cultural and place-based business associations, BIPOC-led community organizations and arts organizations came together to form the Business Resource Collective to ensure relief and recovery efforts prioritized BIPOC business owners’ needs in the short term and reversed entrenched racial disparities in the long term.For a time, our political leaders followed our lead, taking the initial steps toward a different political paradigm. Relief grants flowed to our BIPOC small businesses. Evictions were put on hold to keep our families in their homes.But now, with more than $1 billion remaining from the American Rescue Plan Act and a $9.2 billion budget surplus, our state leaders are poised to squander this historic moment of unprecedented resources that could transform our state economy.With targeted and sustained investments at the state level, we can ensure thriving small business landscapes in every community, where our ingenuity creates living wage jobs for neighborhood residents, and our enterprises support community-nurturing gathering spaces that generate economic opportunity. The time to invest in Micro- to Main Street businesses is now.We know that BIPOC and immigrant-owned businesses play an essential role in building and sustaining the culture, wealth and economic vitality of BIPOC and immigrant communities – and are central to the economic survival and prosperity of our state overall. According to the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, the number of BIPOC-owned businesses doubled between 2007 and 2017, increasing from 31,000 businesses in 2007 to 58,000 in 2017. And that surge has only grown amidst COVID.Here in Minnesota, the Black Women’s Wealth Alliance (BWWA has seen increased demand for their services supporting Black entrepreneurs and businesses. For instance, TRI-Construction, Minnesota’s largest Black-owned construction firm lacked access to critical capital and technical assistance to scale their company during an unexpected period of growth amid the murder of George Floyd. The BWWA provided TRI-Construction with a business assessment, equity capital support for operations in the form of a $30,000 grant, and technical support to develop a business strategy that led to an additional $750,000 in capital lending. But, right now, the small business landscape lacks significant investment options to support small business growth, especially for BIPOC businesses like TRI-Construction.That’s why, drawing on our collective work with thousands of BIPOC small businesses statewide, we created a blueprint for a comprehensive set of state investments that can create and sustain a healthy, thriving business ecosystem for our communities. We have shared this vision and found champions in the state legislature, as well as the Governor’s Council on Economic Expansion, who recognize the potential for our cultural communities – and our statewide tax base – if we support the operation, growth and health of BIPOC small businesses.To do that, we must be specific in naming and defining small business to include microbusinesses, sole proprietors, creative businesses and home-based businesses. We must ensure BIPOC small businesses have access to right-sized capital and loans, affordable commercial spaces with options for ownership, and technical support and training.The resources to do exactly that are available and policies that will move the needle on the racial wealth gap by building this ecosystem of BIPOC business support are on the table at the legislature right now. These policies include a loan fund for both small businesses and emerging developers, increased culturally responsive business support, and community revitalization and capital project grants.With targeted and sustained investments, we can strengthen Minnesota’s small and micro businesses that have been kept in the margins of our economy, providing opportunities to increase resilience in the face of the next challenge. We know what it takes, and we have the resources to do it. The future of our state as an inclusive and welcoming environment for BIPOC entrepreneurs hangs in the balance."
suffolknewsherald_2022_191,"Published 2:59 pm Thursday, January 27, 2022ByStaff ReportsWe are thrilled to see a new advocacy organization has set up shop in North Suffolk to provide a resource for parents of special education students across the region.The Parent Educational Advocacy Training Center’s Hampton Roads office is in the Harbour Breeze Professional Center. As reported by Jimmy LaRoue on today’s front page, this office provides a working space for several employees from throughout the region who have been working from home and now have a place to meet face-to-face with those in need.This office being centrally located in the region will help many who need help with navigating the special education system and accessing support for their families.In June 2020, a federal report found “systemic failures in how the Virginia Department of Education monitors and responds to special education complaints against local school districts,” according to reporting by the Virginia Mercury. The investigation by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services began in 2019 — before the pandemic — and was spurred by “an unusually high number of customer service communications from parents, advocates, and other stakeholders in Virginia with concerns that appeared to raise potential compliance concerns,” according to a letter from the federal department to the Virginia Department of Education.By many accounts, the pandemic has only made access issues worse for students and families in need of special education services. The Hampton Roads area also has a high transient population because of its military presence, and that presents another challenge for those advocating for these students and families.While we’re certain that the individual special education professionals all across our region are doing great work and overcoming many obstacles, having an advocacy organization locally that truly partners with families as well as educators is important. The PEATC is helping to ensure that families and students in the Hampton Roads region are able to get the support they need.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_17,"Thefootage from the Eastern Kentucky flooding has been absolutely jarring, as historic water levels quickly submerged multiple communities, leading to heartbreaking damage and a rising death toll.As of Tuesday at noon, there were 37 confirmed fatalities in five counties, with searches for missing people still underway.From a distance, it’s always hard to know exactly how to help during disasters that happen fast and morph rapidly. We see our neighbors viscerally suffering, but sometimes we’re unsure of where to begin the process of contributing or volunteering.Right now, for the average person, that likely starts with donations. Gov. Andy Beshear has established the Team Eastern Kentucky Flood Relief Fund, a centralized, state-run web donation portal where 100% of the money goes to those affected. There are also many more donation outlets, such as the fund set up by the Foundation for Appalachian Kentucky. The day this issue hits stands, on Wednesday, Aug. 3, the city of Louisville is holding a donation drive from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. to pack SOS trucks that will be parked in front of Metro Hall (527 W. Jefferson St. with general hygiene products to send to Eastern Kentucky (the list for which you can find on the city’s website . Small Louisville businesses are also hosting drives, like Headliners Music Hall, which is giving a pair of tickets to anyone who donates a gift card from 2-6 p.m. through Friday, Aug. 5, at the venue’s box office. These giving opportunities will continue to pop up around town via social media. Water, cleaning supplies and hygiene products seem to be currently the most needed things. Give what you can.But, maybe the most important thing that we can do is not let this disaster fade from memory after the breaking news cools down. In a few weeks, there will be fewer devastating updates, less catastrophic images and not as heavy of a spotlight on the still-developing situation, but it will take those communities affected years to rebuild. The same goes for the areas of Western Kentucky that were torn apart by tornadoes last December.There aren’t quick, patch-up fixes that will swiftly bring everything back to normal. They’re going to be grueling, time-consuming rebuilds that will be ongoing for a very long time. If we want to help as individuals, we should make a continued effort to be involved: Donate now, check in to see what they need in a month, a year, two years, etc. Often, when natural disasters strike, and the danger level is still high, or rescue operations are still in play, officials tell people from outside the region not to randomly drive in, so roads don’t get jammed up. Everyone wants to help in the moment, and that’s natural. But, in a month, the need for volunteers might be extremely high. Let’s stay tuned in and give them what they need.In terms of the natural disasters themselves, we can’t become numb to them, like it’s part of some apocalyptic new normal that we shrug off like America sadly continues to do when a mass shooting occurs. These disasters will almost certainly ramp up, but we have to stay vigilant and helpful. Of course, we’ll have to have a lot of tough conversations about climate change.For only being two years into the decade, it’s been a tough ’20s for the Commonwealth: COVID, the police killing of Breonna Taylor, the tornadoes, the floods, rapid inflation that accelerated the housing market and raised rent to financially crushing prices.An age of radical volunteerism is needed. The organizations to get involved with are out there, we just need to open up our time and wallets. We have to remember everyone who’s suffering.This is a note to myself, as much as it is to anyone else.. ( ."

suffolknewsherald_2022_49,"Published 6:22 pm Friday, June 24, 2022ByStaff ReportsThis country’s wayward politics are on full display in Richmond and Washington, where the two major parties are more concerned about defeating the other side than about adhering to conservative or liberal values, much less helping the citizenry.Take, for example, the notion of some temporary relief from absurdly high gas prices.Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin pushed hard for a three-month “gas tax holiday” as part of the state’s biennial budget that takes effect July 1, but Senate Democrats blocked it, calling it a political gimmick.A hundred miles north, Democratic President Joe Biden proposed a similar break from federal gas taxes and Senate Republicans immediately ridiculed the idea as, you guessed it, political gimmickry.Let us get this straight: Suspending gasoline taxes is a good idea if a Republican governor suggests it but a bad idea if a Democratic president suggests it – or, to flip the hypocrisy, a terrible idea if a Republican governor wants it but a splendid idea if a Democratic president wants it. Never mind what would be good for Virginians and Americans as gas prices dance around $5 a gallon.Such gamesmanship is precisely why we and many others are losing faith in our government and especially the two-party system that controls it. So toxic is the partisanship in Richmond and Washington that winning or retaining power for your political party is more important than serving citizens.Ideology and principle have long given way to tribalism. The art of compromise is nearly lost.It gasped perhaps its last breath this week with congressional compromise on a mild, but potentially effective, effort to help combat mass shootings such as the recent one at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. We commend the Senate Republicans who joined with Democrats to pass common-sense reforms such as expanded background checks for people under 21; incentives for states to pass so-called “red flag” laws that allow intervention when someone is deemed to be an imminent threat to commit a violent act; and increased funding for school safety and mental health treatment.We challenge elected leaders in both parties to come together in a similar fashion and help citizens cope with staggering gas prices.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_146,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As leaders in the Twin Cities’ early learning space, we believe that now is the time to make changes that would both improve the current early care and education system in Minnesota and provide the infrastructure to make progress toward affordable, accessible and high-quality early care and education for every Minnesota child. The Walz administration’sSupporting Children and Familiesproposal is a strong start, but we urge the Legislature to go further and make the most of an unprecedented state budget surplus to invest in systemic changes to Minnesota’s early care and education infrastructure.We urge Minnesotans to support investments in these three infrastructure changes to ensure proper management and function of a quality, mixed-delivery system of programs for children. We are advocating to establish an Office of Early Learning, transform the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP and modernize program administration through new technology.Establishing an Office of Early Learning will advance solutions to the overly complex and fragmented collection of programs identified by the Office of the Legislative Auditor inMinnesota’s Early Childhood Programs. A single Office of Early Learning can align program requirements to reduce bureaucratic complexity for families, providers and administering agencies. Further, it will reduce unnecessary administrative duplication and promote effective data sharing and program evaluation. Improving the overall system will reduce costs in the long term and make this year’s program investments sustainable.With additional state investment, the program could move closer to universal access to high-quality care by raising income limits to make more families eligible for help, reducing out-of-pocket costs for low-income families and requiring provider participation in Minnesota’s quality rating system, Parent Aware, after incorporating recommendations from the Parent Aware Racial Equity Report.Most importantly, these investments could reduce substantial inequities in our current environment. Many more families would be eligible for and could take advantage of support, reducing stigma for families utilizing subsidies. Such a program would help alleviate the challenge that some families face in feeling limited to earning poverty wages in order to maintain eligibility for child care subsidies, knowing that for many families, out-of-pocket child care costs can exceed what they spend on housing.If you agree we have a responsibility to equitable, affordable, accessible and high-quality child care for all Minnesota families, we ask you to support the use of the unprecedented state surplus to lay a foundation for the future.Sondra Samuels is the CEO of the Northside Achievement Zone and Nicole Frethem is the a Ramsey County commissioner.

If it’s May (see the murder of George Floyd , April (the murder of Daunte Wright … even November (the killing of Jamar Clark , and we would likely see thousands in the streets – day and night – decrying the killing of yet another young Black man by police. And given recent history, we can imagine with vivid detail the possible outcomes. I’m not saying that’s right, I’m saying that’s reality.Early Wednesday morning, Feb. 2, Minneapolis police along with St. Paul police, executing a no-knock search warrant, used a provided key and entered into an apartment in downtown Minneapolis where 22-year-old Amir Locke was shot and killed within seven seconds —seven seconds —of police entering the apartment. Locke was apparently sleeping, covered under a blanket, on a couch that was facing away from the front door. In the police body camera footage released Thursday, it can be seen that Locke does appear to have a gun. It also appears that he never pointed the gun at any of the officers.It should be pointed out, 22-year-old Locke was not the subject of the no-knock search warrant. I point it out to underscore the tragedy, but not to say that had he in fact been the subject of the warrant, the snuffing out of his life within seven seconds of the encounter still does not meet the standard of justification.Amir Locke was not a felon, and therefore, underMinnesota law, he was within his rights to possess a handgun inside a residence. Similarly, Philando Castile was a legal gun owner when he was killed, shot seven times by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez on July 6, 2016.But I get it. Black people aren’t supposed to have guns. And if we do, we are automatically deemed a threat. But let’s be real, we’re deemed a threat with or without the gun. The gun is the prop in the scene that’s allowed to steal the thunder of the true plot.I have never said publicly what I’m about to reveal: I’m a licensed gun owner, and like somenearly 360,000 Minnesotans, I have a permit to carry. And as a Black man, it’s just as dangerous to be with a gun as it is to be without one. I don’t carry where I would violate any work policy in any capacity of my many public duties, but in my home, lying on the couch, I’ve been with a gun in hand on more occasions than I’d like to recall. Having so-called stature in the community does not inoculate me from the realities of urban violence that unfortunately hitsway too close to homefar too many times.Not only did the actions of the intruding officers lead to death for Amir Locke, they endangered the lives of residents in other units (thebuilding is home to, among others, Minnesota State Rep. Esther Agbaje . They also put themselves in harm’s way. It is likely that last part will make up the defense of Mark Hanneman, the officer who is said to have fired the three fatal shots.What value was served in this –or any– no-knock warrant? What tactical advantage was gained? Have we learned nothing from the killing ofBreonna Taylor? Have we learned nothing from the killing of George Floyd? Police, have you learned nothing from thekilling of Daunte Wright?It’s clearYanez’ acquittalin the killing of Castile and therefusal to even chargethe officers who killed Clark gave the thumbs up to business as usual as to how police view and interact with Black subjects … wait, Blackpeople.It’s so bad that even I have to keep reminding myself of my own personhood … my own humanity.Normally I’m adverse to the cold, I find myself thankful for the current chill. It’s one of the few times I don’t curse the forecast and scream for warmer temperatures. My screams are reserved for something else. Today I scream for my humanity, I scream for my sanity.

eugeneweekly_2022_13,"We ve got issues. Bait and switch: “The action of advertising goods which are an apparent bargain, with the intention of substituting inferior or more expensive goods.” The bait was attractive. They called it the “town square.” It included a beautiful Park Blocks area, a new Farmers Market Pavilion and a new City Hall. The park would feature an interactive fountain that children could play in. There would be a new covered stage. Curbless streets would create the feeling of a big open space. As bait goes, it was good. Our worn out old Park Blocks have needed upgrading and improvements for a long time. It appeared the time had finally come. Urban renewal funding promised to improve the park, build a new Farmers Market facility and visualize a new City Hall. But what if it was always just about building the new Farmers Market? What if the “town square” was just a sting? The 1940 bookThe Big Con, by David Naurer, which was the inspiration for the 1973 movieThe Sting, defines a store as “a carefully set up and skillfully managed theater where the victim (the mark , acts out an unwitting role.” Shills are the actors who help create the illusion of reality. In the film, the “store” was an off track betting club. For the town square sting, it was the public input events in the Park Blocks. Fifteen-hundred marks took the bait. The shills, called “town square analysts,” would consolidate all the input, saying “one of the goals of the outreach has been to really show how the Park Blocks can come alive with a new town square.” Like the other marks, I was sucked into the scam, it seemed so real. And then came the switch. The city announced there was not enough money to do the town square. There was no money for a new performance stage, or interactive fountain or for eliminating curbs. There was just enough money for the Farmers Market. The rest of the “town square” would be on hold, indefinitely. It was a classic bait-and-switch sting. And not the first time Eugene citizens were taken in by urban renewal, the biggest bait-and-switch scam of all time. In the 1970s and ’80s urban renewal funded the planned destruction of a working downtown. Historic buildings were bulldozed and turned into vacant lots and gravel pits. Our downtown was killed as Eugene repeatedly took the urban renewal bait and destroyed a working business district. Archie Weinstein owned a popular surplus store at 666 Willamette Street. It is the current site of The Graduate Hotel. His historic building was condemned and bulldozed. He watched and complained loudly as his thriving business was transformed into a gravel pit and left vacant for eight years. In the 1980s, I regarded Weinstein as a crackpot. He railed against urban renewal constantly. Urban renewal was destroying downtown Eugene, and he correctly predicted the failure of the doomed downtown mall debacle. Even now, Eugene continues to destroy historic buildings to create gravel pits, parking lots and ugly gray boxes. Urban renewal is, and has always been, nothing but a bait-and-switch scam. It has never delivered on its promises. And it destroyed downtown Eugene. I was reminded of Archie as I watched what happened to our own City Hall. It was torn down for no apparent reason, and with no approved plan to replace it. It became a fenced-in gravel pit for five years. It’s now an asphalt covered parking lot. As stings go, this was a pretty good one. I participated with more than 1,500 other marks, who supported the much needed improvements to the Park Blocks and a year round Farmers Market. I shop at and value the Farmers Market to support local farms and eat local food. I also value the Park Blocks. I don’t believe we should have to choose one over the other. In the end, urban renewal shafted us again. What a surprise to learn there just wasn’t enough money to fund both parks and the market. Had I been asked to choose between a revitalized Park Blocks or a new Farmers Market, I would have chosen the Park Blocks. But, of course, we were not asked. Maybe a genuine public process could have resulted in both an improved Park Blocks and a Farmers Market Pavilion. But since the town square was never real, it was just a sting, and no one was really asking, we will never know. And the new City Hall? It’s a gravel pit. Archie was right. Bob Warren retired in 2012 as the regional business development officer for Business Oregon for Lane, Lincoln, Linn and Benton counties. Prior to that, he was a senior policy advisor to Gov. Barbara Roberts and district aide and natural resource advisor for Rep. Peter DeFazio."
suffolknewsherald_2022_129,"Published 6:46 pm Tuesday, March 29, 2022ByStaff ReportsBleeding-heart liberalism and law-and-order conservatism sometimes have common interests that partisans don’t want to acknowledge.Such is the case with an unsuccessful bill in this year’s session of the Virginia General Assembly to eliminate certain fees that inmates pay during incarceration. Senate Bill 581, authored by Sen. Joseph Morrissey, D-Richmond, would have eliminated fees for participation in educational or rehabilitative programs and for privileges like telephone services, commissaries and electronic visitation systems.Instead, lawmakers opted to study the proposal and take it up again next year.Perhaps surprisingly, the Virginia Sheriffs’ Association supported the legislation and will take part in the workgroup that studies it. Many of those responsible for the state’s prisons and local jails understand that inmates’ experience while behind bars has a huge effect on recidivism when they get out.Paulettra James, the co-founder of Sistas in Prison Reform, told Capital News Service reporter Safia Abdulahi about spending thousands of dollars providing funds for her son and husband, both of whom are incarcerated — her husband at Deerfield Correctional Facility in Southampton County and her son at Coffeewood Correctional Center in Culpeper. The fees go toward commissary expenses, phone calls, stamps and taxes.“One thing statistics and science has shown is that individuals who have constant contact with their loved ones are less likely to recidivate,” James told Abdulahi. “It’s important for families to stay in touch with their loved ones. It gives them a sense of hope, a sense of stability and a sense of being loved.”The nonprofit research and advocacy group Prison Policy Initiative backs that up with data showing that incarcerated people, along with their families and loved ones, also have better health and improved school performance when they have contact with one another.Some of the fees charged inmates or their families are clearly exorbitant.Ben Knotts, with Americans for Prosperity in Virginia, noted that “when we told the (legislative committee that in some cases they were charging $40 for 100 count of Advil in some of these jails, I mean their mouths literally hit the floor; they were shocked.”We hope the studygroup recommends elimination or a significant reduction in inmate fees. An inmate who uses his time behind bars productively is more likely to be a law-abiding citizen upon release. That’s an outcome everyone should desire.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

leoweekly_2022_40,"In Utah,Republican Gov. Spencer Cox vetoed his state’s version of an anti-trans sports bill. He said, “Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don’t understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live.”A similar billwas also vetoed by Eric Holcomb, Indiana’s Republican governor.And yes, Andy Beshear did the same in Kentucky, but wasquickly overrodeby the Kentucky legislature, where the Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers. The same happened to Cox’s veto and is expected to happen to Holcomb’s veto.These bills seekto ban transgender children from playing sports with their peers. All three bills would ban trans girls and women from playing on girls’ and women’s sports teams. This means that a transgender child would be restricted from kicking a soccer ball, throwing a baseball, running in a loop on the school track because Republicans are uncomfortable with what might or might not be happening in their underwear.Why have Republicans chosen to target children? It certainly has nothing to do with saving money or preserving any strongly held value. What it is, is adults bullying children because of a sickly obsession about what is happening in the most private of spaces, and it is gross. Very.Republicans have claimed that it is to preserve women’s sports. Sports that they underfund and “women” that they don’t allow to control their own medical decisions. Sure... we believe you. We don’t. We don’t believe this bullshit.Since the Republican party was infested with evangelical ideology and forgot the very roots of their party platform, it has gone on a crusade to attack marginalized groups including immigrants, People of Color, all members of the LGBTQ+ community, and right now the “attaques du jour” are against children, read that again, children who are transgender.The fact of the matter is that Republicans are making decisions based on evangelical beliefs and the truth is that high religiosity and rampant sexual abuse are intertwined, so the fingers they are pointing at others, should be pointed in their own churches.I’m enraged and protective because they are attacking children and I am a mother. And, even though my child seems to fall into the cis gender category, some of my friends’ children do not and I will fight against this sort of intimidation and discrimination as if it were my own child.Why are we allowing a minority to make decisions that align with the very behavior we’ve already deemed unacceptable, the behavior we tell our children to stand up against? Bullying is never OK, but Republicans have forgotten that because “values” for them are only lip service.The modern Republican party in this country, and particularly in states like Kentucky, are run by overtly white protestant groups of bruised egos and out-of-control Ids, meaning that these adults are displaying the very behavior that should have been lost in the natural process of maturity.But to be sure, more at fault are the people who refuse to vote, and those who voted for these people to mistreat babies. America has a bullying problem and now, more than ever, we’re allowing that behavior to become institutional mores.Two things need to happen immediately, and the first is for American parents to demand that legislators focus on policy that helps people and to make the passing of bills that do harm an offense worthy of being voted out of office.The American people and our government need to grow the fuck up.The other thing that needs to happen immediately is counseling and emotional care for the babies being targeted in this sort of legislation. Children can’t understand what this all means and for them and it definitely will become something that could have major adverse consequences, including the loss of young lives. We can’t afford that.“Four kids and only one of them playing girls’ sports,” said Gov. Cox. “That’s what this is all about. Four kids who aren’t dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are part of something.”In Kentucky, just before a similar piece of legislation was advanced by the Senate Education Committee back in February, Sen. Reginald Thomas, a Democrat from Lexington, asked the bill’s sponsor Sen. Robby Mills, a Republican from Henderson, if he was aware of any issues or disputes concerning transgender students and sports occurring in Kentucky. He said he couldn’t.Last year,the Associated Press reached outto more than 20 lawmakers from across the U.S. who sponsored bills that would ban transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams, asking them to cite a single example of why their bill was needed. In almost every case, they couldn’t.We knowthat kids’ participation in school and having strong peer connections can reduce the risk of suicide. This is true for all children but particular for those children in the transgender and gender non-conforming communities.We can’t lose our kids. We can’t lose them because of the perverted policy decisions that we’ve given Republicans the opportunities to make. What we can do is protect the children and end some careers. I mean, since we’re in the business of bedrooms and underwear… what skeletons are in the closets of Kentucky Republicans?. ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_62,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°President Joe Biden has often described his plan to cancel some federal student-loan debts as a “game changer.” In one sense, this policy has indeed proved transformative — by making a bad system worse.Biden’s plan provides $10,000 in relief to individual borrowers with annual incomes of $125,000 a year or less, or $250,000 for married couples. Since August, the government has approved 16 million applications for loan forgiveness but legal challenges have put the program on hold. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of six Republican-led states that opposed granting loan forgiveness while litigation is ongoing. The White House has asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, which means the issue is likely to remain unresolved for months.With this plan stalled, the administration has resorted to a fallback: extending a freeze on all federal student-loan payments, which has been in place since the start of the pandemic. The decision reverses Biden’s previous insistence that borrowers would have to resume paying off their loans on Jan. 1.The student-loan moratorium has been extended eight times; Biden now says the freeze will last until at least next June. While this may cheer borrowers who’ve grown accustomed to forbearance, the rest of the country will bear the costs. The moratorium has already deprived the government of $155 billion in expected revenue; freezing payments through the middle of 2023 will cost taxpayers tens of billions more. Because much student-loan debt is held by high earners and those who borrowed to pay for graduate degrees, the extension amounts to a subsidy for the affluent.Freezing student-loan payments made some sense as a form of temporary relief during the early months of the pandemic, but there’s no such justification now, with unemployment back to pre-pandemic levels. Allowing borrowers to forgo monthly payments also belies the administration’s supposed commitment to fight inflation, since they’re likely to spend the money they would otherwise have applied to their loans.Given these obvious harms, the administration’s motives seem almost entirely political. Having dangled widescale loan forgiveness to rally support among young voters before the midterm elections, Biden risks a backlash if he requires borrowers to resume making payments before any of the promised debt relief has materialized. In the event that the courts strike down the loan-forgiveness plan, progressive advocates are sure to demand that the repayment pause be extended indefinitely. This would encourage borrowers of all income levels to take out bigger loans, remove incentives on colleges to hold down costs, and boost overall debt levels even more.The administration could’ve avoided this mess by ignoring progressive advocates and instead working with Congress to fix the existing student-loan system. Low-income borrowers should be automatically enrolled in a simplified income-based repayment plan to ensure that they pay what they can afford. The amount that students can borrow for graduate school should be limited. Measures to gather data on students’ career outcomes should be strengthened, and institutions should be held accountable for saddling graduates with high levels of debt they’ll never repay.Any of these reforms would produce a fairer and more rational system for borrowers and taxpayers alike. Instead, Biden has decided to double down on an ever more costly mistake.— Bloomberg OpinionNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

suffolknewsherald_2022_216,"Published 5:24 pm Tuesday, January 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieAs I was out on a morning walk the other day, I noticed a nativity scene that was set up in my neighbor’s yard. The self-standing, silhouette design looked beautiful against the backdrop of the holiday decor that decked the house. It was the brilliance of the white display that caught my attention. It stood out in the early morning when the sunlight was not quite blaring down on my neighborhood and the sky was a bit gray. I paused for a moment when I saw it, because earlier that same morning, I had been thinking of the miracle of Christmas that is the celebration of the incarnation of our Savior Jesus Christ.However, a nativity scene did not cause those earlier thoughts, but rather the illustrations from a Nigerian medical student named Chidiebere Ibe. His artwork is currently trending in the media because he taught himself to draw to fulfill a need in medical textbooks that do not provide medical illustrations of patients of color. An aspiring neurosurgeon, he began to draw what he desired to see in his studies. I saw his drawing of a fetus in the womb of a Black mother, and I was instantly moved. While many news reporters are highlighting Mr. Ibe as a change agent to remedy the underrepresentation of Black skin and inequality of medical illustrations, I saw something different.God is intentional, and He chooses to use whatever he will to get our attention. I don’t think it is a coincidence that Mr. Ibe’s illustrations are trending at Christmas. I also don’t think this message is limited to medical science or the medical community. I believe at Christmas, we were meant to look at the wonder that starts in the womb and be reminded that God wrapped Himself inside of His own creation many Christmas seasons ago and that He did it because He is Jehovah El Roi, the God who sees us. He sees all of us. God lived among us in the son of man, Jesus, because He knows us and loves us so much.As I looked at the fetus in that medical illustration, I was reminded of a baby who was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. This is the foundational truth of the Christian faith. I believe Mr. Ibe’s desire to draw these illustrations was also conceived by the Holy Spirit because the God who sees us and knows us wanted to remind us of the word of God in Jeremiah 1:15. “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart…” And while we may not have realized how much we needed this illustration at this time, we do. We all needed to look inside the womb and to acknowledge that God is still wrapping His spirit inside the flesh of a human being, human hands and human inventions and He is still birthing His creativity into the earth through humans. All of us.While the representation message is important, it is only important because all sisters and brothers, no matter our skin color, have a purpose as image bearers of our Creator God, meaning we have a responsibility to bring forth what He has placed inside of us because God predestined it. We all matter in that way. If we are missing something that our sister or brother didn’t produce, we all miss out. We didn’t know what we were missing until Chidiebere Ibe drew it into being.The wonder of the womb touches all mankind. God brought His son to the world in the same way that you came into the world. Jesus began as a fetus the same way that you began as a fetus. There is something about looking into the womb and seeing yourself that is both holy and igniting right here at the holidays. I wish you a blessed holiday and prosperous new year.QuaWanna Bannarbie is a teacher, writer and affirmer of faith, identity, relationships and experiences.

minnpost_2022_54,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The COVID-19 pandemic has left few lives untouched. As healthcare facilities across the country continue to cope with the pandemic, nurse anesthetists like me remain on the front lines, providing care for critically ill patients.The nearly 60,000 certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs in the United States possess unique skills and expertise that enable us to step forward in a way few others can. We have been leading the way in advanced airway and ventilation management — which have been essential in addressing the deadliest part of the unforgiving virus.The federal government and several governors across the country have made the important decision to remove barriers to CRNA practice during this crisis, reinforcing the critical needs for the skills we bring to bear in combating the pandemic. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS has temporarily lifted physician supervision requirements for CRNAs, encouraging health care systems to enable CRNAs to practice to the fullest extent of their education and training — a move that has increased access to care.CRNAs understand that the U.S. healthcare system cannot succeed unless all people can live their healthiest lives. We work and live at the intersection of patient care, education and advocacy. Leveraging these attributes and enabling CRNAs to practice to the fullest extent of our education and licensure will contribute to building healthcare systems that will work for everyone.CRNAs are highly educated, highly trained professionals. We complete eight to 10 years of healthcare and anesthesia education and more than 12,000 hours of clinical training prior to graduating with an advanced degree as an expert in the field of anesthesiology. CRNAs serve their country as full-practice, independent anesthesia providers in every branch of the military, on the front lines in combat-support hospitals and as the sole anesthesia providers on forward surgical teams.The pivotal role CRNAs play in people’s lives and in providing access to the highest-quality care has become overwhelmingly clear. That is why it’s important that the government’s emergency steps should not be temporary. As our country strives to recover from the pandemic, it is vital that the federal government’s rulemaking permanently removes unnecessary and costly physician supervision requirements that do not improve patient outcomes.It is a commonsense approach to improving access to the highest-quality care while also driving down costs as our delivery system struggles with limited resources and growing demand for services.CRNAs have answered the call to help keep patients healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. If we are good enough to serve on the frontlines of a battlefield and in the face of a global pandemic, we are good enough to do so all of the time.

minnpost_2022_150,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .With Minnesota sitting on a projected $9.25 billion surplus and the state bearing the fifth highest in the nation, 9.85 percent, it’s appropriate to consider an old proposal that is resurfacing. It’s the flat tax rate, and as the April 15th income tax filing deadline looms, the timing couldn’t be better.The concept has been around for a while, but it attracted most attention at the Federal level, when advocated by Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, the son of the business magazine publisher, Malcolm Forbes, in a pair of his unsuccessful runs for the presidency. Similar to most single-issue candidates, he did not gain much traction.However, his flat tax idea, which would have everyone paying Federal income taxes at the same rate, attracted a lot of attention before his campaigns withered and his concept died with them.Now, more than two decades later, the idea has arisen like Lazarus and is back in play, as some 13 states have jumped on the bandwagon already with respect to their state income taxes. It’s worthy of consideration here in “Minnesotax,” too.Further featuresThe uniform rate is at the heart of the proposition, but there are further features in the arrangement. While compressing the tax rate from high to low into a single middle level percentage, the proposal also would eliminate nearly all deductions, while boosting the standard exemption. That’s what most of the baker’s dozen of states have done, and a few others are contemplating.At first blush, it seems that the proposal would disproportionately benefit wealthy taxpayers, those whose rates hover at or near the top levels. While that is true, to some extent, the proponents do not apologize for that disparity; rather, they point out that the overall impact is to lower taxes for the vast bulk of taxpayers, some 75 percent or more in the jurisdictions that have gone flat.In Georgia, the latest state to join the flat tax crowd, about 95 percent of taxpayers will see a reduction in their taxes due to the combination of the lower, uniform rate of 5.25 percent, and one-half a percent below the current top rate of 5.75 percent. The previous state to do so, neighboring Iowa, has opted for a flat tax of 3.9 percent this winter during the legislative session.But the reduction for most taxpayers is deceptive. While the flat rate benefits most taxpayers, its advantages are disproportional, with the tax reduction much greater for those in the top brackets. Simply put, with a flat tax most people pay lower income taxes, but the most affluent benefit the greatest.It’s the converse of Marxian principles: Give the most to those who need it least, and the least to those who need it most.Yet, this alone ought not deter considering it or some variant.Minnesota mattersMinnesota’s four tax rate brackets, ranging from a low of 5.3 percent for individuals earning up to $27,230, somewhat greater for joint filing married couples, to that nearly 10 percent top level for individual incomes at or above $227,600 are among the highest in the nation. The only states with higher rates at the top levels are California, Hawaii, New York, Oregon and New Jersey, plus the District of Columbia. But some other jurisdictions exceed Minnesota’s tax burden when all taxes, fees and other revenue-raising devices are taken into account.An additional benefit of a flat tax is simplification of the process, making it easier and less costly – and with reduced stress – for tax filing, although it probably puts a number of tax advisers, planners and preparers out of work.But that facilitation might be offset by a drawback and it might diminish donations to organizations like religious organization, non-profits and the arts, among others, which rely on those contributions, which are encouraged by being tax deductible. However, that indulgence has been limited by federal tax law limitations imposing caps on those deductions.One impetus for the growing crowd of flat tax states is competition among the various jurisdictions. Those with lower rates tend to attract more new individuals, as well as businesses; a factor that cannot be overlooked when taking into account in surrounding jurisdictions, like Iowa, a uniform rate was adopted this year, the 12thstate to do so before Georgia jumped aboard.With the legislative time clock running down, and Minnesota, with DFL control of the House of Representatives, along with Gov. Tim Walz, the state will not consider undertaking this type of tax rearrangement this year. But that ought not foreclose its consideration in the future.The flat tax rate, while scorned and then ignored, remains a topic whose time may have come.The states, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously observed, are “the laboratories of democracy.” It might behoove Minnesota to join the experimentation with a flat tax.Marshall H. Tanick is an employment and Constitutional law attorney with the Twin Cities Law firm of Meyer Njus Tanick."

For older folks — including this writer — technology makes life incredibly easy, just as it frustrates and bewilders along the way!As a community advocate serving alongside medical professionals and providers at Community First’s Regional Health Partnership, I would like to introduce and educate the public about an exciting, data-driven technology in health care that already exists in Hilo. (Disclosure: I am president of the board at Hawaii Care Choices .Dr. Lynda Dolan of The Family Medicine Center began using data-driven technology this year with her patients experiencing serious illness, to help her members get the right care at the right time.Using data-driven technology can help to identify rising-risk patients for services sooner. This generates options for the patients, which makes delivering effective health care more accessible.Acclivity Health, a predictive analytics platform, uses data-driven technology to identify a patient’s rising-risk factors and makes it simpler for them to get the right care, at the right time, in the right setting. This enables our palliative and home health organizations to increase hospital transitions, get earlier referrals, and improve both care and length of stay.While there are many challenges to delivering palliative care, Hawaii Care Choices (formerly Hospice of Hilo embraces this through its mission: to improve the lives of those we touch by offering support, guidance and compassionate care of body, mind and spirit.All of us will eventually be on life’s final journey. Therefore, wouldn’t it be a positive step if there was a way to know — ahead of time — how long this path may be?As patients, we do not understand the business of health care, nor do we seek the reasons for inefficiency. We simply want to know the status of our health, treatment options available, and costs we can afford. A critical piece of any diagnosis must consider the patient’s needs, points of view and experiences, as well as input from loved ones.One’s own physician plays a critical role, and it is in his/her office that the process begins. When serious illness is encountered, delivering quality information is essential to providing the right care at the right time for patients and their families.Community First, whose executive director is Randy Kurohara and president and chairperson is Toby Taniguchi, is the movement begun by Barry Taniguchi. It was created to address health care in East Hawaii, especially to make the invisible (health care visible. This consortium of dedicated doctors and providers across the medical spectrum solicits input from the populace, seeks to understand needs, and works together to develop ways to address them efficiently and cost-effectively.Community First believes in the importance of educating the community through awareness about palliative care, its benefits and other care options. One of the nonprofit’s aims is to connect individuals living with serious illnesses to quality palliative care on Hawaii Island by supporting palliative care awareness and education through community partnerships, community and provider education.This editorial is brought to you by Community First a nonprofit founded by the late Barry Taniguchi in 2014 to serve as a neutral forum for the community to come together, and as a catalyst for solutions to improve health and access to health care. Through its programs, Community First hopes to shift the model of health care from reactively treating disease to proactively caring for the health of every person on Hawaii Island.

leoweekly_2022_56,"Last week, Louisville’s theater community took another blow. After a pared down, all-digital festival in 2021, Actors Theatre of Louisville has announcedthere will be no Humana Festival of New American Playsin 2022. While the future of the festival is possibly undecided, the announcement is being treated by many as the end of the internationally acclaimed, nearly half-century-old festival.When the 2020 Festival was canceled, there seemed to be a universal wail of despair from the theater community, but Louisville in 2022 is not so united. While many are deeply upset, they don’t always agree with what they are upset about.Some speculate the cancellation is the fault of Artistic Director Robert Barry Fleming, whose tenure at Actors started six months before the pandemic and had already included a massive layoff in February 2020 that left many long-time employees jobless. Often this theory is paired with a criticism of the way Actors and Fleming have pivoted to deal with the pandemic, including a focus on digital content that doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. Others impart that the problems at Actors have been around much longer than Fleming, suggesting financial mismanagement and racial disparity have been unsolved problems for Actors, which reach further back than the pandemic.Well, surprising to absolutely no one, I have opinions. So here are my thoughts I have about Actors Theatre, finance, racism and the possible demise of The Humana Festival of New American Plays.People are often arguing over false dichotomies. Have various people at Actors worked hard for progressive social change since long before the current administration took over? Yes. Has Actors Theatre since its inception continued the American theater’s foundational systemic racism that keeps out BIPOC audiences, artists and leadership? It sure has. Both things can be true.No organization the size of Actors Theatre is a monolith. People, efforts and ideas struggle to be expressed. No single person, even an artistic director, is solely responsible for steering the ship. There isn’t actually an “old” Actors Theatre or a “new” one.Nonprofits are run by liberals and conservatives. Often the “boots on the ground” employees are underpaid and the board members at the top are millionaires. Guess who has the tendency to be liberal and guess who has the tendency to be conservative?In that same vein, guess who has historically had a stronger cumulative effect on their organizations, and made the most important decisions regarding budget and hiring artistic staff?Did the Humana Festival create decades worth of brave and innovative theater? Yes. Theater that I don’t mind saying, I fucking loved, and hope to see more of.Was the Humana Festival racist? There are a lot of complex reasons why many people would say “yes.” Those are conversations that need to be had, but personally, I’d like to cut down to the bare bones; The festival was paid for by money taken from a large health care corporation. I strongly suspect that the corporation in question — like all the other health care corporations — have policies that lead to the deaths of a disproportionately large number of people in the Black communities. In which case: Yeah. The Humana Festival was racist. This is a really bitter pill to swallow for Actors Theatre of Louisville community shareholders, i.e. those of us who have been in the audience, onstage and behind the scenes for more than 45 years of Humana Festivals. And who have been disproportionately white since the festival’s birth.By and large the old ways of running theaters are not leading to fiscally healthy organizations. But what does “the old way” mean? Well — a lot. It means content. It means financial models. It means conditions causing BIPOC audiences to stay away. It means telling people to come sit still and be quiet for two hours. It’s price points that everyday people living in 2022 can’t always afford. Maybe it’s lack of child care, maybe it’s the time of day that theater is usually shown. And other stuff we haven’t even thought of.Blame is being placed on new leadership at Actors for fiscal problems that are probably decades old, all the while expecting new leadership to keep running the organization with the same-sized budgets. Don’t forget some of the stuff the new leadership is doing won’t work. Innovation only comes from experimentation. Experimentation always comes with some failed experiments. And judging these experiments based on 2.5 years of operation would be shortsighted and unfair even if 80% of that time hadn’t been during COVID.I don’t love everything that Actors has tried. I will miss Humana, and the phrase “transmedia, hybrid company” makes my skin crawl. But some of the experiments are great. I want even more radio plays and podcasts. Give me more spoken word. Christmas Carol IS aghost storyand I’m glad we’re admitting that.Personally, I believe that even if current leadership’s experiments all fail, Actors Theatre will recover. We almost lost Shakespeare in the Park back in the early teens, and at one point wasn’t the orchestra shut down for two whole years? And it came back.We need to be patient and give leadership time to do what they are trying to do, and explore new ways to reach communities that have been underserved by American theater since before American theater was even a thing..

suffolknewsherald_2022_241,"Published 4:31 pm Tuesday, October 18, 2022ByStaff ReportsBY ROBERT N. “BOB” HOLTIf you are over the age of 35, you probably learned to write cursive in the second grade. Cursive is a form of penmanship in which individual characters (letters are joined together in a flowing manner. Its main purpose is to make handwriting faster so that the pen or pencil does not have to be lifted from the paper after each letter. This method of writing has been preferred over block printing which requires more time to form each character separately.Some form of cursive was used as far back as the Roman Empire; it became popular when people began writing with a quill, a writing instrument formed from the feather of a large bird. The large end of the feather was carved to form a nib and dipped into a container of ink. The quill became in common use in 16th century England. The term cursive comes from the Latin word “currere” which means to run or hasten.Thomas Jefferson in 1776 drafted the U.S. Declaration of Independence writing with a quill in cursive, Benjamin Franklin helped revise the draft, and Timothy Matlack of Pennsylvania wrote on parchment the final version we see reproduced today. Abraham Lincoln wrote his famous Gettysburg Address in cursive in 1863. That speech contained only 271 words.Although the ballpoint pen was patented in 1888, it did not come into popular use until the 1960s when it was mass produced. Its ink was formulated to dry quicker than the quill ink and also to keep the ink in the pen until the “ball point” made contact with the paper.With the move to typewriters and computers, educators were pressured to spend more time on “keyboarding” than cursive writing. As a result, most schools, including those in Virginia, rarely teach cursive. There may be a brief discussion of it in the lower grades, but it is typically not taught. The accreditation pressure created by Standards of Learning (SOL testing allows very little time for topics not covered on these tests.The National Institute of Health in 2012 studied the brain function of a sample of elementary students comparing handwriting, keyboarding, and tracing. The data from that study clearly indicated that students retain more information when they write by hand. Further, the study reported that “handwriting increases letter processing of brain regions known to underlie successful reading. Therefore, handwriting may facilitate reading acquisition in young children.”Several studies since 2012 have also come to similar conclusions. Will cursive again be recognized as a necessary skill? Let’s hope so.Robert N. “Bob” Holt a Franklin native, is a retired professor of business management and real estate at Southwestern Community College in Sylva, N.C.

minnpost_2022_107,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Once upon a time there was a famous German law professor who did not like lawmakers, particularly when they were democratically elected. He thought that legislators were incompetent amateurs, and that lawmaking should be left to educated experts like him. No surprise that his employer, the King of Prussia, wholeheartedly agreed with the professor who, as a member of both the academy and aristocracy, had a special place in the royal heart. It was good to be the king in 19th century Prussia, and a rigid code of law would have taken all the fun out of it. So, the king’s favorite professor, Friedrich Carl von Savigny, came up with a brilliant idea and a snappy name for it too: historism. Why create from scratch big books full of laws that would at best be superficial, egalitarian and disturbingly progressive snapshots of thezeitgeist? Historism or the “Historical School of Law” held that judges and jurists should take a deep dive into thevolksgeist, the “common consciousness of the people,” and form their legal opinion based on the tradition, heritage and regional customs of the Germanic lands and tribes.Henning Schroeder is a professor at the University of Minnesota and currently teaches in the Department of German, Nordic, Slavic & Dutch.

eugeneweekly_2022_52,"We ve got issues. About a decade ago, the fossil fuel industry sold the public the idea that gas could be a “bridge fuel” between coal-fired and renewable electricity (solar and wind . Instead, the fracking boom that ensued produced an enormous increase in methane, a greenhouse gas around 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short-term. Gas utility NW Natural has a new bridge to sell you. In launching its assault on the city of Eugene’s electrification plans, NW Natural’s campaign website proposes “a better path to a renewable future.” The gas utility claims it “is evolving by working to provide communities with renewable natural gas and clean hydrogen over time.” NW Natural attempts to support this through its “VISION 2050: Destination Zero” plan, purporting to transform NW Natural’s fracked-gas product into a net-zero-emissions energy source. As with previous bridge fuel claims, when fossil fuel companies aggressively promote an emissions reduction solution that sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Such is the case with Destination Zero. In addition to extensive use of renewable natural gas (RNG , and “clean” hydrogen, Destination Zero relies on offsets to project net-zero emissions. Given the audacity of this claim, each component of the plan deserves scrutiny. So-called “renewable” natural gas is simply methane gas produced from organic processes (waste gas would be more accurate, as RNG is sourced primarily from agricultural and human waste . The emissions-reduction case for RNG is that the carbon dioxide emissions from burning methane is preferable to letting methane escape into the atmosphere. There are several problems with this argument as it pertains to NW Natural’s plans in Oregon. There is no evidence that RNG facilities exist at the scale needed to make up a significant proportion of the gas currently in NW Natural’s system. Despite its claim that RNG is “is on its way home” to Oregon, NW Natural is currently purchasing virtually all of its RNG from facilities outside of Oregon (eg Tyson Foods facilities in Nebraska . That gas never actually makes it to Oregon; it is sold to out-of-state utilities and their customers. What allows NW Natural to claim RNG is reducing emissions in Oregon is an accounting trick. After purchasing RNG from out-of-state sources, NW Natural applies the reduced emissions from that RNG (so-called “renewable thermal credits” to its fossil fuel-derived methane gas delivered in Oregon. So, the gas delivered to customers in Oregon comes from fracking. Because a utility in the Midwest agrees to treat NW Natural’s RNG as if it were fracked gas, NW Natural gets to treat some of its Oregon fracked gas like RNG. This is a corporate shell game — the climate version of offshore tax avoidance — designed to greenwash NW Natural’s activities on paper without materially changing what’s delivered. Another problem with RNG comes from partnering with massive agricultural conglomerates like Tyson Foods. Attempting to procure large quantities of RNG will create a perverse incentive to expand the most emissions- and waste-intensive agricultural operations (factory farms to meet this demand. Any reduction in building sector emissions could simply lead to increased emissions in the agricultural sector, not to mention additional air and water quality issues for communities living near intensive agricultural facilities. Clean hydrogen is shorthand for hydrogen-methane mixing — replacing a small portion of the methane gas delivered to gas appliances with hydrogen. Burning hydrogen produces water vapor rather than greenhouse gasses, theoretically reducing the emissions of that fuel source. Yet, as said in a recent challenge by Beyond Toxics and other community groups to NW Natural’s now-withdrawn proposal to introduce hydrogen-methane mixing into its system in the Bethel neighborhood, the technology is riddled with issues, like cost. It’s an incredibly expensive way to reduce emissions compared to replacing gas appliances with electric alternatives, and hydrogen will only ever be a minority of the fuel delivered to consumers. There are further risks, including a greater risk of explosions and potentially increased air quality issues. Hydrogen also requires a substantial amount of energy to produce; if the energy used is coming from fossil fuels, then the emissions reduction benefits are even more dubious. Offsets have long been criticized by the climate movement due to questions around their credibility and verifiability, and for creating perverse incentives for those selling offsets to polluters. More importantly, to the extent that offsets (and RNG and hydrogen have a role to play in an economy-wide effort to reduce emissions to zero, they should be reserved for emissions sources that don’t have a viable replacement. In buildings, electrification already exists as a proven, immediately deployable, emissions-free alternative to gas heating and cooking. Make no mistake, NW Natural remains a fossil fuel company. Greenhouse gas emissions are its product. “Destination Zero” exists not because NW Natural is genuinely committed to addressing the climate crisis, but because greenwashing is good for the bottom line. NW Natural’s net-zero plan seeks only to deceive the public into believing in the merits of a gas system that, if it were ever realized, would be more expensive and hazardous than the one that exists today; just as if not more hazardous to indoor air quality and public health; and achieve no economy-wide benefit in reducing emissions. By deluding its customers and the public, NW Natural hopes to lock in gas, slow the energy transition and preserve profits for as long as possible. If you believe otherwise, I have a bridge to sell you."
suffolknewsherald_2022_168,"Published 6:05 pm Friday, November 25, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSuffolk’s Mike Duman is one of Hampton Roads’ most popular mayors, according to a recent survey by the Social Science Research Center at Old Dominion University.According to data collected for the 13th annual Life in Hampton Roads survey, 59% of Suffolk residents approve of Duman’s job performance, trailing only Newport News Mayor McKinley Price’s 60.8% among the mayors of the region’s seven major cities. Portsmouth’s Shannon Glover is least popular at 31%. Duman’s disapproval rating of 7.7% was second-lowest in the region, behind Price’s 6.3%.An important piece of context: The survey, while released to the public just last week, was conducted May 31 through Aug. 19. In other words, respondents were surveyed entirely before the Suffolk City Council’s September approval of the dreaded Port 460 warehousing monstrosity. Duman’s support of that project, which has angered the citizenry unlike anything we’ve seen in decades of chronicling Suffolk politics, surely will cost him some support when the ODU survey is done again next year.Still, we find Duman’s high approval — and low disapproval — ratings to be well earned and unsurprising. He is diligent and sincere, respects Suffolk’s “weak mayor/strong manager” form of government and has an obvious love for a city that has helped him build a thriving business, while he has reciprocated as one of its more generous civic and charitable supporters.Other interesting findings from the Life in Hampton Roads survey:On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_23,"A wave of layoffs at U.S. technology companies has forced scores of skilled immigrants on temporary visas to find new jobs within 60 days or leave the country. Their predicament underscores how a flawed system is jeopardizing America’s ability to attract and retain the foreign-born talent it needs.The tech industry has long relied on skilled foreign workers to fill IT and engineering jobs. The majority are employed through the H-1B visa program, which brings 85,000 workers to the U.S. each year. The visas last a maximum of six years, during which time workers can apply for legal permanent residence, if sponsored by their employer. Of the estimated 580,000 current H-1B holders, more than half have had an employer petition for them to get a green card. Due to the system’s arbitrariness and inefficiency, however, the process for actually obtaining one lasts years.This backlog leaves H-1B holders vulnerable to corporate downsizing — as tens of thousands have recently learned the hard way, including those at Twitter Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. Under rules put in place during President Barack Obama’s administration, workers who lose their jobs have 60 days to find a new employer to sponsor them or they will have their visas canceled. At Meta and Twitter alone, at least 350 laid-off visa holders are now racing to secure new jobs before the grace period expires. Even those who do find work may have to relocate their families, sell their homes or settle for less desirable work just to stay in the country.Forcing skilled immigrants to endure such upheaval is not only cruel but self-defeating. Among America’s greatest strengths is its ability to lure and assimilate such talent, thereby boosting growth, entrepreneurship and innovation. H-1B workers also create opportunities for U.S. citizens, by enabling companies to invest in domestic operations instead of sending jobs overseas. Yet rather than expanding the pipeline for skilled foreign workers, the U.S.’s onerous policies are increasingly pushing them away, with pro-immigration countries like Canada and Australia becoming more attractive destinations for global talent.The U.S. should take notice. As a start, President Joe Biden should extend the 60-day grace period for unemployed H-1B visa holders to six months, giving them a fair opportunity to find new jobs, and allow their spouses to continue to work legally in the meantime. Those who’ve applied for green cards should also maintain their place in the queue, rather than having to convince a new employer to sponsor them.Over the long term, broader reform is required to bring in more skilled workers. Congress should increase the overall number of employment-based green cards issued each year and eliminate per-country caps, as a bipartisan bill in the House aims to do. Even better would be to prioritize immigrants with high-value skills rather than those with family ties.For the moment, such reform appears unlikely, with Republicans focused on securing the southern border and Democrats prioritizing legislation to protect undocumented immigrants.Yet by making the U.S. more welcoming to talent from around the world, a skills-based system would help employers fill critical roles, spark innovation, boost U.S. competitiveness and benefit the economy as a whole.That’s a cause both parties should embrace.— Bloomberg Opinion"
philinquirer_2022_17,"Every school district — including Central Bucks — has LGBTQ students. Hiding books with positive LGBTQ messages won’t stop them from being gay, it will just stop them from feeling OK about it.A few months ago, a long-awaited moment in my life arrived: My 8-year-old grudgingly let me read to her from my favorite childhood book,Harriet the Spy. As I opened my original copy, now faded, yellowed, and torn, and started reading about this judgy tomboy who is determined to be a writer, I had excited butterflies in my belly. But they stopped a few pages in, when Harriet’s nanny, Ole Golly, introduces Harriet to Ole Golly’s mother, who is obese. For several pages, Harriet keeps calling back to Mrs. Golly’s physique, describing her as a “mountain,” bursting out of her clothes, with “ham hands.” She hassome sort of mental disability, perhaps dementia. “This fat lady wasn’t very bright,” Harriet thinks.When I finished the chapter, I closed the book and reminded my daughter about how people come in all sizes and that it’s not nice to make a big deal out of the way someone looks. And I talked about her grandfather, my dad,who had dementia for her entire life— he had a problem with his brain, I said, which wasn’t his fault.We have these conversations about older books a lot. The girl inTheSecret Gardenwas born in India and is downright cruel to the local people who work for her family, calling them “pigs.” Stuart Little iskind of a sexist jerk. TheBaby-sitters Clubseries has modern moments, but the books shouldn’t always call Claudia a “terrible student” when she struggles with math and reading, but clearly seems destined for a brilliant career in art or fashion. And as the only Asian character, she is consistentlydescribed in an exotic way, with “beautiful dark almond-shaped eyes” and “jet black hair.”“Stuart Little is kind of a sexist jerk.”I didn’tbanany of these books; they’re still sitting on my kid’s bookshelf. But I would rather she read them with me so that we can talk about the many harsh asides they contain.Not all children’s books should take place in some politically correct utopia where difference is celebrated and everyone is gentle and kind. There’s a reason schools teachLord of the FliesandTheMerchant of Venice, even though cruelty runs rampant through both. It’s important for kids to learn that life isn’t a PC utopia, and develop tools to think about and deal with that.That said, I also believe it makes sense to revisit some of the books we consider classics and ask ourselves if the moments they depict are truly teachable, or just plain cruel. If the latter, perhaps they should be part of a classroom, not the library, so teachers can talk to kids about what they read and help them place it in a modern context.But we seem incapable of having rational conversations about books in school, mostly because of fear. On one side of the conversation, adults who want kids to have access to books with diverse authors and topics are afraid of being called “groomers” who seek to “turn” all kids gay or trans; on the other side, we have adults who are afraid of exposing kids to ugly parts of history or different kinds of people in a compassionate way. But these conversations are important, especially so since Central Bucks adopteda newban on books with “sexualized content,”and Pennsylvaniahas the second-highest number of book bans of any state(after Texas .So let me start. I believe we should revisit some older books that may make some kids feel hurt or unwelcome in the world. (That’srevisit, notban. But the books I suggest we revisit are not the books that will likely be banned by Central Bucks and other school districts across the state, which are targeting books that include LGBTQ characters, or address race or racism. I want my daughter to readthe often-banned booksThe Bluest EyeandGender Queer: A Memoir, even if she isn’t LGBTQ herself — I want to open her mind and heart to people who are different from her.» READ MORE:Why I take my kid to Philly PrideOne of my favorite days of the year is Philly Pride, andI take my kid whenever I can.

It’s a beautiful story about family, acceptance, and a kid who is just trying to be himself. I hope that reading about Aidan helps give my daughter thecourage to be herself, to know that she deserves to feel loved and accepted no matter what.And I hope she always remembers the inscription the author Kyle Lukoff (who is also trans included for her when we asked him to sign her copy. “Thank you for being part of this world,” he wrote.Alison McCook is an assistant opinion editor at The Inquirer."
eugeneweekly_2022_29,"We ve got issues. It’s been a hoot to be out and about in the last few weeks and seeing friends again after two years. Open heart surgery and geezer arthritis have slowed me down a bit, but as the Irish say: It’s better to be seen than viewed. I even attended a fundraiser at a “nonpartisan” political event. Now you may ask: What the hell is that? It’s an event where you’re required to substitute the words “Progressive” for “Democrat” and “Let’s Go, Brandon” for “Republican” candidates. It’s also forbidden to release morbid partisan statistics at these events, so I couldn’t share my recentNew York Timesstat that COVID death rates nationwide have been much higher in counties that voted for Donald Trump than those that voted for Joe Biden. Voters decided that the Lane County commissioner race should be nonpartisan years ago. Apparently, nobody told the candidates or the donors. I was privileged to speak in support of County Commissioner Heather Buch at a recent house party. I am a constituent and admire her efforts on behalf of working families, rural public safety, the county’s homelessness issue and her deft handling of the Holiday Farm fire event: 450 homes up in smoke. I also thanked Biden and Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan, and the Lane County commissioners for each deciding to hold the primary this year on my birthday! I reflected on how it had been 28 years since their predecessors had similarly honored me in 1994, when I first ran for office. Not many Democrats survived the Newt Gingrich assault that year. And that was way before COVID and Citizens United. Expect a similar attack this year. Off-presidential election years always require more work on voter turnout, especially the primary. This year should be especially fun because of all the open seats — governor, the 4th and 5th Congressional Districts and the new 6th U.S. congressional seat. It appears we have more candidates than registered voters. There are 15 Democrats and 19 Republicans running in their primaries for governor, and one rich independent (Betsy Johnson who will likely face the winners in the general election. It’s going to be a three-way race. Remember 1990 when Barbara Roberts snuck past Dave Frohnmayer 46 percent to 40 percent after third party candidate Al Mobley stole 13 percent for the anti-gay Oregon Citizens’ Alliance? Johnson is no Al Mobley, but she has been a pro-choice, pro-gun DINO who will draw votes away from the Democrats this time. Former Speaker Tina Kotek and Treasurer Tobias Read lead the Democratic pack. I’ll support the winner in that primary. Because guess who’s running to defeat Republican Christine Drazen in her primary — our old butthole union haters Bill Sizemore and Bob Tiernan! They’re upset that a wife-swapper is running in their primary. I say “Let’s Go, Stan Pulliam!” My good friend Peter DeFazio leaves a large body of work for his successor with his decision not to run again for Congress. This 4th Congressional District is still a tough district for a Democrat in these skittish times. DeFazio has been there since 1987. There are eight Democrats in the primary. DeFazio has already announced his endorsement: Val Hoyle. She is the most qualified Democrat in the field, having been elected and served in the Oregon House and as majority leader and run for statewide office twice, winning the district by double digits both times, once in a primary and once to statewide office as labor commissioner. Five of the other Democratic candidates for the 4th district won’t even get enough votes to share an Uber unicycle. And of the remaining two, both are carpetbagging dilettantes who have never been elected to anything. Dull Canning tried to beat DeFazio in the last primary in 2020; she got 15 percent of the vote. And Andrew “Harvard” Kalloch is a real piece of work. He’s a corporate lawyer/shill for Airbnb whose campaign is funded by East Coast corporate/gig economy executives. He and his wife were anOregon Business“Power Couple” recently. Just because he went to Harvard Law with Joseph Kennedy III doesn’t mean shit. He’s never run for anything in any state on either coast. His campaign mailing address is still in Portland! There were folks who suspected he was going to try to run against DeFazio back in 2020, but then Canning decided to run. And there were folks who suspected he would run against Peter this time around because of Kalloch’s nastyRegister-Guardeditorial piece calling out DeFazio for “succumbing to cathartic and unprofessional outbursts.” This was before DeFazio announced his retirement. GMAFB! As a 25-year constituent, I personally always liked it when Peter spoke truth to power. Republican Alek Skarlatos is running again as their sole primary candidate, and Trump money is flowing in. DeFazio has very good reasons for endorsing and supporting Val Hoyle: She has the best chance of retaining the seat for a progressive voice. She fits the district. Who better would know? After all, DeFazio is one of the founders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.The other was Bernie Sanders. ν Personal Note: I want to send my condolences to Anita and the Johnson family and theEugene Weeklyfamily for the loss of their loved one, Art Johnson.

suffolknewsherald_2022_113,"Published 8:27 pm Friday, December 2, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Bob LewisVirginia MercuryThe elevator doors were closing one hot July morning in 1994 and I was about to ascend 13 floors to my office when a large man in the lobby doubled his pace to catch the elevator. I stuck an arm against the door to hold it open a few more seconds.“Thanks,” he said, extending his large right hand to me as the doors shut. “Hi. I’m Don.”That was the first welcome I had been extended after my move here by a Richmonder other than my new colleagues at The Associated Press, where I had just started work as the Virginia news editor, and the realtor who was helping me find a house.I will never forget that introduction. Don was Aston Donald McEachin, who would later become a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Democratic nominee for state attorney general, a state senator and a member of Congress. To me, he would always be just Don, a sweet man with a friendly smile, a warm handshake and an innate likeability.Then only 33, he was a named partner in the McEachin & Gee law firm one floor directly beneath AP’s main Virginia bureau. There would be many elevator mornings, some shared lunches and discussions about government, the law, society and politics. He was candid about his desire to hold public office and make a qualitative difference. Two years later, in 1996, he won his first term as a delegate.I am about 6 feet, 2 inches tall, but Don towered over me. His most impressive trait, however, was his gentleness, his remarkable intellect, his thoughtfulness and his ability to listen, a quality essential to good lawyering, good politics and good friendships. In a conversation, Don focused on the person before him, and it was clear he was drinking in everything he was told.When I heard of Don’s passing Monday at the age of 61 after a long and very public battle with colorectal cancer, it was like a fist to the solar plexus. Beside the shock and the tears clouding my vision, my immediate thought was, “You deserved better, Don.”Don had the skills to ascend much higher in public office than a seat in Congress. He had served almost six years in the House of Delegates when his party nominated him in hopes he would become Virginia’s first African American attorney general. Timing and luck had something to do with holding him back.In the 2001 campaign, he seemed the odd man out in a Democratic ticket led by gubernatorial candidate Mark Warner with Tim Kaine running for lieutenant governor. Warner and Kaine won; Don lost.No difference between the candidates was clearer than Don’s disdain for Warner’s cozy relations with the National Rifle Association and his promise not to seek new gun restrictions in a state that had voted reflexively Republican for years, depriving Democrats of every lever of statewide political power.Don voiced his displeasure at Warner’s closeness to the NRA in a state Capitol news conference with former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the nation’s first elected Black governor. Going public with such a rift within a ticket would have been enormously damaging but for an ominous quirk of history: It happened as terrorists crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. The explosive presser went unreported.Don was a loyal Democrat, but he never let partisan leanings supersede friendships.“This one hurts. This one really hurts,” said Bea Gonzales, a state Republican Party staffer before she embarked on a career as a well-regarded Richmond lobbyist. She had forged a friendship with Don and his wife, Colette – Richmond’s commonwealth’s attorney – that became even closer with the birth of Bea’s son, Sebi, and the interest the congressman took in the child. She marked his passing with a Facebook post of a photo of the McEachins holding her infant, now 8, during a dinner years earlier.“I called him a bad-ass teddy bear,” she said. “People think of him as this huge person, (so he must be mean, he must be angry, and he wasn’t at all. Even as sick as he was, if I had called him and said, ‘I need this for Sebi,’ he would do it. He just would, and so would Colette.”What clearly brought Don fulfillment was identifying promising public servants and helping them embark on promising careers. One such person was Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, a young lawyer with a desire to serve in elective office as Don had. He remembers him as “a larger-than-life man, but he was just Don.”“Didn’t matter if he was winning multi-million-dollar judgments, whether it was Senator McEachin or Delegate McEachin or Congressman McEachin. It was just Don,” Bourne said.“To me, the thing that made him special was the encouragement he always gave to young, aspiring African American community leaders, political leaders, folks who thought they might want to be elected,” he said.Don turned up this month at a screening of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” in Richmond to persuade the mostly Black audience to get checked for colon cancer, the disease that killed “Black Panther” actor Chadwick Boseman and would take his own life less than two weeks later. He spoke bluntly of the disease that had reduced the strapping hulk of a man I met 28 years ago into a gaunt, gray but still determined public servant.“Don’t y’all fool around. Don’t do my journey. Go see a doctor,” he said.It’s not an eloquent epitaph, but it’s powerful, plain, lifesaving counsel given freely to help others.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_58,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°The incoming Republican House majority is salivating to begin investigations against the Biden administration, with some in the caucus even talking about impeachment. In contrast to the numerous Democratic investigations and two impeachments against Donald Trump — which were legitimate responses to a uniquely unfit president who routinely spurned the rule of law — the GOP’s current plans are little more than tit-for-tat politics. They should keep in mind how obvious that will be to a nation that just denied their party the “red wave” everyone was expecting.Congress has an implied duty under the Constitution to provide oversight of the president. Inarguably, both parties in modern times have weaponized the oversight process to score partisan points. Trump may well have been the most investigated president in history, with scores of inquiries launched in the two years Democrats have controlled Congress. Many Republican partisans clearly believe that fact alone merits some payback — as if the Trump probes were plain old politics. That attitude is part of the blinkered normalization the GOP has always extended to a dangerously abnormal president.No one can deny Democrats approached their oversight duties with zeal when it came to Trump. But Trump provided voluminous, literally unprecedented justification throughout his tenure, including his inherently suspicious Kremlin coddling, his appalling family separation policy at the southern border, his use of the Justice Department to attack his political enemies and his abuse of his pardon power to reward cronies. And don’t forget his tragic politicization of the pandemic and his frontal assault on democracy itself during and after the 2020 election.In contrast to the GOP’s craven and silly impeachment of Bill Clinton for the high crime of lying about sex, Trump’s impeachments were about the deadly serious topics of extorting a global ally for political gain and fomenting a physical attack on America’s seat of government.There is simply no rational way for anyone not wearing partisan blinders to conclude they are comparable.The same can be said for most of what Republicans have in store for President Joe Biden. There are some legitimate issues that deserve attention — most notably, his botched withdrawal from Afghanistan — but far more of the ammo Republicans have looks like exploding cigars. Unlike Trump’s border controversies, Biden’s problems appear to be about poor management, not malign and deliberate inhumanity.The FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago was a solidly legal and restrained operation, no matter how Trump’s hysterical supporters tried to portray it as an abusive siege. The business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter, might deserve scrutiny, but the right’s obsession with the whole topic seems designed more for distraction than oversight.House Republicans are going to do what they’re going to do. And, as they did with Bill Clinton’s impeachment, they’re likely to see their transparently cynical attempts to mountain-ize these molehills backfire on them politically.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"

It caught my attention because you don’t see as many of those as you did in the past, and it held my attention because I noticed that it was free.I opened the box, pulled out a copy of the Suffolk News-Herald and flipped through its pages.It wasn’t long before I found myself purposefully stopping at locations where I knew I could get a copy of this local paper. It was a unique idea to me: a paper focused solely on one area, one city. Every story was local, and most columnists lived or worked in the city. It was a community paper, and it helped me stay in touch with the happenings of the places closest to me.I know you’re going to say that I’m biased, but I like the Suffolk News-Herald. There’s something special about a paper that makes you feel like part of a community.I am grateful to have a paper that focuses solely on the news of our city. Many news outlets report on global news, national news and Virginia news, but the Suffolk News-Herald focuses on news that directly impacts this city. It helps all of us stay connected to our city, and it allows each of us to stay informed on the things happening closest to our homes.Furthermore, I am grateful that most columns published on this page come from local columnists. The Suffolk News-Herald states that part of its mission is to “serve as a forum where public opinion is valued and shared.”Columnists share a wide range of views on numerous topics, and I love how the presented views are from those who live in our community. The opinions shared aren’t from some highly paid columnist in New York City or San Francisco. The columns are from my insurance guy, the banker I see when I cash my check, and the pastor of the church down the street. The columnists aren’t unknown individuals who live far away; they are my friends, neighbors and associates.I admit that I was skeptical when I first saw the Suffolk News-Herald desires “to take an active role in helping Suffolk grow and prosper.” I didn’t understand how a paper could help a city, but the longer I read the Suffolk News-Herald, the more I understood that it does help Suffolk.This column isn’t an advertisement for the Suffolk News-Herald. The Herald isn’t telling me what to say or sending me a check for my words. I just think that a local news outlet is an important thing for a community to have, and we are lucky enough to be in a city whose paper has remained open and printing.Like me, I hope that you have grown to appreciate the Suffolk News-Herald and will continue to support it so that it can remain for a long, long time.Nathan Rice, a Hampton Roads resident since 1988, is a branch operations manager for a regional credit union in Virginia and North Carolina.

minnpost_2022_78,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I am grateful for the interest of your Washington correspondent in “the possible” in Congress these days, as shown in her June 21 article,“As Washington opened the money spigots, Minnesota towns hired D.C. lobbyists.”No doubt municipal and corporate lobbyists add value. When I arrived in the U.S. Senate in November 1978, there were two: one for 3M and one for Honeywell. The value add was that one took me golfing in my new “home away from home” and the other offered to take me and my wife to a local show now and then.On the other hand, I hired Phil Cohen, who had been mayor of Brooklyn Center, to work in my Minnesota office full time getting my D.C. staff to do what they still can do — get projects for locals. Retired Rochester Mayor Alex Smetka came to work for me with his old Oldsmobile in which, once a week, he drove out to a different Minnesota city and visited with newspaper and radio station owners, business and professional leaders. He wrote a report for my D.C. office staff, which was must-read.Ask anyone from that era and they’ll tell you how effective Dave Durenberger’s staff in general became at “bringing home the bacon.”Oh, and I also spent one term on the Intergovernmental Relations Sub-committee. And eight on Intelligence, including chair. And I served on the powerful Senate Finance (taxes, health and social security Committee and on Intelligence (chair . Etcetera. But all facilitated by my staff.That all changed in 1995 when Newt Gingrich et al. took over, sent families home, guaranteed two- or three-day work weeks nine months out of the year and put the two political pages of lobbyists Ana Radelat wrote about in the drivers’ seats that my staff and I were proud and pleased to occupy.Dave Durenberger served as a U.S. senator from Minnesota from 1978-1995."

The competition asks artists to complete an entire piece of Plein Air artwork in just 120 minutes.What is Plein Air painting, you might ask. Artists get out of their studios and paint in an outdoor setting. They have to work fast as the light is always changing. The Quick Draw event gives artists the opportunity to paint on the streets of downtown Suffolk while the Taste of Suffolk event is going on, providing lots of great compositions to choose from.Suffolk Plein Air Quick Draw is open to all ages and abilities. Pre-registration and complete rules are available online at www.suffolkpleinair.org or those interested may register in person beginning at 11 a.m. on the day of the event. There is a $10 registration fee and each artist must provide all of their own painting supplies.The Suffolk Plein Air Festival will feature some “pros” as well, some 45 artists traveling from across the United States and as far away as the Netherlands to “Paint Suffolk Virginia.”After three days of painting, juror James Warwick Jones has the daunting task of reviewing over 120 works of art to select the winners. On Friday, Sept. 9, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., artists and patrons will gather at the Center for Cultural Arts for the much-anticipated Wet Paint Sale and Awards Reception.

suffolknewsherald_2022_144,"Published 6:03 pm Friday, March 11, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Chris QuilpaWhen I was under the weather (and on self-quarantine in our master bedroom during the past Christmas season, there were nights I wanted to sleep some more. But, I couldn’t, even though I tried hard. So what did I do in those sleepless moments? I was actively thinking.One time, in the wee hours, I found myself scribbling something on a notepad: “Silence is a precious gift, something to cherish and to take advantage of at the moment you encounter it. This is, to me, a grace-blessing from God.“Silence is powerful and so helpful in restoring your sanity and sensibility. It provides you the opportunity to think and to listen deeply to what the inner voice of your heart is telling you.“It gives you the time to be at peace with yourself and your God. It helps make your heart and mind and body and soul in tune with nature, as Mother Nature nurtures the ailing environment, ecosystems and the world as a whole.“Silence heals and treats a troubled soul. It calms the nerves and senses, with ample opportunity for you to pray, to meditate and to listen to the Voice and Word of God dwelling in you at the moment.“Silence is indeed a precious gift that can restore your ailing body to recover and become well again. Truly, Silence is a gift of/from God!”While the outside world is actively busy and noisy, and you’re alone, but not lonely, in your room, you can experience silence. With a window overlooking your backyard that depicts a gray, shady environment — dried leaves on the ground and a standing tall maple tree that is leafless and seem lifeless with branches extended outwardly and appearing to be praying to the Almighty God — there is that sense of peace and serenity, amidst an impending change of weather or climate change.In my notepad, I also wrote: “The world was at peace on Christmas Day because the Word made flesh came down and dwelt among us! What a great feeling of relief! The world stopped being busy and noisy. Peace on earth prevailed that moment.”In all of your life, have you ever thought, even in a split second, why we need to be in a state of silence, to be at peace with others, even for a while? We all long for peace, don’t we?That peace we’ve been wishing for since time immemorial remains elusive. Where and when can we find it? To long for peace, you have to long for silence. And silence is so volatile that when you encounter it, grab and claim it, and value it because the moment you have it you feel at peace with yourself and your God. We experienced peace at Christmas.Having this “silence,” you forget, even for a moment, that there’s still this COVID-19 pandemic roaming around the world. Silence allowed us to feel at peace with ourselves and the world.I don’t mean you have to get sick to encounter or experience silence in your life. You can have silence whenever and wherever you crave for it. It’s just in you to feel it and experience it.Silence is not synonymous with peace but a component or a part of it. It is, to me, crucial to attain peace, peace of mind, peace that we all long for in life and the world.In silence, there is peace, serenity, hope, love. There is an opportunity to be useful and productive. There is a quiet moment that we long for, at times. Such moments allow us to be aware of what is important at that very moment in our life. And, in the end, we express our gratitude to our Creator-God for the silence we encountered and for the life that we have, with our family members and friends. That’s when we feel at ease and at peace with ourselves.Chris A. Quilpa, a retired U.S. Navy veteran, lives in Suffolk, Chesapeake and Portsmouth.

Vote no on Amendment 2. That’s what you need to do at the polls on Tuesday but, in case you didn’t know, Satanists and Marxists are on your side.That’s according to a press release from a “family” oriented foundation of “kerrr-iss-chans” who think it is their place to jump into the examination room with a uterus-having person and their physician. The mission of this foundation says they are standing up for families and “God-honoring” public policy… but only their version of God, of course.It’s just so weird. They’re afraid, according to their executive director, that those who oppose the amendment are being led by “radical personalities.” Folks, “radical” is the new common sense and if you oppose this bullshit, invasive amendment, then you too are one of the rational and yes, radical ones.The organization pulls out their best and brightest in the press release calling on pastors but not a single, solitary uterus-having person to have an opinion about abortion access.Here’s the Amendment 2 Text, just so you can spend some time with it before you vote no:Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?Trying to use the state constitution… a male-made document to do the service of their personal religious beliefs. I mean, isn’t this the same as their cries against their perceptions of Sharia law? Laws made based on religious beliefs? These folks are mind-numbing in their cognitive dissonance.Speaking as an authority on uteri, as I am the proud bearer of one that has been pregnant, I would never let my husband, or any man who is not my OB/GYN into the examination room to instruct or direct the care that I feel I need or that my doctor feels is appropriate for the care of my health or the health of any zygote I produce.Men, especially those who are not OB/GYNs need to stay in their lanes. Women’s bodies and uteri are ours to drive. We aren’t stepping into the urologist to talk about how we don’t think you need to get prescriptions for your enlarged prostates or pills for your flaccid penises. So it’s probably best if men step off and remain quiet here.I know, some of you are sperm donors and think that just because you shimmied out a few x and y chromosomes that you have the capacity to make decisions on how those are dealt with. Alas, sons, those of us with uteruses bear the divine right and responsibility of how those seeds are planted and whether or not we choose to sow them.Keep your creepy, murder-obsessed version of God out of the uterus and while you’re at it, stop spending such a weird amount of time thinking about what goes on in anyone’s private space between their underwear, their sheets or inside the parts of their bodies that you aren’t personally privy to.

suffolknewsherald_2022_24,"Published 4:07 pm Tuesday, December 13, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardWe were pleased by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s announcement this week of plans to create a task force to find solutions for Virginians who need critical mental health care.The state’s Temporary Detention Order, or TDO, system is terribly broken, endangering not just mentally ill people but their families and others.Youngkin said his Prompt Placement TDO Task Force will bring together government agencies, public and private hospitals, law enforcement and other community partners to address the crisis facing people with TDOs who are waiting for behavioral health services.“It is critical that we address the mental health crisis and prioritize caring for Virginians,” Youngki said. “I’m committed to making substantial progress in providing access to resources, caring for Virginians and reforming the TDO process.”We’ve all heard, if not lived, horror stories about dangerously ill people harming themselves or their loved ones because there’s no place to put and treat them. Suffolk police spend valuable time, which could otherwise be devoted to preventing crime and tracking down criminals, making repeat visits to the homes of mentally ill people and to emergency rooms, where many of those people are taken by their families.It’s long past time to begin addressing the problem as a health crisis and not the responsibility of the criminal justice system, which has its hands full.“Virginia’s current TDO process is bad for patients, care providers, families and law enforcement who wait with these patients for a placement,” said Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Resources John Littel. “This task force is a key step in improving the behavioral health system across the commonwealth.”Dana Schrad, executive director of the Virginia Chiefs of Police Association, called the initiative “the most dedicated effort we have seen in 25 years towards trying to address the problem of getting mental health beds available to people,” he said. “This effort is way overdue, and in the end, it should save Virginian’s lives and save much-needed law enforcement resources.”In the 14 months from June 2021 to July 2022, there were 21,099 TDOs in Virginia, state officials say. The average wait time for someone under a TDO to receive a placement and care has risen to an unacceptable 43 hours.Objectives of the task force include ending the TDO waitlist, finding rapid placements for people under a TDO, releasing police officers from spending significant hours away from patrolling the streets, ensuring the safety of all parties and “setting the stage for lasting systematic change to the way Virginia processes TDOs.”We support it wholeheartedly.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_4,"Kids in the city need safe places to go where staff are trained in trauma-informed care and where kids can have enriching experiences without a looming threat of violence.This week,14-year-old Nicolas Elizalde was killedbygunfire outside Roxborough High Schoolas he was leaving a football scrimmage. The incident — in which four of his friends were also shot — has left the city reeling.After-school and out-of-school time activities should be safe places for kids to go. Clearly, Philadelphia isn’t supporting the social and emotional development of its youngest residents — just look at the sheer number of young people impacted by gun violence.While the exact motives of the shooting are still unclear, an earlier intervention in the lives of the shooters could have prevented them from turning to violence. We also need to make after-school programs safer for kids. Fully funding after-school programs would increase the number of adults at school during those hours, including security personnel, and provide safe transportation for kids to and from activities so that they’re not as vulnerable to violence.After several years of upheaval and uncertainty, Philadelphia’s kids are in a state of crisis. With the rise of neighborhood violence, there is a critical need for activities and intervention in the after-school hours to support the development, health, and safety of our students.Research shows that out-of-school time activities are part of a multipronged strategy to help meet kids’ social and emotional needs. After-school programs cannot be an afterthought in planning for student success.We are calling for city, state, and school district leaders to act boldly and quickly, and make more financial investments in after-school programs for kids of all ages. There is key funding from theAmerican Rescue Planavailable to the school district allocated specifically for out-of-school time programming. This funding should be released immediately to increase the availability, accessibility, and safety of extracurricular programs in Philadelphia.“No child should be fearing for their life while walking out of a football scrimmage.”Along with an increase in funding, we need the city and school district to use their investment well. This is why, on Sept. 22, Vetri Community Partnershiptestified at a school board meeting in favor of the creation of an Office of Extracurricular Partnerships, joining the Greater Philadelphia Extracurricular Collaborative and other out-of-school time providers.This office would make school-based extracurricular programs easier to administer, ensure they are more equitably distributed across district schools, and remove barriers to participation. It would also foster coordination between the district, the city, schools, and community-based organizations. In such a space, the district can better align resources like transportation, meals, and initiatives improving community safety. The result is more accessible and safe programs for students and families.The demand for after-school programs is there. According to theAfterschool Alliance, for every child who is enrolled in an after-school program in Pennsylvania, four more children are waiting. A 2019 report from thenational nonprofit Council for a Strong Americafound that after-school programs play a vital role in turning the hours from 2 to 6 p.m. into a time for opportunity for kids.» READ MORE:The shooting at Roxborough High and the absurd state law that limits local gun safety measures | EditorialWhile keeping kids safe and out of trouble is a key reason to increase investment in after-school programs, there are other benefits. Working parents in Pennsylvaniaoverwhelmingly agree that after-school activities preserve their peace of mind and help them keep their jobs. Meanwhile,students enrolled in after-school programs are learning life skills, getting homework help, participating in STEM learning, and getting physical activity. These are all outcomes that can help prevent violence and help children cope with the reality of living in Philadelphia today.Investing in these programs now is urgent. Kids in the city need safe places to go where staff are trained in trauma-informed care and where kids can have enriching experiences without a looming threat of violence. No child should be fearing for their life while walking out of a football scrimmage.We believe that Philadelphia can be a place where children thrive, but they can only succeed with important, thoughtful, high-quality investments in their success.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_19,"After all that Donald Trump has put America through, he owed the country a good laugh. Last week, he delivered spectacularly, if unintentionally. Trump teased a “major announcement” that turned out to be a return to his grifter roots. This time he was hawking not worthless college degrees or failing casinos but digital images of himself in various heroic poses (cowboy, astronaut, superhero .The sound of dropping jaws was palpable throughout MAGA world. If Trump’s earlier suggestion of suspending the Constitution to return him to the presidency didn’t convince his remaining supporters that this man belongs nowhere near power, there are promising indications that perhaps this latest evidence of untethered clownishness finally will.The twice-impeached former president is running for that office again, though evidence of an actual campaign remains elusive. So speculation was rampant when Trump posted on his Truth Social site Wednesday: “AMERICA NEEDS A SUPERHERO! I will be making a MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT tomorrow.”“Will he announce a third party run? House Speaker bid? His running mate?” tweeted one breathless conservative. Others speculated he would announce he is accepting fellow billionaire narcissist Elon Musk’s invitation to return to Twitter.What no one predicted was that Trump meant the “superhero” reference literally. What he unveiled Thursday — in a bizarre video announcement in which he declared himself a better president than Lincoln or Washington — was a line of digital “trading cards” depicting Trump in various heroic, muscular settings.Including one with lasers coming out of his eyes.“Collect all of your favorite Trump Digital Trading Cards, very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting,” Trump wrote in an accompanying post. “Only $99 each! Would make a great Christmas gift. Don’t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!”In yet another confirmation of the old adage that there’s a sucker born every minute, the 45,000 nonfungible tokens (NFTs of the images were in fact gone by Friday morning, according to an independent NFT market monitor.Maybe those buyers thought they were helping Trump’s supposed presidential campaign? If so, sorry, chumps.Trump is just pocketing the money.Mockery of his cheap stunt spread like wildfire across the internet, with even conservative voices getting in on the act. “Don’t give any money to con artist Trump,” blared an editorial headline in the formerly Trumpy New York Post. “Thank God, the digital trading cards are here. It was indeed a MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT,” snarked conservative commentator Ben Shapiro.Even die-hard Trump ally Steve Bannon declared glumly, “I can’t do this anymore.”Trump has repeatedly shown himself to be an existential threat to democracy.But this episode conclusively, finally, reduces him to a national joke.Anyone who ever supported him should be embarrassed. Anyone who still supports him should see a shrink. And America should move on from this idiotic shyster.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
suffolknewsherald_2022_32,"Published 5:56 pm Tuesday, July 19, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:As a lifelong Suffolkian with deep roots here since the late 1800s with my great-great-great grandparents buried on the Pitchkettle Road “Water Works Property” and as a Murphys Mill Road resident, I am very concerned with the rezoning of Route 460, Pitchkettle Road, Murphys Mill Road and King’s Fork Road.Below are key points why my family and the community have concerns with the rezoning:Agriculture.Suffolk is losing its identity! We as a city were known for agriculture. Developing this large property into warehouses is another main highway entering and exiting our city that does not resemble who we are.I am a proud farmer’s daughter and despise the change of our city. There was a balance of industries and agriculture for a long time, but that has dissipated in the course of just 10-15 years. The city does not demonstrate any balance as a reflection of who we are.How can you have a Peanut Festival when you are consuming the city with warehouses? What about creating a working farm for school field trips/science/machinery operations, a complete educational operation? There are so many ideas available to keep this farm intact and available for the community.Revenue.Suffolk continues to build warehouses and homes; however, there is no investment in actual businesses to keep the residents here. Warehouses do not provide residents with options of spending money.The Suffolk residents venture out to other cities to shop, eat and other activities. Suffolk loses out on the revenue that could be brought into the city. A warehouse can be built for the incoming business occupants; but as we have seen, many warehouses are short lived. Yes, this provides job opportunities, but those employees do not have any other means to keep them in the City of Suffolk.Also, U.S. 58, Manning Road, Kenyon Road, Wilroy Road and Nansemond Parkway are loaded with warehouses, active and inactive (vacant . Why does another business want to come this far from the ports? Again, losing the city’s identity from agriculture and who we as a city are!Water.Living by Lake Meade, my family enjoys the fishing opportunities the lake provides. The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts use the West End Baptist Church cabin and land right on the lake. What will come of this property with warehouses surrounding it? With the warehouse this close Lake Meade could be polluted by the warehouse runoff, which the City of Portsmouth owns.Many of our Suffolk residents utilize the water from Lake Meade. In addition the runoff could bring toxins to those who use well water, which is not only a danger to people but to the wildlife.Traffic/Road Conditions.When the apartment/condo neighborhood Hallstead Reserve began preparing the land for development, both bridges on Murphys Mill Road had to be reinforced — not restructured for better support but reinforced. These rural roads are not meant for this type of heavy load on a regular basis.The traffic on Route 460 is already heavy with tractor trailers and this extra traffic will make commutes more difficult for school buses, farm equipment and vehicles. We are already seeing a road surface change on Lake Kilby Road as the tractor trailers from LandWerks’ lot uses Lake Kilby in both directions.Tractor trailers access rural roads to their convenience. I watched this happen all the time when I was a resident of Lummis Road. Drivers would use Lummis Road to cut through to Whaleyville Boulevard due to missing the turn at Copeland Road or just choosing a different route. When a tractor trailer and farm equipment meet on the rural roads, that can be a disaster. There is not enough road shoulder nor durable road conditions for this type of traffic.If you are a true Suffolkian you will back a farmer and his livelihood before any warehouse development! You should also look at our city as a whole and rediscover our city’s longevity as an agriculture community.Christy CordovaSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_39,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There remains a resilient and misguided narrative that suicide rates, across all groups, skyrocketed during the pandemic. This is not true.Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC show a decrease in overall suicides in 2020 as compared with 2019. However, there were communities disproportionately impacted. When we control for ethnicity and income, we see spikes. Big spikes.Some groups saw increases despite overall drop in suicide ratesAccording to the report by the CDC, based on data from 99 percent of all death records from 2020, the overall suicide rate in 2020 dropped 3 percent compared with 2019. This means that almost 46,000 people died from suicide in 2020, roughly 1,600 fewer than in 2019. Suicides among women saw an overall drop of 8 percent from 2019 to 2020 and men saw a 2 percent drop during the same period.However, that only tells part of the story. Among Black girls and women, aged 10-24 years old, suicide rates rose. This group saw suicide rates increase more than 30 percent. Black boys and men in the same age group saw a 23 percent increase from 2019 to 2020.Hispanic/Latina women in that age group saw suicides increase 40 percent, and Hispanic/Latino men of the same age saw a 20 percent increase, according to the report. Meanwhile, Asian women ages 15 to 25 saw a nearly 30 percent increase in suicides.Show me the money: Poverty as a factorWhen we look at ethnicity, we see a significant increase in suicides from 2019 to 2020 and that needs a bright spotlight focused directly on it. This confirms our understanding of the role of white supremacy/privilege and racial disparities. We know ethnicity impacts a person’s health and Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC folks are disproportionately denied access to healthcare as compared with White people. When we also look at income, we see another spike.Around the globe, many governments provided their citizens money to survive during the lockdowns, with the United States being one of these countries. The pandemic funds often exceeded the typical government financial assistance and even working wages people would have otherwise earned. As a result, poverty dropped in the U.S. and suicide rates dropped along with it. As a comparison, in Canada, where the emergency government money was large and lasting, the suicide rate dropped roughly 30 percent. Although data on how poorer countries addressed cash transfers to poor people during the pandemic is inconclusive, it appears providing people with additional money reduced suicides.A paper published in the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2020 showed that those in poverty are more vulnerable to suicide because the strain drastically increases a person’s odds of developing a mental illness which can lead to suicide. The study looked specifically at depression and anxiety and showed a marked increase in the levels of mental illness for people in poverty.IntersectionalityWhen we attempt to look at both ethnicity and income and their relationship to suicide, we must ask new questions. Despite the evidence, many seem reluctant to recognize the link between suicide and people’s inability to meet their basic needs. What is the correlation between ethnicity, income and suicide? We need an intersectional lens and analysis to better understand.Even in research studies or opinion pieces concluding that poverty raises suicide risk, authors will often fail to suggest addressing racism or poverty itself, instead suggesting traditional anti-suicide interventions such as increasing mental health services or access to suicide hotlines. These are necessary to capture the people in immediate need of intervention, but what if we can get people off the suicide path earlier?A Slate articlefrom November of 2021 makes the insightful observation that if the diagnosis is money and the prescription is money, we might have to confront the fundamental building blocks of our economy. If we add ethnicity as a primary driver of suicides and the solution is to confront white supremacy, we have turned our understanding of this problem upside down.To be clear, ending racial disparities and poverty would not end suicide. Many other factors are at play, and many of the traditional intervention strategies are needed and worthwhile. If data truly drove decisions, we’d look at systemic racial disparities that impact suicide and support individuals and families through difficult economic times, much like we did for part of the pandemic.Gary Norman is the chief operating officer at Twin Cities Health Services and adjunct instructor at Augsburg University."
suffolknewsherald_2022_1,"Published 4:38 pm Friday, December 30, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAfter a year of highs and lows for Suffolk, we hope that 2023 sets the course for enduring progress.Successes in 2022 like the opening of a massive Amazon fulfillment center were undercut by an unacceptable wave of violent crime and city leaders’ blessing of a controversial warehousing monstrosity that left citizens in a collective funk.It’s time to close that chapter and resolve to make the new year one of peace and prosperity.Suffolk’s success must begin with public safety. The run of violent crime, which continued to flare in 2022’s final week, is unacceptable and must be declared so by law enforcement, elected leadership, the faith community and the citizenry.The response to date has been heavy on excuses and light on solutions. While the nation’s homicide rate declined in 2022, Suffolk became more violent, too many of its citizens killed and maimed, others fearful to leave their homes or places of employment without getting mugged.Ingredients are in place for a safer 2023. Congress has approved significant funding for local law enforcement agencies nationwide, putting to rest the “defund the police” nonsense that damaged police-community relations for the better part of two years. Inflation, which strained household budgets and led to economic despair for many, has eased. Virginia, under the leadership of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, finally seems serious about addressing the mental health crisis that is the root of so many societal woes.Economically, we hope the City Council and City Hall declare 2023 to be the year our community pivots away from warehousing as its development focus, creates a vision for what Suffolk should be and gets citizens excited again about their quality of life.Suffolk has more than done its part for the Hampton Roads region and its port. City leaders must say unequivocally to state and regional leadership that we’re done “taking one for the team,” as happened with the Port 460 warehousing campus in the core of the city. And City Hall must demand state and federal funds for infrastructure improvements to handle the coming tsunami of yet more truck traffic.Lastly, we hope to see less pettiness in 2023. Suffolk Public Schools have been especially susceptible, the tone set by a superintendent who’d rather pick silly fights than put his nose to the grindstone and make our public schools more successful and more accountable. A retooled School Board gives him that opportunity.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_81,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Throughout my 37 years in the Legislature, the second year of every session has been dedicated to passing a bonding bill to invest in Minnesota’s infrastructure. Bonding bills provide financing to pave new roads, improve our ports, construct water systems and update existing infrastructure — and the construction of these projects creates thousands of good-paying union jobs along the way.Bonding bills always make sense for Minnesota, but this year there was an additional incentive from the federal government: matching funds to finance the projects. If the Legislature had passed a bonding bill, the taxpayers of Minnesota would have benefitted from critical infrastructure investments at a heavily discounted rate.Unfortunately, so far the Legislature has failed to pass a bonding bill, leaving the possibility that this federal money could be used for projects in other states. That’s why I’m urging the Senate Republican majority to agree to a special session so we can get our work done on a bonding bill and other key priorities.Minnesota needs infrastructure improvements, and we cannot afford to wait. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE , Minnesota’s infrastructure received a “C” grade in 2022. Our roads are filled with potholes, our wastewater facilities are aging, and our parks have been heavily trafficked throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. But it doesn’t have to be this way.A $280 million state investment would unlock 26 times that amount — $7.3 billion — in matching federal financing. That would amount to one of the largest infrastructure investments in state history.These investments would be used toward important projects that don’t necessarily get the attention they deserve, like upgrading the HVAC systems at our colleges and universities, or replacing roofing on government buildings.Every Minnesotan deserves to have world-class drinking water, safe roads and bridges, clean wastewater facilities and beautiful parks. But these projects are expensive, and we can’t expect local governments to shoulder the entire cost.The failure to pass a bonding bill is a failure to take advantage of the opportunities to invest in the jobs and economic development that keeps our state moving. As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to maintain our state’s assets and build new projects to support future generations.Unfortunately, Senate Republicans have made clear in recent days that they are not interested in coming back to the Capitol to finish this important work. Their decision to walk away is a decision to leave billions of dollars in federal infrastructure subsidies on the table. I encourage my Republican colleagues to reconsider that decision and come back to the Legislature to finish our work to deliver for Minnesotans.Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, is a member of the Minnesota Senate."
suffolknewsherald_2022_105,"Published 6:52 pm Friday, April 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceThe confirmation page for my purchase sat on my computer screen while the webpage encouraged me to book now. I thought of all that I had to do over the next few months, and I wondered if I should postpone this vacation. I had so much to do, and I could always take this trip later.Then my mind took me back several years. I was planning this trip then, but I became ill unexpectedly. I remember the doctor’s diagnosis and wondering if I would ever be able to take the vacation that I had planned. Several years later, with the Lord’s healing and doctors’ help, I felt better and excited to try this trip again. Then the world shut down, and no one went anywhere.I thought of both of those delays, and I hit the purchase button on the page. My flight was booked, and my vacation was scheduled. The opportunity for this vacation is now, and I know from previous years that no chance is guaranteed to last.We are all guilty of thinking that the things that lie before us now will always be available. Other times, we delay things we want to do because life is too busy or work is too hectic. This thinking, however, has problems.The first problem is that we do not know if what is available today will be available for us tomorrow. None of us know what the future holds. My two previous attempts at this vacation were foiled by things that I never saw coming – a personal illness and a worldwide pandemic.The next problem is that life is always busy. There will always be projects at work and responsibilities at home. We will miss chances to live life fully if we wait for things to slow down because life doesn’t slow down often.We should know that taking an adventure, completing a dream, or going on vacation isn’t a bad thing. I am not taking a “live for today at the expense of tomorrow” attitude. Taking opportunities to have an adventure or enjoy something special doesn’t mean that you have to do so recklessly.My advice to take full advantage of opportunities and the encouragement to enjoy things while you have the ability isn’t a free pass to avoid responsibilities, hurt others, or damage your future.I ensured that both of my employers knew about my vacation, prepared them for my absence, and completed what work I could do in advance. My responsibilities outside of work are resolved for my time away, and I saved my money and time off from work for this trip.I’m not sure what vacation, dream event, or adventure you’ve put on the back burner because you think you can always do it later or because you think life will slow down in the future, but I encourage you to enjoy what you can enjoy today. We’re not promised tomorrow, and we’ve all learned that our world can change quickly.

suffolknewsherald_2022_65,"Published 5:41 pm Tuesday, June 7, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Tom MastaglioGuest columnistOf the four patriotic spring and summer holidays, Flag Day is the least acknowledged and often poorly understood; the others are Veterans Day, Memorial Day and July Fourth.Should it be? June 14 is officially Flag Day. It is not a national holiday in the sense of government offices and businesses closing, nor does it mark a three-day weekend, so often it goes unnoticed by many citizens. Nevertheless, it provides us an opportunity to reflect on this grand symbol of our republic and show our respect.The date was chosen because it was June 14 in 1777 that the Continental Congress adopted the design of our flag. First, the design was proposed as composed of 13 red and white alternating stripes and a Union Jack in the corner; that corner design was widely contested, of course, and replaced with a field of blue containing one star for each state in the Union – 13 then and 50 today.It was not until 1916 that President Woodrow Wilson designated June 14 as Flag Day – a day on which to honor our national flag and reflect on the foundations of the nation’s liberties. The flag of the United States represents freedom and has been an enduring symbol of the country’s ideals; it is universally recognized as a symbol of such individual liberties.Some essential facts about flag and flag etiquette that we all should know and follow: Do not let the flag touch the ground. A flag displayed out of doors should be illuminated by sunlight or artificial light at night if it is not taken in. There is a proper way to fold a flag; if you need to know, ask a Boy Scout.The flag should not be used as apparel, bedding or drapery, according to the official flag code, although today using its design on clothing or in other places appears to be acceptable. Unserviceable flags – ripped, torn, damaged or soiled – should no longer be displayed but properly disposed of. The best way to ensure proper disposal is by turning your flag in to a civic or community organization that will retire your flag properly.In Smithfield, American Legion Post 49 will conduct a formal ceremony to do that on June 18 at 1 p.m. at the Post, 818 S. Church St. The public is invited to bring flags to the post any time before the ceremony and to attend our ceremony. It is particularly appropriate for youth to experience this respectful and solemn event. Refreshments will be served following the ceremony.The Stars and Stripes is mistreated by those who want to express a political position that opposes government action (or inaction and by our foreign opponents. This is improper. In fact, the flag represents the very freedoms that allow such protestations. If you see this type of activity politely remind the desecrators that they are disrespecting the very symbol of our country that represents their freedom to publicly disagree and protest. Freedom should be cherished, our nation’s principles that provide it honored and our national symbol, the Stars and Stripes, respected as a representing those liberties.So, on June 14 show the colors by your home or on your vehicle and take time to reflect on this grand symbol of our freedom and democracy. Honor the flag and honor your country.Tom Mastaglio is the media and publicity coordinator for American Legion Post 49 in Smithfield.

suffolknewsherald_2022_227,"Published 6:27 pm Tuesday, November 1, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThe Whaleyville Recreation Center was something former Councilman Curtis Milteer Sr. had championed and was proud to cut the ribbon for when it opened in January 2015.Now, some nine months after his death at age 91, the building bears Milteer’s name.A Friday ceremony officially christened the Curtis R. Milteer Sr. Recreation Center after a prior City Council vote to name it in memory of the longtime city council member.Milteer served as the representative for Whaleyville Borough on the Suffolk City Council for 40 years and was elected to 10 consecutive terms by voters who trusted him implicitly to represent their interests at City Hall.“Everybody knows my father, and what he was about,” his son Anthony Milteer said at Friday’s ceremony. He’s right. The Milteer name is synonymous with rural southern Suffolk.The recreation center was converted from the old Robertson Elementary School, which closed in 2011, and the school division handed the building over to the city. It was originally called the Whaleyville Community Center before becoming the Whaleyville Recreation Center.“This center is going to be a success,” Milteer said at the time of its opening, “because we’re going to make it a success.”Such was Milteer’s determination, a confidence that never bordered on arrogance.At a council meeting soon after Milteer’s death, longtime colleague Leroy Bennett remembered Milteer’s persuasiveness.“I’ll miss him calling and saying, ‘Hey young man, I want to run something by you.’ And usually when he called you to say he wanted to run something by you, he was trying to get you to agree with whatever he wanted to run by you,” Bennett said.We commend the City Council’s decision to pay permanent tribute to a man who served Suffolk and Whaleyville faithfully and effectively.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

An associate sat behind the counters tapping on his cellphone, barely even looking at me as I checked out.I wasn’t shocked at the condition of the store or the inattentiveness of the associate working there. Sadly, this is a common occurrence in many areas of our country, including some in our fine city. However, I left the store that day wondering when our society lost the pride we once had in our work, our workplace and our city.I couldn’t stop wondering why it seems that so many people do not care about their workplace, city, home and area in which they live?I know that these questions cannot be answered in a short column, and it would be hard to come up with an answer without a lot of research and discussion. Plus, it may not be the most important question. Instead, let’s look at what we can do to reclaim the pride we once had in ourselves, our places of employment, our home and our city.We must first understand that we cannot control every aspect of the things around us. We only control a small portion, but we can, and should, do what we can to make everything within our control the best possible. Too often, we throw up our hands in frustration, allowing the things that we cannot control to cause us to give up on what we can control. We fail to realize that if we all took pride in our little corner of the city that the entire area would begin to improve.Next, we should realize that things do not have to be new, fancy or expensive to be excellent. We use the excuse of not having money to repair everything as a reason to let everything fall apart, but there are things we can do that do not cost a lot of money.An older building can be maintained, kept clean and be well organized. We can easily fall into the trap of considering older places not worth our time to maintain or clean, but older doesn’t mean it can’t be pleasant. Likewise, inexpensive doesn’t have to mean trashy. We will be more likely to take pride in our ownership of things when we understand that things that are old or inexpensive can be nice.Lastly, we can begin to hold ourselves and those who work with us accountable. Let’s look around our corner of the city and our place of employment to see where we can improve in helping make things as nice as possible. Let’s hold one another accountable and help one another as we strive to retake pride in the place that we call home.Would you pledge with me today to take pride in the things we own, where we work and where we live by keeping everything around us as nice as possible?Nathan Rice, a Hampton Roads resident since 1988, is a branch operations manager for a regional credit union in Virginia and North Carolina.

However, the GOP successfully does awaywith all prerequisites for owning and carrying firearms.

A loose network of charter schools, 90% of which are operated by churches, appears to fill the void. Anyone with a high school diploma is allowed to teach K-12. To subsidize tuition at these schools, sales tax is imposed on groceries, and tollbooths are set up to collect money from motorists every 100 miles. The Indiana Chamber of Commerce effusively praises the creation of new non-union teacher and tollbooth operator jobs. A bill abolishing all restrictions on the sale of firearms passes easily. Gun sellers place vending machines in every mall and drive-thru kiosks beside every tollbooth. Mask requirements by private businesses are punished with stiff criminal penalties, including fines and jail time.2025:A nonprofit corporation operated by Liberty University takes control of most of the cash-strapped charter schools in the state of Indiana and fires all the teachers who have ever bought birth control.

That makes it all the more important to recognize when the process works as it should.Last week, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that will require states and the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages that have been conducted in any state or U.S. territory where such unions are legal.It also affirmed the legitimacy of same-sex marriages for the purpose of federal benefits.It’s now back to the House, where an earlier version passed in July.Should the bill advance as expected, President Joe Biden has said he’ll promptly sign it.Arguably, the measure is superfluous. Although it would formally repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which had defined marriage as a union of one man and one woman, more recent Supreme Court precedents had effectively already invalidated it. Since the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, moreover, gay marriage has been established as a constitutional right.Yet the Respect for Marriage Act, as the new bill is titled, should stand as a landmark nonetheless, for two reasons.One is that it affirms the value of making policy by legislation as opposed to judicial fiat.Supporters of abortion rights have recently been dismayed to realize that a right invented by a court in one era — as with Roe v. Wade — can be just as easily dismantled in another.Indeed, Justice Clarence Thomas, in his concurring opinion in the case overturning Roe, suggested that the decision invited reconsideration of other high court rulings, including Obergefell.No one joined Thomas’s opinion, and Obergefell is almost certainly here to stay. But the point stands: An elected legislature, accountable to voters and responsive to shifts in public opinion, is the appropriate venue for negotiating wide-ranging social policies.Same-sex marriage now has a firmer basis in federal law, as well it should: Polls show that more than 70% of Americans support such unions.A second, related virtue of the bill was procedural.After the House passed the original version, Senate Democrats could’ve played politics, dared Republicans to mount a filibuster, and used their opposition as a cudgel during the midterms.Instead, the bill’s cosponsors accepted that genuinely undecided Republicans such as Mitt Romney had good-faith reservations about the bill and held off on voting until after the midterms.That collegial trust paid off: Twelve Republicans — about a quarter of the Senate GOP conference — eventually crossed over and supported a revised version that addressed their concerns about religious liberty.As recently as 1996, the U.S. was solidly opposed to gay marriage.Today — thanks in large part to decades of hard work and political pressure by advocates for marriage equality — lawmakers in both parties have fashioned a bargain reflecting a new national consensus.That’s how the democratic process is supposed to work.— Bloomberg Opinion"
eugeneweekly_2022_34,"We ve got issues. “We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres made these opening remarks at last month’s climate change summit in Egypt. Was the secretary-general using alarmist language in order to make a point? Or is the world literally racing forward along a highway to climate hell? Guterres continued by saying, “Our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. It is the defining issue of our age. It is the central challenge of our century. It is unacceptable, outrageous and self-defeating to put it on the back burner.” Meanwhile climate activism continues to lag behind climate reality. Carbon dioxide and methane are invisible, up-in-the-sky pollutants that can be easy to ignore while we carry on with our day-to-day lives. And greenhouse gasses co-exist with other forms of air and water pollution that choke up our cities and poison our drinking water and that often command more immediate attention. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. There are other reasons that climate change lacks immediacy. David Wallace-Wells, journalist atTheNew York Times, examines the competing descriptions that we use to frame the problem. “What is the line between climate danger and climate disaster?” he asks. “Or between climate normal and climate disruption, and climate catastrophe and climate apocalypse? Is ‘climate hell’ what awaits us past 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, or past 2.0 degrees, or at the level the United Nations expects the world’s current policy commitments to take us to the end of this century, 2.6 degrees?” And all this time, the consequences of global warming continue to cause suffering and death. During this past year, the world has witnessed unprecedented floods in Pakistan, severe drought in southern Africa, hurricanes in the Dominican Republic, deadly heat waves in China, and the longest continuous mega-drought ever recorded in the western U.S. Climate change is a battle for power — not just the power to run our cars or keep our buildings warm, but a battle against the political and economic power that the fossil fuel industry holds over us. The Climate Trace Project documents an imposing list of worldwide greenhouse gas polluters — more than 72,000 steel and cement factories, power plants, oil and gas fields, cargo ships and cattle feedlots, not to mention our continued reliance on gasoline-powered cars and trucks. Most of us remain addicted to fossil fuels. Another battle for power focuses on reparations. Should wealthy nations like the United States, with long histories as greenhouse gas polluters, pay poorer countries for damage and loss due to extreme weather and rising seas? Amid all of these consequential issues, there is also an increasing sense of hope in the air. Kate Marvel, a climatologist at NASA, says, “We live in a terrible world, and we live in a wonderful world. It’s a terrible world that’s more than a degree Celsius warmer. But also a wonderful world in which we have so many ways to generate electricity that are cheaper and more cost-effective and easier to deploy than I would’ve ever imagined. People are writing credible papers in scientific journals making the case that switching rapidly to renewable energy isn’t a net cost; it will be a net financial benefit. If you had told me five years ago that that would be the case, I would’ve thought, ‘Wow, that’s a miracle!’” So how do we make sense of all of this? Should we hope or should we despair? How do we talk to our children and grandchildren about climate change? How should we act as responsible citizens and consumers during this brief time we have on earth, and will our actions make a difference? On Thursday, Dec. 8, at 6 pm, there will be a discussion about climate change at the downtown Eugene Public Library. Many of the issues raised in this essay will be discussed. The general public is invited to attend, and admission is free. The discussion will be facilitated by Caroline Lundquist and me as part of a monthly series of library-sponsored Community Philosophy Circles. We hope to see you there. Paul Bodin worked as a teacher in Eugene District 4J schools for over three decades, and is currently leading philosophical discussions in elementary and middle school classrooms.

minnpost_2022_65,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .With the Minnesota Vikings searching for new leadership, conjecture has focused on a number of displaced coaches of pro teams and high-level assistants around the country. Yet the Wilf family owners do not have to look that far.Just a couple of miles away east of the Vikings stadium in downtown Minneapolis, P.J. Fleck, the coach of the University of Minnesota football team, has elevated the Gophers from mediocrity to relevance in the Big Ten and on the national scene.Coming off a third-consecutive bowl game victory, the 18-6 win over West Virginia in the re-christened Guaranteed Rate bowl game in Phoenix after Christmas, the energetic head of the Gophers has just completed his fifth season — and he has at least seven more upcoming as a result of a mid-season $5 million extension of his contract with the university. That’s a large sum, to be sure, although middling by big-time collegiate standards and puny compared to what the pros are paying these days (about $8 million to $10 million .P.J. might be the best choice for the most vaunted — and highest-paying — athletic coaching position in the state.To pull off that maneuver will take some skillful planning and execution, like the fake 2-point extra point conversion that helped propel the Gophers’ bowl game victory.One obstacle is the notion that college coaches don’t succeed in the pros, a view bolstered by the utter failure and firing in mid-season this fall of Jacksonville’s Urban Meyer, who had great success and won a pair of national championships in the collegiate ranks at Florida and Ohio State.But that marked-for-malaise outlook is a misconception. While many have faltered, including ex-Gophers coach Lou Holtz, who had a disastrous one-year run with the New York Jets after some collegiate success and before his two seasons with the Gophers, a number of highly successful college coaches have done well in the National Football League (NFL , such as: a pair from Oklahoma, Chuck Fairbanks at New England and Barry Switzer for the Dallas Cowboys; another Cowboys head, Jimmy Johnson from Miami; and Pete Carroll, a former Vikings assistant coach, incidentally, who went from the University of Southern California (USC to become the longest-serving current NFL coach at Seattle. All of them and some others were championship-caliber coaches in college and emulated, or exceeded, that success in the pros.Overall, effective college coaches have about as good, or bad, a track record in pro football as others who have not had similar campus coaching credentials.The bigger question with Fleck is whether his rah-rah “Row the Boat” attitude would work with the mentality of professional players.Why not? One of the criticisms of the Vikings under former coach Mike Zimmer, even articulated by one of the team’s star players, All-Pro receiver Justin Jefferson, after the team’s disheartening loss to the Los Angeles Rams the day after Christmas (a day before the Gophers bowl-game triumph , is that the squad lacked “energy.”There’s no one around that could instill that enthusiasm and vigor better than P.J., a gridiron version of the Ever-Ready rabbit. If his approach can’t take hold, with some adjustment, with the Vikings, shame on them, not him.Other obstaclesBut other obstacles face Fleck if the Vikings were inclined, and so was he, to make the move up (or down Washington Avenue.One of them is that big University of Minnesota contract. But breaking it is a mere trifle. College coaches do it all the time, including the aforementioned Holtz, who rescinded his here in midstream in 1985 to jump to Notre Dame, where he won a national championship three years later.This year alone, several big-time college coaches have abrogated their long-term collegiate contracts to obtain more lucrative ones elsewhere, including another Notre Dame mentor, Brian Kelly, the winning coach in that school’s illustrious history, who departed for another elite football factory, Louisiana State, while another, Lincoln Riley, left Oklahoma to join USC. (Funny how the names of those same institutions keep popping up. Fleck has experience doing so; he left his former coaching position at Western Michigan in mid-contract to come here in 2017.There is a buy-out provision in Fleck’s contract — a sizable $10 million — if he were to leave this year. But that’s a mere bagatelle that could easily be paid off by him, probably subsidized by the Wilfs, if he joins the club, or possibly even renegotiated with the university.A popular coach jumping ship in the middle of a contract often breeds fan animosity. But Fleck would not be abandoning the community; he would just be moving his base of operations to an adjoining zip code. The bulk of his adoring fan base at the university overlaps with the Vikings faithful. Any disappointment of the former would be outweighed by delight of the latter.Of course, leaving the Gophers and joining the Vikings would still keep him in this community and his “home.” He wouldn’t even need a moving van, unless he decides to buy a mini-mansion here.With the possibility of a long-term, lucrative contract, offering substantial security and more remuneration than he currently has, not to mention increased acclaim and a new challenge, if offered the opportunity, he probably would respond like a quintessential Minnesotan: You betcha!Marshall H.

minnpost_2022_161,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Between Nov. 9, 1989, and Dec. 26, 1991, the Berlin wall toppled, the iron curtain was lifted, and the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In just a little more than two years, the Cold War came to an end and the daily threat of nuclear war dissipated. For the past 31 years we have slowly forgotten our fears and the real possibilities of nuclear Armageddon.This all changed on Thursday, Feb. 24, 2022, when the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin justified his war by saying it is a “special military operation to demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine” and to prevent a genocide against ethnic Russians in the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk. Just two days later, Putin placed his nuclear forces on high alert and threatened that any nation that interfered with his actions against Ukraine would face “consequences they have never seen.”A new nuclear red line has been drawn by the autocrat Putin. Most of the world sees the Russian invasion of Ukraine as unjustified and horrific. Many want to help Ukraine remain independent, but they realize any direct confrontation of nuclear powers could lead to an escalation and the end of the world as we know it.Both Pope Francis and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have recently commented on the increased threat of nuclear war. On March 14, the UN Secretary-General stated, “Nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.” A few days later, the Pope commented, “Our imagination appears increasingly concentrated on the representation of a final catastrophe that will extinguish us … such as that which would happen with an eventual atomic war.”Not since the Cold War, have we felt this overwhelming dread of a possible nuclear holocaust. According to the Federation of American Scientists, Russia has the largest stockpile of atomic weapons in the world with 5,977. The United States has 5,428 such weapons with the United Kingdom having 225 and France having 290. That means NATO has 5,933 nuclear weapons at its disposal.The old doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD has come back to the world forefront. Basically, MAD prevents all out warfare between two or more nuclear nations because each side would be wiped out in an atomic confrontation. Having nuclear weapons, oddly enough, prevents WWIII from occurring.However, the world is in real danger now because it is becoming difficult to see where Putin has drawn his nuclear red line. If NATO aids Ukraine too much an escalation could occur to nuclear war. But what is too much aid?Apparently, it is all right to allow some 16,000 to 20,000 volunteer foreign fighters from Europe, America and elsewhere to join the Ukrainian war efforts. It also seems acceptable to place incredibly severe economic sanctions on Russia to force it to withdraw from Ukraine. Finally, it also seems “safe” to send Ukraine billions of dollars of conventional weapons to defend against the invading Russian military.NATO is sending in additional troops into Eastern European nations that are members of the alliance including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. It wants to send a message to Putin that they have a nuclear red line as well. If Russian forces attack one of these nations, NATO will defend them.With such heightened tensions between NATO and Russia, a miscalculation by either side could trigger a direct confrontation and escalation to World War III.We no longer train our students to duck under their desks or to hide in fallout shelters, but we still live under the daily threat of destroying ourselves. At times we forget how close we are to our own demise. The Russo-Ukrainian War has brought back the terror of a possible nuclear apocalypse front and center.Dave Berger of Maple Grove, Minnesota, is a retired sociology professor who taught for nearly thirty seven years.

I found the report of that analysis to be laser focused on the Port 460 facility, as if nothing else really matters.Project positives were very visible: tax revenue, jobs, turn lanes and stop lights. Project negatives were not: its location at the junction of the two most dangerous roads in Virginia, higher risk of accidents/fatalities up and down U.S. Routes 58 and 460, increased gridlock potential on U.S. 58, exacerbating existing congestion and dangers on U.S. 460 from Suffolk to Petersburg and degradation of Suffolk’s livability and image. Issues such as these should be obvious to anyone charged with doing what’s best for Suffolk and its people, but in this case it fell entirely to the citizens to bring them up.The vote looms, and still these issues go unaddressed: no crash probability analysis, no funded plan to complete road improvements before we double the traffic and no changes to preserve quality of life. Instead, we get “the trucks are coming whether we do this or not.”To that, I say: If Choice A is thousands of trucks passing through on their way to somewhere else, and Choice B is those same trucks exiting onto a single overcrowded highway, shifting lanes in a hurry, and turning sharply into a warehouse monstrosity, I respectfully request Choice A.Council members have said they have never seen such public opposition to any other issue.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_12,"In April, when Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter, he spoke in elevated terms about fulfilling a high moral purpose. “I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he said, adding “since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.”Read that again, then read the news, then laugh hard for an hour. The transformation under Musk’s private ownership, still underway, now consists of barring prominent journalists who covered him and his suspension of an account that, using publicly available data, tracked his private jet’s movements.Such a tantrum is perfectly legal; the sole proprietor of a social media platform is under no obligation to keep it open to anyone. But by succumbing so quickly to the very censorious tendencies he decried, Musk, the self-proclaimed ”free speech absolutist,” becomes the joke and the punchline at the very same time.Musk’s fit of pique simultaneously pulls the mask off the conservative critics who have spent years railing against so-called Twitter “shadow bans” while pushing for legislation that would force privately run networks to host many more speakers who violate terms of service intended to prevent bigoted attacks, bullying, incitement and other uncivil speech.Those critics, who claim to revere the Constitution, are comically wrong when they claim that Twitter and Facebook and other privately run online communities are subject to the First Amendment, which only limits government from abridging expression — while effectively protecting the right of companies to act as moderators.With a straight face, Musk claims merely to be enforcing the company’s own rules, but that’s bogus. He’s just the king lashing out against troublemaking subjects. That it’s his right to be so wrong cannot paper over a hypocrisy every bit as swollen as the head that wears the crown.— New York Daily NewsNEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

leoweekly_2022_30,"Beyond the occasional mass shooting, now as unremarkable as a traffic jam or a tornado, there isn’t much Big News out of central Indiana. So when a baby was deposited in a box affixed to the Carmel Fire Department last month, it was Big News.It has thus far proved to be the feel-good Big News of the year for Hoosiers. All the local media outlets were slipping in their own saliva to cover it, and the comments sections were mostly full of praise for the “wonderful” baby boxes, the “courageous mother” who made a “heartbreaking decision,” the “heroic firefighters” who retrieved the baby in less than a minute, and so on. The Carmel fire chief said: “It was so adorable.”It was even Big News to Todd Young, our all-American goodboy soldier/lawyer/senator. On his social media accounts, he wrote: “Baby boxes are saving lives across Indiana and giving mothers a place to turn. Thanks to all those who support the baby box movement.” “Ha ha, that’s a funny thing to say,” I thought. “’The baby box movement.’”Then another baby was left at the same fire department. Then another. Three deposits in five weeks. And that’s just in Carmel.Again, Young posted effusive praise for infant collection devices. In fact, if you dig through Young’s social media, you’ll find several posts on the subject from the last few years, including one personal visit by the senator to a Seymour fire station. Nearly all these posts mention Safe Haven Baby Boxes, Inc., a nonprofit that installs human deposit receptacles in fire stations all over the Midwest. At least one has a photo of Young with Safe Haven’s founder, former Indiana firefighter Monica Kelsey.Safe Haven has its own robust social media presence. Most of its posts are celebrations of new box installations (“Welcome to the party, Fort Wayne!” or of successful infant retrievals (“Welcome to the World, Sweet Baby!” . You can also buy t-shirts with witty slogans at their online shop (“I love Jesus but I cuss a little” .These boxes are saving tiny little lives? Great. But something about Young’s attention seemed to transgress boundaries of ordinary tractor-and-hay-bale-photo-op politicking. Baby hatches (or “foundling wheels” were common from the 12th to the 19th century. These baby drop-off points have fallen out of favor in the industrialized world because we have mostly figured out how to afford the upkeep on our kids, even if just barely. And now all of a sudden they’re popping up everywhere? Senators are tweeting about them? “I’m a red-state lifer and therefore used to weird Dickensian shit,” says I, “but something ain’t right here.”Then it hit me: “Christ! This is theirpolicy solution!”You see, the GOP has a bit of maneuvering to do. They have to figure out how to soft-land this anti-abortion blimp they’ve been flying for the last 50 years. If unskilled hands are at the yoke, they’re going to crash into a tower of “How are people with no health care, no parental leave, and no money going to raise the children they are forced to give birth to?” So far, they’ve mostly answered this question the way they answer all policy questions: With more questions. (What about critical race theory? Isn’t it terrible about trans girls in sports? Aren’t lizard-people operating secret pizza sex dungeons in D.C.? Etc. But if babies start to die of malnutrition — a possibility even now, with domestic infants in comparatively short supply — they know there’s a risk that things could get messy.Faced with this problem, Republicans could support modest Medicaid and FMLA expansions, extended unemployment benefits, food stamps and other social programs. Or they could simply follow the lead of some European countries and allow for anonymous births at hospitals. Or they could come up with some minimalistic, medieval monstrosity that sticks the parent with a hospital bill and/or the risk of unassisted home birth and act like it’s an honest-to-godpolicy solution.Well folks, if you know American conservatism, you know where this is going.Baby hatches began their American comeback tour in 2016, around the same time that the end of Roe became a real possibility and not just a Falwellian wet dream. The first two were installed in northern Indiana courtesy of — you guessed it — Safe Haven Baby Boxes, Inc. The company has installed over 100 more in the last five years.Suspect timing alone wouldn’t mean that baby boxes are about to be the GOP’s universal answer to the social ills that are coming post-Roe. But you have to wonder why else a goober like Todd Young would pay so much attention to them. Is it really because they save lives? The Safe Haven Baby Boxes, Inc., website says: “Since April 2016, when the first box was installed, there have been no dead abandoned infants in the state of Indiana.” Ok, but I couldn’t find much evidence of “dead abandoned infants” ever in the state of Indiana, let alone any evidence that firehouse incubators were preventing such deaths. Safe Haven posts stories about “infants in dumpsters” from elsewhere in the country, but most of these end up being women who have panicked after a miscarriage or stillbirth. There’s an oft-repeated assertion that the boxes prevent abortions, but come on. What pregnant person has ever said “I was going to get an abortion, but luckily now I have the option of carrying to term, delivering a baby and leaving it in a night drop?”The real tell came when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who, at the hearing in the case that is about to overturn Roe, asked this question: “Both Roe and Casey v. Planned Parenthood emphasized the burdens of parenting and the obligations of motherhood that flow from pregnancy. Why don’t the safe haven laws allowing anonymous infant surrenders take care of that problem?”What Aunt Amy is saying here is not that the boxes prevent abortions, but that the “burdens of parenting” are no longer a thingbecause you can drop the baby in a box.Add to all this the fact that Safe Haven Baby Boxes, Inc., is propelled by extreme anti-choice ideology, and you start to see why Republicans are spilling so much seed over baby hatches. Safe Haven’s website boasts that it “has referred over 500 women to crisis pregnancy centers.” Founder Monica Kelsey’s personal website explains that “Monica has been sharing her pro-life views with millions of people since February 2011 and works diligently to support pro-life legislators who take a stand to defend the lives of children conceived in rape.” See? Rape is no excusebecause you can drop the baby in a box.Stories about rescued kids sound nice, but when Senator Young gushes about the “baby box movement,” he’s really broadcasting the GOP’s answer to “what do we do post-Roe?” It’s another question: “Why are you complaining about having to raise your rapist’s child when you could have just left it in one of the boxes affixed to fire stations all over the country? Everyone knows about those, they were Big News a while back.” •Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor.

I proudly voted for this bill, and while it doesn’t have everything I wanted, it’s going to save lives. This victory lays the foundation for more progress, and I’m going to keep working to make our communities safer.Following the Supreme Court’s dangerous decision taking away a woman’s right to make personal health care decisions, I’ve been reaching across the aisle to see if we can find a bipartisan consensus to restore that right legislatively.

minnpost_2022_136,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It seems that April has proved this year to be the cruelest month. But actually it has been so for the past 10 years, according to my favorite Minnesota weatherman. Just even thinking about how our state’s been consistently experiencing below normal spring temps for a decade now makes me shiver as I pull back out my warmest woolen mittens that I had just packed away.I also know my back porch is still playing host to my shiny red shovel, worn out snow boots, ice melt and my heaviest dog hair covered parka. After all, even though it’s the middle of April, it snowed earlier this week and last week we experienced wicked winds, rain, ice and hail.So in an effort to make myself smile, I took a walk up the hill to the grocery store one recent morning. I’d intended to pick up a loaf of heart healthy 12 grain bread but instead walked out with an oversized bag of sugar filled jelly beans that will surely disgust my dentist. I’m easily distracted, and the Easter display next to the bread aisle drew me in with its cornucopia of brightly colored jelly bean packages to choose from. I’ll admit, the sweet scent of an army of happy chocolate bunnies sporting blue bow ties next to the beans couldn’t be ignored, but I held my ground.The truth is I don’t even like jelly beans all that much, but I was already popping some of those ruby red, sun-kissed orange, lemon yellow and berry blue candies into my mouth even before I walked out of the store.I guess that jelly beans have always been my “go to” comfort food in spring. And perhaps even more so in this crazy year of 2022 with our continuing COVID concerns, increasing crime, inflation, supply issues and the horrific war in the Ukraine.As I continued nibbling on my jelly beans while walking home I suddenly felt like a little kid again. There I am sitting on an old church pew next to Dad in my winter jacket and snowboots, yet in spite of the weather I’m wearing an Easter bonnet trimmed in tiny pink daisies. Dad and I are both carefully and slowly pulling out small handfuls of jelly beans from our pockets during another long sermon given by our long winded minister. Occasionally Dad and I each pretend to cough, covering our mouths, as we sneak a few beans from our now sticky and colored hands onto our tongues. Then we chew, and swallow. Dad trained me very well and I never dropped even one jelly bean. Though on one April Easter morning, Dad grabbed up too many beans and accidentally dropped them all. The congregation could hear the pitter patter of each shiny colored jelly bean as it rolled down the aisle towards the minister’s black wingtips.I don’t think the minister was amused, though Dad probably was. At least a little. But I’m guessing he was mostly annoyed that he lost some of those jelly beans. Especially the ruby red ones that were his favorite.After Dad died two decades later from Alzheimer’s, we discovered that he had been hoarding jelly beans for years. My family smiled through our tears at the discovery as we tossed out the past dated bags.I still miss my Dad. He was such a kind and loving father.

minnpost_2022_32,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The staffing crisis in Minnesota nursing homes and other residential settings is reaching critical levels, taking a toll on workers and threatening the health and safety of vulnerable seniors.Even industry leaders warn of imminent collapse. While AARP applauds Gov. Tim Walz’s recent appropriation of $50 million to nursing homes and his commitment to hiring 1,000 additional certified nursing assistants, more critical investments are needed to address the workforce crisis and protect nursing home residents. At the same time, Minnesota lawmakers must act now to make home care options more affordable and available and that includes support for the family caregivers who help keep our loved ones at home and out of taxpayer-funded facilities.COVID-19 has been devastating to older adults and laid bare chronic problems in Minnesota’s nursing homes. At the height of the pandemic, nursing homes and assisted living facilities represented close to 80 percent of Minnesota’s COVID-19 deaths and sadly, deaths are on the rise again with the emergence of the omicron variant. Now more than ever we must reduce reliance on nursing homes and expand access to home and community-based services that offer seniors more choice and saves taxpayers’ money as in-home care costs one-third of nursing home care on average in Medicaid.Far too many families in search of long-term care, especially care at home, enter a world that is fragmented, confusing, costly and lacking in transparency. Older adults and people with disabilities who need long-term care under Medicaid often wait up to 90 days to establish eligibility. As a result, individuals who would prefer home care end up in the last place they ever wanted to be; a nursing home. As hospitals struggle to find nursing home placements, expediting access to in-home services can help avoid unnecessary and costly admissions to nursing homes.Several states have implemented policies that fast-track applicants likely eligible for Medicaid to start receiving services in their home when a need arises. In these states, an individual can receive services at home while their Medicaid application is being processed; and the financial risk that someone will be found ineligible is either fully assumed by the state or shared with providers. Minnesota should consider this streamlined presumptive eligibility process for our Essential Community Support and Elderly Waiver Programs.We also must do more to support family caregivers who are the backbone of our long-term care system. Too often, individuals and their loved ones cobble together a patchwork of ways to get the services they need. A Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, along with respite care and additional in-home supports could help alleviate the financial, health and emotional stress faced by family caregivers and help retain participation in the labor force, especially by women who provide the bulk of eldercare.Without paid sick leave, front-line staff are getting ill but cannot afford to stay home, putting vulnerable seniors at risk. It is dangerous not to provide sick leave when staff are caring for medically vulnerable residents during a pandemic.With these dynamics, nursing homes often have chronic infection control deficiencies and persistent staff shortages. That is why it is also important to ensure that new public investments in nursing homes rates be tied to quality improvements and strong oversight to ensure funds are being used to support staffing, wages and benefits.With the upcoming session fast approaching, Minnesota lawmakers must seize the opportunity to make nursing homes safer and prioritize more options to help seniors stay in their own homes. Seniors need care they can count on. Seniors deserve better.Cathy McLeer is the state director for AARP Minnesota, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization with nearly 664,000 members statewide."
suffolknewsherald_2022_289,"Published 4:52 pm Tuesday, August 23, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:I have called the police department several times in the past about traffic offenses on our street. Namely speeding, driving the wrong way on our one-way street, blocking a fire hydrant, parking in front of a no parking sign and parking in a handicap zone. I have been told, “That on the bottom of the list of traffic laws.”I have been told, “We only have about 20 officers on duty for the entire area.”I have been told, “They are doing more important things and will be there in about 30 minutes to an hour.” And no one ever came. Are you kidding me?There is a female 911 operator with a bad attitude who demonstrates little or no concern or respect for the citizens of her Suffolk community. She needs to be disciplined or demoted as she clearly doesn’t belong in the capacity of dealing with the public.After several calls, I was finally connected to an officer, Lt. Herox. He was very polite, an excellent listener and was able to direct me to the proper department and phone number to call to discuss my concerns — the traffic engineering department.The traffic engineer suggested we needed a petition of signatures of the residents on our street to formally show our concerns. With the overwhelming support and assistance of a neighbor, every single person on our street signed the petition. Every single person.The traffic engineer told me the department would install a road monitor to count traffic and they were considering adding cameras at either end of the street. True to his word, the monitor was installed for a week after I submitted our petition to his department. Have not seen a camera or heard back from his department since then. And the traffic offenses continue.The answer is to install a working camera at either end of Clay Street. It’s about saving lives and preventing property damage. Or is this another case of waiting until the unthinkable happens before money is spent on preventative measures?I have several questions:One — If you are not going to enforce the laws, big or small, then why do we need those same laws?Two — If you have a self-important 911 operator whose idea is, “Oh well, these are small crimes and are not important,” why is she holding that position?These small unimportant crimes lead to more violent and dangerous crimes in the future.Clay Street is two blocks from what is soon to be the epicenter of Suffolk’s cultural entertainment district at West Washington and Saratoga streets. Shouldn’t our street be a safe walk from the Cultural Arts Center to the new venue? If you care about the city’s safety then install the cameras toward that end. The money spent is the people’s tax money.The Clay Street criminals are back. Please let’s work together to stop them. Install the cameras as promised.Please note I am not blaming the police officers on duty for the lack of response to my calls. They cannot do their duty if they are unaware these offenses are being committed. That is the job of a 911 operator, but instead she takes it upon herself to decide what and who is important. Who does she think she is? All crimes are important to those that take the time to call them in.“See something, say something,” we are taught is our civic duty. A little better response from the 911 operator would go a long way in cutting down the number of offenses on our street and the entire city.Daniel RobertsSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_7,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the United States continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation is on the rise, and consumers everywhere are looking to stretch their dollars as far as possible.That’s especially true in fuel markets, where turmoil in Ukraine offers another reminder why U.S. energy security is a pocketbook issue for American families. Fortunately, there are steps we can take to help diversify energy supplies, including the use of newer biofuel blends on offer by select retailers in the state of Minnesota.In fact, the latest state Department of Commerce report shows that Minnesota outpaces every other state – including Iowa – in thesales of higher biofuel blendslike Unleaded 88, containing 15 percent homegrown ethanol. Not only does Unleaded 88 offer greater octane, but it also allows drivers to save an extra15 cents or more per gallon. And while lawmakers in St. Paul cannot control U.S. energy policy, they are actively considering legislation to help make E15 available statewide.Those efforts would not only protect drivers by diversifying our fuel supply, but they could also support significant economic growth in Greater Minnesota, which is home to 19 ethanol plants. Currently,ethanol supportsapproximately 22,810 jobs Minnesota jobs and contributes $6.1 billion annually to our state’s economy.Access to new markets for biofuel blends like E15 would expand that footprint. A recent study fromABF Economicsfound that statewide E15 would add $313 million in GDP to Minnesota’s economy and generate an added $27 million in tax revenues. Wider access to E15 also would greatly benefit our state’s corn farmers, resulting in demand for an additional 43 million bushels of corn annually.At the same time, higher biofuel blends are a great option for motorists looking for a simple, affordable way to help reduce emissions. In fact, recent estimates show that statewide sales of E15 wouldreduce greenhouse emissionsby 332,000 metric tons – equivalent to taking more than 72,600 vehicles off Minnesota roads each year.Due to United States Supreme Court reversing year-round sales of E15/Unl 88, Minnesota retailers cannot even sell E15 from June 1 through Sept. 15. Hoping Governor Tim Walz and members of Congress can assist Minnesota fuel retailers, farmers and consumers this coming summer save money at the pump and sell a homegrown fuel from hometown fuel retailers.Lance Klatt is the executive director of the Minnesota Service Station & Convenience Store Association. He also serves on Gov. Tim Walz’ Council on Biofuels."
suffolknewsherald_2022_266,"Published 6:03 pm Friday, September 16, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardBlue-and-yellow flags have adorned lawns and hung from porches throughout Suffolk since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. Even the Suffolk Visitor Center at Main and Constance got in on the display of solidarity, illuminating its exterior in the Ukrainian national colors.Maybe the staff there knew before the rest of us about some particularly special visitors coming to town in the fall. That time has come. The Kyiv City Ballet will take up residency this week in Suffolk, its only Virginia stop on a 15-city U.S. tour. Suffolk is in heady company on the list of host cities, which include major metropolises Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Minneapolis and New Orleans.City dignitaries will formally welcome the 45 performers and crew members at a reception Monday evening at the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts, kicking off four days of activities. The ballet company will hold an education program for local schoolchildren and two master classes Tuesday, then perform for the public at 7 p.m. Wednesday, a “Tribute to Peace” Ukrainian repertoire, and at 7 p.m. Thursday, the ballet classic “Swan Lake.”Tickets are available at www.SuffolkCenter.org for both performances. They are $25 for students up to age 15 and range from $45 to $65 for adults.“Suffolk is privileged to welcome the members of the world-class Kyiv City Ballet to our beautiful city,” said Mayor Mike Duman. “Our community has watched the events in Ukraine with despair, and now it is our honor to offer a safe respite for these dancers, at least for a few days, while they share their art with us.”The day before Ukraine was invaded by Russia last winter, the Kyiv City Ballet unknowingly took one of the last flights out of Kyiv, traveling to Paris to begin a long-planned tour of France. They have not returned home since as war continues to ravage their homeland.“We are honored to share the beauty of ballet with U.S. audiences, through Ukrainian artists,” said Ivan Kozlov, artistic director of the Kyiv City Ballet. “Touring the States for the first time with a range of ballets makes an important global statement. It demonstrates the resilience of the Ukrainian people.”We commend SCCA for landing a spot on the ballet’s U.S. tour and join many in the community in rolling out the red, or perhaps more fittingly, blue carpet for our special visitors.Laskavo prosymo!On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_26,"I missed you in bed last night. If you had been there I would have shifted as I always do, so that your head could fit on my lap as I type, situating the weight of my arm along the back of your neck so that you know I am there, but not pressing on you too hard. It was a long day of sitting in front of a low-grade tractor beam, pulled a millimeter at a time into the world’s biggest pile of shit, images of infant corpses and burning hospitals juxtaposed with advertisements for PhD programs on foreign continents, mail-order diabetes medication, and discount ammunition, until I’m all the way in it, trying to dig a tunnel to the other side but finding it useless, so I give up.The radiation from the screen burns my eyes so I close them for a moment and pick up a guitar, but I can’t remember any chord changes, or any lyrics, and it doesn’t matter because my hands won’t move. I look down at them and see hundreds of pencil lines drawn in crisscross patterns from my fingertips to my forearms, and as I look closer, I see that they are not lines at all but Gordian worms who, having been seen, begin crawling. I brush them away and realize that I’m exposed, out in an open field, and I know that snipers will pick me off if they catch me in the sun, so I scramble for the nearest house. Inside it smells like shaved wood and industrial cleaners, it’s familiar but I haven’t been there all semester, fuck! I’m going to fail this stupid class, and I didn’t even know I was signed up for it, and so I won’t graduate, and so I won’t get a job, and so I might as well just leave. I empty my locker and get in the car and you are waiting there for me, crouched down in the passenger seat; I mash my forehead into yours and stroke your hair and start the engine. In a few minutes we’re on the highway, a little drunk and driving too fast with all three kids in the backseat, or maybe one was missing. We skid out of control and plow through the guardrail, sailing into the Ohio River.I can get my window open and swim to safety but the rest of you are stuck and I’m trying to figure out how to get to you before the car sinks too deep. Do I have something to cut the seatbelts with? Can I open the back end and pull the little ones out, at least one? How will I explain what happened? But then everything is okay, the children are in their beds and your frame makes its usual cursive ‘m’ under the blanket next to me. I reach for your waist and remember that today is the last day of freedom, that I’m going to prison for a long time, maybe forever, and it’s a misunderstanding but I have to report to the warden with a toothbrush and a book, only one book, so we cry together and we cry with the kids and we cry with everyone we know, and I grab the only book I can take, written in a language I don’t recognize, and the goddamn thing is covered with mud and wasps. I throw it down and run, and now I don’t remember what I’m running after or why, but you are with me, and someone is trying to kill us. We duck down a long corridor and snake through alleys behind mossy brick buildings, taking steps like injured cats, knowing that if we are heard we are dead, because everyone is in on this plot. I begin to wonder if you are even you anymore.Then we crawl into an old warehouse through a broken stained-glass window and we are safe again, forever; the breathing slows, the pulse returns to normal, the blood warms in the veins, it will always be like this. Do you remember any of it? Of course not. I try to tell you we’ve made it, how we fought and survived together, and my teeth fall out. I spit them on the nightstand and check my phone, then put a hand on the baby’s chest to make sure she’s still breathing. She is. Anyway I hope you are home soon, I’ll leave a small light on because it’s very dark and I don’t want you to stumble. •Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor.

leoweekly_2022_9,"“Look for the helpers” is sound advice we have come to rely on in the aftermath of tragedy. The phrase originated from Nancy McFeely Rogers, but her words were later popularized by her son, Fred Rogers, in his book, “Mister Rogers Talks with Parents.”We tell our children to look for the helpers in circumstances that are too complex for them to understand, too difficult for us to explain or, in many cases, both. Kentucky has had more than its fair share of tragic natural disasters in the last few months, from the historic Western Kentucky tornadoes in December 2021 to the record breaking Eastern Kentucky floods in July.Team Kentucky is fortunate to have an abundance of helpers, including the brave heroes from the Kentucky National Guard, Kentucky Emergency Management, Fish and Wildlife and the first responders from across our commonwealth who volunteered their time and resources. But as a new school year begins, Gov. Beshear and I want to focus on one group that deserves our eternal respect and gratitude: Kentucky’s schools. On a regular day, our schools are a lifeline, and teachers are the heartbeat of their communities. In times of tragedy that takes on a whole new meaning. Schools are our safe havens, and the people in them are our helpers.The looks of despair on Kentuckians’ faces after these disasters is something I will never forget, but I found hope in the helpers from our schools. After the tornadoes, as Pennyrile and Kentucky Dam Village state parks filled up with families seeking temporary housing, we found ourselves days away from the holiday season. A group of teachers from Marshall County went door to door collecting Christmas wish lists from the displaced families to ensure that kids who lost everything had something to celebrate.Shortly after the flooding, the governor and I visited Floyd County. One of their schools became a makeshift laundromat where school leaders washed clothes.During my visit, I ran into Floyd County’s superintendent as I was touring the damage; she was personally delivering meals to the homes of her students.Walking into Letcher County High School gave me cold chills. The gym was packed with donations and volunteers. It was busier than a Best Buy on Black Friday. I met Harley, a 2022 Letcher County High School graduate who was about to head off to college. She shared stories of how she and her neighbors formed human chains in rushing water and kayaked to houses to save people who were stranded. Harley graduated high school just six weeks before this. I also met a school group from Ashland, a three-hour drive from Whitesburg, who were packing supplies and working like it was their hometown.While the damage from these events in Western and Eastern Kentucky is unprecedented, the work being done by our educators is not. Our schools opened their doors to serve, and our teachers, as they always do, answered the call.It is undeniably true that there are many long overdue policy and structural changes needed in the teaching profession, like better pay, manageable class sizes and a normal workload. I will continue fighting for those things every day. What our teachers also deserve – outside of legislation and budget improvements – is to have their support reciprocated. A thank you email, a kind word when you see them, an offer to volunteer in their classroom or a positive social media post do not require bold action or cost anything but will make a huge difference to a stressed-out teacher.Team Kentucky, as we begin a new school year, let’s take Mr. Rogers’ advice one step further: Let’s rededicate ourselves to helping the helpers.Jacqueline Coleman is the lieutenant governor of Kentucky. •.

minnpost_2022_24,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The population most vulnerable to climate change is the one with the least ability to stand up for itself: young children.The climate change era is already here: A heat wave in mid-June put more than 125 million Americans under extreme heat alerts, while the driest conditions in over a millennium led to raging wildfires in the Southwest and unprecedented flooding hit Montana.Global warming poses immense threats to early childhood development — so much so that last summer UNICEF declared the climate crisis a “child’s rights crisis.”Yet little attention has been paid within the U.S. to this intersection of climate change and childhood. That’s why the think tank Capita and the Aspen Institute are teaming up to launch the first-ever nationalEarly Years Climate Action Task Force.Climate change is already having enduring impacts on children’s health, development and flourishing. Extreme weather events, longer and more intensive heat waves and climate-related displacement will increasingly be major sources oftoxic stress, which can alter the development of a child’s brain architecture in waysthat are likely to“impair memory, executive function, and decision-making in later life,” according to the American Psychological Association, or APA.Climate change alsothreatens children’s well-beinginother ways, such as by increasing air pollution and the prevalence of new (or resurgent diseases. The damage is not limited to children’s bodies: Climate change-enhanced weather also causesdestruction of their physical care environmentssuch as homes, playgrounds, pediatric clinics and child care programs. A recent study shows that compared with a decade ago, schools in many parts of the country are losing double the number of instructional days to extreme heat.Young children under the age of 8 are uniquely at risk, as their developing bodies and brains take these blowsespecially hard. For instance, young children breathe in and out at a much higher rate than teens or adults, and due to their small stature inhale air closer to the ground, where pollution concentrates. Similarly, young bodies are made up of a higher percentage of water, and they have higher metabolic rates, meaning thatthey can dehydratemuch faster.And, in terms of mental health,according to the APA, “after climate events, children typically demonstrate more severe distress than adults.” Eco-anxiety isalready on the riseamong teens, while today’s and tomorrow’s young children will be contending with the climate crisis long after older generations have passed on.All of these impacts can negatively influence academic performance, health, relationship formation and other long-term life outcomes.So where do we go from here?The early childhood movement must contend with climate change; the climate movement can advance its goals by centering young children and their parents — a largely untapped constituency. We can and should do more at this intersection, whether it’s by ensuring child care programs have clean and efficient air-conditioning and air-filtration systems that run on renewable energy, by offering age-appropriateclimate educationfor young children and their families or by establishing public policies (such as Wales’ Well-Being of Future Generations Act that account for climate change impacts on children.This is also where theEarly Years Climate Action Task Force— made up of policymakers and parents, leaders in the early childhood and climate movements, academics and pediatricians — can potentially make a difference. Its charge is to recommend a concrete action plan by the middle of next year that can be implemented and adapted by the early years sector, the climate sector and the nation as a whole.Inspired by the catalytic work of Aspen’sK12 Climate Actioncommission, the task force will hold a series of listening sessions with content-area experts and people who have already experienced major climate change effects. They will focus on communities disproportionately impacted by climate change, including areas with high populations of Indigenous, Black, and/or Latino individuals; rural and urban communities with high populations of low-income families; and communities in geographies particularly vulnerable to climate change.In the end, the impact of all efforts to improve early childhood health, development, learning and well-being face a ceiling if we don’t address climate change. As the futurist Alex Steffenputs it, “the planetary crisis is not an issue, but an era.”It is time for the nation to reckon with the impacts of this new normal on its youngest residents.Elliot Haspel is an early childhood policy expert who serves as senior adviser to the Early Years Climate Action Task Force.

minnpost_2022_120,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The article,“Housing advocates want lawmakers to restart and replenish Minnesota’s halted rental assistance program. That’s gonna be a tough sell”called attention to the need to fund programs that address the homelessness crisis here in Minnesota. Sen. Rich Draheim (R-Madison Lake questioned the effectiveness of existing housing stability programs saying, “What are we doing with the hundreds of millions in housing stability programs that we already have? That means our existing programs are failing. We need to unpack those. Why aren’t the existing programs working?” The problem isn’t that programs are failing; it’s that they are underfunded and don’t meet the scale of the challenges that exist in Minnesota.The Emergency Services Program (ESP , which is the best and most flexible source of funding to provide services to people experiencing homelessness, is a prime example of this gross underfunding. Since its creation in 1997, the Emergency Services Program has only received moderate increases and never at the scale to meet the need. In 2014, $844,000 per year was allocated to address homelessness for the entire state. Through our advocacy in 2021, a funding boost of $12 million dollars was approved per two-year period. With this increased funding, Minnesota only allocates $137 per child, youth, adult or senior experiencing homelessness for shelter and services per year. Knowing that 50,000 Minnesotans experience homelessness in a given year, we are calling on the legislature to approve $95 million so homeless service providers can hire the staff and provide the services needed to support individuals and families on their journey to find a home. The pandemic relief dollars that have provided a financial lifeline to organizations across the state are exhausted; homeless service providers are now facing a funding cliff that will drastically impact thousands of individuals and families seeking shelter and support.The second challenge is a lack of shelter spaces so children, youth, adults and seniors have safety and dignity as they seek a permanent home. With 20,000 individuals experiencing homelessness on any given night, 80 of Minnesota’s 87 counties lack enough shelter to meet this need. This is due, in part, to a lack of state investment in shelter infrastructure. Recently, the Department of Human Services received $15 million in shelter capital funding to prevent the spread of infectious diseases; this is the first time Minnesota has developed a program to distribute funding to support capital needs of shelters. The Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless completed a detailed Shelter Capital Needs Assessment and identified $114 million in capital requests to preserve the shelters we have and to expand the number of shelter beds that so many communities are hoping to create. This investment would preserve or create 50 shelter projects; more than half of the projects in Greater Minnesota. Fully funding these projects is crucial if we are going to end unsheltered homelessness.Julie Jeppson, executive director of Stepping Stone Emergency Housing told the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless, “These organizations and service providers are walking alongside clients as they make great strides in their journey to find a home. The programs themselves are successful, and the funding made available to these programs makes a difference – but these funds can only help a finite number of people. As the amount of funding made available remains the same, the number of people experiencing homelessness is increasing, creating the perception that communities and organizations are less impactful. In reality, we remain incredibly impactful, saving lives through shelter. The problem is that there are many more lives to save than ever before.”In questioning the effectiveness of these existing programs, Senator Draheim spotlighted one of the most important issues we face in addressing homelessness: that the funding simply doesn’t match the need. Until we have enough homes for everyone, funding for shelter and services that provide safety, dignity, and support for children, families, and seniors experiencing homelessness is essential.Mayor Emily Larson of Duluth told the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless, “Investing in housing is investing in our future. If you feel it’s important for your children and family to have a place to call home, don’t you think that’s something other children and families could benefit from as well? Communities are just plain better when every single resident has access to safe and affordable housing. That’s how sharing a community and city and state works.”Targeting the state’s resources to address homelessness and preserve/create homes should be a top priority for lawmakers this legislative session. Minnesota has fallen behind in its goal to create 300,000 new homes by 2030. The state has the opportunity to meet this challenge and provide the funding and resources that will allow local providers to find creative, flexible solutions that fully address homelessness and housing instability.Shelter saves lives and housing ends homelessness. There is no excuse for children, youth, families, and seniors to be homeless with a $9 billion surplus.Rhonda Otteson is executive director for the MN Coalition for the Homeless,Julie Jeppson is the executive director for Stepping Stone Emergency Housing (Anoka andMayor Emily Larson is the mayor of Duluth."

eugeneweekly_2022_22,"We ve got issues. I’ve taught college for almost 30 years. Over the past decade and a half, I’ve averaged a teaching award every three years. Next year I’m teaching in Japan on a Fulbright. I’ve embraced higher education up close, and I wish more people didn’t struggle under a gross misunderstanding about it. Given how essential higher education is to the culture and economy of Eugene, I want to confront that misunderstanding. There’s no such thing as a superfood. Spinach won’t turn you into Popeye. Multivitamins give gullible Americans the world’s most expensive urine. A name brand college doesn’t guarantee career success, and neither does a highly touted major. The misunderstanding is a polarized pair of wrong views of college. The first is that college is all about the job search Monday after graduation. A lot of worried parents arm-twist daughters and sons to pick a major they expect to turn into a lucrative job. They imagine graduates with those degrees find high paying work while everyone else bounces between unemployment and barista jobs. But that’s dead wrong. Traditional undergraduates enter a working life that can span five decades. Hot majors cool off. Industries are scrambled by technological breakthroughs. Even graduates with one of the supposed golden tickets have to brace for the arrival of the following years’ graduates who have the latest advances baked into their degrees. There’s a reason many such workers transition, between ages 25 and 40, into jobs that no longer use their degree. Graduates whose majors weren’t built around newly invented skills are more likely to grow and mature in their work, instead of frantically trying to outrun the cutting edge of innovation. Google David Deming’s work on the subject if you want a closer look at data backing up what I say. Don’t get me wrong: sometimes an in-demand major fits your interests or your life’s plans. If so, it’s the right choice. The blunder is choosing it as a sedative for your phobia of poverty. If someone you knew decided to get married just for a swinging party with flattering photos and a wild wedding night, you’d expect to see them in a divorce lawyer’s office right away. If they don’t approach marriage with the long term in mind, they predictably land in what the Holmes-Rahe stress inventory scores as the second most painful experience of all. Aiming college at landing a first job, instead of a career, is the same mistake, equally reckless and destructive. It’s long past time we collectively dump it on the trash heap of abandoned dumb ideas. The mirror image of misunderstanding higher education is writing off college altogether. If it doesn’t guarantee you a high paying job, what’s the point? When you get hungry, if you can’t have açaí berries or spirulina, then you may as well grab Cheetos or a Big Mac, right? A healthy diet is not a black-and-white choice between junk science and junk food; there are plenty of good options that contribute part of a broad, diverse foundation for health. Similarly, there are a lot of good opportunities in college that contribute part of a broad, diverse set of growth experiences that strengthen the foundation for adult life. One population of students, I think, gets this: older students returning to school. The ones I’ve seen pick a major, sometimes self-designed, that builds tools that apply to a lot of problems, not a dress rehearsal for one job that might or might not be the right fit, might or might not stay in demand, or even in existence. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that they’re also at the age where they clean up old eating habits and think about having a healthy diet, not just a healthy ingredient. Just this week, my old boss retired, and my new boss asked a powerful question in his first meeting with all of us: “It’s not primarily what are you going to do with your degree, but what is your degree going to do to you?” I know the cost of college is out of control. Believe me when I say the obscene tuition is not lining my pockets. But the cost of healthcare is also out of control, and that doesn’t change the fact that superfood claims are junk science. Misguided is misguided, dumb is dumb, and colleges are not vending machines for dream jobs. They’re gymnasiums for thinking and decision skills. Stop brutally simplifying what we do and we can offer you something that can help in every area of your life. Doyle Srader lives in Eugene.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_53,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Approaching year three of a global pandemic, it’s shocking that the U.S. is still debating whether workers should be allowed to take time off work when they’re sick or need to see a doctor.Yet sick leave has been at the heart of the threatened railroad worker strike. Railroad companies and a dozen railroad employee unions were at loggerheads for months; the main sticking point, particularly for the conductors and engineers who operate the trains, was the lack of guaranteed sick days so workers could take time off when they are ill, have medical appointments or family emergencies without being punished.Congress last Thursday voted to block the strike by imposing a labor agreement on the railroads and unions that includes pay hikes but no paid sick days. The Senate couldn’t muster enough votes to include seven paid sick days in the new agreement, as the House had done, meaning workers will continue to have to show up when they are ill or face disciplinary action.This was a missed opportunity for the Biden administration and lawmakers to codify what should be a commonsense policy — American workers deserve guaranteed paid sick days. Pay hikes are not a substitute for paid leave. After more than two years of a pandemic, it should be clear that allowing workers to take time off when they are ill is not just a worker benefit — it’s a public health protection.Railroad workers do not have guaranteed paid sick days. They can take vacation days for personal business including medical appointments, but union leaders have complained that those days must be approved far in advance and can be denied. If workers suddenly become ill or need to see a doctor quickly, they can face disciplinary action for taking time off, according to the unions.In September, the Biden administration helped negotiate a tentative contract between the railroads and the unions that included a 24% pay increase. Four of the 12 unions rejected the deal because it did not include paid sick days or address scheduling. The unions had planned to strike Dec. 9.Afraid that a railroad strike could upend the already fragile U.S. economy and send consumer prices even higher, Biden urged Congress to use its power under the 1926 Railway Labor Act to block the strike. (The act gives Congress the authority to intervene in rail labor disputes that threaten to disrupt interstate commerce. And that’s what has happened last week.Some lawmakers opposed intervening in a labor dispute, even though Congress has done it 18 times over the last century. Others said adding paid sick days would reward the workers who voted against the tentative contract, “gambling that they would secure a better deal from Congress.”The railroad companies were able to gamble too. The companies had less incentive to offer paid sick leave or make adjustments to their profitable, punishing scheduling systems knowing that Congress would probably intervene to block the strike and impose the tentative contract to avoid broader economic harm. Biden too made a calculated decision to prioritize avoiding a strike.“Now, within this agreement, we’re gonna avoid the rail strike, keep the rails running, keep things moving, and we’re gonna go back and we’re gonna get paid leave — not just for rail workers, but for all workers,” Biden said Thursday.That’s far easier said than done, as we saw this week.— Los Angeles Times"
leoweekly_2022_71,"Despite human trafficking being an often-discussed crime, it still remains a global epidemic, generating an estimated $150 billion worldwide per year, according to a 2021 U.S. State Department report. The Commonwealth has its share of cases, with one of the latest arrests happening in Bowling Green on Aug. 11, after authorities said a man and a woman forced another woman into engaging in sexual activities with several men.Local experts state that understanding not only the warning signs of human trafficking but also the root causes of trafficking in Kentucky is the foundation needed to properly fight this prevalent crime.Saiyed also notes the connection between trafficking and the opioid crisis.“Data collected by the Cabinet of Health and Family Services shows that in larger cities like Lexington and Louisville, trafficking tends to be coordinated by a pimp or organized gangs,” she says. “In the rural parts of the state, however, trafficking is often a form of currency in the opioid crisis. If mom or dad has a drug problem, they can’t pay off their debt, and they have a child they can trade for a couple of hours, that becomes a way for them to fuel for their habit.”Understanding the misconceptions about trafficking in Kentucky is equally important in maintaining focus. Amy Nace-DeGonda is a 12-year anti-trafficking professional and serves as the assistant program director for Catholic Charities of Louisville’s Bakhita Empowerment Initiative, which provides direct services to survivors of trafficking. She says: “People put a lot of emphasis on major events that attract tourists and out of town guests, but there is nowhere in the data that actually specifies that trafficking increases at those events. A University of Louisville study revealed that the promotion of commercial sex in places like Backpage increases during big events, but there is nowhere in the data to show that it’s trafficking.”Nace-DeGonda also points to warning signs that serve as the overall foundation of the trafficking problem. “When we are talking about root causes, we’re talking about homelessness, racial inequity, poverty; things that make people vulnerable that traffickers are using to exploit,” she says. “The community at large wants to eradicate trafficking, but you are not going to end anything until you are addressing what is the root cause of it happening.”Nace-DeGonda also recommends utilizing the hotline rather than engaging in direct intervention: “Don’t ever approach someone you suspect of being trafficked because A they may not be being trafficked, B you may be putting yourself in danger, or C you may be putting them in greater danger if they are in fact a victim,” she says.Instead, she stresses the utilization of the hotline, which can dispatch the appropriate professionals to a suspected situation.Beyond reporting, bystander intervention to trafficking must also include working to disrupt poverty, homelessness and racial inequity from an advocacy standpoint. As Nace-DeGonda says, “If you really want to help, you must focus on the root of the problem. Because if we don’t attack trafficking at its root, then it will never go away.” •If you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888.James Wilkerson is a writer and speaker on the topics of sexual misconduct, masculinity, and DEI issues..

suffolknewsherald_2022_78,"Published 6:15 pm Tuesday, May 24, 2022ByStaff ReportsThe alarm bells will be muted — even ignored — thanks to bitter partisan division over public education, but a report last week by the state Department of Education should be a wakeup call for all Virginians.Stakeholders of all political persuasions should put aside, at least for a moment, arguments about Critical Race Theory, face masks and other hot-button emotional debates and focus squarely on the report’s findings:State Superintendent of Education- Jillian Balow said the report should create a “sense of urgency and importance for all of us.”We agree.The report noted that, despite statistically significant declines in the reading performance of Virginia students on 2019 national and state assessments, the state Board of Education in 2020 lowered the proficiency standard on Standards of Learning reading tests for all grades. The Board of Education’s Standards of Accreditation now de-emphasize grade-level proficiency in reading and math, masking wide achievement gaps, especially for Black and Hispanic students, whose test scores lag white students’ scores even more than before the standards were relaxed, creating what the report calls an “honesty gap.”The report also found that 38% of Virginia fourth graders and 33% of eighth graders were proficient in reading on a 2019 national assessment, compared to 75% and 76%, respectively, on the 2019 state SOL reading tests. Some 71% of Black fourth graders demonstrated proficiency on the 2019 math SOL compared to 26% on the national test. For Hispanics, the gap was 77% on the SOL compared to 36% on the national test.The report added that 45% of Virginia public high school seniors in 2019, including 76% of Black and 56% of Hispanic seniors, were not college-ready in math on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.It’s time to pause the partisan bickering, commit to higher standards for public schools and, more important, identify and fund the tools needed to meet those standards. That includes paying salaries that attract and retain the best and brightest teachers, creating safe classrooms where discipline is enforced, and empowering those teachers to impart important knowledge free of bureaucratic restraints.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_73,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .This past Christmas Eve, after putting my kids to bed, I was able to sneak away to attend midnight mass at St. Mary’s Basilica in Minneapolis. While it has been years since I have been an observant Catholic, the ritual of Catholic mass is still comforting and provides an opportunity to reflect on how being raised in the Catholic faith has shaped who I am and my work as an immigration attorney and professor.For fellow Catholics, the Christmas season includes a number of faith-based traditions and biblical stories of the Holy Family. While most know the story of the nativity and the Epiphany visit of the Three Wise Men, one lesser known story is the Holy Family’s flight to Egypt. According to the Gospel of Matthew, shortly after the visit from the Three Magi, Joseph is warned by an angel in a dream to flee with Mary and the Baby Jesus to Egypt to escape King Herod’s order to kill all male babies in Bethlehem, known as the Massacre of the Innocents. Reflecting as an adult and immigration attorney on this story that I first learned in childhood, one fact is clear: Joseph, Mary and Baby Jesus were refugees seeking asylum in Egypt.While the Holy Family was allowed to seek safety and refuge in Egypt, the same cannot be said for refugees seeking asylum on our southern border. Indeed, the past five years have been marked by a pervasive attack chipping away at the right to seek asylum in the U.S. Under the Trump administration, these measures included things as horrific as separating parents from their children to serve as a deterrent to asylum seekers, to banal regulatory changes making it more difficult to qualify for asylum.In December 2018, I saw another policy firsthand while serving as an attorney volunteer for the organization Al Otro Lado in Tijuana, Mexico. Under “metering,” the U.S. government limited the number of individuals allowed to present themselves at a port of entry each day to request asylum. During my time in Tijuana, the U.S. government accepted and processed only 40 asylum seekers per day at the San Ysidro Port of Entry. For context, San Ysidro is the busiest land port in the U.S., processing 100,000 people into the U.S. each day, so claims it could not process more than 40 asylum seekers per day clearly defied credulity.Sadly, the metering policy was only the tip of the iceberg. In January 2019, the Trump administration began the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP Program, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” which required certain asylum seekers to wait out the asylum process outside of the U.S. and attend hearings in makeshift tent courts near the border. Asylum seekers placed in MPP faced horrific conditions in makeshift refugee camps in northern Mexico, where they were subjected to kidnapping, extortion, sexual assault and other violence at the hands of local cartels. Additionally, most in MPP had to prepare their asylum claim without the help of a lawyer, making it almost impossible for them to win their case.On March 20, 2020, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the situation worsened when the Trump administration implemented the Title 42 Policy, effectively closing the border to asylum seekers. Under this policy, justified by public health law in Title 42 of the U.S. Code, all individuals appearing at ports of entry to request asylum or apprehended after crossing the border were summarily expelled to Mexico or their home country. Since implementation of Title 42, public health experts have decried the practice, noting that there is no evidence that expelling migrants is mitigating the spread of COVID-19 within the U.S.However, this hope soon turned to frustration as the Biden administration kept Title 42 in place for all, save for unaccompanied minors. In December 2021, in compliance with a court order, the Biden administration also restarted MPP and expanded the program to include Haitians. While Biden’s critics have attempted to claim he is for “open borders,” the reality is that the border remains effectively closed to asylum seekers under Biden, just as it was under Trump.Our country’s failure to accept and process the claims of asylum seekers is both a violation of our treaty obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol and our moral obligation to protect those seeking safety. As we begin a new year and celebrate the feast of Epiphany this week, I hope that Biden will make good on his campaign promise to restore the asylum system, while also honoring the words of Christ to which he often refers: “whatsoever you do to the least of my people, you do unto me.”Ana Pottratz Acosta is an associate professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, where she specializes in immigration law."
suffolknewsherald_2022_163,"Published 5:52 pm Tuesday, February 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonDecades ago when I was growing up, it was always a special day. Mostly, the valentines were nice, good wishes expressing love. It seems the world never changes. It wasn’t the lack of information about this special day, the only one in 365 to tell us a better way to live is by showing love. Retailers made sure of that, plenty of valentine cards, candy and chocolates.It was the media filling the air waves with the bad news about the possibility of war. I wanted a reprieve. Along with that, all eyes were on the Super Bowl.And now I have a confession. It was not the super bowl nor the media which kept my Valentine’s Day article out of the Suffolk News-Herald. I wrote, but like all the elderly (and sometimes the young I forgot to send it. It was left in drafts — perfect proof of how we can miss the mark, even with good intentions.I am writing now to extend thanks to this paper and to Tracy Agnew for her work — and I think that is tied to love — for keeping this paper going as editor these past few years I have known of it. As she leaves, I hope the next editor comes soon, because the News-Herald is one of those legacies we have because of someone’s faithfulness. Both writing and reading are so important for a civilized society.Now about those red valentines: It seems to me we needed them more than ever this year, because they use a word we all need to hear — love. For so long, we have been dealt Covid news, stats and “to mask or not to mask.” It has made friends become enemies. Most of us were weary and wanted to move on when we discovered the next chapter in the book seemed to be worse — that possibility of war! What kind of world is facing the youth and children of our day, and who has created it? As a student and lover of biblical truths, I know the answer to that question. We have done it to ourselves.There are only two kingdoms that rule in this world. One is the Kingdom of Light and the other is the Kingdom of darkness. Call them each by a four-letter word, Love and Hate. We choose and live in one of those. The Kingdom of Light is Love and is controlled by God, the Kingdom of Darkness is a kingdom of Hate, ruled by His enemy. It has been so since the beginning of time. We make choices and live by those choices. When the choices we made do not work out, we begin to blame something or someone else. Our personal worlds become shattered. Sadly, things shattered cannot be put back together, so is there no hope?Thankfully, there is. We can have the privilege of a new life in Christ. Romans 3:23 tells us we are all sinners. No one is excluded. Romans 6:23 tells us a penalty has to be paid for sin. It has been that way from the beginning of time. John 3:16 tells us of a very loving God — omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent — Who accepts us on His terms, confession of sin and our need of help.The apostle John has added, “Herein is love, not that we loved God but that He loved us and has given Himself for us.”Another biblical writer wrote, “Let love be without dissimulation; abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.” We can do that only when we allow God to rule our lives. Let’s continue the tradition of love, even without it being called Valentine’s Day. We are in desperate need to change our ways from the ugliness we hear every day. No one can really live with those harsh and angry words.Myrtle Thompson is the writer and author of a book about her life as a Christian in three foreign countries.

eugeneweekly_2022_4,"We ve got issues. The coming midterm elections are trending toward a nightmare that could take many of us by surprise. Nationally, a slew of candidates energized and emboldened by our recent sociopolitical and economic fracturing — Trumpies, QAnon devotees, election deniers, anti-vaxxers, Jan. 6 “patriots,” anti-immigration xenophobes, anti-abortion evangelicals — are on the ticket. They could be ushered into office on a frothy wave of support by (as Hillary Clinton so cynically labeled them that “basket of deplorables” legitimately pissed about years of Democratic weak sauce. Four-plus years of Donald Trump, a lifelong cheat whose final pyramid scheme was playing the long con on the nation itself, provided the kindling, leveling our politics to a nihilistic rubble of falsity, bravado and raw aggression; the current slew of candidates is the spark that finally could set the whole thing ablaze. Homey, handsome and freshly scrubbed, Oregon 4th District congressional candidate Alek Skarlatos is the smiling face of this Republican revolution (or, rather, counter-revolution : He presents as a classic Oregon “libertarian,” the sort of toothsome good Christian who hunts, fishes, backs the blue, hates “socialists” and wants to make America great again (i.e., straight, white, Christian, armed and angry . Skarlatos has hitched his wagon, albeit loosely, to Trumpism. He is the Forest Gump of white nationalism; he’s been seen with or has ties to the Proud Boys, Patriot Prayer, anti-environmental Timber Unity, the moribund Tea Party and QAnon, to name a few coalitions, and he’s garnered the support of such far-right Republican extremists as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican Whip Steve Scalise. Considering his past comments, as well as who he hangs out with, who he’s identified with and the support he’s garnered, we can make some broad assertions about Skarlatos’ political leanings: unconditionally anti-abortion, anti-organized labor (he’s a right-to-work guy , anti-federal minimum wage (which he once said he supports abolishing , anti-taxation, wildly pro-gun (no assault ban , anti-public education (he’s proposed abolishing the Department of Education , pro-military (he served in Afghanistan , anti-economic and environmental regulations, and, therefore, vehemently free-market capitalism. Related to such concrete policy points, Skarlatos has also expressed support for the rioters who “stormed the Capitol” on Jan. 6, and — in keeping with his “one-hundred percent” support of Trump — he’s also aligned himself with the Big Lie crowd that denies the legitimacy of the last presidential election. For anyone with a nominal understanding of actual fascism, a disturbing portrait begins to emerge when the past and present of Skarlatos are taken as a whole. Too many boxes are checked: suppression of labor power, protection of corporate power, supremacy of the military, a dismissal of education and teachers unions, an association with aggressive (white nationalism, dismissing legitimate elections, an overweening obsession with crime and “safety” in the form of unlimited support and funding of law enforcement, and a concomitant obsession with demonizing the banal left as “extremists,” etc., etc. You don’t need to be a “fascist” to be a fascist. It is simply the organic unleashing of the worst instincts of the economic system itself — as Trump, a farcical reiteration of Mussolini, proved over and over. The social bigotries of fascism are no less catastrophic for being secondary to its primary aim, which is the complete deregulation of the economy. It equates political power with corporate power, and it does that by tapping the fears and resentments of those who will be most screwed by its brutal functioning. The scapegoat, whether drag queens or trans kids or immigrants or the homeless, is essential to the fascist agenda; it cannot function without targeting an oppressed or outsider segment of the population; whether real or imagined doesn’t matter. But let’s avoid the dreaded “F” word. Let’s call Skarlatos’ platform one of corporate feudalism — the calculated elevation of the free market to a kind of religious ecstasy, disguised as a return to the Wild West of capitalism before unions, environmentalists, feminists, liberals, intellectuals and “socialist” politicians started gumming up the works. It’s an appealing message, especially to a working and middle class currently mired in economic anxiety and dread. The Democrats, of course, have failed to directly attack Skarlatos on economic issues where they stand just as guilty. In fact, considering the abiding failures of the Democratic Party — its bowing to corporate lobbying, its abandonment of the working class, its bailing out of big banks and cozying up to globalist trade policies — a nativist candidate like Skarlatos is to a significant degree their creation, a pure product of the great American selling-out of us all. Skarlatos, in other words, is a pure product of our broken politics. He is a symptom of the times, as well as a harkening to the worst catastrophes of the 20th century, when the politics of resentment mobilized the disenfranchised masses to throw their support behind charming psychopaths who pushed a vicious, insipid form of social Darwinism, where only the strong (and white, straight, armed and angry survive — to hell with the rest. Unless you are uber-rich, a business owner or high-level military, a vote for Skarlatos is a vote for your own undoing. Steve Lafreniere helped with research for this opinion piece.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_90,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°As the demise of the FTX crypto empire unfolds — on Twitter, in bankruptcy proceedings, in congressional hearings and potentially in criminal court — lawmakers and regulators are grappling with a question: What, if anything, should they do to civilize a market so rife with abuse?A few simple fixes should suffice.For all the grief it might have given individual investors, the FTX debacle has also had benefits. It exposed the flaws of a market that never had much to do with the underlying blockchain technology. It helped deflate the crypto bubble and eliminate some of the riskiest participants. It also vindicated officials who saw peril in the speculative frenzy surrounding virtual tokens with no intrinsic value.Regulators might be tempted to sit back and hope the crypto market will simply burn out, putting an end to the whole bizarre episode. That would be wishful thinking. All cryptocurrencies outstanding still have a notional value of about $850 billion, and daily trading remains in the tens of billions of dollars. Officials need to act on the lessons of 2022’s fiascos — from the collapse of the Terra stablecoin to FTX — to ensure that renewed speculation never threatens the broader financial system.Three steps in particular would help.As a start: Make stablecoins stable. Much like money-market mutual funds, stablecoins purport to maintain a constant value in fiat currency, typically $1. Yet they’re often backed by assets ranging from short-term corporate debt to nothing at all. This makes them highly vulnerable to panic withdrawals — which, if they entail sales of assets in the real world, could disrupt the credit companies need to fund their everyday operations. The solution: Bank regulators can create a limited charter for stablecoin issuers, requiring that any representations of dollars be backed by real dollars deposited at the Federal Reserve. This would ensure stability while leaving issuers to compete on the quality of their technology, which could yet prove useful in making payments cheaper and faster, particularly across borders.Next, rein in exchanges. FTX’s competitors, such as Coinbase Global Inc. and Binance Holdings Ltd., still don’t face the requirements on safety, soundness or segregation of funds that traditional exchanges do. This leaves them free to put customers at risk, including through proprietary trading and extreme leverage. There’s no need to wait for Congress to determine which regulators should be in charge, or to define digital tokens as securities, commodities or something else. Instead, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should cooperate to set up an industry-funded overseer — along the lines of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority — that would ensure crypto intermediaries meet the same standards as their traditional counterparts.Finally, maintain a firewall. Financial regulators have so far done a good job of keeping crypto out of traditional banks, which is one reason FTX’s downfall didn’t have broader repercussions. Whether or not they go on to adopt specific rules, they should remain vigilant, to prevent systemically important financial institutions — including nonbanks — from getting too exposed. Digital tokens may eventually have utility as representations of valuable things, but on their own they have none of the real-world uses or cash flows of assets such as commodities, stocks and bonds.

suffolknewsherald_2022_54,"Published 12:03 pm Wednesday, June 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsToday we hand over this space to Dean Ridings, CEO of the America’s Newspapers trade organization, for an important message on a timely opportunity to improve the health of community media across the country.Congress has an opportunity to pass legislation that benefits all local citizens, businesses and even protects our democracy. The Local Journalism Sustainability Act, LJSA for short, should be included as part of any upcoming reconciliation bill that Congress is considering. The LJSA is a well-thought-out bill that would provide needed support to local news organizations, including local newspapers, to ensure their viability as they continue to make progress toward a digital future.Many members of Congress have seen what happens when a newspaper closes in their district, and they see the impact it has on the community. That is why many of our leaders, including Senators Cantwell, Schumer, Manchin, Wyden and others, have stepped up in support of the LJSA. And while others in Congress may not have signed on as co-sponsors of the bill yet, many recognize the importance and the need to maintain strong local news organizations in their communities.To understand what the LJSA is, it is important to understand what it is not. This is a temporary measure to help newspapers at this critical time, and it sunsets after five years. The LJSA won’t help national news organizations, but it will support local news organizations and help them invest in their newsrooms in order to continue to cover the issues that impact local cities and towns. The result is a bill that provides a bridge for local newspapers as they continue to evolve their business models.So why is it so critical for Congress to pass the LJSA now? Quite simply, the future of local newspapers in many areas of the country hangs in the balance. In the past 15 years, more than a quarter of all newspapers have disappeared, and many more have been forced to make staff reductions that have diminished the coverage of topics that impact local citizens. The way people get their information and advertise their local businesses is quickly moving to digital, and local newspapers continue to be impacted by the Big Tech companies that use their original content without fair compensation. To make matters worse, newspapers, like many other industries, were financially impacted by the pandemic, even though the coverage provided by local newspapers was more vital than ever.The current economic challenges have only hastened the need for Congress to act on the LJSA quickly. As inflation is impacting everyone, it has made the environment for local newspapers even more challenging. The cost of retaining employees has gone up. The cost of newsprint has increased 30% over last year, and the cost of gas used to deliver the newspaper is up more than 50% in the past two years. Many newspaper carriers drive hundreds and even thousands of miles each week. These increases have driven many local newspapers closer to making further reductions or even ceasing operations.Who wins with the passage of the Local Journalism Sustainability Act? Clearly, local newspapers win by obtaining the support needed to continue their investments in reporting on local news. But the real winners are the communities that keep their local newspaper. From watching the actions of local government, reporting on the state of local schools, tracking local health trends or providing the latest restaurant reviews and sales information, local newspapers keep a community connected and informed.We encourage everyone to reach out to their representatives in Congress and ask them to support local journalism. Whether it is inclusion of the LJSA in the budget reconciliation bill, or a stand-alone bill, the time for action is now. It’s a rare opportunity for government to act on something that benefits us all.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_134,"Published 6:40 pm Tuesday, March 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Steve HanerThe elections of a Republican Virginia governor and a new Republican majority in the House of Delegates have not changed Virginia’s status as one of the greenest of Green New Deal states in the country. Every effort to reverse the course set during the previous period of Democratic hegemony has failed at the 2022 General Assembly.The massive construction plans for ratepayer-funded solar, wind and battery facilities dictated by the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act remain on track. A bill to repeal VCEA failed in the majority-Democratic Virginia Senate. So did a simpler bill that merely restored the ability of the State Corporation Commission to review those construction plans for prudence, reasonableness and cost.If California moves to ban the sales of new internal combustion engine cars and other vehicles starting with the 2035 model year, as expected, Virginia is still positioned to automatically follow suit. Until then, a growing percentage of all new car sales must be electric starting in 2025. A bill to revisit that 2021 legislation, and do a proper regulatory adoption process, also died in the Senate.Legislative efforts to remove Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative regional compact all failed. A regulatory reversal may still be possible without legislation, but in the meantime the carbon tax remains on every Dominion Energy Virginia bill and works its way into everything touched by electricity costs.In these waning hours of the regular session, a bill to protect the use of natural gas from local restrictions or prohibitions is struggling in a conference committee. If it fails or passes without teeth, local governments that operate natural gas utilities (such as the City of Richmond can proceed to close them or restrict new connections. Other localities can use building codes or other regulations to do the same to private natural gas suppliers. The state’s largest and one of its more Democratic localities, Fairfax County, has plans to discourage gas already adopted. It and Richmond won’t be alone.Within the General Assembly, the partisan divide on this debate is nearly total. The bill to protect natural gas did receive two Democratic votes in the House. Some Senate Democrats voted to restore State Corporation Commission oversight on the reasonableness, prudence and cost of renewable energy generation that is expected to add hundreds if not thousands of dollars to annual electric bills.But that bill, House Bill 73, did not even receive total Republican support. It failed in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee 9-5, with four Democrats and only one Republican voting to keep it alive. One Republican, Senator Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, voted to kill it. Senate Minority Leader Thomas Norment, R-James City County, failed to vote.The same pair had weeks before voted to kill a similar effort at restoring SCC authority over these projects, that bill coming from one of their Senate Republican colleagues.Through the session the steadfast position of the House Republicans with lukewarm support from key Senate colleagues has been joined by mostly silence from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has only sought to repeal the RGGI carbon tax. The offshore wind and solar bonanza of VCEA, the demands to buy electric cars and covert our homes to all-electric, those will cost average Virginians far more than will RGGI.Whether they know it or like it, Virginians remain firmly in the grip of those who think fossil fuels are dangerous and must be rapidly retired. We currently depend on those fuels heavily, they are abundant within U.S. borders and national waters, they have delivered reliable economic prosperity, yet they must disappear from Virginia’s future. Replacing them with intermittent and unreliable electricity will be expensive and risky.The mainstream media outlets filled with daily climate disaster claims are silent on the costs or risks of the energy conversions they tout. Abundant evidence that the climate catastrophe narrative is false on some points and debatable on others never makes the local paper or nightly news.The physics behind our climate remains a controversial mystery. Inertia is something all can understand.Steve Haner is a senior fellow with the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy.

philinquirer_2022_26,"I agree with the growing consensus that we should mark the anniversary of the Adoption and Safe Families Act by repealing this harmful, discriminatory law for good.Although the trauma caused by family separation at the U.S.-Mexico border has received widespread attention and outrage, far less attention is paid to the family separation that occurs daily throughout this country.Every two minutesin the United States, a child is removed from their family and placed in foster care. Just think about that for a moment — by the time you finish reading this op-ed, another child will have been taken from their family.“By the time you finish reading this op-ed, another child will have been taken from their family.”Less thanhalf of all children taken are ever reunited with a parent. So it should be no surprise that, for many people and communities, the child welfare system is widely regarded as a tool of family destruction.This is a particular problem in Philadelphia, where children areremoved more frequently than the national average, and at more thandouble the rate of big cities such as New York or Chicago. Family separation hits certain communities harder — for instance, Black children are 13% of the population in Pennsylvania but26% of the commonwealth’s foster care population.The driving force behind the child welfare system — often called the family policing system or family surveillance system — is theAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. Nov. 19 marks the 25th anniversary of this federal law, presenting an opportunity for deep reflection and critical action to combat the damage caused.I agree with thegrowingconsensusthat we should mark the anniversary of the Adoption and Safe Families Act by repealing this harmful, discriminatory law for good.Hailed at its signing by then-President Bill Clinton as a way to ensure children werenot trapped in foster care forever, the Adoption and Safe Families Act encourages children in foster care to be permanently adopted by cutting kids’ ties to their biological families. Specifically, the act mandates that states must terminate parents’ rights if a family cannot reunify within requisite timelines, usually 15 months (as it is in Pennsylvania , unless certain exceptions are present. When parental rights are terminated, children lose not only their parents, but also their biological siblings, grandparents, and extended family. Too often, they don’t gain a new adoptive family, so they are left with nothing. Each year,25% of childrenwhose parents’ rights were terminated — thousands of children — age out of foster care as “legal orphans,” their ties to any family legally severed.All children, including those in foster care,come from families. And all children’s sense of safety and security is entirely dependent on maintaining key attachments and family connections. While child abuse is a serious concern, the vast majority of children in foster care are there not because of allegations of physical or sexual abuse, butbecause of allegations of neglect— often a proxy for conditions of poverty such as housing and food insecurity, and inadequate medical care. Families who lack appropriate resources need actual help, not to have their children removed.» READ MORE:Four ways the legislature can fix Pa.’s ChildLine registryChildren should not be forever separated from their families because of poverty, and caring about the safety and well-being of children means caring about their family connections. We must reorient our approach to support children’s need for lifelong family connection. Children cannot simply “forget” ties to family; we must recognize the significant trauma, grief, and loss experienced by every child who is taken.The Adoption and Safe Families Act was created with the goal of protecting children. But 25 years later, we must see it for what it is: a failure.Let’s reimagine the concept of “child protection” to one that commits significant resources to preserving families, not separating them. Policy choices such as universal basic income, universal health care, and access to affordable housing and child care would go a long way in preventing child abuse and neglect. And for those children who must be separated from their families, child protection law must prioritize concrete supports for struggling families and flexible custody options such as guardianship, which could provide both stable family arrangements and lifelong connection.More thanone million childrenhave been forever separated from their families in the time since the Adoption and Safe Families Act became law 25 years ago. For many of those children, the law was a disaster. We must repeal it to save future generations from the same fate.Sarah Katz is a clinical professor of law at the Temple University Beasley School of Law, where she directs and teaches the Family Law Litigation Clinic."

This proposal would accelerate the governor’s 10-year goal for achieving universal internet access from 2028 to 2024.Living without internet/WiFi in a world that’s built around technology is a difficult task. Living in a rural area, having daughters and working in the school system makes it difficult to complete any work at home. Although we have a phone and can use the hotspot, that’s not consistent. Using the phone means that I will lose service and have to spend time reconnecting several times over. Even enjoying any fun activities or movies is hard.When COVID-19 hit and school was online, my daughter struggled to keep up with schoolwork and assignments because we had no internet. Now that school is back in-person, she is able to keep up with her assignments. Although school is in-person, she still has some homework and having no internet access makes it difficult to complete.Working in the school system, having internet access is necessary in order to successfully plan for students to be successful. In some cases, I have had to stay late in order to prepare because I had no internet at home. Now that my daughter is heavily involved in sports, it makes it difficult to stay late. Having internet access at home would help out a lot because I can complete my work at home.Having read and now knowing some issues that I and some other people may face without internet access, I’m hoping that Suffolk City Council will consider using the funds that are available for internet access.

minnpost_2022_49,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Out of the Deep South, a lumber company, Huber Manufacturing, is proposing what may be the largest oriented strand board (plywood plant in the country. The Frontier plant would be built in Cohasset, just east of Grand Rapids, and on Minnesota Power’s land, where the Boswell Energy Facility is located.The era of coal is ending in a time of climate chaos and major innovations in renewables. Replacing the big polluter and employer, the Huber plant would go up less than a mile from the Leech Lake reservation. But no one in the Walz administration thought to call Leech Lake and ask what they thought. The Leech Lake Tribal government learned about the project from a press release.That’s not the way it’s supposed to be in Minnesota. To be clear, Gov. Tim Walz signed the 2019 Executive Order l9-24 “affirming government to government relationship between Minnesota and Minnesota tribal nations, providing for consultation, coordination and cooperation.” The executive order is intended “to establish mutually respectful and beneficial relationships between the state and Minnesota tribal nations.”Well, throw that one out the window.What’s amazingly clear is that Walz did not conduct any consultation as required by his own executive order. Instead, the governor and the Legislature just started the cannonball rolling toward the forests of the north.Huber Manufacturing hopes to build a 750,000-square foot facility, where 150 people could work and make industrial-sized construction panels. Sounds simple? Well, the Minnesota Legislature thought it sounded like a really good idea, so it gave $80 million in subsidies to this North Carolina-based company, told the City of Cohasset that it should be the responsible government unit, then gave the company an exemption from an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS , saying that a simple Environmental Assessment Worksheet (EAW might be just fine. Minnesota’s hoping the deal would be sweet enough that Huber would pick Cohasset over competitors in other states.Kind of sounds like Minnesota has become a very cheap date. And, for that much in state subsidies, it might be worth some vetting — like a proper EIS.OSB = Healthy?Oriented Strand Board, or OSB, is some important stuff to fast building. It’s sort of a sticky mess and has some toxic materials to hold the world together. Basically, since Paul Bunyan logged our massive pine forests, we now just mush up little stuff and glue it together with petrochemicals. That’s the Minnesota way.The first oriented strand board was made by Blandin in Grand Rapids. There was also an OSB plant in Deerwood, which made joists, operated initially by MacMillan Bloedel and then by Weyerhaeuser. Deerwood’s Trus Joist had a number of health-related concerns before the plant was closed, and the industry is generallypretty toxicto worker health. It turns out that chemicals like formaldehyde and others, combined with wood dust, aren’t good for you. OSB facilities closed during the financial collapse in 2008, and facing more changes and shrinking forests, the pulp and paper mills also experienced hard times. Tough sledding in the logging industry.What about the trees?At the heart of this development, it’s about the trees and the forests. A forest is a living ecosystem, timber resources are inanimate materials.Those are profoundly two different world views which have been colliding in the forests of the north since before the l855 treaty. What’s clear is that Minnesota does not manage the forests sustainably. Even the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR knows that. Twenty-eight DNR staffoutlined their ecological concerns in a 2019 letter to Commissioner Sarah Strommen. According to anMPR report, “the authors do not believe it is scientifically honest or transparent to say that the 10-year timber plan is ‘beneficial to wildlife.’”The fact is that Minnesota’s forests are managed for aspen and deer. That’s not a diverse forest, that’s a monocrop. Loss of old growth and clearcutting destroys habitat for larger animals and destroys ecosystems. The DNR wildlife scientists felt the proposed 8.75 percent increase in harvest from state-managed lands would cut out biodiversity and habitat. There’s just not enough forests left to support mega projects like this one.That 2019 information was before the Huber Plant proposal, which will be fed by these same forests. The Frontier OSB plant needs an estimated 400,000 cords of wood annually to sustain a 24-hour assembly. Huber wants to get that within a l00-mile radius from the project. By comparison, the Minnesota DNR in 2019 offered 875,000 cords from all state land. That logging impact circle includes the entire Leech Lake reservation, the Chippewa National Forest and a good portion of the White Earth and Red Lake reservations.There are already two separate lumber plants on either side of the Leech Lake reservation. Recently the Leech Lake Nation voiced concerns about the lack of information provided in the EAW, noting in their initial comments, “most of the wood for this project will necessarily be harvested from the Leech Lake reservation or the l855 treaty territory. The failure to analyze the woodshed based on feedstock quantities necessary sets the State upon a dangerous trajectory for forest health.”“We find our medicines in mature forests, not early in the succession,” explained Ben Benoit with the Environmental Program for Leech Lake. “Protecting and restoring forest diversity is critical to preserving Anishinaabe lifeways in an ever-changing climate and world … tribal citizens rely on the forest as our teachings and culture is tied to natural cycles and diversity that is disrupted with timber industry focused management.” In other words, you can’t make maple syrup in a clearcut.Then there’s the little guys, like the long-eared bat orMyotis septentrionalis.They are endangered. There’s a long-eared bat nesting site right there by Cohasset, that is going to get creamed in construction. Bapakwaanaajiinh, the bat, is an epic character in Anishinaabe mythology, illustrating that mysterious and small creatures can change the world. This specific bat species also was impacted by the Line 3 project. That was one of the primary endangered species the pipeline rolled over. There’s only so many times you can knock out an endangered species and expect it to live.The United Nations has reiterated that biodiversity matters to not only planetary health, but also human health. The reality is that mega projects are fragmenting forests and creating ecological havoc. Those same clearcuts make the forest damage more at risk in windstorms, which increase with climate change. It’s easy to see the wind shears along corridors like highways and pipelines. Protecting the integrity of the forest protects us all. Besides that, the Lorax lives in the forest.Paul Bunyan was already here. There were once 75 million acres of contiguous forest in the region; most of them have been cut to build railroads, the cities of St. Paul, Duluth and more. The northern forests created empires — from the Congdon to the Pillsbury, Weyerhaeuser and more — all those empires born from these forests. Those companies are the actual names of the fictional Paul Bunyan. In the least, Bunyan needs to do something epic to reverse his legacy.There is no sustainable harvest in the north woods, only a lot of aspen monocultures being cultivated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. But that’s not a forest and that’s what the DNR Wildlife concerns are about. The Leech Lake tribal government has been working for decades on forest restoration outlining “desired vegetative conditions” and facing all of these logging interests, as well as a Chippewa National Forest which was carved out of the reservation, all impacting Indigenous land knowledge and care.The time of Paul Bunyan is over.Walz’s bad gambles — hemp’s saving grace?“Very few opportunities come along where someone is looking to build a new plant,” Rep. Tom Bakk said, as he went to bat for $28.5 million in state subsidies for Huber. That may be because it’s a bad idea. But that didn’t stop them.“You have a company coming into Minnesota looking at our environmental laws and telling everyone, telling Minnesota Power, telling the Legislature, we’ll come in as long as you get rid of this one law for us,” noted Evan Mulholland, senior staff attorney for the environmental policy group MCEA. “And that just doesn’t sit right with us.”As the Glasgow Climate conference came to an end in November, there was a greater than ever call to keep forests intact and cut carbon emissions. The Walz administration talked about the new plans for cars, but neglected to mention the big tar sands pipeline, and the new plans to clearcut the north for an out of state corporation. This fall, Walz talked about the clean car initiative, his new council on climate change, and then proposed to give away the northern forests with $80 million in subsidies from the state.This administration could do a lot better, in fact, they could change the future.It may also be time for hemp wood — that’s all sorts of wood made from compressed hemp, stuck together with, well, soybeans. Can’t eat it, but you can make a lot out of it, including joists and something like OSB, made with hemp and soybeans. Besides that, hemp sequesters carbon faster than a forest, and has great adaptability. It takes about four months for hemp stalks to reach maturity, while it takes trees at least 20 years. Let’s take a break from the southern charm of Huber and look across the forests. That’s where the wild things are and that’s where the bats live. And the Anishinaabe.This is the only place we have, Huber can go find another forest.Winona LaDuke is a Harvard-educated economist, environmental activist, author, hemp farmer, grandmother, and a two-time former Green Party vice presidential candidate with Ralph Nader.

suffolknewsherald_2022_122,"Published 5:24 pm Tuesday, April 5, 2022ByStaff ReportsVirginia’s awkward dalliance with recreational marijuana is even messier than it was a year ago, when lawmakers authorized possession without any means for legally purchasing. Legislation in this year’s regular session of the General Assembly has made the picture even muddier.Capital News Service’s Josephine Walker reports that Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, introduced Senate Bill 591 to “restrict the use of products that appeal to children through gummies.”That seemed reasonable, but lawmakers passed an amended version of Hanger’s bill redefining marijuana as any cannabis product with over .3% THC (the main psychoactive compound in marijuana or .25 milligrams of THC per serving, which covers even some non-intoxicating CBD products.Many stores have been selling a variety of CBD-based, low-THC products for a variety of reasons and ailments. Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, is co-owner of a Norfolk shop that sells “legal” CBD products. Some products sold at the store were over the threshold for allowed THC, according to a report published by the Virginia Mercury. Her dispensary and many others could be affected by Hanger’s legislation.While lawmakers dance around full-fledged marijuana legalization, the truth is that anyone who wants to buy actual, high-quantity THC marijuana can easily find it.“Some sellers offer delivery options and showcase product menus on social media,” Walker writes. “Many people began operating in those spaces when marijuana possession was decriminalized and in anticipation of the legal recreational market that many thought was greenlit for 2024.”Both Republicans and Democrats in Richmond seem to agree that a legal marijuana marketplace is still the way to go, as it would generate substantial tax revenue off an activity that’s happening regardless. The regular session ended, however, with no final framework for sales.The legalization bill that passed last year needed to be reenacted in the 2022 session, but a House committee continued the bill to the 2023 session, jeopardizing the previously planned January 2024 start date for recreational sales. For now, Walker writes, the only way marijuana can be obtained legally is if it is grown or gifted, or if an individual has a state-issued medical marijuana card.That’s a lot of tax revenue going up in smoke.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Orchestrating this delay was Councilor Alan Zelenka, who persuaded his pro-electrification colleagues of the virtues of sitting on their hands by claiming that a patchwork of state and federal policies meant that the city should be “thoughtful and careful” in response to an urgent and unprecedented climate crisis. In particular, Zelenka — a career bureaucrat whose day job is at the Oregon Department of Energy — pointed to the state’s recently passed Climate Protection Program. Zelenka misleadingly stated that this program required reductions from “all fossil fuels” in Oregon. In fact, the program excludes Oregon’s largest stationary sources of emissions (fracked gas power plants . Zelenka also omitted that NW Natural is currently suing the state in an attempt to invalidate the program. Zelenka failed to identify which federal laws or policies obviate the need for Eugene to reduce its emissions — because none exist. On the contrary, Congress’ attempts to pass climate legislation before November’s midterm election will continue to be stymied by the pro-coal Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision inWest Virginia v. EPAwill be a thorn in the side of any attempts by the Executive Branch to further regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Pleas for “thoughtful and careful” action have long been used by the fossil fuel industry as a strategy to slow down and lower the ambition of regulation. Zelenka’s insistence on waiting to see the effects of state and federal action plays right into this strategy. It is reckless for a government official who clearly has some grasp of climate science to frame emissions reductions as a zero-sum game, where action by one level of government excuses inaction elsewhere. Rather, the science is clear that, to avoid catastrophic levels of warming, all levels of government need to be using every policy lever at their disposal to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible. Zelenka’s wait-and-see rhetoric was even more damning given that, earlier in the session, city staffers presented the City Council with clear evidence that almost every newly constructed home increases our city’s gas emissions. Specifically, data showed that over 80 percent of one- and two-family homes constructed in Eugene in 2021 had natural gas installed. NW Natural has been heavily incentivizing these new gas hookups. They know that once gas gets in a home it will stay there for a long time, as retrofits are much more costly than building all-electric from the outset. Further delay means that new buildings will remain a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in our city, and the families living in those buildings will continue to be exposed to hazardous levels of nitrous oxides and other emissions. The policies Zelenka alluded to will do nothing in the short-term to address these emissions. On the other hand, a city ordinance would not only rapidly eliminate these emissions in new homes, but would lower construction costs and energy bills, and provide much-needed climate resiliency via the ability of electric heat pumps to also provide both home cooling and heating. It is clear from April’s work session that Zelenka no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt when it comes to tackling climate change and standing up to the fossil fuel industry. On July 25, those councilors who support genuine climate action, electrifying our buildings and tackling harmful gas emissions should not be so easily duped, and should instead move this city towards an emissions-free future.

James, however, sulked over to one of the walls, sat down and cried. I had to say no to a request that he and some other campers had made, and he took my decline the hardest. I gave him some time on his own to pout before I went and sat next to him.“I know you’re upset with me,” I said, “But I want to tell you why I made my decision.” I began by repeating his request to me, so he would know that I understood what he wanted to do. I then told him why I would not allow him or his fellow campers to try to find and catch the snake that had supposedly been spotted on our recent trek.I explained that while most of the snakes in our campground were not poisonous, some could be dangerous. I told him that even if the snake wasn’t poisonous, it could still bite him or one of his fellow campers if we got too close. I shared that even if he was old enough and smart enough to not get too close to the snake, some of his fellow campers might not be so wise or old enough to understand. Lastly, I shared that there may be more than one snake around the rocky crevice that we could not see that could come out unexpectedly and that I had to keep everyone safe.I wish I could tell you that my explanation helped him accept my answer, but it did not. He continued to cry and pout against the wall. Nevertheless, I am glad I took the time to tell him why I had to say no.Taking time to speak with him let him know that I heard his request. I repeated what he wanted to do, so he would know I understood fully. I wanted him to know that he was important enough to me that I heard and understood his request. Repeating his request also allowed him the opportunity to clarify something if I had misunderstood.Sharing my reasons let him know I had taken his request seriously.

The country’s Communist Party dictatorship tried brute force to defeat the virus with the “Zero-COVID” strategy, characterized by heavy-handed lockdowns that kept people constrained to their homes, sometimes without the ability even to buy food, and the government’s now distinctive penchant for mass surveillance.Like keeping the pressure on a wound without actually treating it, the strategy could only delay the deterioration, and the time of reckoning has come. Nearly three years in, after countries around the world have been battered by COVID-19, it is China again in the center of the maelstrom, with an exploding catastrophe in the form of hundreds of thousands of infections overwhelming an already-beleaguered health system as the government seems to exasperatedly wash its hands of the whole thing.Countries including the U.S. are again imposing travel restrictions, and the administration of President Xi Jinping seems at a loss about what to do as it watches the order it tried to force into being collapse in on itself, endangering its grand designs for an ever-more prominent place in the firmament of the global economy. Perhaps it should be yet another reminder that totalitarian control, no matter how badly one wills it, is an unattainable goal, and is more like a mirage that will lure you out to your demise.This illusion will, sadly, cost tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese lives, just as our own flavor of self-delusion cost so many American ones.

Minus Ms. Sherri Story, board members fail to even respond to parents’ concerns.EO #2 does not ban masks, it simply gives parents the choice. Regardless of how you feel on this issue, one thing we can all agree on is there is a lack of transparency and involvement with parents. Did the board meet on the issue? Did they vote? We don’t know, because nothing was communicated to parents except for a decision which excludes us. Code of VA, Title 22.1, Ch. 13.2, 22.1-253.13:7 Standards of Quality 7, School Board Policies, states “C. Each local school board shall ensure that policies are developed giving consideration to the views of teachers, parents, and other concerned citizens.” Surely Dr. Gordon did not decide on such a controversial issue independently.The school board is using CDC recommendations (key word: recommendations and SB1303 as a crutch to inflict their authority over parental rights. SB1303 does not mandate masks in schools, because the CDC does not mandate masks in schools. The law is so vague that it could literally be construed to support either side of the issue, so this argument is weak. Code of VA, Title 1, Ch. 2.1, Article 2, 1.240.1 Rights of Parents, states “A parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child.”Healthy children under the age of 18 are less than 1% at risk of becoming severely ill with COVID. Physiological damage to children from chronic face mask: hypoxia, accumulation of harmful bacteria, decline in cognitive performance, anxiety, and rebreathing contaminated air with high bacterial concentrations along with low O2 and high CO2 levels continuously challenge the body’s homeostasis, causing self-toxicity and immunosuppression. (Kisielinski 2021 Our kids have been subjected to two years of mask mandates and remote learning, none of which have stopped the spread of COVID. COVID is here to stay. Decisions are being made based on political affiliation, pressures from school board and teacher associations, and feelings, rather than on actual science. Those who are at risk should take whatever precautions they need to in order to feel safe, just as those who are healthy should do whatever they feel makes them safe. If masks work so well, why does it matter if everyone else is wearing one or not? The logic here is “my coat only keeps me warm if everyone else wears theirs.”We are not co-parenting with the school board.

suffolknewsherald_2022_102,"Published 7:31 pm Tuesday, April 26, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Barbara HollingsworthPassing the state budget, which is a blueprint of how state tax money in Virginia must be spent during the next two years, is one of the General Assembly’s most important jobs. So the failure of the legislature to pass a budget for the 2022-24 biennium during this year’s regular 60-day session was a major abdication of legislators’ duty to their constituents.Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s call for a special session in Richmond starting today to do what state lawmakers should have already done puts them at a strategic disadvantage, especially since the governor is pushing them to return a large portion of the $16.7 billion state “surplus” back to taxpayers.Due to the General Assembly’s failure to pass a budget during the regular session, Youngkin currently stands on higher moral, fiscal and even political ground. Here’s why:So far, the Republican-controlled House of Delegates is proposing a tax cut of $5.1 billion, while the Democrat-controlled state Senate is only willing to return $2.2 billion to taxpayers. But even the more generous House plan (if you can call it that involves less than a third of the total “surplus” – and that’s not nearly enough.Like the federal government, the state government has enormous power to extract wealth from its citizens. This power to tax is wielded by the General Assembly, which uses the money the state collects to authorize payment for all the goods and services the commonwealth provides, based on the state budget. But any money collected above and beyond that amount – a “surplus” – is in reality excess taxation that should be returned to the people.This should not be controversial. It is a simple matter of fairness. If you accidentally overpay at a retail store, the merchant is not entitled to keep the “surplus.” He or she is ethically obligated to return any money received beyond the agreed-upon price of the item. Likewise, the state budget is the agreed-upon price of financing state government. So any excess funds collected should be returned to the taxpayers who were overcharged.This is even more important during a time when inflation is raging after two years of state-mandated pandemic lockdowns, which wreaked havoc on many Virginians’ businesses and personal budgets. And because most of the general fund “surplus” was due to a conscious decision by both the Northam administration and the 2019 General Assembly to break with tradition and not conform state income tax rates for individuals and businesses in Virginia to the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, creating what they knew would be a “windfall” by design.But the “windfall” came at the expense of struggling Virginia families and businesses, who are in no mood to keep forking over more and more of their hard-earned money to Richmond. Youngkin knows this. It’s why he campaigned on promises to push for a slew of tax cuts, and it’s one of the reasons the political newcomer beat former Governor Terry McAuliffe.Tax cuts and tax rebates are politically just as popular as stimulus checks, but without the borrowing. Lawmakers who try to block them may come to regret it.“I do believe we can and should have the largest tax reduction in the history of Virginia,” Youngkin said. He’s right. But tax cuts are not just popular with voters. They’re also good public policy.A recent review of the economic literature by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation found once again that “tax cuts have positive effects on growth,” while “taxes, particularly on corporate and individual income, harm economic growth.”Structural tax reform, such as conforming Virginia’s standard income tax deduction to the federal deduction, will allow Virginia to better compete with its neighbors. Taxes place an additional burden on companies’ profitability, and they tend to seek places where that burden is the lightest.For example, former Gov. George Allen cut taxes by over $600 million in the mid-1990s. But since then, Virginia has lagged behind Tennessee and North Carolina in job growth, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job growth is a good measure of economic growth because only businesses that are thriving can afford to hire more help.More recently, during the year following the 2017 federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, federal tax revenues increased by $190 billion while unemployment hit historic lows and real wages increased.The irony is that economic growth spurred by tax cuts will create even more tax revenue for state government down the line. Giving back the “surplus” will mean a larger pot of cash for legislators to spend later, a win-win for everybody if members of the General Assembly don’t let their egos and partisan interests get in the way.Barbara Hollingsworth, former editorial page editor of the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star, is visiting fellow with the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, which originally published this column.

minnpost_2022_86,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .TheFederal Reserve on June 15, 2022,lifted interest ratesby 0.75 percentage point, the third hike this year and thelargest since 1994. The move is aimed at countering thefastest pace of inflation in over 40 years.Wall Street had been expecting a half-point increase, but thelatest consumer prices reportreleased on June 10 prompted the Fed to take a more drastic measure. The big risk, however, is that higher rates will push the economy into a recession, a fear aptly expressed by the recentplunge in the S&P 500 stock index, which is down over 20% from its peak in January, making it a “bear market.”What does this all mean? The Conversation asked Brian Blank, afinance scholarwhostudies how businesses adapt and handle economic downturns, to explain what the Fed is trying to do, whether it can succeed and what it means for you.1. What is the Fed doing and why?The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policymaking arm, had been pondering how much and how quickly to raise its benchmark interest rate over the coming months to fight inflation. The stakes for the U.S. economy, consumers and businesses are very high.Only a week ago, theFed had been expectedto raise rates by 0.5 percentage point at the latest meeting. Butmarkets and Wall Street economists began to expectthe larger 0.75-point hike after the May consumer price data suggested inflation has been unexpectedly stubborn. Some Wall Street analystseven argueda1-percentage-point hike was possible.The prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes due to inflation has promptedfinancial markets to plunge by over 6%since the June 10 report. Investors worry the Fed may slow the economy too much inits fight to reduce inflation, which if left unchecked alsoposes serious problemsfor consumers and companies. A recent poll found that inflationis the biggest problemAmericans believe the U.S. is facing right now.2. What is the Fed trying to achieve?TheFederal Reserve has a dual mandate to maximize employment while keeping prices stable.Often policymakers must prioritize one or the other. When the economy is weak, inflation is usually subdued and the Fed can focus on keeping rates down to stimulate investment and boost employment. When the economy is strong, unemployment is typically quite low, and that allows the Fed to focus on controlling inflation.To do this, the Fed sets short-term interest rates, which in turn help it influence long-term rates. For example, when the Fed lifts its target short-term rate, that increases borrowing costs for banks, which in turn pass those higher costs on to consumers and businesses in the form of higher rates onlong-term loans for houses and cars.At the moment, theeconomy is quite strong,unemployment islow, and the Fed is able to focus primarily on reducing inflation. The problem is, inflation is so high, atan annualized rate of 8.6%, that bringing it down may require the highest interest rates in decades, which could weaken the economy substantially.And so the Fed is trying to execute a so-called soft landing.3. What’s a ‘soft landing’ and is it likely?A soft landing refers to the way that the Fed is attempting to slow inflation – and therefore economic growth – without causing arecession.In order to stabilize prices while not hurting employment, theFed expectsto increase interest rates very rapidly in the coming months. Including the latest rate hike, the Fed has already lifted rates by 1.5 percentage points this year, putting its benchmark interest rate at a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.Historically, when the Fedhas had to raise rates quickly, economic downturns have been difficult to avoid. Can it manage a soft landing this time?Fed Chair Jerome Powell has insistedthat the central bank’s policy tools have become more effective since its last inflation fight in the 1980s, making it possible this time to stick the landing.Many economistsand other observers remain uncertain. And arecent survey of economistsnotes that many anticipate a recession beginning next year.That said, the economyis still relatively strong, and I’d say the the odds of a recession beginning next year are stillprobably close to a coin flip.Each time the Federal Open Market Committee meets, it seeks to communicate what it plans to do in the future to help financial markets know what to expect so they aren’t taken by surprise.One piece of guidance about the future that the committee provides is a series of dots, with each point representing a particular member’s expectation for interest rates at different points in time.This “dot plot” previously indicated that the Fed will raise interest rates to 2% by the end of the year and close to 3% by the end of 2023.The latest inflation news is forcing it to change its tune. Thedot plot now suggests the Fed expects ratesto near 3.5% by December – implying several large rate hikes are still in store this year – and almost 4% in 2023 before falling again in 2024.Long-term interest rates, such asU.S. Treasury yieldsandmortgage rates, already reflect these rapid changes. Some investors, however, think the Fed may have to move even faster and are forecasting rates approaching4% by the end of 2022.5. What does this mean for consumers and the economy?Interest rates represent the cost of borrowing, so when the Fed raises the target rate, money becomes more expensive to borrow.First, banks pay more to borrow money, but then they charge individuals and businesses more interest as well, which is why mortgage rates rise accordingly. This is one reasonmortgage paymentshave been rising so rapidly in 2022, even as housing markets and prices start to slow down.When interest rates are higher, fewer people can afford homes and fewer businesses can afford to invest in a new factory and hire more workers. As a result, higher interest rates can slow down the growth rate of the economy overall, while also curbing inflation.But what it ultimately means for consumers and everyone else will depend on whether the pace of inflation slows as much and as quickly as the Fed has been forecasting.D.

eugeneweekly_2022_38,"We ve got issues. Aviolent attack, PTSD, anxiety, oppression, COVID, depression — we, as a society, are entrenched in a myriad of suffering, experienced collectively, voluntarily or not. The byproduct of this pandemic’s wild twist of history turns into another story of the human condition, as if it’s the writing on the wall. I am thinking of how the suffering could be the result of so many unfortunate experiences we have been thrown into. As I am lying in my bed, unable to breathe, my body is so hot it’s cold, my skin pale and clammy, every attempt to talk has a strange whistle and crack. It hurts to breathe, because everything is swollen. I know how this goes, as long as I’m strong enough to endure. In a way, I’ve been here before, when I was beaten by the police. This time, the culprit is literally in the air. As I think of it all, it is as if some people are just more susceptible to this suffering than others: socioeconomic status, age, ethnicity, “essential” or not. The pain in my body is unheard of. Every joint is on fire. My muscles are weak, I have no appetite, I’ve lost 10 pounds since it happened. I have no control over the intensity, I’ve done all I’m “supposed” to do. Now, I’m supposed to lie here and witness my body fight for every ounce of strength it has. I have limited recourse. They empathize with shallow gestures of condolences. The system is supposed to provide sovereignty. It is the safety net, right? At some point, you’d think people would step in and step up to help, but they have their reasons — secretly too scared to truly get involved. It’s easier to lean on the fact that the system is bigger than them, I guess. Truth is, they don’t see themselves in the suffering. Instead they sheepishly posture behind their choices, “freedoms” and their ability to gain access, avoid scrutiny and their unearned privilege to their right to carry on. Their “individualism.” I follow the rules — wear my mask, keep my hands on the wheel, say yes sir/no sir, carry my receipts clearly as I walk out of the store — because I know the rules of this system somehow work against me, that they work against marginalized communities. How many people have to die before it makes a difference, personally? Do we recognize the emotional, physical aftermath of police brutality, intersectional oppression and the routine denial of access to equitable health care as the reality of the context in which we live? COVID deaths by the thousands. Systems. Everyone is tired — of everything. Experiencing the system, marginalized, is more than inconvenient. It is forever. For those who are witnessing this, when do you lose sight of the people experiencing it? If you’ve never experienced it yourself then how long does it stay relevant? What I’m wondering isifyou reflected on this experience, the suffering: Was that reflection outside of yourself? Were you looking at someone else’s experience that, as you witnessed it, you somehow deduced that it could not be you? If you didn’t center yourself at first, and you thought, “How horrible that must be,” and did you ask yourself: “What am I supposed to do?” Our ability to do better for each other seems equally as complicated as it is to recognize and name the active oppression at play. What does “each other” truly mean to the solution? It is clear our collective experiences are results of this system, but only one community reflects the system. However, If we are all human, Maya Angelou reminds us that “I am a human being, nothing human can be alien to me.” So, I’m asking: How did we get here? How did we get to a place where the pain and suffering for some is acceptable as long as the majority isn’t further compromised?

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_49,"The U.S. dollar is near its highest level in more than a decade. A strong U.S. dollar has many benefits to consumers. When traveling abroad, goods and services cost less in U.S. dollars, making foreign destinations attractive vacation options for many. Domestically, imported items also cost less in U.S. dollars, with some of these savings passed along to consumers.At the same time, a strong U.S. dollar means that exported goods and services cost more in foreign countries, putting downward pressure on export sales. Compensating for this effect may require lower prices offered overseas and an associated lower revenue and earnings for U.S. companies.So far, at least for large companies, this has not been the case. S&P 500 companies generate a significant portion of their revenue and earnings abroad. In fact, based on the first quarter of 2022, those that generated more than one-half of their sales domestically had weaker earnings growth than those companies that generated more than one-half of their sales abroad.Conventional wisdom is not always accurate, which makes forecasting economic causes and effects so challenging. It also means that setting economic policies is an inexact science at best.Take for example inflation, which is close to a 40-year high. Shouldn’t a strong U.S. dollar be buffering higher prices?Surprisingly to some, it has, which means that prices would be even higher if the U.S. dollar were weaker. For example, inflation rates are higher in several other countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.Oil prices have received significant attention. Gasoline prices are routinely between $3.50 and $4 per gallon in the United States. Given that crude oil is priced in U.S. dollars, a strong dollar obfuscates its actual cost.The current nominal, noninflation-adjusted price of oil has been comparable to the price of $80 to $90 per barrel back in 2011 to 2014. Taking inflation into account, prices are much lower today.In contrast, oil prices are near all-time highs in Canada and Europe. As much as Americans are not pleased with gas prices at the pump and will not be with the cost of natural gas to heat their homes this winter, Canadians and Europeans are faring even worse. For example, Canadians are paying around $1.70 Canadian dollars for a liter of gasoline, equivalent to around $6.50 per gallon, or $4.80 in U.S. dollars.What a strong U.S. dollar is doing is clouding the cost of oil that many other countries are paying. If the U.S. dollar weakens, as it inevitably will, the price of oil domestically will surge. This means that $4 per gallon of gasoline at the pump will look like a bargain.As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates to suppress economic activity, effectively cooling systemwide demand and placing less upward pressure on prices, higher interest rate investments become attractive to foreign investors. This means that demand for U.S. currency is increased, putting more upward pressure on the dollar.It’s complicated. And rightly so. Every dial that is turned has unexpected consequences.Now with Republicans in control of the House, bipartisan support will be needed to affect any legislation that could support the economy and temper inflation. Without such cooperation, gridlock is likely, with President Joe Biden forced to resort to executive orders, which have their limitations.Polls from the Pew Research Center show that people view inflation as a top issue of concern. What few realize is that the number of tools available to effectively manage a massive economy like that of the United States is limited, and those available are rather blunt with significant time delays to yield effects.As bad as inflation may seem at this time, it could be worse.

suffolknewsherald_2022_62,"Published 4:44 pm Friday, June 10, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonGuest columnistIn a day when the flag of the USA is being stomped on and burned, I want to give it the recognition it deserves.I have crossed the ocean 20 times in my trips to and from three foreign countries as a missionary servant. Each time when I returned and saw that flag, I felt a sense of contentment. I was home.Memorial Day is always a special time each year for those who love our country and its flag. Thank you, Suffolk News-Herald, for your June 1 edition of the paper. The flag ceremony at the A.J. Horton Memorial Cemetery with pictures of the multitude of flags was a wonderful reminder of why we have remained free as a country and as a people.A small flag was placed at each grave honoring the member who served our country — some who did not survive, others who did. My husband served and survived. He graduated from high school just as World War II was starting. With his gown over his arm he went immediately to the recruitment office to volunteer. The memorial crosses are a reminder of those like him who fought to keep us free. He and others who survived lived with the honor of having served. We still honor them.June 14 is officially Flag Day. Let’s fly our flags to show our loyalty and gratitude to God and the honor due “old glory.”Just above the picture of the Horton memorial story was the bold headline “Stepson charged with murder.”The people who commit this kind of crime don’t seem to understand that the country in which they live was founded on freedom to do the right things, not the wrong. That freedom was bought with a price. Its symbol is a flag that flies the colors red, white and blue. It deserves to be flown with honor and respect.Maybe the visionary response I have is attached to the biblical values I hold. The significance to those colors represent the blood that has been shed for freedom. The white, a blank slate on which I write my future. Blue is a peaceful color. Let it bind together the peace bought with the blood and hope of continued freedom for a future generation. The 50 stars set on its background are lined up to represent unity.Sadly, not everyone sees the need to honor the flag. Some would replace or destroy it. Just a few months ago, we saw young people stomping on and burning our flag with no regard for its meaning. America has freedom because of those who gave their all for it. Someone has said our flag should be a reminder that freedom means an absence of slavery to another power.Let’s apply the message of the apostle Paul in Galatians 5: “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, and do not let yourselves be burdened by a yoke of slavery ”On June 14, let’s all fly this symbol of our freedom in America! Let’s guard our freedom to do right, not wrong.Myrtle V.

minnpost_2022_69,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We have something to celebrate in Uptown! While it sometimes feels like we are drowning in bad news, I’m here to give kudos where they are due and to celebrate Minneapolis municipal work done well.The City of Minneapolis Public Works recently released its final design recommendation for the Hennepin Avenue S. reconstruction project between Lake Street and Douglas Avenue. Public Works staff are recommending permanent dedicated bus lanes, wider sidewalks, more greenery and dedicated left-turn lanes (no more getting stuck behind left-turning vehicles! . The layout also includes dedicated delivery and passenger drop-off areas, shorter pedestrian crossing distances and a two-way, curb-level bike lane. Construction has been delayed a year to 2024 after consulting with the local business community still recovering from the pandemic.The city’s plan is great. Still, I want to address the elephant in the room: parking. Hennepin Ave is going to look different than it does now. There are currently more than 3,600 parking spaces on and within a half block of Hennepin. The city’s parking study shows that even in the busiest times, parking demand does not exceed 73%. Slightly less than 10% of the corridor total (roughly 340 parking spaces are slated for removal, all of which are directly on Hennepin.There will still be delivery and drop-off zones either on Hennepin or on side streets to serve businesses. This leaves a substantial buffer of available parking spaces while devoting more public right-of-way for greater accessibility, safety, trees — things that create an inviting human experience in this neighborhood corridor. Better yet, similar redesign experiences in places like Toronto, Canada, and Dubuque, Iowa, have resulted in greater economic activity — a promising outcome from a battered pandemic economy.For generations we’ve overlooked safety in designing our city streets. This 1.4-mile stretch of Hennepin in particular is home to three of the top 25 most dangerous intersections in the city. At the center of this recommended reconstruction, however, are safety and community. This design adds bump-outs to increase visibility of pedestrians, and limits speeding and drag-racer donuts with a center median.Jefferson School will gain a safe bike route to school for students and staff with a protected bike lane in front of the building. Similar to Lyndale Avenue south of 31st Street, dedicated left-turn lanes and a single lane of vehicle through traffic will provide better predictability for travelers. Changes in on-street parking will minimize cars and the people exiting them from being sideswiped. Hennepin Avenue can become a model of people-centered street design — a place people want to visit and spend time.Of course, no design is perfect. The tail ends of the design lack a dedicated bus lane. And long pedestrian crossing distances near Lagoon Avenue are a concern, among others. Still, it’s a major improvement that recognizes residents’ diverse needs and provides real transportation options.The Hennepin Avenue project has rightfully received much attention in its redesign. This is the first major redesign project since the city adopted the Transportation Action Plan and declared a climate emergency. As with any significant capital project, there have been dozens of public meetings, hundreds of comments submitted, and plentiful area signage engaging the public.The outcome for Hennepin is an indicator of how seriously the city plans on taking its road design policies and climate commitments. If Hennepin is the measuring stick, I’m happy that Minneapolis is standing tall. The city is soliciting comments through Jan. 28 and holding a virtual open house Jan. 13 on the recommended design.

suffolknewsherald_2022_6,"Published 7:36 pm Friday, August 12, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:Following the public hearing before the Planning Commission on July 19, I wrote to you, expressing several concerns about the proposed Port 460 project. Since that time I have attended the second community outreach by Matan Companies on Aug. 4, and have reviewed portions of the video of the council meetings on this topic over the past few weeks. The lack of meaningful response to the concerns I had raised, as well as some additional concerns which have arisen, prompts me to express serious reservations about these issues.1. An inappropriate locationAt the Planning Commission meeting speakers from the community raised questions about why the development of this warehouse project had to be located adjacent to several residential areas, instead of in an area of similar business types. The questions were brushed aside with the statement that the proposed location was the only site in Suffolk that had 500-plus acres available. The clear implication was that this size of property was essential to the project.However, at the second community outreach meeting the Matan representatives admitted that each of the proposed 10 warehouse sites (which they refer to as “lots” would be sold individually to new owners. The only information given about the “unavailability” of alternate properties for the project was to say the alternates did not meet the criteria of Matan for the project. The specific criteria was not provided. However, it appears very clear that, since the lots are to be sold individually, that it would be no impediment at all to have relocated to two or more properties located near one another, rather than requiring a specific, single, property for the entire project. In fact, no reason, other than the preferences of the developer, was given for the property not being located elsewhere.Once the possibility of relocating the site to multiple properties is considered, another benefit becomes apparent. As discussed below under traffic hazards, relocating the site elsewhere will allow for reduced traffic and congestion, and corresponding enhancement of safety, without reducing the size of the overall project.2. Traffic hazardsAt the second community outreach meeting, there was a presentation of the remediation being done at the interchange between Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460 and U.S. 58. Much of the discussion related to the traffic signal at the U.S. 58 West offramp to Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460. One speaker, a truck driver, also raised concerns about being able to get from that off ramp to the proposed left turn lane into the Port 460 location.Many speakers expressed concerns about traffic backing up onto U.S. 58 because of the traffic signal. While the Matan representatives brushed aside such concerns, the Matan traffic engineer did not. He admitted that the improvements were only a stopgap measure, and that further remediation would be needed.In my view, the truck driver who spoke made perhaps the most important point. A truck exiting U.S. 58 at that point will have to stop at Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460, even though there is a right turn lane, because they will need to be sure that all lanes of northwest bound traffic are clear, in order to cross all lanes of Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460 to reach the left turn lane. That stopping will back up more vehicles, many, or even most, of which will be trucks, onto U.S. 58 West. This is exactly the problem experienced at the U.S. 58/Godwin Boulevard interchange. As these trucks hurry to cross the multiple lanes of traffic, the risk of accidents with other trucks, or with passenger vehicles, is very troubling.The developer’s estimate is that there will be at least 3,000 trucks per day traveling this route. Simple arithmetic indicates that is more than two trucks per minute, 24 hours per day. It is painfully obvious that this number of trucks can not help but back up. With that number of trucks passing through this interchange, there Also will be a backup in the left turn lane into the Port 460 development on Pruden Boulevard. The developer says the distance between the interchange and the turn point is approximately 1,700 feet.Allowing for truck and trailer lengths of 70 feet, plus several feet for spacing, that distance allows for, at most, 24 trucks. It will likely be less. Even that number will accumulate in little over 10 minutes. What will the duration of the left turn signal be for these trucks? It will need to be several minutes long to clear that backlog in a reasonable time. Oncoming traffic will surely become frustrated and that will cause tempers to rise, and create more dangerous situations.However, since it doesn’t appear that it really is necessary for the project to be located at this dangerous interchange, the idea of an alternate site, created by using multiple other locations becomes especially attractive. Not only will it allow the developers to build the full project desired, but it has the double benefits of being located near other similar uses, and of reducing the amount of traffic added to a single location, along with its corresponding dangers to the public.In addition, as has been pointed out by Mike Host in his correspondence, U.S. 460 is the single most dangerous road in Virginia, with U.S. 58 a very close second. A disproportionate number of the accidents and fatalities involve trucks. Adding thousands of daily truck trips to these roads can only increase the accidents and fatalities significantly.other hazard involves Kings Fork Road. When this was brought up at the second community outreach meeting, the Matan representatives hemmed and hawed, but had no answer to concerns over safety on Kings Fork Road. In fact it is a more dangerous road, despite that the affected part of it is very short. It is a narrow road, with deep ditches and no shoulders. It also has a very severe “S” turn between Pitchkettle Road and Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460. It is inconceivable that trucks, because of their length, and the narrow roadway, will not cross over the centerline in that “S” curve, endangering every vehicle on Kings Fork Road.3. Altering the Comprehensive Plan and ZoningThis project will not comply with either the 2035 Comprehensive Plan or the Suffolk zoning ordinances for the subject property. The proposal is to change the zoning from agricultural to heavy industrial, with conditions. Many of us, my wife and I included, chose our home in Pitchkettle Point because of its charming residential quality, and the fact that the nearby properties were similar in character, with the exception of nearby agricultural land, which we thought added to the charm. We anticipated eventual residential development of the agricultural land, consistent with the surrounding properties. We did not anticipate that we had moved into a location, which, some 10 years later, would become heavy industrial-zoned warehouses.The comprehensive plans are prepared with significant community input. It is something of an agreement between the city and its populace as to the way growth will proceed in coming years. Now, 13 years before the 2035 comprehensive plan’s target date, a change is proposed that amounts to a breach of faith by the city with the community it is supposed to serve. Despite the community input in the preparation of the comprehensive plan, very little public input was obtained to alter it. In fact, the primary public input has been objections raised long after the proposal had been finalized by the developer and staff.There is nothing inherently wrong with changing a comprehensive plan, just as there is nothing inherently wrong with changing zoning. However, zoning is a careful design, ordinarily used to keep incompatible uses from being placed next to each other. Typically it puts like uses of property in areas near one another. Here it is being proposed to be altered to attain exactly the opposite result.The proposal here is to alter the comprehensive plan to deviate from the plan prepared with significant public input, to change it without significant public input. The proposal is to change the zoning of the property so that incompatible properties are separated, to a situation where severely incompatible properties are absurdly close to each other.4. Effect on residential property valuesThere is no doubt that this will significantly diminish the property values of the nearby homes. As one study puts it, “A surefire way to hurt property values and reduce buyer interest in neighborhoods is to make them hard to access due to constant traffic.” Our neighborhood has only one entry/exit, and that is via Pitchkettle Road. We have no alternative. At the community meeting, the Matan representatives described Pitchkettle Road as not suitable for trucks, “in fact, it isn’t much of a road, at all.” While the Matan representatives plan to widen Pitchkettle Road between the project and Kings Fork Road, the only plan to address the remaining portions of Pitchkettle Road is to put up signs indicating “No Trucks.” With all due respect, such signs have been on PitchkettleRoad for years, and they do not stop trucks from using it. Consequently we can look forward to trucks using Pitchkettle Road to avoid traffic on Pruden Boulevard/U.S. 460, causing dangerous travel on Pitchkettle Road, and heavy traffic (including the increased employees from the development racing past the entrance to our neighborhood. This is exactly the type of traffic that is “a surefire way to hurt property values and reduce buyer interest” in the properties along Pitchkettle Road.ConclusionAs you can see from the above, and as I stated in my previous correspondence, I am not opposed to the owner of the property selling his land, or to the developer building this project in Suffolk. My objections are to the decision to build it at the currently planned location, where it will cause danger to all on the roads, where it will cause loss of property values, and where all this is done with inadequate public interaction and contrary to the comprehensive plan.I respectfully request that you vote against the proposed zoning changes and against this development being built as currently proposed.Scott ThomasSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

The letter highlighted the need for a way to connect neighborhoods and provide safe pathways for pedestrians in Suffolk.Our nonprofit, Suffolk Parks and Trails Alliance (“SPTA” , was established in 2020 in order to support quality recreational areas in the city of Suffolk, including safe pathways for pedestrians and cyclists.Many citizens don’t know that the city of Suffolk adopted a Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan in 2017 and incorporated the plan into its Comprehensive Plan for the city. Developed by experts and with public input, this comprehensive plan is accessible to the public on the city’s website at www.suffolkva.us/1519/Guides-and-Resources.Responsive to Reyes’ and, we trust, other citizens’ “call to action” for greater and safer walkability in the city, this plan lays out in detail Suffolk’s planned improvement and expansion of safe corridors for non-motorized travel for both pedestrians and cyclists.SPTA’s mission is to raise public awareness of and help raise funds for those safe corridors that enhance quality of life for the citizens of Suffolk. With the public’s support, we trust these planned enhancements will come to fruition in Suffolk for the health, safety and enjoyment of its citizens as well as its visitors.Learn more about Suffolk Parks and Trails Alliance on our Facebook page.Katherine CrossSuffolkEzequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

suffolknewsherald_2022_35,"Published 4:06 pm Tuesday, December 13, 2022ByLetters to the EditorEditor:At the end of a November City Council working session, Mayor Duman noted that: Suffolk isn’t average, we are not a one-size-fits-all type community … we need good information to help make decisions.I applaud these comments that were in response to the 2045 Comprehensive Plan update given by a hired consultant.I’d like to expand on a few notable elements from this presentation, specifically regarding agriculture.For reference, Suffolk has more than 70,000 acres of active farmland and close to 250 farms that generate more than $55 million in annual revenue, according to the USDA Agriculture Census.Impressively, out of 98 counties at the state level, Suffolk ranks sixth overall for crop production. We come in at ninth for grain and soy, third for cotton, and second for hay production. On a national level, our greenhouse and flower production rank in the top 7%. Suffolk poultry, egg, and hog production also rank near 20% nationally. We should be proud of our ability to produce.During the same working session, the consultant compared Suffolk with Savannah, Charlotte, Charleston and Richmond, despite each having very different economies and larger populations than Suffolk. For example, Charlotte is near nine times our population.But since we are doing a comparison, using the same agriculture data previously referenced, Suffolk generates higher revenues and has higher rankings than all four of those referenced cities, combined! Who would have thought little old Suffolk would make such a big impact in a sector that gets so little attention from an economic and planning perspective.When I hear planners talk about development, they say we need to “balance” growth with the existing rural presence. The word “balance” sounds neutral, but it is completely misleading. You can build a subdivision or a warehouse almost anywhere. But you can’t just start a farm anywhere.Suffolk is home to thousands of acres of prime, productive farmland. Once a farm is covered with concrete and asphalt, it’s a multi-generational loss.Suffolk is a leader in agriculture. Let’s embrace that and not compromise it in exchange for the latest fad. Let’s stick to our heritage – it’s what got the city to where it is today.Moving forward, we need better data to inform what truly benefits the city and protects the productive industries that are already here. I encourage City Council to ask for the complete data and not just accept the superficial summaries provided in staff reports. If there isn’t enough time to review the information, change the process so you have more time. Details matter and, in the end, what’s at stake for all of us is everything.Bryan HarrisSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_293,"Published 8:12 pm Friday, August 19, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:I attended the public hearing on the Port 460 Project Wednesday. Because I didn’t arrive early enough, I was one of the hundred or so people who were only able to watch the hearing on the screens in the foyer, and, due to insufficient time being allowed for public comment, I was not permitted to council.I have written to the council twice previously on this matter, on July 19 and again on Aug. 7. My intent last evening was not to revisit the points made there, but to bring up a new matter. However, I do want to summarize my previous correspondence for context. Those emails dealt with four topics: (1 the inappropriate location of the planned project based only on the preferences of the developer; (2 the severe traffic hazards that will result on all three affected roads (Pruden/460, Pitchkettle Road, and Kings Fork ; (3 the alteration of the zoning to be inconsistent with the 2035 Comprehensive Plan without adequate public input; and (4 the inevitable diminution of property values this will cause for homeowners in the areas surrounding the project.In addition to last night’s meeting, I also attended Matan’s public outreach meeting on Aug. 4. I have yet to hear any of these issues addressed in a meaningful way. The location question was answered with “other sites don’t meet our criteria.” Perhaps so, but without disclosing the criteria, who can know if there aren’t other possibilities. There certainly appear to be several and no other reason is given not to consider them. A comment was made at the hearing, if this project is turned down, it will “just go down the road,” presumably to another town. There is no evidence of that. In fact, there appear to be other locations within Suffolk that could support this project.Traffic issues, caused specifically by the proposed location, are brushed off with “trucks are coming anyway.” That is likely, but misses the point. This location significantly adds to the traffic hazards. That is not “coming anyway.” Yet, the real issues have been ignored.Questions about the zoning changes being in opposition to the 2035 Comprehensive Plan are greeted with “it’s only a plan; we can change it.” More on that follows.Loss of value of residential properties has not been mentioned in any setting. It is apparently viewed as a non-issue. I can assure you that is not the case for the nearby residents.A new matter for your considerationWhen my Aug. 7 correspondence appeared in the Suffolk News-Herald, on Aug. 12 (online , the paper’s Editorial Board also ran an Editorial (Raise the bar economically, Aug. 12, 2022 , which, I was delighted to see, agrees with me on this issue. While pointing out just how controversial the Port 460 Project is in this community, it acknowledges the progress made in attracting businesses to Suffolk, and urges the council to consider the input of the people of Suffolk, and to set their standards higher.The Editorial, in a sense, is saying that the City of Suffolk, in consultation with its citizens (who are after all the city, as Tim Johnson mentioned last evening , need to formulate a plan for the way Suffolk wants to see itself in the future, and urges that Suffolk’s future move on, from simply being, as one wag put it, “the warehouse capital of America.” What next? Should we give up the Peanut Festival in favor of a Warehouse Festival?I agree with the Editorial, that Suffolk needs (a to set its sights higher, and (b with public input, determine what it sees as its future. However, I can’t help but observe that such a plan for the future has already been prepared in the 2035 Comprehensive Plan! That was done with significant public input, yet, with nowhere near the same public input, it is now proposed to adopt a zoning change that would radically alter that 2035 Comprehensive Plan more than 13 years before its target date! To that objection, the Council has said, “it’s only a plan; we can change it.”This flippant response to a serious objection runs parallel to earlier statements by the council to the effect that traffic concerns are not an important consideration because “we did all that was required.” Both of these responses show little or no consideration of the views of the people of Suffolk, and the safety of its citizens.If the Comprehensive Plan is prepared with significant public input, then it should be considered to be the will of the people of Suffolk, and the character of the areas defined in it should not be changed without similar public input to the original plan.The answers that “we did all that was required” and “it’s only a plan, we can change it” amount to saying, “If we check all the boxes we can do as we please. We don’t need to worry about what the people want (or how it impacts them .”With all due respect, these attitudes are unworthy of the positions of the council as the leaders of our community.There are two roads set before the council. You can take the “low road” and bury your head in the sand, ignoring the views of the public, or you can take the “high road” and listen to the people that make up this city.As I have said previously, I do not oppose growth. I do not oppose Mr. Williams selling his property. I do not oppose the warehouses being built in Suffolk. I oppose them being built in this location in light of the traffic and safety concerns, the zoning changes that contradict the Comprehensive Plan, and the inevitable negative impact on residential properties.I urge the council to “take the high road” and vote against this project being in this location.Scott ThomasSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_5,"A little more than eight months ago, I endorsed Kentucky state Sen. Morgan McGarvey’s candidacy for Congress. While I normally avoid endorsements in primaries, I wanted to make sure that our nominee would be able to retain the only seat in the Kentucky federal delegation held by a Democrat. I was confident McGarvey could do that.The rest is history; McGarvey is a few weeks from taking the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives that I have been honored to hold for the past 16 years. I strongly support his candidacy, and I look forward to calling him my congressman.Obviously, I have a significant stake in that race, both personal and professional. But this year is very different. I believe I have a personal and professional stake in every race on the ballot across the country, and so does everyone who is reading this or not.In the summer of 2019, I addressed the Louisville Downtown Rotary Club. My speech was about the issues I considered the most important for our society to have a viable future. But before I got to the meat of the speech, I said, “If you don’t think that we face the greatest threat to American democracy in our history, you’re not paying attention.” I believe that threat has only grown in the last three years, to the extent that this year’s elections — federal, state and local — may well determine whether our 246-year experiment as a government of, by and for the people comes to an end.At least 300 Republican candidates for various offices still publicly say they do not believe Joe Biden was legitimately elected President of the United States. In more than half the states, policies have been proposed or enacted that will make voting more difficult, especially for minority voters. Many states are rolling back women’s rights to their bodily autonomy. School boards across the country are censoring books certain parents don’t like, and they, along with state legislatures, are regulating what teachers may say about our country’s racial history and other topics.Conveniently, the vast majority, if not all, of these efforts are coming from Republicans. Indeed, the once respectable GOP — a party I once claimed — has become the anti-democracy, anti-freedom party, and it needs to be repudiated forcefully.Of course, I have Republican friends, both in and out of Congress. I know most of them believe in democracy. They know our elections are run fairly and honestly. They know that the most vociferous election deniers are wrong. They know, for example, that Critical Race Theory is not taught in elementary and high schools around the country. They know that Donald Trump is a pathological liar and a narcissistic sociopath. They are essentially good people.Yet they accept the lies, the bigotry, the disinformation, and everything else that threatens our democracy, and it truly saddens me. I wish they would think about their legacies.I am not politically naïve enough to think that we Kentuckians who care about our democracy will deal a stunning defeat to Republican candidates in our Commonwealth this year. But we can strike a blow by turning out in massive numbers on Nov. 8, and help defeat Republicans at every level, or at least scare the hell out of them. We can reject the two constitutional amendments, neither of which would serve any interests except partisan ones. We can show, by helping to defeat Amendment 2 — which would pave the way for a total ban on abortions rights in Kentucky — that Republican cynics have miscalculated, as they did in Kansas, the popularity of their policies.Finally, we can start, on Nov. 9, a year-round effort to protect our democracy by re-electing Gov.

suffolknewsherald_2022_23,"Published 7:17 pm Friday, July 29, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor,My wife and I reside in Pitchkettle Point subdivision, located near the proposed rezoning area. We also attended the Planning Commission meeting on July 19 and were among the many people who sought to speak out on this issue, but were not permitted to speak.Like my neighbors in Pitchkettle Point, as well as those in the Pitchkettle Farm neighborhood and others, when we relocated to Suffolk nearly 10 years ago, what attracted us to this part of Suffolk was the lovely and quiet neighborhood, with good access to downtown and to the Route 58 Bypass. We were aware of the neighboring farmland, which is now the subject of rezoning, but understood from the Suffolk 2035 Comprehensive Plan that this area was a Suburban Use District. Consequently, we expected that one day this property would be sold and used for residential purposes, but we never would have dreamed it would be considered for heavy industrial use. Had we known that, we would have looked elsewhere for a home.While we were not familiar with the definition of a Suburban Use District, from the name we would certainly not have expected it to include several million square feet of warehouses, thousands of daily truck arrivals and departures, and many thousands of daily employee trips. What’s more, all this is said to be accomplished with only minor improvement of a short stretch of Pruden Boulevard (Route 460 and an even shorter stretch of Pitchkettle Road.While it is expected that most of the traffic will use the Pruden Boulevard route, the maps provided by the developer show that there will be multiple entrances on Pitchkettle Road. It is inconceivable that some trucks, and most employees, will not use Pitchkettle Road to avoid the truck traffic on Pruden Boulevard. But Pitchkettle Road is a narrow, two-lane, rural road, barely adequate for the traffic it now receives. I have no idea how many vehicles per hour Pitchkettle Road now handles, but it has been increasing, and this development will undoubtedly multiply it several times over.We have sincere and serious objections to this project being placed in this location, and to the lack of public input in the city’s process of approval.The widening of these roads over only a small portion of their length will make it worse, not better, as the vehicles will then have to squeeze down from multiple lanes to only one lane. The developer has said that trucks will not travel on the two lane portion of Pitchkettle Road, because signage will prohibit this. With respect, there were signs prohibiting trucks there in recent years. There were still trucks on Pitchkettle Road. Signs are not the answer.Traffic information has not been made available to the public, but we have personally observed an increase in both automobile and tractor-trailer traffic on Pitchkettle Road in the past year. Adding thousands of employee cars and many thousands of trucks to the area will certainly create the kind of traffic that will harm our property values. This is the city taking the value of our properties without due process of law.At the July 19 Planning Commission meeting a large number of people, including my wife and I, indicated a desire to speak, but were not able to do so. The developer repeatedly mentioned that they had “engaged with the community,” but it was clear that they meant that they had spoken with Planning Department staff. With respect, the Planning Department staff is not the same as the public, and especially the residents of properties in the area impacted by this project.At the July 20 City Council meeting Councilman Tim Johnson pointed out the lack of opportunity for public input. In response Mayor Mike Duman indicated that required steps had been taken. The required steps may have been taken, but when the proposed change isn’t merely a zoning change, by itself, but is also contrary to the 2035 Comprehensive Plan, checking those boxes is simply not enough.Presumably the 2035 Comprehensive Plan was developed with input from the public. Yet, now it is to be disregarded, some 12 years before its consummation, without seeking similar input. That is entirely inadequate and smacks of governing by stealth. Now the City of Suffolk wants public input on a 2045 Comprehensive Plan. Why? Why should anyone participate in a plan that is so readily ignored?This development is tantamount to dishonesty by the City of Suffolk in its Comprehensive Plan, by seducing people into buying in a Suburban area, then turning it into a warehouse or industrial area with little warning. The result will be significantly lower home values for all nearby residents, caused by vastly increased heavy truck traffic and enormously increased car traffic, increased noise and diminished safety for all, as the volume of traffic increases.We are not opposed to growth, nor are we opposed to a development such as this one. We are opposed to having this type of development adjacent to a residential neighborhood, contrary to the implied promise the city has made in its comprehensive plans.I respectfully request that the City Council reject this proposed use.Scott ThomasSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_3,"While workplace DEI was born of the best intentions, it has been poorly implemented. Fairness is a zero-sum game — the workplace is either fair for all or fair for none.Black women have finally caught up. On Sept. 21,Black Women’s Equal Pay Dayhighlighted the additional time Black women needed to work to earn the same as the average U.S. white man in 2021.It is an alarming realization: Black women needed to labor for nine additional months simply to earn the same as their white male colleagues do in one year. Today, Black women only bring home58 centsfor every dollar the average white man earns — an income disparity that adds up to a staggering$907,680lost over a Black woman’s career.This pattern holds true in our region. Black women in the Philadelphia area earnsignificantly lessthan white men.Concerningly, the wage gap prevails despite the fact that Black women are completing four-year college degrees at rapidlyincreasing rates. Higher education may be helping others get ahead, but Black women are finding that obtaining a degree does not translate to pay equity. A regional analysis of Census Bureau data conducted by The Inquirer found that college-educated Black workers makesignificantly lessthan their peers.Systemic racism, sexism, and discrimination perpetuate the wage gap. Black women are hired more slowly, not prioritized for mentorship, subjected to frequent microaggressions, and promoted less frequently.These factors are not just about dollar amounts — they also limit Black women’s life expectancy. Decades of research have established that experiencing racial discrimination results in chronic stress, which elevates cortisol levels (the stress hormone and can lead to diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and other obesity-related syndromes.Over 74,000Black Americans die unnecessarily each year from diseases that are the result of these pervasive health inequities, including chronic stress.According to Black women, theworkplace is one of the greatest sources of stress, making tackling workplace disparities an essential step toward achieving health equity. Some might argue that this effort is already underway, citing decades of workplacediversity, equity, and inclusion programming. But this programming has failed to move the needle.Black women are still significantly underrepresented in workplace leadership.Black women make up 7.4% of the U.S. population, yet only 1.6% of VP roles and 1.4% of executive positions. White men, in contrast, account for 35% of the U.S. population, 57% of VP roles, and 68% of executive roles.Furthermore, a survey conducted last year by theGallup Center on Black Voicesfound that only23%of Black women are likely to say their organization is fair to everyone.While workplace DEI was born of the best intentions, it has been poorly implemented. Research conducted byBersin, a Deloitte partner, suggests that about80% of companies are “just going through the motions”instead of holding themselves accountable.If diversity, equity, and inclusion programming is not the solution we once hoped for, then what is?The answer may lie in the often-overlooked link between fair working environments and overall improvements in business performance.Today’s workplaces are not fair. Fairness is a zero-sum game — the workplace is either fair for all or fair for none. When employees are polled, they typically describefairness as feeling respected, appreciated for their work, and encouraged to strive for more. These are all valuable feelings that, if fostered in a workplace, would make it more successful.So, the final question remains: How do we achieve fair?» READ MORE:How Pennsylvania women can achieve equal payThe first step is understanding where your organization stands. What practices and policies are in place, and are they fair? How do you measure up against other organizations relative to gender and racial equity?Then, determine where you need to go. Work with employees to better understand what changes are needed such that they feel they are treated fairly. If your workplace is not fair for all, make it so.We have an obligation to keep future generations of Black girls from experiencing the repercussions of an unfair workplace. If we can achieve fairness, then we will have made an essential step toward health equity.Linda Goler Blount is president and CEO of the Black Women’s Health Imperative."
minnpost_2022_28,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In 2017, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey criticized then-Mayor Betsy Hodges for what he called a “massive uptick in violent crime, specifically shootings” and poor police-community relations. He wanted voters to know that public safety is “the mayor’s job” and that “the police report exclusively to the chief and the chief reports exclusively to the mayor.”To be fair to Hodges, Minneapolis’s homicide rate has nearly tripled since Frey took over. Shootings and carjackings have also exploded. In 2021, 650 residents were shot and residents reported 640 carjackings. And at least 54 have been shot so far this year, compared with 31 in the same span in 2021.Police-community relations under Frey are seemingly worse than ever. After two years of Frey leading the MPD, Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, businesses burned, and Frey allowed protesters to sack the Third Precinct. Since then, around 300 police officers have left, including the widely respected Chief Medaria Arradondo. Our remaining officers are stretched too thin. The MPD lacks the manpower needed to solve crimes and serve justice.These facts warrant Frey’s removal. Still, it was not surprising he was reelected. He claimed he learned a lot from his first term and was backed by endorsements, press, big money, and a barrage of campaign material.While the voters have spoken, we need to establish a baseline of accountability because we cannot stand another four years like Frey’s first term and the direction we are headed is not good. Our city’s future hinges on a need for bold, transparent leadership.On Feb. 2, an MPD officer killed 22-year-old Amir Locke in a no-knock warrant early morning raid. Bodycam video shows police using a key to enter an apartment and rushing in with flashlights and guns pointed, yelling commands over one another. Seconds later, an officer kicks the back of a couch and a young man under a blanket starts to rise. He is holding a gun and he is shot three times before getting fully upright. Mr. Locke was not a target of the warrant. He had a license to carry a gun.Locke’s death is an enormous tragedy for his family, this city, and the good men and women of the MPD.This is just the latest incident calling into question Frey’s effectiveness as the MPD’s top boss. If you were surprised by the fact that the MPD conducted a no-knock warrant, you are not alone. Frey proclaimed to voters that he banned the use of no-knock warrants. His reelection campaign website even touted the supposed ban as one of his “top achievements.” It has come to light since Locke’s death, however, that the MPDdid not in fact stop using no-knock warrants.Frey clearly has some explaining to do. Subsequently, the statement about banning no-knock warrants has been removed from Frey’s website.News recently broke that Frey’s hand-picked interim chief recently promoted a once-fired MPD officer to lead all police training (and promoted other officers with checkered pasts to other positions .It seems unbelievably ironic that the same mayor who in 2020 declared that Minnesota law should be changed to prohibit fired cops from being reinstatedto any positionin the force would allow the promotion of a once-fired cop to lead all police training with no explanation.Meantime, Frey’s star is on the rise.Voguemagazine is the latest publication to feature him. A resident’s quote seemingly sums up the article’s crux. “It’s just a really impossible situation.”I strongly disagree with that general sentiment. But mounting evidence indicates it might be true under this mayor.Clint Conner is a Minneapolis resident, husband, father to three girls, caretaker for a dog and two cats, lawyer, and former mayoral candidate."
suffolknewsherald_2022_285,"Published 6:32 pm Tuesday, August 30, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:For months now the citizens of Suffolk have been told, “The trucks are coming,” because the Port of Norfolk is expanding. On the surface this seems logical given trucks travel U.S. 58 every day to and from the port, and a bigger port means more trucks right? VDOT does not see it that way.VDOT’s transportation engineers now use a computer program to analyze current conditions and project future changes in freight traffic on state roads. The public can view the interactive maps for current and projected changes at https: www.vtrans.org/mid-term-planning/freight-plan.VDOT does not show Suffolk’s future truck traffic increases as being significant. The interactive maps shows Interstate 95 and Interstate 85 currently have high to very high truck traffic. U.S. 58 from the Chesapeake line to the end of the bypass currently has medium truck traffic. The other roads in Suffolk currently have low truck traffic.Future projections out to 2045 show a different story. VDOT “truck flow growth ratios” show little to no growth on both Interstate 95 and Interstate 85. Very high growth ratios are anticipated for both the Hampton Roads and the Monitor Merrimac Bridge Tunnels. Interstate 64 and Route 17 will have high growth ratios. U.S. 58 is projected to go from a medium to a high truck flow growth ratio. U.S. 460’s current low truck flow rate is projected to stay low well into the 2040s.VDOT is planning on the truck traffic generated by the Port of Norfolk expansion to increase truck traffic primarily on Interstate 64 and Route 17. A smaller increase in truck traffic is anticipated for U.S. 58. U.S. 460 is projected to see a low increase in truck traffic. So while most truck traffic to and from the Port of Norfolk will use the Peninsula, some will be coming to U.S. 58. The changes currently happening on U.S. 58 are a result of VDOT’s research and planning.The proposed 5 million square foot warehouse complex on U.S. 460 does not seem like a wise decision. The project will increase traffic from the current 25,000 vehicles a day to over 47,000 vehicles a day. Should we nearly double the congestion on a road VDOT projects to have a low increase in truck traffic?Unlike what we are being told, no large numbers of trucks are coming to U.S. 460, unless we add a truck warehouse complex. While Suffolk traffic engineers maybe planning to widen U.S. 460, it is not in VDOT’s six year plan. Can you guess who is going to pay for this road widening project to nowhere?

minnpost_2022_90,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Connections to our cultural backgrounds have a healing power, and we need to create and maintain spaces and areas across our city that honor diverse cultures and support cross-cultural solidarity. The creation of seven designated cultural districts, as part of Minneapolis’s 2040 plan, recognizes the importance of cultural vibrancy in a city’s future. East Lake Street is one of the cultural corridors, which serve as a way to organize investment in an area and build on existing community-driven efforts like Lake Street Alignment.Rich in cultural diversity, Lake Street has long been a place of hope and entrepreneurism, of community and connection, even with fundamental inequities laid bare. For decades, different cultural communities have established businesses, arts organizations, nonprofits, faith centers, restaurants and homes along this main street. Culture is the heart of Lake Street, and as we revitalize the area, we must proceed in a way that truly centers equity, honors culture and promotes cross-cultural solidarity.This moment is an opportunity to do community development differently.It is not enough to reconstruct buildings destroyed in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. We must also repair our social fabric, a truth that becomes more apparent every day.Lake Street Alignment, a collaborative community development initiative, has made strides to do just that.In fall 2021, Lake Street business and property owners, residents, community and cultural organizations, institutions, business associations, major employers and arts groups participated in the grassroots-driven Lake Street Alignment. With initial support from the McKnight Foundation, we began a process to listen to our fellow community members, align visions and strategies for revitalizing Lake Street, and identify existing projects that promote local ownership and equity — and need funding.To date, Lake Street Alignment has engaged more than 400 people, 153 organizations, 49 property owners and over 128 Black, Indigenous, African immigrant and Latinx businesses. Broad participation in the process reflected our community’s desire to dig in.Lake Street Alignment has differed from typical main street revitalization initiatives. As community residents and leaders from different cultural groups that often shoulder the burden of neglect, we felt heard and invited into the strategic planning process. We were not there to affirm an already decided effort. We felt ownership and agency in decisions that would impact our businesses, families and lives.A new public-private initiative called theGroundBreak Coalitionis mobilizing to raise “$2 billion of flexible private, public, and philanthropic capital…to disrupt the status quo, close long-standing racial disparities, and transform communities.” We applaud the effort.Authors Abe Demmaj, Kelly Drummer and Alicia D. Smith are leaders in the Lake Street Alignment initiative, a collaborative community engagement and planning process designed to reimagine and rebuild Lake Street with racial, economic and environmental justice at its core.

suffolknewsherald_2022_114,"Published 5:50 pm Friday, April 15, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonSpring means Easter — bunnies, hidden eggs, children and fun times.Easter is all these things but, like so much else in our lives, Easter has a deeper meaning, sometimes ignored or not known. It is a time of reflection, of sadness, then a time of joyful reassurance, something we need right now. This world and some of its leaders are no different than they were thousands of years ago.That was when the people of the Jewish faith were in bondage in Egypt, oppressed and crying out to God. God chose an answer that might seem strange to us. He chose Moses, who was able to obtain the release of God’s people by God’s sending what we know as 10 plagues.The last plague was the most serious. It required the sacrifice of an animal and its blood to be placed over the doorposts of their houses. The death angel would be coming that night and when the angel saw the blood, it would “pass over” that dwelling. Those who did not have the blood in place lost their firstborn, including their beasts (Exodus 11. That was the beginning of the Jewish Pesach, or Passover, as we know it today. It is still commemorated by the faithful after thousands of years. They still look for “Elijah” to return. They have missed what the New Testament scriptures told about the coming of a Redeemer for everyone, including Israel.What meaning does Passover have for non-Jewish people like Christians? Why do we celebrate? We believe in the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the need of a Savior. We believe what John’s Gospel said about Jesus, that He came as the Lamb of God to take away the sins of the world. We believe His blood had to be shed to cover our sins. We are unworthy and unable to get into the presence of a holy God without being forgiven. We are sinners, “There is none righteous, no not one… ” (Romans 3:10. Two thousand years ago Rome was the political power, the religious rulers the spiritual powers, not entirely unlike our conditions today. Rome celebrated a goddess known as Eostre. That is the likely reason we call this season Easter. In time what the Romans believed about celebrating their goddess became a part of the Christian celebration.This week in Christian history is called “holy week.” It is always celebrated in the spring, the same as the Jewish Passover. It was about the same time as when Jesus was crucified.Jesus had done many miracles, and had been able to confront the “spiritual elitists” who wanted Him dead. They were fearful of losing power with the Roman governors. At that Passover Jesus knew He was coming to the end of his three years on earth. He had been sent to die for our sins.Palm Sunday begins the last week of His life. The adherents thought He would end in triumph as He rode through the streets on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9 . They were trying to proclaim Him King, but kings don’t ride on donkeys; they ride on horses. That day is yet to come when everything about Jesus will be fulfilled (see Revelation. On Friday we remembered those last moments of the crucifixion. It was about the ninth hour, or 3 in the afternoon. Is it a coincidence or just a reminder that the Seder, the Jewish Passover, is celebrated starting at 6 p.m.? Both of these have come together this year, 2022, on the same day, Sunday, April 17. The Jewish date does not change. The Christian calendar and celebration is set by the moon changes, the equinox. The significance cannot be ignored. Something happened that changed history forever.It is not by chance that the Old Testament scripture writers have told of a time when God was going to send a deliverer. When we pull apart what the God of Eternity, the Creator, has told us we find every book in the Bible has something God wanted us to know.The Bible is a history book of truth. Even Balaam the dishonest prophet saw it (Numbers 24 , Job knew it (19:25 , Daniel had a message (Chapter 12 , and Isaiah and the other prophets wrote almost exactly about what was to take place.We rejoice in a risen Savior because what the Bible said about Him happened just as Isaiah said it would: “He was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him and by His stripes we are healed.” (Chapter 53 Sunday is Resurrection Day. The tomb in which Jesus was laid is empty. Let us be glad and rejoice as we await the return for His people.

suffolknewsherald_2022_74,"Published 6:22 pm Tuesday, May 31, 2022ByStaff ReportsWe’re inspired daily by the work of Suffolk’s many nonprofit organizations and honored by the opportunity to tell their stories on our pages.Last week’s Arise Suffolk gala at the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts added two important ones to our list. As reporter Rachel Austin writes on today’s front page, Hope Center Ministries and Cornerstone Ballet drew more than 150 generous people for an evening of dance, moving testimonies and fundraising for an important cause: the fight against drug addiction.Actually, our regular readers were already familiar with the Hope Center, which was the subject of a property rezoning and conditional use permit on Holland Road in April. Mayor Mike Duman, in remarks at Thursday’s gala, noted that few zoning decisions are no-brainers for the elected officials who make them, but clearing the way for Hope Center Ministries to serve up to 33 women struggling with drug and alcohol addiction was an easy one.In a pair of unanimous votes, Duman and his colleagues rezoned 1.9 acres at 1654 Holland Road from residential low-medium zoning to office-institutional and approved a conditional use permit because the facility is not a by-right use in the office-institutional zoning district.The center’s founder, Rachael Culbertson, captivated gala attendees with her own inspiring journey from Nansemond-Suffolk Academy graduate to inmate at the Western Tidewater Regional Jail to sober, successful mother, wife and now founder and director of a nonprofit organization that will work to lift others from the despair of addiction.The Suffolk location will be the 35th for Hope Ministries and its fourth in Virginia. The ministry uses a Christian-based 12-step program as residents work through a Bible-based curriculum. It is funded up to 67% by its vocational training program, allowing residents to pay a smaller amount, with the rest of its yearly funding coming through fundraising, grants and donations from local churches and the community.Thursday night’s proceeds were a huge boost for both the Hope Center and Cornerstone Ballet, founded by Amanda Short. She too inspired gala-goers by recounting her own brush with the dangers of drug addiction as a competitive dancer.Mike Dail’s heartbreaking tribute to his deceased daughter, Tori Dale, a former standout volleyball player at NSA, reminded the audience that no family, regardless of income or social status, is immune from the tragedy of drug addiction. Tori, after becoming addicted to opioids via a legitimate prescription to treat pain for an injury, overdosed on heroin in 2016.Thanks to the Hope Center and Cornerstone Ballet, future lives will be saved from the ravages of addiction. We hope the community will continue its generous support of both.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_10,"The Wyoming congresswoman placed her commitment to truth — and to democracy — over her partisan interests. It s time for Democrats to do something equally bold.Democracy is on the ballot.That’s what my fellow Democratshave been saying for the past two years, as Republicans attacked voting rights and elections. Behind the GOP campaignlies the Big Lie: that Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, won the 2020 contest for the White House.If democracy is indeed on the ballot, then I believe Biden should make a key change to his ballot as well. Specifically, he should select Liz Cheney as his vice presidential candidate.I can almost hear you gasp, dear reader. But let me explain.This is an out-there idea, I know. But it’s not nearly as out-there as the death cult that has seized the Republican Party, which seems bent on destroying our democratic system. And we must do everything we can to save it.“I can almost hear you gasp, dear reader.”Cheney, of course, is the most prominent Republican to break with the party over Trump’s election falsehoods. Serving on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol,she was steadfast in denouncing Trumpand the GOP sycophants who continue to back his baseless claims.That cost Cheney her congressional seat in Wyoming, where Republican voters elected her primary challengerby a whopping 37-point margin. Since then, she has hinted at making her own run for the presidency. Last month, she said she will be doing “whatever it takes” to keep Donald Trump out of office.» READ MORE:Liz Cheney’s lonely fight against the extremist wing of the GOP | EditorialThe best way to do that is to join hands with Biden, who has also emphasized the threats posed to democracy by the GOP. Last week, Biden told a Maryland audience thatTrump-aligned Republicans were verging on “semi-fascism.”Speaking in Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday, heblasted those who refuse to condemn the Jan. 6 insurrection. And Thursday, he’ll take the stage outside Independence Hall to deliver a rare prime-time speech describing our current moment as a “battle for the soul of the nation,” according to a White House press briefing.He’s right. This year, Republican voters nominated over 100 candidates for statewide office or Congresswho have repeated Trump’s false claims of election fraud in 2020. The list includes Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, who attended the Jan. 6 “Stop the Steal” rally at the Capitol andpaid for charter buses to ferry 135 supporters there. He also participated in an attempt to send a slate of bogus electors to Congress who would deliver Pennsylvania to Trump.Other GOP leaders have avoided echoing Trump’s lies but have lined up behind candidates who spout them. That Hall of Shame includes Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely aspirant for the White House in 2024, who has appeared at campaign rallies for Mastriano and thetruth-challenged Ohio Senate nominee J.D. Vance.This is how fascism — or, as Biden called it, semi-fascism — begins. You recite the Big Lie, over and over again, until people start to think it’s true. Nearlythree-quarters of the GOP think there was election fraud in 2020.Liz Cheney refused to go along with that, placing her commitment to truth — and to democracy — over her partisan interests. Now the Democrats need to do something equally bold, by placing her on their ticket in 2024.That would mean replacing Vice President Kamala Harris, which would surely anger progressives and people of color in the party. But if GOP election-deniers win, who will suffer the biggest losses? People of color, of course. Mastriano has proposedseverely curtailing mail-in ballots, for example, which will surely make it harder for Black and brown people to vote.Many Democrats won’t be pleased with a vice president who opposes abortion rights, gun control, and most other liberal positions. But Liz Cheney supports democracy, which should be our first priority.And if you can’t stomach the idea of Harris getting dumped, here’s another idea: Biden steps down, the Democrats nominate Harris for president, and she makes Cheney her running mate. That would be fine by me. But it’s not fine to carry on as if these were normal times when we know they’re not.If we truly believe that democracy is in mortal peril, we need to start acting like it.

minnpost_2022_100,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As far as my employer, the American Jewish Committee (AJC , is concerned, it doesn’t matter who you support to be Minnesota secretary of state.The AJC has long been nonpartisan and we have cordial and productive relationships with members of both parties.That makes it easier for us to call someone out when they are behaving badly. Kim Crockett is behaving very badly.Crockett seems to enjoy careening from one controversy to the next, ones often of her own making. But now Crockett has veered into the antisemitic lane and shifted into high gear. She needs to hit the brakes. Now.Crockett’s latest episode of ugliness emerged at the Republican state convention, where a video of hers contained an image of billionaire Jewish philanthropist George Soros — a frequent target of antisemites and conspiracy theorists — as a puppet master manipulating the strings of DFL Secretary of State Steve Simon and election lawyer Marc Elias. Both are also Jewish.The puppet master imagery is a classic antisemitic trope. As AJC’s Translate Hate glossary notes, “Jews have been accused of puppeteering the world economy for centuries, having been associated with money since the Middle Ages when commerce, trade, and other financial industries were the only professions Jews were allowed to have.”GOP Chair David Hann, to his credit, attempted damage control when he released a statement in which he apologized and said it “should not have happened.” He continued, “I have concluded after talking with Ms. Crockett that the depiction of Mr. Soros was not intended as anti-Semitic, and that neither Ms. Crockett nor her creative team were aware that the depiction of a puppet-master invokes an old but persistent anti-Semitic trope.”Hann may be sorry. But you know who’s not? Kim Crockett. Notoriously media-averse, Crockett sent an email to supporters decrying “contrived and bogus political attacks” with a photo of a Tucker Carlson book resting on her legs. “Let’s laugh and be happy warriors as we knock doors, get our message out to voters and WIN.”Crockett essentially repudiated Hann. She had her chance to echo what Hann said her intentions were or to acknowledge that the puppet master imagery is hurtful. She chose not to. Now we have to ask why.Is it because she relishes her self-styled role as a brash party outsider who won’t be reined in by the party establishment? Is she flipping the bird to reporters outside the right-wing fringe who are naturally curious about her? Or is she simply dispensing with the dog whistles and letting us know how she really feels about Jews in power?These questions are being asked at a time when fears about antisemitism are on the rise in the U.S. The most-recent survey of American Jews by the AJC found 90% believe antisemitism is a problem in the U.S., while 82% believe antisemitism has increased over the last five years. Even more troubling was the finding that 39% have altered their behavior in public or online to conceal the fact they are Jewish. Words really do matter.Even though there’s no doubt about her campaign video, I don’t know whether Kim Crockett is antisemitic. I hope not. We should find out. Crockett’s campaign is all about election integrity. Let’s hope she can muster her own brand of integrity and let us know how she truly feels about Jews.Jacob Millner is director of the Twin Cities regional office for the American Jewish Committee."

eugeneweekly_2022_8,"We ve got issues. We should live in a democracy where the rule of law still holds for all I’ve always considered myself more of a “social justice” guy than a “law and order” person. Not that the two are necessarily in opposition, but growing up in the Civil Rights era and amid Vietnam War protests, I found that law and order were usually on the wrong side of justice. Rather curious then, that I find myself now longing for the triumph of law and order over Mar-a-LawGone. I was too young and too far away to march with Martin Luther King Jr., and the draft ended before I turned 18, so I had no draft card to burn. My only serious brush with the law came when the sheriff of Marion County tried to arrest me and a handful of others in the summer of 2000 for “unlawful prayer.” That’s not what they called it, but that’s what we were doing — praying that is. Whether lawfully or unlawfully wasn’t actually the issue. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. To the credit of the seven deputies that arrived that night — eight if you count the four-legged K-9 team member — they respectfully waited until we finished our prayer in the labor camp. “You are trespassing,” said the deputy in charge. “No,” said I, “we are clergy engaged in our right to attend to the spiritual needs of these workers as guaranteed by Oregon law.” “Do you have a copy of that law?” asked the deputy, as if carrying a copy of the Oregon Revised Statutes is routine for clergy. Bible, check. Hymnal, check. Prayer book, check. Now where did I put my copy of the ORS? Oh yeah, here it is, in my back pocket! “Huh,” said the deputy, reading the photocopy I had made of the relevant statute. “Would you mind remaining here while I call this in?” And so it was that we continued to sing and pray with the farmworkers for an extra 15 minutes — and maybe between prayers we mentioned something about their right to unionize and a few other things about the rights of workers, but gee, my memory has gotten a little fuzzy. But I’ll never forget the deputy’s words when he returned: “You are right, and we will stay here until you are finished to protect your rights as religious leaders.” I am not sure all seven deputies and the K-9 unit were needed to protect those rights. We encountered only one hostile person, the crew boss, who seemed to think we were nothing but union agitators. In reality, we were nothing but religious people, and, well, maybe a little bit union agitators. All for the cause of justice. I learned something very important that night. When the law is in your favor, it is a good thing to have in your back pocket. “An unjust law,” on the other hand, “is no law at all,” wrote Martin Luther King Jr. from the Birmingham jail. Our obligation in this era, if democracy is to survive, is to uphold the just laws and strike down the unjust ones. Can one steal government documents for a just cause? Daniel Ellsberg would say yes, and history has judged his release of the Pentagon Papers as the right call. But hiding top secret documents amidst your framedTimemagazine covers? I am having a hard time seeing any justice in that cause. But here is what I find most disturbing. When David Frost got Richard Nixon to say on national TV, “If the president does it, it’s not illegal,” that sound you heard of the rushing wind was the collective gasp of the nation, Republican and Democrat alike. Everyone — well, maybe not Uncle Jim who always was into those crazy, nonsensical conspiracy theories —everyoneunderstood the bedrock principle that no one in a democracy, not even the president, is above the law. Today it appears that Uncle Jims have taken control of major sections of our society. Now a former occupant of the High Castle can say if he does it (take secret documents home , it’s not illegal, and all his followers say, “That’s right!” Seriously? What country is this? Either we can have a democracy where the rule of law still holds for all, and perhaps we argue over what is just and what is not, or we can have an autocracy where one rules the law over all, and we long for what was just and is now gone by the sea.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_24,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In many ways, 2022 might seem like it was a pretty bad year for Americans on the political right. After all, the year saw record budget deficits, spending bills loaded with corporate welfare, a legally dubious student loan scheme, and disappointing election results for the Republican Party.Despite all this, the year actually had a variety of genuine triumphs that people who believe in limited government ought to celebrate. The Republican Party learned some important lessons in the elections (if it listens , life opened up, markets showed their promise in solving major problems, while federal institutions delivered a few important limited government victories.Let’s start with elections. Fringe candidates lost while competent, limited-government advocates won. Take Georgia: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has a long list of conservative accomplishments in areas ranging from electoral reform to a bureaucracy-light effort to help the state’s poorest residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. He handily beat Democrat Stacey Abrams despite her smarts, celebrity and fundraising acumen. In the same state, Republican Herschel Walker — who indulged in election conspiracy theories and drew little interest — lost a winnable Senate race.The culture-warrior Republicans who won races handily did so because they hadn’t forgotten to govern. Florida’s Ron DeSantis, for example, pursued thoughtful policies on issues ranging from financial literacy education to environmental protection. Voters remembered him for this. Meanwhile, mainstream conservative Joe Lombardo unseated an incumbent Democratic governor in blue-leaning Nevada. Even the one Democratic governor who walked to an easy victory in a purple state — Colorado’s Jared Polis — governs with more than a dash of libertarianism. He supports free trade, stands for civil liberties and wants to eliminate state income taxes.The recognition that COVID-19 is endemic, rather than a pandemic, also presented a step forward for personal freedom. Since March 2020, the country has spent too much and forced counterproductive “public health” measures ranging from plexiglass shields to mask mandates in uncrowded outdoor areas on many Americans. Even though some efforts like vaccination campaigns and short-term lockdowns did good, recognition that “the pandemic is over” weakens the case for restrictive rules.The year also presented some tantalizing evidence that markets will address major problems without government intervention. Massive new market-driven investments in clean energy —most of which would happen without the billions in subsidies Congress approved — are just one piece of evidence that the market will play a major role in dealing with the serious problem of climate change. Innovative private sector firms are doing everything from writing property insurance to storing nuclear waste. Even the (sometimes rightly derided movement for improved Environmental-Social-Governance behavior by big companies has produced some promising results in encouraging companies to take their environmental effects into account without government coercion.This doesn’t even begin to list the other limited-government triumphs that right-of-center Americans can appreciate. The year saw the Supreme Court rule to stop unelected bureaucrats from writing major new laws in West Virginia v. EPA and forbid (in one case unanimously discrimination against religious organizations. While some new legislation passed that will continue to expand the government’s role, the last major new law to pass during 117th Congress — the Respect for Marriage Act — can rightly be counted as a triumph for personal liberty.Overall, 2022 should go down as a pretty good year for those on the political right.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today. The center is forecasting wet and windy weather conditions to persist throughout the day but will decrease in intensity later this afternoon and into the night.7 p.m. update:The Central Pacific Hurricane Center reports as of 5 p.m., Tropical Storm Hone is 125 miles southeast of Hilo with sustained winds of 65 mph moving west at 14 mph.

eugeneweekly_2022_55,"We ve got issues. Remember when performance mattered during political debates? Remember when it came down to whose ideas and proposals were best? It has been many years since we have heard visionaries discuss and debate on the best plan to move us beyond poverty and into a more efficient, responsible and collaborative civic life. Instead, during our latest political cycle, insults, smears and sharp rhetoric took center stage again. Needless to say, I am happy that nasty, mean-spirited, racist and polarizing political ads are ending. At least for now. Candidates are no longer interested in engaging in a dialogue on how to serve voters to address basic needs and to ensure broad participation regardless of political affiliation. Black, Indigenous and People of Color are groups politicians routinely ignore. Politicians are overdue in engaging people of color in meaningful dialogue — dialogue that goes beyond the usual, patronizing talking points. They only remember us when their re-election is on the line. Time and time again they take our vote for granted. The political tide and solid blue base we enjoy in Oregon is now challenged as the people whom politicians pretend to represent are weary and motivated to make changes. It is no coincidence that the supremely popular Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont, and President Joe Biden visited Oregon to stump for like-minded Oregonians and to ensure the state stays blue. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. When career politicians like Sanders and Biden are so concerned about losing a traditionally Democrat state like ours, it is not only a sign of the tide turning, but also it signals the strong discontent we people of color have with the political system. Is it any wonder people of color seek other political options? It is obvious that underrepresented communities must tear down the ivory tower so we can be candidates for mayor, county commissioner, senator, congressional representative or governor. For this to happen, the arrogant posturing and faux allyship of progressive leaders must be exposed. While at a meeting between several community leaders and Lane County Democratic Party leaders several years ago, its vice chair matter-of-factly declared he only saw us — people of color — as “precinct people.” A precinct person is a very important and crucial position, but that is all he saw as potential for us. In addition, he expected us to kiss his ring. Rather than a proactive and well-meaning outreach approach and recruitment of talented, educated and experienced people of color, he and the others have staunchly defended the status quo. For decades, our votes have been taken for granted. For several political cycles, the new president of the League of United Latin American Citizens of Lane County (LULAC has requested that city leaders reach out to it post-election and craft a plan of meaningful inclusion. Unfortunately, it has fallen on deaf ears. However, new city leaders seem to be more open-minded and a lot more in touch with their community, thus it would appear they don’t take us for granted. Only time will tell if they will have a real interest in ensuring community representation for all and at all levels. Voting is our real voice and our right to choose who will serve us in political office without fear of intimidation and/ or violence. As60 Minuteshost, Scott Pelley said on Oct. 30, “It’s the vote that holds America together. A belief that with a ballot, voices are heard, disputes are addressed and there’s always another chance. Countries without this belief tend to be in bondage or at war.” As the dust settles on who got elected and what ballot measures got the green light, many questions, no doubt, will remain on how to continue to voice our grievances and diverging views. Sadly, the deep political wounds likely will never heal. We must demand those wishing to represent us truly represent us, not merely their own interests. Civic life and being civil should go hand in hand. Juan Carlos Valle is a longtime community leader and founding president of the League of United Latin American Citizens of Lane County."

Then the party that stirs up the most anger wins the next election.Barlow wouldn’t have had the stomach for it. He was unusual in the political set for his willingness to listen and appreciate the sincerity of an opposing viewpoint. He’d have made a good mediator in the modern debates about public education.Barlow would have been slow to ascribe motives to those who have strong feelings on hot-button questions like transgender policy and racial equity.Parents with concerns about indoctrination of school kids on sensitive topics aren’t all white supremacists and bigots. Likewise, parents and school officials who want a level playing field for kids regardless of their race or sexual orientation aren’t all Marxists scheming to take over public schools.Sometimes people with good hearts and sound minds just see issues differently.It takes a deep breath and a little emotional intelligence to appreciate the gray areas in controversies that are too quickly reduced to black and white.

minnpost_2022_157,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As health care professionals, we understand that 90 percent of what keeps us all healthy happensoutsidethe doctor’s office.While 10 percent of health is influenced by clinical care, and another 10 percent by genetics, the remaining 80 percent is a result of physical environment, health behaviors, and socioeconomic factors like housing income, food insecurity, access to quality education and community safety.Our collective missions extend beyond the traditional health care settings, and as key partners in the health care equation, we all understand that the impact of socioeconomic factors is what can make health thrive or wither. Of all these factors, housing is one of the best-researched; and having safe, affordable housing has been found to improve health outcomes, decrease health care costs, and positively add to the social characteristics of neighborhoods.We know that stable housing promotes health. An extensive literature review summarized in aHealth Affairshousing policy brief demonstrated clearly that being without a stable home is detrimental to one’s health. People who are chronically homeless face substantially higher morbidity in terms of both physical and mental health, as well as increased mortality. The trauma associated with unstable housing also has long-standing adverse impacts on psychological well-being. And just like COVID-19, housing challenges disproportionately impact Black, Indigenous and other people of color in our state. The history of housing access is very much the history of structural racism, as redlining, racist covenants, and other policies created tremendous racial inequities in housing. BIPOC households are more likely than white households to be low-income renters, and disproportionately struggle to pay rent compared to white households. When that struggle turns into homelessness and foreclosure, documented research from 25 studies shows that mental health and health behaviors, including substance abuse, and adverse outcomes such as depression, anxiety, increased alcohol use, psychological distress and suicide are the result.There are markedly higher costs to health care systems when people do not have stable housing – costs that impact all our wallets. By providing access to stable housing, we would not only leverage better health outcomes, but also reduce health care costs. This is great news, as it means we as a state have the tools to positively impact health and health care costs through affordable housing investments and provisions. Indeed, a study of a population of nearly 10,000 people in Oregon with unstable housing found that after affordable housing provisions were put in place, it decreasedMedicaid expendituresby 12 percent. At the same time, emergency department use – a huge driver of health care costs – declined by 18 percent. These results ring true here in Minnesota too. Every year, each of our health care systems have documented higher health care costs for people experiencing homelessness, who often use high-cost emergency systems as their primary care. Such instability and chaos of living without a home exacerbate mental health and substance use too. If we as a state implement reforms and investments to stabilizing housing such as rental and foreclosure assistance, we can bend the health care costs curve and improve those mental health outcomes. This will also reduce unnecessary and preventable costs by reducing avoidable institutionalization, inpatient hospitalizations, and incarceration.We understand that improving health outcomes requires much more than a prescription or doctor visit. Just as we treat patients as whole people, with complex and connected needs, we know that treating a single ailment does not guarantee health by itself. Still, having the solid foundations of a stable home is critical to healthy patients and healthy families.As a state we offer Medicaid and Medicare to all people who are eligible, which has worked to support better health outcomes for those who are unable to access other health care options. In contrast, only one out of every four eligible people receive assistance to access housing they can afford. We as a state must re-think how we invest in housing, by scaling investments to match the true demand and need for this fundamental human need. Right now, our under-funded housing systems create just a few hundred new homes each year that are affordable, but we actually need a fewthousandnew homes each year to meet the housing needs of families with very low incomes. Our housing systems are foundational to health outcomes, and our delivery of health care is compromised when our patients do not have stable, safe, affordable housing. The prescription for what ails our housing system is greater investment that will create more vibrant and healthy communities across Minnesota-and have a positive impact where health really happens.Bukata Hayes is vice president of Racial & Health Equity, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, Dr. Rahshana Price-Isuk is the director of Clinical Services, NorthPoint Health & Wellness Center and Diane Tran, is system executive director of Community Health Equity & Engagement, M Health Fairview."
minnpost_2022_53,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Both 2020 and 2021 were brutal for public schools in Minnesota, but 2022 is shaping up to be worse.As we struggle through the havoc unleashed by the omicron surge, there’s a related issue putting schools, communities and families at longer-term risk: Teachers are lining up at the exits.As a mother of two children in St. Paul public schools, the thought of the Great Resignation hitting my kids’ schools is chilling. Worse, as an educational researcher, I’m seeing early evidence that it’s our expert teachers who are rushing for the doors.Colleagues and I have been following area teachers’ experiences throughout the pandemic. We’ve watched it go from bad to worse in hundreds of surveys, focus groups and interviews over the past 22 months. This fall, a survey of nearly 400 Minnesota teachers revealed a startling finding: Teachers who report the highest levels of confidence are the very same teachers reporting the highest levels of overwhelm.Teachers in Minnesota are contending with ongoing COVID-19 waves, political polarization, reckonings with racism, anxieties over learning loss, school violence, acute staffing shortages, widening opportunity gaps, mask melees, curriculum kerfuffles and social media scandals, all in addition to everyday work of teaching students, many of whom are struggling.Confident, veteran teachers tell us how these compounding challenges result in situations like nothing they’ve ever experienced. From an angry parent threatening the seasoned kindergarten teacher with violence, to the veteran fifth-grade teacher trying to manage teaching nine different levels of math at once, even expert educators — our research suggests especially expert educators — are being pushed to the brink.These experienced teachers already have all the knowledge, strategies and dedication to meet student needs. Yet the burgeoning needs of exhausted and traumatized students and families — combined with the stretched-thin, worn-out resources of the third pandemic-affected academic year — now far exceed what any one person, no matter how skilled, can realistically meet.Thankfully parents aren’t stuck on the sidelines. Although we are overwhelmed and exhausted ourselves, there are still small but impactful ways we can partner with teachers without even entering a classroom.Here are four simple things parents can do right now to support teachers and steady Minnesota’s public schools.Acknowledge, with empathy, how hard this isLet your children and their teachers know you understand how tumultuous a time this is. Listen wholeheartedly when they express their frustrations, and empathize by telling them how you see them doing their best even when it’s exhausting.Express appreciationTake time to thank your child’s teachers. Recently, a teacher tearfully recounted how close she was to quitting when a thank you note from a parent appeared in her inbox, lighting a spark of hope that kept her going to winter break. This gesture took mere moments for the parent, but had an outsized impact for everyone.Maintain perspective and patienceMost things are topsy turvy now. When things don’t go well, pause and ask yourself how much an issue will matter in the long term. Consider your whole child now, and remind yourself how they are so much more than any single test score or assignment. Keep in mind the expanding needs and severe shortages schools are contending with when considering how urgent an issue is. While the late bus or missed homework grade is frustrating, it’s likely unintentional, temporary and already causing stress.Build on the positiveNotice and emphasize whatever good you can. When days are tough, express confidence that they will get better — then celebrate when they do. Our children are watching how we respond to this chaos, and they depend on us to muster any hopeful positivity we can. Teachers, even expert teachers, need this as well.If Minnesota’s kids are going to weather ongoing uncertainty and thrive in the days and years ahead, we need confident, skilled educators staying in our classrooms. It is these teachers who, alongside parents, play the critical societal role of being caring adults in children’s daily lives.We need their expertise now more than ever. It’s time for parents — and all Minnesotans — to step in with empathy, appreciation, perspective and positivity to help Minnesota teachers hang on in 2022 and beyond.Laura Wangsness Willemsen is an associate professor of education at Concordia University in St. Paul."

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_73,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°The worst — and best — of this country was reflected in the deadly attack on a Colorado Springs nightclub.The bar, Club Q, caters to the city’s LGBTQ community. It allegedly was targeted by 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich, who last Monday was arrested on murder and hate crimes charges in the assault that killed five and injured at least 25 patrons. Aldrich was seen on surveillance footage arriving at the club in body armor and allegedly using an AR-15-style rifle while carrying another weapon.While much more needs to be learned about this specific suspect and the Club Q attack, it’s undeniable that despite the progress on LGBTQ rights in America, unabated hate for the community continues in some quarters, often stoked online by like-minded individuals.Such hatred is a scourge upon our society. So too is the easy availability of weapons meant for warfare that often end up in the hands of people like Aldrich.“When will we decide we’ve had enough?” President Joe Biden said in a statement reacting to the attack. “We must address the public health epidemic in all its forms.”One attempt to do just that — Colorado’s red flag law — proved tragically inadequate in this case, even though Aldrich allegedly threatened his mother with a homemade bomb last year. Despite this, no charges were filed, and neither relatives nor law enforcement attempted to invoke the red flag law meant to take weapons away from dangerous individuals.This inaction is part of a broader national trend, according to a September Associated Press analysis of 19 states and the District of Columbia that have versions of red flag laws. Overall, the AP concluded, “many U.S. states barely use the red flag laws touted as the most powerful tool to stop gun violence before it happens, a trend blamed on a lack of awareness of the laws and resistance by some authorities to enforce them even as shootings and gun deaths soar.”Sometimes it’s not state but local or county officials who are recalcitrant in using the law. El Paso County, home of Colorado Springs, “appears particularly hostile to the law,” the AP reported. The county joined nearly 2,000 nationwide “in declaring themselves ‘Second Amendment Sanctuaries’ that protect the constitutional right to bear arms, passing a 2019 resolution that says the red flag law ‘infringes upon the inalienable rights of law-abiding citizens’ by ordering police to ‘forcibly enter premises and seize a citizen’s property with no evidence of a crime.’”An investigation will reveal whether Aldrich’s family or local authorities should have acted.Thankfully, there were heroes at Club Q, according to Colorado Springs Police Chief Adrian Vasquez.He said two patrons subdued Aldrich by taking away his handgun and not shooting but hitting him with it, then pinning down the alleged assailant until police arrived.“We owe them a great debt of thanks,” Vasquez said.Indeed, the entire nation does. Perhaps it can return the favor by changing America’s ludicrously lax gun laws and addressing hate against members of a community that has suffered so much discrimination.In pressing for LGBTQ-protection legislation, Biden said in a separate statement: “This is a matter of safety and basic dignity. As we mourn the lives we’ve lost, let us continue building a country where every American can live free from fear and discrimination.”— Star Tribune"

It’s more diverse (from the people to the food and experiences — the recent Asian Night Market comes to mind , still DIY, still leaning left (yes! , and nurtures a great art, theater, performance scene and finally decent nightlife.LEO’s borders used to be really focused in the Highlands, Crescent Hill and Germantown — our original stomping grounds — but it’s just not possible for us to exist in the vacuum of those areas anymore and neglect all of the other fascinating parts of the city and the people who live there.We know that we’ll never be all things to all Louisvillians, but we can be more adept at reaching the stories in areas that we haven’t before. We can be better at inviting more people to our “table” and having difficult conversations in a way that is productive and helps our city grow more equitable. We can also be more fun, more creative, more risk-taking.Our print version is on a biweekly schedule (every other week , and we keep a daily digital schedule. We can do things that we couldn’t before and bring you LEO in a new way. I don’t think we’ve given ourselves enough room to breathe and enough time to remember that we’re part of Louisville, its past, and hopefully, its future.It isn’t lost on me that my very existence in LEO is proof that Louisville has changed. LEO hasn’t had a lot of Black folks on staff. A few of us here and there, and never in the editor’s chair. It’s major that I have this opportunity, and it means that part of my responsibility is that I remember the past and make what is possible for the future better and fairer, if I can.When I assume the role of editor-in-chief in January, I hope that LEO can step out of the shadow of what we’ve been and into the LEO that still has some breath to breathe, some stories to tell, and most of all, a community that cares about it, even if we make you angry. We really are here for you.P.S. Look for the Letters to the Editor to return because I miss hearing your voices and knowing what’s on the mind of the city. Get your “caps” fingers ready. •. ( ."

However, there have been no deaths reported from the chilly chaos, and that’s due to some combination of God’s grace, good fortune, the folks who were stuck helping each other, and the work of emergency crews to clear the roadblock and get everybody back on their way.There are multiple lessons to be learned here, not the least of which is to heed the warnings when told to stay off the roads. While surely many of the folks stuck on I-95 last week were trying to reach important destinations, such as essential jobs, some others were out needlessly.Another lesson?

minnpost_2022_45,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s newly formed working group on police reform calls to mind the poor track record of past efforts — the most recent one being that ofMinneapolis for a Better Police Contract, which abandoned its year-long negotiations with city officials after George Floyd was murdered in May 2020. The reason cited was Frey’s reluctance to address their recommendations.Likewise, thePolice Conduct Oversight Commissionformed in 2012 reported that the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD was unresponsive. Its predecessor, the Civilian Police Review Authority, similarly found its recommendationsignored under then Chief Tim Dolan.In 2013, another body, the Office of Police Conduct Review, was formed to give citizens a voice in accountability. Yet aStar Tribuneanalysis showed that between 2013 and 2018 only 3 percent of hundreds of misconduct complaints resulted in discipline.For the future of our city, I hope this new effort is fruitful. The small number of activists on theworking group, who have long sought to end police violence and improve publicsafety, face an uphill task given the breadth of views represented among its 35 members. Ifpolice and city officials or conservative working group members thwart meaningful change,activist leaders may once again need to call Minneapolis residents into the streets.There are two basic principles that should guide the working group. First, communityinvolvement in hiring, evaluating and disciplining officers and second, the granting of subpoena power to an oversight board to investigate police misconduct.Allowing police to hire police is where the problem begins and where the solutions must besought. Unfit officers who harbor the type of racist attitudes and use of excessive force longexhibited within the MPD ranks may be well-trained by policing standards, but their conductshows they cannot be reeducated via diversity training programs. The conduct of the fourofficers involved in the killing of George Floyd is Exhibit A.Unless police officers are first vetted by the community they will serve, reforms in policingprotocols, training and policies will remain inadequate. This is the vehicle through which to buildtrust between communities and public safety personnel, be they licensed officers or socialworkers. The interview and hiring teams should be comprised of a majority communitymembers working along with police officials to determine who should be hired. The finalauthority must reside with community members.A similar process is needed to evaluate officers and discipline those who violate police protocols,use excessive force or are charged with misconduct. Supervisory police officials and legalcounsel would advise such a board on technical and personnel matters, but decisions as towhether officers are fired or disciplined must reside with community members.Also, if a community board does not have subpoena power to compel testimony of officersit will lack authority. Currently, state law prohibits local governmental units from grantingsubpoena power to an oversight entity. The 2012 Legislature enacted this measure that was co-authored by John Harrington, then a state legislator, who is currently commissioner of theMinnesota Department of Public Safety under Gov. Tim Walz. Until state law is changed, anyoversight board constituted is advisory only.For about a year in the late 1960s a citizens’ review board in Minneapolis was granted subpoenapowers to compel testimony. The Police Federation and officers refused to cooperate and ignored the board’s subpoenas. A year later the City Council acquiesced and rescinded the board’s subpoena power.Since then, all iterations of review boards have operated in an advisory capacity.The outgoing council lacked the courage to take decisive steps to purge the department of unfit officers like those who took these lives. The first recommendation the working group should hand the mayor is that he fire the officers involved in these killings andall the others. Second, it should recommend that all such cases be reopened for furtherinvestigation.It will take a powerful movement to establish any system of community control. It will takesmart politics, organizing and negotiations. It will take building trust between advocates ofcommunity control and city residents. Tactically, it should aim to cause a rebellion in the ranksof police officers by encouraging good officers to back community vetting.Since the murder of George Floyd, protesters and citizen campaigners for police reform havewaged a determined effort for police accountability. This working group must not fail them andour city as other efforts have. The outcome will depend on the residents of Minneapolisholding the commission to its task.Wayne Nealis is a writer and longtime peace and labor activist who lives in Minneapolis.Editor’s note: This commentary was written prior to the Feb. 2 police killing of a man in Minneapolis and the timing of its release is that of coincidence."
minnpost_2022_141,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Last year, when the Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ summarized the literature regarding impact of COVID-19 on students and education, we reached troubling conclusions about the state of our students’ mental health and learning, the learning opportunities they were experiencing, the challenges in assessing students’ learning and how best to support learning during COVID-19.Another year into the pandemic and the conclusions from our updated literature review are no less troubling. The pandemic continues to negatively affect our students’ learning and well-being, especially our students of color. Our educators are overwhelmed with the challenge of moving students forward. Here’s what we have learned since last year.Mental health needs are rising to unprecedented levels in K-12 studentsThis began shortly after the pandemic began, and continues. In one study, parents were 2.5 times more likely to report externalizing mental health problems in their children, and four times more likely to report clinical levels of internalizing symptoms. In the Minnesota Safe Learning Survey, educators, families and students all emphasized the challenges of maintaining mental health, the need to adapt instruction and instructional environments to support mental health, and the demand for mental health services. In many districts, mental health services are delivered to lower-income students in schools; while some were able to transition to telehealth during the pandemic, there were significant interruptions in service delivery and some students were lost in the transition. It is unclear how delivery of mental health services has been restored with the inconsistency of in-person learning this school year.Students are not making the academic progress expected in non-pandemic yearsTest scores reflect drops in reading and math, with greater declines in math. The academic progress of students who are BIPOC or living in poverty is most negatively affected. National studies show students are three to seven percentile points behind in reading and nine to 11 percentile points in math comparing fall 2019 to fall 2021 scores. BIPOC students had lower levels of proficiency and greater declines. The incomprehensible achievement gap for students in Minneapolis Public Schools has widened, now a 50-point difference between 2nd-8thgrade BIPOC and white students.Most students transitioned to in-person learning in the fall of 2021, but have since also experienced disruptions in learning environments. Inequities in in-person learning exist. Learning environments also changed. Throughout the pandemic, more students of color learned from home compared to their white peers, either because they were in schools with distance learning, they chose to learn at home, or they were being homeschooled. Quarantining, temporary pivots to distance learning, and staffing challenges complicated the return to consistent in-person instruction. Homeschooling rates doubled across the nation; the rates for Black students homeschooled increased five-fold. NAZ parents reported that almost 50% of their children changed schools this year, due to the Minneapolis Public Schools’ (MPS Comprehensive District Design (CDD plan, rethinking schools during COVID-19, and expected school change by grade.Nationally, students were more likely to be absent in an online environment; online instruction was more likely to be offered by schools with higher proportions of disadvantaged students. Rates of absenteeism were higher for students who were BIPOC or living in lower income areas.Educators are also struggling with mental health concerns and burnoutSchool districts are faced with staff shortages, staff and educator exposure to COVID-19, instructional challenges, and supporting staff and students’ mental health needs.Our ongoing review of the literature yielded the following recommendations.To promote student mental health:To promote student attendance and learning:To promote educator mental health and prevent burnout:Clearly, it is time to ring the bell, sound the alarm and bring all the financial and human resources we can to support our students and educators, especially those recovering from the MPS strike. The longer it takes for us to address this human crisis, the longer it will take for our students to recover and forge ahead.Amy Susman-Stillman, Ph.D. is the director of evaluation for the Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ and Marissa Marsolek is a research assistant with NAZ. NAZ has a mission to end generational poverty and build a culture of achievement in North Minneapolis where all low-income children of color graduate from high school, college and are career-ready."
leoweekly_2022_47,"This yearmarks my 14th Kentucky General Assembly as the Fairness Campaign’s lobbyist for LGBTQ rights, and I can’t believe how much harder it has gotten. We’ve halted virtually every anti-LGBTQ bill for years, but now Kentucky is on the precipice of final passage of one of the worst attacks on queer kids passing in the state legislature — Senate Bill 83, a total ban on transgender girls and women playing girls’ sports in our Commonwealth.From the start, this bill has been more about fear than fairness. In Kentucky’s entire school system, there is only one openly transgender girl we know playing on a school sports team. That studentstarted her school’s field hockey team, recruited all of the other team members, and just wants the opportunity to play with her friends her eighth grade year.Instead of solving Kentucky’s real problems, the politicians behind this bill have used their power to bully this student and others like her. At a previous House committee hearing of the bill, those politicians had to fly in people from out of state to give testimony in support of the bill, because few Kentuckians would. The bill is a carbon copy of other anti-trans bills sweeping the nation this past year, which ignore the policies already in place to ensure an equal and inclusive playing field for student-athletes.When we are talking about sports, every child wants the same things — to play with their friends, get a good education and be happy and healthy. Every child should have the opportunity to play with their friends in sports that help them stay active and learn about teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship — including transgender kids.The truth is, very few transgender kids play sports beyond middle school — and they play sports for the same reason as every other kid: to do something they love and spend invaluable, memory-making time with their friends that will last their whole lives.In the rare instance when a transgender kid goes on to play sports in high school or beyond, sport associations already have policies in place to ensure a level playing field. In fact, Kentucky already has a strict, restrictive policy through the Kentucky High School Athletic Association. But that won’t stop the political posturing and the use of trans kids as political pawns.Last month, I sat and listened to the state legislature debate a bill to lower Kentucky’s income tax. They speculated a 1% deduction, maybe ultimately no income tax, would start bringing people back to the state. Because the recent census showed what so many of us already knew — Kentucky is dramatically lagging behind its peers in population growth.Well, let me tell you, it’s not a 1% reduction in income tax that’s going to draw people here. We know why they’re not coming. I know why they’ve left. Ask your gay nephew why he left the state. Ask your lesbian aunt why she moved out west. Ask your former coworker why their whole family moved to provide better opportunities for their transgender daughter.They’re not making Kentucky more attractive by passing these laws. They’re making us last on the list. More than 160 major employers across the nation, many of whom operate right here in our Commonwealth,sent an open letter to the Kentucky General Assemblyadamantly opposing these types of bills — Brown-Forman Corporation, PepsiCo, Amazon and countless others. Are they going to move their next corporate headquarters here? Will the other signers open more stores here, like Target, CVS and Macy’s? Or will they look to states that share their values and protect their employees and their families?Not to mention the most obvious potential blow to our commonwealth — the bill runs afoul of NCAA guidelines, threatening our participation in NCAA sports and championship tournaments. Simply put, discrimination doesn’t dribble. It’s also a clear violation of Title IX that will trigger an automatic costly lawsuit. Idaho and West Virginia both currently have federal injunctions against similar laws for violating Title IX, including a ruling from Chief Judge David Nye of the U.S. District Court of Idaho, who was nominated by former President Donald Trump and confirmed 100-0 by the U.S. Senate.The one ray of hope is Gov. Andy Beshear, who joined the Republican governors in Utah and Indiana in vetoing this discriminatory legislation. They agree that these bills are unnecessary and harmful to kids, particularly kids that are transgender. But the rights of transgender people in Kentucky are still in danger. This week, the legislature is expected to override Gov. Beshear’s veto.You can still speak up to stop it. Call 1-800-372-7181 and visitFairness.org/LetKidsPlayto message your state lawmakers and House and Senate leadership to let all Kentucky kids play.Chris Hartman is the executive director of the Fairness Campaign, a Kentucky LGBTQ advocacy organization founded in 1991..

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_65,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°If you ask any security consultant about one of the biggest physical security risks a business can take, high up on the list would be having huge piles of cash lying around. If you ask a business consultant what one of a small business’ biggest commercial risks might be, they would likely tell you that it’s not being able to get loans, financing, or even standard banking services to run their operations and collect customer payments.Yet even as a legal, regulated cannabis industry is growing wildly across the country — including now here in New York, America’s financial capital — we still saddle marijuana merchants with both of these issues simultaneously by dint of the difficulty in transacting with established banks.This is all tangled with the fact that, while the majority of states now allow the sale of medical marijuana and more than a dozen states have made the recreational market legal, the drug remains a federally controlled substance. That can and should change, either through regulatory or congressional action, but in the meantime, Congress should move to clear this pointless obstacle by more explicitly letting banks do businesses with cannabis producers and retailers.There’s proposed legislation to accomplish this in the form of the SAFE Banking Act.As with much else in Washington, the bill is getting bogged down as everyone wants to stick something on. While expungement of prior marijuana offenses, for example, is a laudable goal, it is a separate question and the squabbling over the right way to implement it shouldn’t derail the simple objective of letting cannabis businesses process payments and open bank accounts in a sector that’s already worth billions.With every week of inaction, the upshot is that the very large businesses that can afford to pay for fancy security and complex regulatory compliance keep gaining ground over the small businesses that could keep industry profits local and trickling into communities most affected by marijuana’s criminalization. And dispensaries remain fat targets for criminals.Pass the bill.— New York Daily News"
eugeneweekly_2022_14,"We ve got issues. Anyone present during the Black Unity-led protest in Springfield’s Thurston Hills neighborhood on July 29, 2020, will likely remember it forever. The protest focused on supporting a local Black resident and educating people about the racist history of nooses after a neighbor “decorated” his yard with a skeleton on a noose. Dozens of anti-racist protesters showed up in solidarity to march and chant, with some residents joining in. Other neighbors appeared to join with counter-protesters to heckle, harass and assault the protesters. But it was the responsive police violence, in collusion with racist counter-protesters, that exemplified why people had been continuously protesting nationwide since the May 25 police murder of George Floyd. The Springfield Police Department placed riot cops behind barricades and kettled the marchers, with counter-protesters at the rear of the march and behind the barricade with the cops. Activists continued to chant, sing and demonstrate at the barricades. SPD rushed them, arresting, jabbing and punching protesters while turning a blind eye to the counter-protesters’ assaults on the nonviolent protesters. Nine activists were charged with misdemeanors, and one faced felonies. Only one was convicted — the other cases were dismissed. In response to this blatant police misconduct, the Civil Liberties Defense Center (CLDC represented organizers on criminal charges and filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Springfield police to force a reckoning. Two years after the 2020 protest, here is an update onBlack Unity, et al., v. City of Springfield, et. al. The plaintiffs and CLDC recognize that reform is just a Band-Aid on the inherently racist system of policing. Abolition will not come from police departments agreeing to police themselves. However, through increased accountability, we can mitigate the harm people face on a daily basis from outdated, racist and unprofessional policing. What Are We Pushing For? CLDC, Black Unity and several individuals filed impact litigation against Springfield, the police and officers in March 2021. In July, we added new defendants and a new plaintiff, Black Unity leader/activist Jazmine Jourdan, who was brutally beaten in the face and head with closed fist “focused blows” — punches and kicks often to the head or face — by Officer Bronson Durrant. Jourdan faced trumped-up charges that were dismissed last month, and now joins the other plaintiffs fighting to dissuade such egregious police misconduct in the future. Currently, we are in discovery — exchanging documents and taking depositions to gather evidence for trial. What we have learned so far makes us confident about holding SPD accountable for violating activists’ constitutional rights. Most civil rights cases end in settlement rather than trial. The plaintiffs are attempting to reach an agreement regarding important structural and policy changes within SPD. We provided a list of 12 significant — but reasonable — demands to improve SPD’s transparency, accountability, training, anti-racist and de-escalation policies. So far, the defendants have failed to accept any of these demands or make any meaningful counter-offer, but the plaintiffs remain committed to forging change and anticipate further negotiations this fall. What has changed at SPD? Numerous officers, including Chief Richard Lewis and Officer Durrant, have left SPD. The new chief has promised change, but in Oregon, police disciplinary records aren’t public, making it difficult to learn if cops were held to account for violating their duties. SPD’s misconduct exhausts resources and makes the community less safe. Over the last five years, SPD accounted for 90 percent of the millions of dollars paid out in Lane County police litigation settlements. As part of the $4.55 million settlement with the family of Stacy Kenny, a trans woman brutally killed by SPD during a 2019 traffic stop, an Independent Critical Incident Review recommended 33 policy changes, including disallowing focused blows. In the aftermath of the Thurston protest, Springfield commissioned another independent assessment. Despite its selective, incomplete review of records, the March 2021 report still made 38 recommendations. Yet, SPD continues to use focused blows, and to our knowledge, has failed to adopt any recommendations other than those mandated by new state laws. Last month, the Eugene Police Department brought in the SPD riot squad to break up a reproductive justice protest after the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade.Once again, people were subjected to excessive force and injury by over-reactive, militarized cops. Endless Pressure, Endlessly Applied Oregon has a long history of racism, and these racist roots are often evident in Oregon’s police departments today. That’s part of why CLDC is working with Black Unity and the larger BIPOC community to bring about real change in a department that has long resisted it. Many more people were affected and injured on that day than are included in our lawsuit. Not everyone can join such a suit due to its immense pressure on their time, family and mental health, as they are placed under scrutiny in their pursuit of justice. With this litigation, Black Unity and CLDC seek a future Springfield in which BIPOC can assert their rights without fear of state-sanctioned violence. Long-range litigation like this is most effective with sustained community engagement, without which SPD and the city may feel less urgency to address their internal problems. Even as Springfield faces the threat of losing its insurance because of SPD misconduct, it continues to resist the call for drastic reform. The Civil Liberties Defense Center is a nonprofit organization of lawyers and movement professionals who seek to dismantle the political and economic structures at the root of social inequality and environmental destruction. We provide litigation, education, legal and strategic resources to strengthen and embolden environmental and social justice movement success. Learn more and get involved at cldc.org."

minnpost_2022_116,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In 2020, residents of long-term care (LTC facilities accounted for 23% of Minnesota’s total COVID-19 cases and experienced 81% of total COVID-19-related deaths. More than $150 million has been spent in emergency health response at LTC facilities in Minnesota. It’s been just over two years since the pandemic. The omicron variant is still hitting long-term care facilities, with many reported cases in these facilities.Some of the main issues associated with this problem includethe lack of total workforce vaccination, poor-quality control and regulation and the vulnerability of LTC facilities residents. However, there is an urgent need to address the low staff COVID-19 vaccination rates as data suggests a strong correlation between COVID-19 incidence among LTC facilities staff and residents.But how can Minnesota reduce the incidence and death rates of COVID-19 cases in LTC facilities in Minnesota as COVID-19 continues to linger in our communities? To connect the dots looking forward, we must look backward. Some of the problems that plague LTC facilities can tie back to their history in the United States.These includethe historical social acceptance of poor infrastructure and services provided by LTC facilities, the lack of financial protection for low-income older adults who do not qualify for Medicaid, and the industrialization of LTC facilities.Although recent efforts such as thefive-point battle plan unveiled by Gov. Tim Walzaim to solve this issue by providingpersonal protective equipment against COVID-19and improving the staffing levels in LTC facilities in Minnesota, it has only somewhat been successful in tackling this issue. Due to the pandemic, LTC facilities still report inadequate COVID-19 protective equipment like face masks and low staffing levels. Nonetheless, the five-point battle plan serves as a window of opportunity for effective health policies to tackle the disproportionately high incidence and death rates among residents of LTC facilities in Minnesota.In my opinion, a definitive solution to this problem is to create a task force within Minnesota to distribute funds to LTC facilities with at least 80% fully vaccinated staff. This policy proposal mirrors the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS vaccination requirements for health care providers, which requires health care workers participating in Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated or lose their federal funding.The health care system has historically responded to financial incentives. The CMS’s total workforce vaccination mandate for the health care system has laid the foundation for this policy to be very successful. Following its implementation, vaccination rates in nursing homes have risen.Current data show that the COVID-19 booster shot rateis comparable to the national average for adults over 65 years of age. Therefore, creating a task force to distribute COVID-19 relief funds to only qualifying LTC facilities with at least 80% total workforce vaccination should complement the CMS’s mandate to improve the vaccination rates across all LTC facilities in Minnesota.The CMS complete health care workforce vaccination policy faced numerous legal challengesand pushbacks, especially from red states, notably Texas. However, a favorable Supreme Court ruling proves this policy will withstand political challenges. Nevertheless, creating a criterion for governmental aid for health-related matters will have equity implications despite serving a greater good. Since this purposely selects only qualifying long-term care facilities to receive funding, these LTC facilities might not be the ones in the greatest need of governmental funding.The favorable Supreme Court ruling on the CMS total workforce vaccination on Jan. 13provides evidence within the authority of the secretary of Minnesota’s Health and Human Services to decide which long-term care facility qualifies to receive state government funding through the task force. However, there is uncertainty about its impact since it is voluntary for LTC facilities to adhere to the proposed policy, but a gamble, I believe, is worth taking.Dr. Praise Emukah-Brown, a practicing physician, is currently completing a masters in Public Health Administration and Policy at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health."

White bagging — called this because of the white bags in which pharmacies traditionally deliver medications — is a process in which the patient’s insurance company dictates which pharmacy can be used to dispense the drug. These specialty pharmacies are often owned by or affiliated with the insurance companies’ pharmacy benefit manager (PBM . This requirement to use the PBM designated specialty pharmacy is fraught with issues that impact patient safety and the timeliness of therapy.White bagging can cause delays in medication administration. For example, patients may arrive to their clinic ready for their chemotherapy infusion only to be told that their medication has not arrived from the specialty pharmacy. While the clinic infusion pharmacy routinely stocks this drug and has a supply ready for patients, white bagging can cause a delay in shipment because the clinic has not received the medication in time for the patient’s scheduled infusion because of the demands of the insurance company. A delay in shipment can also occur if a patient has a change in medication dosage or therapy. To make things worse, if the original drug has already been shipped, the white bagging process can prevent the drug from being returned. In this case, the patient must pay for both the original drug as well as the new prescription. Situations like this could be prevented if the insurance company allows the clinic infusion pharmacy to dispense the drug.The added burden of managing the white bagged drugs creates several potential safety issues. The provider must know when the medication needs to be reordered from the specialty pharmacy, especially if the order is changing for any reason. It can be difficult to know the exact timing needed for the reordering process when the provider has to work with an unfamiliar pharmacy. Then, the clinic infusion pharmacy must assure the orders have arrived, potentially from one of multiple specialty pharmacies, ensure that the arrival of the shipments matches the patient’s treatment dates, and that the correct drug and dose have arrived. The medication then has to be stored separately because drugs that arrived via the white bagging method can only be given to that specific patient. Since these white bagged medications are shipped to the clinic infusion pharmacy outside of the normal supply chain process, there is a large potential for error.So why are insurance companies trying to push the white bagging method? One reason insurance companies give for pushing through this process is cost savings, yet patients may end up paying more out-of-pocket for these drugs. To explain, when white bagging occurs, the insurance company can shift the drug from the patient’s medical benefit coverage to the pharmacy benefit coverage, where there are increased co-pays or other out-of-pocket costs and there may be no out-of-pocket maximum for drugs. An additional cost may be incurred by patients when the white bagged drugs have been sent to the clinic and the patient’s condition requires a dose change or change in drugs. As describe previously, the drugs sent will be billed to the patient and may not be reuse – they must be wasted. White bagging may have cost savings to the payer, but there are no cost savings to the patients, and it creates significant barriers to care, waste and disruptions to the patient-provider relationship.In Minnesota, HF 3280 and SF3265 have been introduced to prohibit insurance companies from demanding white bagging of medications that are typically administered in a clinic infusion center. This bill will prevent this process that can ultimately cost additional money and cause harm to patients. Please reach out to your State Representative and Senator supporting this bill. Support for this bill will be crucial to allow physicians and patients to make the choice that is best for patients — rather than being dictated by insurance companies.Scott A.

While most of the focus was on problems surrounding the Northgate Commerce park in North Suffolk, both our Planning Commission and City Council should heed these hard-learned lessons when making future decisions for our city.The traffic complications along Bridge Road, Shoulders Hill Road and Nansemond Parkway are examples of what can happen when expansive warehouses are developed in conjunction with rapid residential growth and no consideration of the capacity and health of our roads.The current recipe being followed near downtown does not bode well for our traffic future: ongoing warehouse construction along U.S. 58 and Carolina Road, numerous high-density subdivisions and apartments underway on Pitchkettle, Godwin, Turlington and Pruden, and the recent rezoning to allow forfive millionsquare feet of warehouses on U.S. 460. Included in this mix are narrow, ditch-lined, rural roads, namely: Manning, Lake Kilby, Lake Cohoon, and Indian Trail, all of which are being used as alternate routes for all types of vehicles trying to avoid main road congestion.We are facing potential rezoning on both Lake Kilby Road and Manning Road that would allow for over 200 and 300 homes respectively on each. There are now almost-daily incidents due to tractor-trailers in these areas. Indian Trail has an 11-foot railroad trestle and trucks are increasingly getting either stuck or having to turn around, causing delays in both directions.Developers are literally asking to sandwich thousands of current and future residents between multiple warehouse districts with no consideration of what the reality is on the ground. This is happening right outside our downtown at the same time we are trying to revitalize it.I have been to many city meetings recently and believe our representatives are now listening, but more citizen input is needed.

eugeneweekly_2022_43,"We ve got issues. Iheard it before I saw it. The 1900 horsepower, 14 cylinder Pratt & Whitney rotary engine has a sound all its own. It’s a Grumman TBM Avenger, coming in for a landing at the Columbia, California, fire air attack base. The TBM was a carrier-based torpedo bomber, the heaviest single-engined aircraft of World War II. It is coming in at treetop level out of the Sierra foothills and headed directly at me. The year is 1962. Using hand signals, I guide the plane to where I stand, at the far end of the runway. I chock the wheels. The pilot leaves the engine running as my cousin Ron and I pull the big hose over and insert it into the plane. We open the nozzle and fill the tank with 400 gallons of red borate slurry. I was 15 years old and it was my first real summer job. Working with my cousin, we operated the borate mixing equipment and filled the planes with retardant. Ron and I work as fast as we can. The pilot gets paid by the hour ($100 an hour in 1962 but the Sonora Flying Service gets paid by the load, delivered to the fire. After loading the Avenger with slurry, I pull the chocks from the wheels and give the pilot the go-ahead signal. The pilot revs up the engine, does a 180 degree turnaround and, within seconds, is airborne again. For a 15-year-old kid from the San Fernando Valley, loading air tankers at an air attack base in northern California was pretty glamorous, exciting, high-wage work. How did I get there? I was there because air tankers were part of my family. Five years earlier, my uncle, Bob Roberts, and his partner, Mel Coeur, were co-owners of the Sonora Flying Service. They had been urging the U.S. Forest Service and the California Division of Forestry to establish firefighting air bases in strategic locations for initial attack of wildfires. They had outfitted an open cockpit Stearman bi-plane with a 150 gallon tank for just such a role. The USFS called it into service in June of 1957, and the Sonora Flying Service made the first-ever air attack on a wildfire. The fire in the Stanislaus National Forest was held to just three acres. The Forest Service was impressed, and the Columbia airport became the first fire attack base in the U.S. Later that year, Uncle Bob would purchase two TBM Avengers and outfit them with 400-gallon tanks. A new firefighting industry was born. The original firefighting role for the air tanker was to get to a fire while it was small and keep it small until ground crews could get there. But that’s not how it played out. The money was just too good for that. Years later, on a Forest Service fire crew, an old timer told me the USFS fought fires by pouring money onto them. Well, if you want to pour money on a fire, air tankers are an efficient way to do it. And the bigger the tanker, the more money it can drop. A good example are the DC-10 super tankers, originally designed by Oregon’s Evergreen Aviation. They cost more than $10 million each and run more than $75,000 a day to have them on standby. Hourly rates for flight time exceed $12,000, not including the pilots and retardant. Are they worth the money? Critics point out that giant tankers make for great photos and video clips, but aren’t worth the cost. With the new reality of mega-fires destroying entire communities, there is increased demand on buying into the next generation fleet of super tankers. There is evidence from the federal Office of Management and Budget that they are largely ineffective and, to make matters worse, the fire retardant they drop is lethal to fish and kills streams. I believe there is a role for air tankers in fighting wildland fires. Just as in that initial drop in 1957, they can be effective at initial attack on a fire to prevent it from getting bigger. They can also make strategic drops to protect structures or other high value assets. But those roles require precision, not massive, high altitude drops from supertankers. On a fire it was sometimes referred to as a CNN Drop. Fire management would bring out the star power and drop a load of retardant at a location near the media. Shots of a big red plume dropping from an airplane provides a dramatic image for the press. It’s been that way since 1961, the year the tanker industry got its big break, the year Hollywood made the air tanker a star. It’s a hot, windy, November day in 1961. My brother Walt and I are up on the roof of our house in Sherman Oaks looking towards the Santa Monica Mountains. The smell ofsmoke is in the air. The sound of sirens comes from all directions. We can see large columns of dark smoke rising from the nearby hills. The deep rumbling of World War II warbirds fills the air. The Bel Air Fire was the largest brush fire in Southern California history at that time. It would destroy over 400 homes. But this was not just any place, and these were not just any homes. This was L.A., the home of Hollywood and the entertainment industry. These were the homes of the rich and famous, of movie and TV stars. Movie stars Burt Lancaster and Zsa Zsa Gabor would lose their homes. Our house is under the flight path between the air attack base at the Van Nuys airport and the fire. From our rooftop perch we watch the WW II warbirds — TBM Avengers, a PBY Catalina and a B-17 Flying Fortress — as they fly in and out of the smoke. The planes are owned by Uncle Bob. Celebrities’ homes were burning. News photos included Richard Nixon standing on his roof with a garden hose, in slacks and a dress shirt and tie. Stars shown defending their homes included Kim Novak, Maureen O’Hara and Robert Taylor. Images of movie stars with garden hoses defending their homes made national news. And with them came a new celebrity, the air tanker. This was the tanker’s debut performance on a national stage. WW II bombers, flown by WW II pilots were making precision air drops that saved the homes of the rich and famous. Hollywood gratefully responded in the only way it could. Spectacularly dramatic scenes, right out of a war movie were broadcast and seen on the nightly news in living rooms across America. Hollywood knew how to create a star, and that’s what it did. From that moment on, no wildfire story would ever be complete without a tanker drop. Back on the roof, Walt and I notice the big four-engine B-17 coming out of the smoke, aimed directly at our house. It comes in low and directly over our heads. We yell and wave our arms and the big plane’s wings dip side to side as it passes overhead. It was Uncle Bob heading back to Van Nuys for another load of borate. Not long after that, the Sonora Air Service would morph into Intermountain Aviation, owned by the CIA. That same B-17 would take on a whole new life flying spy missions. In 1965, as part of its “skyhook” cover identity, it plucked James Bond out of the ocean at the end of the movieThunderball. Decades later, at the Evergreen Aviation museum in McMinnville, I noticed the B-17 on display. Could it be the same plane? Evergreen Aviation officials confirmed it was. All of the assets of Intermountain Aviation had been absorbed by Evergreen, including the B-17. I could hardly believe it. I was looking at the very same plane that dipped its wings over Walt and I so many years before. We lost my brother Walt to AIDS in 1988, and I miss him dearly. I think about him every day. For those precious few moments, standing in front of that old plane, he was there with me again, back on that roof, two kids whooping and hollering, as that big old Flying Fortress saluted us as it flew over.ν Bob Warren retired in 2012 as the regional business development officer for Business Oregon for Lane, Lincoln, Linn and Benton counties.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_32,"The passage of 34 years since Pan Am Flight 103 was blown from the Scottish skies above the town of Lockerbie has not dimmed the need for justice for the murder of 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on the ground.Who ordered the terrorist bombing of the American aircraft? The apprehension of the accused Libyan bomb-maker Abu Agila Mas’ud by the FBI and his delivery to a federal court in Washington will help solve this crime and bring some peace to the surviving families.The flight, from Heathrow to JFK, had in its baggage hold a suitcase with the bomb, planted in Malta.The bomb worked as the assassins conspired and destroyed the airliner in midair.Among the victims was a large contingent of 35 Syracuse University students on the way home following a semester in Europe. Another young American murdered was David Dornstein, age 25 and returning from a trip to Israel. His little brother, Ken Dornstein, 19 at the time, has conducted years of meticulous research untangling the Libyans’ involvement in the plot.His dogged pursuit, through his writings and TV documentary, helped focus on the bombmaker, Mas’ud, now in custody.This won’t be the first Lockerbie trial. That was a Scottish court convened in the Netherlands, as part of a deal with Muammar Gaddafi.The court convicted one Libyan and acquitted another. The guilty man, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, served less than nine years of a life sentence before the Scots granted him compassionate release due to terminal cancer. But their compassion was premature, as he returned to a hero’s welcome in Libya and lived nearly three more years before dying a free man.This time, there’s no deal with Gaddafi, who paid billions to Lockerbie families while denying responsibility.

leoweekly_2022_10,"Some city officials and corrections leaders want a new jail. A consultant report from 2016 estimated it could cost $300 million to build it. THREE HUNDRED MILLION. And it would likely be more now. The math isn’t mathing. The math, passed to the city and jail officials via consultants they hired, sounds like a way for pro-penal system folks to cash grab off the backs of local taxpayers. The complaints of those pro new jail are that the current jail building is 54 years old and isn’t built to house more than 1,400 people a day which is the daily populous of the jail in recent months. And, now that ten people have died since last November, they’re ready to push a high price tag on local taxpayers without offering answers as to why inmates have died.How much of the issue could be that some of those in jail shouldn’t be there in the first place? The ACLU certainly seems to agree, as do other activists. To be honest, jail should be used sparingly. Violent offenses where there is clear and present danger to the community is the only reason I can think of. And while I think most jails should be damn-near empty, I’m not opposed to updating the current building in a way that addresses basic health and safety.The issue is that poverty, mental illness and addiction have been weaponized in America as jail-able offenses. The system created its own problem and now is looking for yet another bailout. It’s really little different than the bank bailout, or the big auto bailout.Capitalists spend their way into monetary issues and then want to squeeze money from the people who have the least. Authoritarians do the same with criminalizing things that shouldn’t be criminal.Why are people in jail for crimes that present absolutely no corporeal danger to those around them? It’s a waste of space and creates the danger they claim it is to have an overcrowded jail. It’s nonsense to think that the only remedy is to throw money at more space to lock people up, which does two things — give LMPD more reason to increase the population of the jail to the next capacity and then discourage the real discourse which shouldn’t be increasing the sizes of our jails but improving the quality of our criminal justice system overall, and thoroughly moving away from incarceration as penalty toward reform/abolition and root cause work.America is long overdue for an overhaul of the “justice” system. It hasn’t worked for a long time and has done more damage than good, especially for Black and Latino people. That we think increasing the budget of the abuser is somehow going to fix the issue, is asinine. If addiction is killing addicts in jail, increase the ability for them to access treatment instead of locking them up. Fix the root causes of so-called criminal activity with the millions and stop throwing giant cash drops of money at limited, ineffective solutions. In this situation, less is more. Decrease the population in jails, decrease the need that makes crime seem like an option and decrease the budget of LMPD officers and move that money toward the needs of the citizens.We’ve overfunded our justice system in all the wrong ways and we can’t seem to figure out why those things haven’t worked, but yet we think the only way to fix it is to toss more money in a bottomless well. I’m sorry but again, the math isn’t mathing.Citizens of the city should tell their council members that this coming “proposal” is unacceptable in any form without attention to the very basic and real ways to reduce the danger in our jails and reduce the population of American people we lock up because they are poor, sick and desperate. It’s shameful.. ( ."

What happens when the people in your world try to define who you are to fit their own terms? It shifts the atmosphere.An atmosphere is the “pervading tone or mood of a place, situation or work of art.” Did you know that your current “atmosphere” of your life is only a work of art in which God is redirecting, reshaping, repurposing and restoring your kingdom DNA? During this season of “atmospheres,” I had questions about my kingdom assignment; the voice of the world became loud in my spirit, and it became overcrowded.The atmosphere forced me to sit in silence just to hear the voice of God. The silence became a sense of healing as the voice of God grew louder and louder in my spirit. It is normal for the atmosphere to feel uncomfortable because of the shifting and pulling that is taking place in your life.Although you may feel like you are far away from your assignment, you are actually walking in it. Today is your second chance.When the atmosphere shifts, you shift into a place of questions, bruising, grief and tears. You find yourself in a maze not knowing the direction to get out. You wait in anxiety for answers and healing but become afraid that God doesn’t hear your voice.Sometimes, the tone and mood of your “experienced” atmosphere can open healed wounds and leave you looking for a spiritual first aid kit.To be transparent, I stopped speaking and praying because I felt like I did not have the perfect words to speak to God. I stopped speaking and praying because I felt like my imperfections compromised my “Kingdom DNA (Don’t Negotiate Atmospheres .”I did not realize that my imperfections created the perfect atmosphere to call on him. Recently, I stopped at the beach, looked towards the water, breathed, and began to speak into the atmosphere of faith; faith was all I had; it was all I needed. The exact words, “I let go” began to spill from my mouth. I exhaled and left a heavy atmosphere that was weighing me down to walk into a new atmosphere that claimed my Kingdom DNA.It is important to allow God to surround you with people that will show you that you are not “exclusive” to the challenges that will come during this walk. It is important to allow God to surround you with people that will show you that you are “inclusive” in the Holy Spirit.I had to realize that I was not alone in my walk. While I was trying to fit back into me, God was showing me that I was outgrowing an atmosphere that no longer belonged to me. I needed God to restructure and reaffirm my spirit.Sometimes, we must sit in silence so that we can hear again. While I thought that I had forgotten how to pray, God only wanted me to open up my mouth and whisper His name.I was giving so much of me that I depleted everything that was within me. I found myself defending my atmosphere to people who did not truly capture the “art of my heart” that God painted for me as part of my Kingdom DNA.His purpose for my life allowed my spirit to go through some things that shaked me to the core. It allowed me to step out of “old shoes and claim a new pair” just for a new walk. It felt uncomfortable.A good friend told me that I couldn’t turn back to collect those old shoes and that I had to press forward. I want to encourage you at this moment that you have been “delivered from the things of your past; refuse to live in anything that God delivered you from.” You are just beginning to live in your Kingdom DNA.Begin to whisper his name into the atmosphere, and those whispers will heal any open wounds.

suffolknewsherald_2022_251,"Published 6:00 pm Tuesday, October 4, 2022ByStaff ReportsNational Newspaper Week, which started Sunday, is an opportunity to take a moment and recognize all the ways that community newspapers like this one make a difference.If you’re reading this, you probably already have a good understanding of why it is important to have a healthy newspaper. By reading or advertising in your local newspaper, you are providing much-needed support to keep trained, professional journalists covering the issues important to you. Your local newspaper is committed to being the local watchdog, covering city government and school board to make sure your tax dollars are being spent properly.But, there are many other ways newspapers serve their readers and communities, things even regular readers might not always consider.Newspapers are reliable. Unlike news you get on social media, or even from national publications or cable news channels, you can be sure that news from your local newspaper is professionally gathered, fact-checked and edited. You might not always agree with everything we publish, but you can rely on the fact that what’s published has followed journalistic standards.Newspapers protect your right to know. In addition to covering what’s going on in your local government, most newspapers serve another critical purpose by publishing public notices. Public notices are issued by government agencies regarding proposed actions, zoning proposals, tax initiatives or other lawmaking proceedings. In Virginia local governments are still required to publish them in local newspapers, so all citizens have the opportunity to know what’s going on, and if necessary, take appropriate action.Newspapers provide broad community distribution. Moving a public notice to a municipal website would be like hiding the notice. Newspapers help keep your government’s actions transparent.Newspapers are more than print. We deliver information in the format that works best for you. For many, that remains a printed newspaper held in your hands. For an increasing share of our audience, information is better consumed on computers, phones and tablets. We have made significant investment in digital platforms to make sure you get the news you need when you want it and how you want it. Newspaper audiences are bigger than ever thanks to the broad reach provided by the combination of print and digital channels.Your newspaper is local, produced by local citizens who drive the same streets, shop in the same stores and consume the same government services as you. The local newspaper’s focus is on making the community stronger, safer and healthier.In short, we hope you agree that your newspaper makes a difference in your community in many ways.

minnpost_2022_117,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It is refreshing when our elected officials stand together and work towards good public policy in a bi-partisan manner.The Minnesota Legislature is currently doing just that as they consider legislation that would ensure boaters are responsible and educated on safety, operational and conservation best practices. Introduced as SF3392 and HF3787, the language is now included in the House Environment and Natural Resources omnibus bill (SF 4062 .This common-sense legislation has broad, bipartisan support. The bill is backed by the Lake Minnetonka Conservation District, lake associations, marine manufacturers, law enforcement, marinas, boat dealers, resorts, cities, and citizens of our great state of 10,000 lakes. We share a common goal – to increase the safety of all boaters and lake-goers in Minnesota.The new law will require all operators ages 12-plus born on or after July 1, 1987, to complete a boater education course and receive a watercraft operator’s permit. The program will set forth national approved safety standards with the opportunity for Minnesota-tailored messaging and content provided by key stakeholders working with the Department of Natural Resources. This education will focus on important issues like stopping the spread of aquatic invasive species, impacts of wakes, and towed water sport best practices. The legislation will also require an operator of any boat rental to receive a summary of statues and rules, instructions for safe operation, and to take a short exam prior to operating a boat. The Community of Minnesota Resorts worked successfully to ensure the requirements increase safety without overburdening businesses.Minnesota is ranked second in the U.S. for registered watercrafts. In the past two years, 16,000 new motorized boats have been registered in the state. As a result, injuries are increasing. The U.S. Coast Guard statistics confirm 77% of boating deaths occurred with an operator who had no safety instruction. That number drops to 12% when the operator received a nationally approved boating safety education certificate. It is about time we update the outdated boater education program that only focuses on youth operators. People under the age of 18 are not buying new boats. The new legislation is a proactive approach that protects public safety, diverse recreational opportunity, and the ecological health of our lakes.So many in Minnesota are excited about this bi-partisan legislation. I have been boating on Minnesota lakes since before I was born (my mother was pregnant with me when she and my dad were cruising around in boats in 1960 . I have served as the mayor of the city of Greenwood for more than 13 years, and my family is blessed to live on Lake Minnetonka in the larger South Lake Community. I love seeing the lake being enjoyed by people of all ages across the state and beyond. When tragedy happens on the water due to poor boating safety, we are all affected.I encourage our state elected officials to help pass this important boater education legislation into law. The education we require of our youth (which has proven to reduce incidents on the water , should be something all boat operators can rally behind. That’s just common sense.As the boating season approaches, please remember to focus on safety and how best to operate on Minnesota’s amazing bodies of water.Deb Kind is the mayor of Greenwood, Minnesota."

Seemingly, a step-by-step article on what could be done to reverse election results might include a bit more details about the people who want the information.Although most people in Suffolk want to move on, there are those who want to continue making circular arguments. They argue about the need for a School Board audit when audits paid for by the City of Suffolk have revealed no deficiencies. The first Story Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA lawsuit has not been resolved. The Virginia Supreme Court recently issued an opinion that the School Board did not violate VFOIA in its certification of closed meetings. The case is being sent back to the circuit court to determine whether the School Board should pay Story’s legal fees. The second Story lawsuit was settled in hopes of moving on with the business of the Board. The Story attorney received $15,000 from the School Board, and $5,000 from the insurance carrier. The Wahlstrom lawsuit is still undetermined, as the Board waits to see if the Virginia Supreme Court will hear the appeal. The Wahlstrom/Story attorney (same attorney has not been paid. In the Wahlstrom lawsuit, the VFOIA Council indicated that the School Board did not violate the VFOIA. In neither the Story nor Wahlstrom lawsuit did the court find that any of the actions of the School Board Chair or School Superintendent were willful. In truth, the School Board Chair was innocent of purposefully violating the VFOIA.On the other hand, the cost to the taxpayers in the Story harassment of the School Superintendent was $56,000, down from the original cost of $142,627.50. The law firm worked with the Board to adjust over $86,500 of the bill. The public investigative report confirmed Story’s egregious behavior. However, Story refused to apologize, accept responsibility for her actions, follow the recommendations of the independent investigators, or the School Board. If the group members were really concerned about accountability, transparency, and doing what is right, one wonders, who would need to be recalled?The Nansemond and Whaleyville Boroughs are diverse communities that represent all segments of Suffolk. The citizens understand the issues. Almost 12,000 people from the two boroughs voted in a free and fair election. Those individuals voted their incumbents in for a third and a fourth term, respectively. They know who they want to represent them. The most visible leaders of the anonymous movement do not appear to live in the two boroughs that are under attack. Incumbent leaders have simply been targeted. This is the time to take a position, whether or not it is “safe, popular, or polite.” The Suffolk School Board has to make decisions for thousands of children, families and employees in the middle of a pandemic. Pitiful, partisan, power plays consume unnecessary time and energy. “The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence of the good people … conscience tells one that is right!” — Martin Luther King Jr.Dr. Judith Brooks-Buck can be contacted at jbec2000@msn.com.

minnpost_2022_13,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact onmental health, particularly in rural America. These mental health struggles have taken on many forms.Older adultsin rural communities experienced increased risk of loneliness and isolation due to social distancing.Farmersfaced more anxiety due to supply chain issues and outbreaks at processing plants. Medical providers who were already experiencing staffing shortages before the pandemic were even more stretched thin and experiencingburnoutdue to lack of resources. Teachers and students struggled with distance learning over unstable and often nonexistentrural internet connections.Throughout the pandemic, most of us have been willing to do our part to stop the spread of COVID. We stayed home, wore masks, socially distanced ourselves, changed policies to protect workers against COVID, and many are now vaccinated. All of these pieces of action that we did, as organizations and citizens, have ultimately helped slow down the spread of the virus and reduced rates of severe illness and death. With that same willingness to help protect each other’s physical health, collective action is needed to support the mental health of people in rural communities.Acollective impact modelis a strategic approach to addressing complex problems by mobilizing partnerships and resources in alignment toward a greater goal. It works like this: Bring together people from different sectors of the community around a table — for example, people from education, law enforcement, social services, elected officials and business. At this table, they have a common agenda to address a specific issue in their community. As they develop solutions, they agree on how to track progress toward their desired goals withshared measurementsandmutually reinforcing activities.A representative from alocal backbone organizationfacilitates the conversations about the problems and follows up with the people at the table to help coordinate activities that collectively move the needle toward achieving the goal for the community. This facilitator keeps track of progress by collecting data on how the work is going and encourages communication across partners in the efforts in order to keep people accountable toward reaching their shared goal.Continuous communication is vital to the success of collective impact efforts. If partners have adeep connectionwith one another, it makes people more excited to come to the table to work together and reach their desired goals for their community. Policymakers and local leaders investing in opportunities for rural places to create capacity in their community to collectively collaborate with others about mental health is vital to moving forward in a post-pandemic world.The beauty of the collective impact is it can be tailored to the priorities, strengths and resources of communities. This model has been successfully used in many communities around the country to address things such assubstance abuse,cradle to career outcomesandCOVID-19 response. Through a collective impact approach, organizations and members of rural communities can commit and contribute to achieving the goal of better mental health outcomes through mutually reinforcing activities that are realistic for them.For example, if members of rural community want to prioritize increasing access to mental health services, partners in education can focus on increasing access toschool-based mental health programsfor youth, while churches, libraries and community centers offermental health educational trainingto community members in order to reduce stigma. The health care partners can work on incentivizing mental health providers towork in rural placesor increasing localbehavioral telehealth infrastructure, while law enforcement and social services can focus on resources to support those experiencing amental health crisis. Each of these coordinated activities is continuously evaluated based on the shared data measurements and end up making an impact on the outcomes in a community in the long run.In any collaboration it’s important to make sureall voices are heardand that vocal partners don’t overshadow the perspectives of those who are new to the table or have been historically marginalized. But as people become aligned to addressing the goal, it makes collaboration and communication more effective, even when working out differences of opinion. Often work across different sectors can besiloed, but when people intentionallyalign their efforts, the impact can be so much stronger.It is worth noting that the greater impacts of COVID are far reaching, affecting the economy and showing the cracks in our public health infrastructure. There are so many issues that rural communities could prioritize as we transition into a “post-COVID” world, but mental health affects everyone and deserves to be a top priority.If resources are put toward bettering mental health in rural spaces through strategic, intentional collaborative models, rural areas can demonstrate their resiliency and thrive.Katie Rydberg is a Program Manager at theUniversity of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center."
suffolknewsherald_2022_178,"Published 5:27 pm Tuesday, February 8, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:While reading Jimmy LaRoue’s article “Mask requirements still stands for SPS” (Jan. 21 , I felt an abundance of comfort to know that the Suffolk Public Schools system decided to keep the mask mandate for students and staff. Attending in-person at a high school of SPS has made some parents and students, including myself, wary of catching COVID-19 due to the fact that we are in close quarters with one another. It goes beyond just the people in school, but to the families that students and staff go home to. These family members could be parents, grandparents or siblings that have medical conditions that cause them to be at risk. I will admit, masking up can seem bothersome at times when it comes to speaking or even breathing, but keeping the community and myself safe is a bigger priority.Masks are important now more than the start of the school year with the new variants of the virus and the great amount of people that have traveled over the winter break. I saw first hand the amount of students who were sick returning from vacation, and it was unsettling to know that I could get sick easier now if SPS decided in opposition. It is a known fact that the masks will not shield people from everything, just like social distancing and Plexiglas will not as well, but we cannot discredit the fact that they do protect us by limiting the spread of the virus.Makylah BlizzardSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2022_42,"We ve got issues. It’s said that when a big ship goes down it pulls everything down with it, sucked into a vortex. Looks to me a good metaphor for what seems to be happening as civilization begins to go down. Maybe nothing much escapes its pull; most things are at least altered or a bit deformed. Civilization is near-total these days; its force field is far from inconsiderable. Thinking itself is affected, and I don’t imagine that my thought is an exception. In the context of the pandemic, especially, the effects are plain to see. Millions deny the reality of Trump’s electoral defeat. Then there’s the wacko fringe of that fringe, QAnon, with its mad, science-fictionesque, anti-Semitic claims and predictions that never come to pass. (TheNew York Times, Dec. 21, reports that QAnon is growing stronger. Much, if not most, of the anti-vaxx contingent also fills the conspiracy theory bill. Many of these folks see the new mRNA vaccines in a very sinister light. For them, the shots constitute something qualitatively new, their components secret, protected by Big Pharma patents. And the motivation of the new vaccines, they say, is control, new levels of surveillance and restrictions. I wonder how many anti-vaxxers reject email, social media, smartphones, the metaverse? What “liberty” have we not already lost, held hostage as we are by ever-morphing levels of technological “advance”? When confronted with millions of confirmed COVID deaths worldwide, anti-vaxxers either ignore or downplay the facts. The figures are inflated, they say; only old people die. What thousands of health care folks around the world continue to report is nothing but lies, they claim. One of the most head-scratching aspects of this phenomenon to me has been the hate mail I’ve received for not being anti-vaxx. These screeds have come from individuals whose work on the critique of society, on the crisis and what drives it, I’ve much valued! Some in this camp, of all people, have attacked me as a fake anti-authoritarian for not drinking their conspiracy-theory Kool-Aid. This is how far critical thinking has declined in some quarters. Frankly, my dear, I’d prefer to live to fight another day. Zerzan is a local anarchist writer, whose books includeElements of RefusalandFuture Primitive.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_33,"In a rare bit of good news out of the U.S. Supreme Court, there are signs that three of the court’s six conservatives are poised to join its three liberals to oppose a radical legal theory that threatens to enable partisan electoral sabotage in statehouses around the nation. The theory holds that state courts have no jurisdiction over how state legislatures handle states’ congressional elections. This would be a dangerous weapon to hand to politicians who tend to view gerrymandering as a legitimate partisan tool instead of the cynical affront to democracy that it actually is.The “independent state legislature” doctrine is a once-fringe legal theory that has, unfortunately, been mainstreamed lately. It holds that state legislatures have total control over the state’s congressional election rules and district lines, and that state courts have no authority to second-guess them — even if those lawmakers’ decisions flagrantly violate the state constitution.The theory rests on an extremely blinkered reading of the U.S. Constitution’s Elections Clause, which says: “The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.”That’s all it says on the matter.There is no subsequent sentence to suggest those legislators get to do that outside the normal system of checks and balances that apply to virtually every other part of government.The bizarre argument that the clause means state judges can’t stop state lawmakers from violating their own state election laws is a position being promoted by (yes state lawmakers — the Republican majority in North Carolina’s legislature, in this case.All data indicates the state has a roughly 50-50 split between Democratic and Republican voters, yet the GOP legislature produced a district map gerrymandered to give the GOP more than two-thirds of the state’s U.S. House seats. The state’s Supreme Court struck down the map as being gerrymandered in violation of the state’s constitution.Lawmakers challenging that decision before the U.S. Supreme Court last week aren’t arguing their map isn’t gerrymandered (that would be an impossible argument to make , but rather that the state court has no authority to tell them not to gerrymander — even though it violates the state constitution.The U.S. Supreme Court already ruled in 2019 that federal courts can’t block states from partisan gerrymandering, essentially saying that’s a job for the state courts.So what North Carolina Republicans ultimately are seeking here is unfettered gerrymandering power with no legal recourse for Democratic voters being deprived of fair representation.That may be a bridge too far even for Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, based on the conservative justices’ skeptical questions during arguments last week.We hope so. Scorched-earth partisanship is bad enough in America today without supercharging it with this crackpot legal theory.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
leoweekly_2022_11,"An opinion columnistshould not simply share stuff they’ve been thinking about. Readers have every right to expect an op-ed writer to purvey informed opinions; to answer the big questions of the day not with Kerouac-style riffing, but with reasoned logic supported by research, interviews, statistics and whatever else it might take to give the reader a basis to form their own informed opinions.If not for columnists like me, people might hear one little news story about some legal or political matter, develop a half-assed opinion on it without knowing how things really are, and go blissfully about their day. My job is to insulate readers from this sort of tragedy. I dive into grim topics and bring you horrible, unvarnished truths — truths which tends to be considerably worse than you might have otherwise thought.And so it is with bad holiday music, a topic which is not unlike law or politics. People talk about it, they have opinions on it, they think they know something about it. But the few of us who dig a little deeper discover that reality is quite different from what they assumed. Trust me on this: Just because you have a mild distaste for “Little Drummer Boy,” or you’ve been annoyed by a rendition of “Twelve Days of Christmas” in your dentist’s office, or you’ve decided to read your own relationship issues into “Baby It’s Cold Outside,” that doesn’t mean you know bad holiday music. Here for your displeasure is a polemic on the worst of the worst.5.“BACK DOOR SANTA” — BON JOVIThere are plenty of hair-band Christmas songs that could have made this list. Danger Danger’s “Naughty Naughty Xmas,” which promises to “deck the halls with Amber and Holly and all those naughty girls,” is a notable contender, as is AC/DC’s “Mistress for Christmas,” which — I swear to god — rhymes “jingle all the day” with “grope you in the hay.” I get that some of these songs are played for laughs, but this should make them no more redeemable to discerning listeners, especially if they aren’t funny.This cover is more unforgivable than other misogynistic schlock because it’s a classic example of what happens when you filter a decent soul song through the pale cheesecloth of keyboard rock made exclusively by and for people of European ancestry. And gentle reader: if you are able to listen to this one without envisioning a specific sex act involving a thousand-year-old elf or a sixty-year-old rock idol, or both, you are of a purer constitution than I.4.“CHRISTMAS BABY SHARK” — BOUNCE PATROLThe inclusion of this song on a worst-of list may seem like a cheap shot at a children’s song, or at least like lazy journalism. You might think I didn’t do the work to find something truly abysmal, so I picked this harmless-but-annoying low-hanging fruit that I am now trying to pass it off as a giant, steaming road apple. But have you listened to “Christmas Baby Shark?” ALL the way through? No, no you have not. I know you haven’t. If you had, you wouldn’t be reading this now, you’d be locked up somewhere to avoid harming yourself or those you love. This is the kind of song to which you must develop a tolerance before trying to devour it whole; it requires years of ingesting bits of grating standards like Barbara Streisand’s “Jingle Bells?” and Dan Fogelberg’s “Same Auld Lang Syne” before even attempting.3.“SANTA CLAUS HAS GOT THE AIDS THIS YEAR”— TINY TIMThere are holiday songs which may be considered bad from their very conception, either owing to a heinous mismatch between the artist and the song (the guy from Judas Priest singing “O Holy Night” or because the idea of the song itself is bad (“I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” , or because artist and song are both independently obnoxious and the mere suggestion of combining them constitutes blasphemy (think Celine Dion singing “Feliz Navidad” .This song transcends those categories. Tiny Tim’s nagging soprano and pre-programmed synth would be unlistenably bad on its own, but it’s the historical context that should earn this song a place on any worst-of list. In 1986, when this track was first released, AIDS wasn’t some extra-continental novelty illness. It was a full-blown epidemic that was killing people everywhere, and was especially painful to the LGBTQ+ community — where Tiny Tim got his first big break. You think that Band Aid track about whether they know it’s Christmas in Africa is insensitive? Had this song received any airplay, it might have been a raft upon which listeners drifted into oblivion, leaving behind all hope for humanity.2.“CHRISTMAS IS FOR THE BIRDS” — CONWAY TWITTYAs with the hair bands, there are plenty of country Christmas songs that are fucking terrible. These come in three varieties: 1 mangled classics, like Toby Keith’s “Silent Night,” which sounds like a cow getting strangled with a piano wire; 2 bizarre story songs, mostly from the 1970s, like “Billy’s Christmas Wish,” a gratuitously miserable piece in which the only thing the listener knows about any character is that nothing good ever happens to them, ever, not even the little boy who is abused by his stepfather after his father kills his mother’s boyfriend (spoiler: THE CHILD DIES AT THE END ; and 3 songs featuring a positively diabolical chorus of robotic singing birds. There is only one song in this final category.1.“THE CHRISTMAS SHOES” — NEWSONGIn 2011, Jezebel published the readers’ poll of worst Christmas songs, and this one topped the list. For the most part, Jezebel’s readers were wrong. One simply cannot trust any list that includes the delightful “Dominick the Italian Christmas Donkey” but fails to mention Joe Diffie’s “Leroy the Redneck Reindeer,” to say nothing of the other songs on the eminently superior list you are reading now (though to be fair, “Christmas Baby Shark” had not yet burst forth from the anus of its ancient demon host in 2011 .But on this point, they were right. By now “The Christmas Shoes” is universally reviled, and for good reason. Whatever elements you might think make a Christmas song bad — overwrought sentimentality, preachiness, singing children — all of them are present here. This agonizing five-minute exercise in self-congratulation is worse than “Waffle House Christmas”; worse than Skip Ewing’s “My Name Is Christmas Carol”; even worse than the entire Goo Goo Dolls Christmas album. Imagine taking a handful of those vomit-flavored Harry Potter jellybeans and cramming them into your ears, and you’re getting close to this listening experience. It is the sonic equivalent of waterboarding, or hemorrhoids, or having your knees broken by the seat in front of you on an economy-class flight. Did you know there’s a novel based on this song? And an entire full-length feature film starring Rob Lowe? I did not read/watch these. Even I have my limits.The good news is that you’re not likely to hear these songs on accident; you’ve got to seek them out. Let this list therefore be a reminder to be thankful for all that we have, including the usual lineup of bad-but-not-THAT-bad music. •. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_206,"Published 2:09 pm Saturday, January 15, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Chris QuilpaWhere were you that day a year ago? If you saw what happened that day, how did you feel? Mixed emotions? Sad and mad? Upset and frustrated? Ashamed? Thankful? Fearful?Lots of questions and speculations abound in the minds of different people who witnessed that day. Why did it happen? Did anyone have knowledge of what is going to happen prior to that event? Was that day pre-planned, or unexpected? Who is to blame; who is responsible and accountable for that day?What lesson or lessons can we learn from that day so it won’t happen again? That no one is above the law? That democracy is fragile and, therefore, all law-abiding citizens must cherish and protect it if they want to live free, to enjoy the fruits of liberty?The world witnessed in horror the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and also saw what happened on Jan. 6 last year, at the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C.Jan. 6, 2021, was an unforgettable day in the modern history of the United States of America. It was unthinkable and unbelievable. That violent uprising became deadly and dangerous — so dangerous that the citadel of democracy, the U.S. Capitol, was under siege. That day, democracy was tested, shattered, and shaken.Unlike the historic Sept. 11 attack perpetrated by foreign militant terrorists on American soil, the Jan. 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol was perpetrated domestically by groups of Americans who were trying to undermine our constitutional democratic process — the peaceful transfer of power.When protesters or rioters breached the U.S. Capitol, members of Congress, the senators and representatives, and the former vice president, were convening to ratify the results and proclaim the winner of the 2020 presidential election.There was chaos and confusion, destruction of federal property, the U.S. Capitol building, injuries and loss of lives as a result of the insurrection.On that fateful, fearful and momentous day, the destructive, violent and deadly mob tried to disrupt a democratic process to overturn the results of the Nov. 3, 2020, election, but U.S. Capitol police officers and D.C. metropolitan police and other law enforcement agencies fought hard and defended democracy.In the end, democracy prevailed. Though tested, shaken and shattered, democracy reigned. Democracy prevailed.Just as there were heroes and patriots that day, were there also criminals who can be branded as “traitors”?Again, questions arise as to what and who provoked the rioters to do what they did. Who is responsible and accountable for the U.S. Capitol insurrection? Where and what was the former U.S. president doing that day? As commander-in-chief, did he attempt to do anything before and during that momentous day to inflame, stop or quell the situation?Were there lawmakers who condoned or conspired with the protesters or rioters-turned-insurrectionists?The shattered and shaken democracy the United States has is fragile. It is quite obvious that democracy is everyday tested and threatened, not only in the United States, the land of the free world because of her democracy, but also other countries clamoring to have it.What is democracy, anyway? Why is it worth dying for? Webster’s dictionary defines democracy as a form of government in which people choose leaders by voting; hence, it is a representative, elective and constitutional government.If democracy is fragile and threatened all the time, and is worth dying for, then everyone who loves it must be vigilant and fight for it.

minnpost_2022_44,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The COVID-19 positivity rate in Minnesota reached a record level of 15.6 percent at thebeginning of January, yet we know the burden of COVID-19 in prisons and jails is much higher. On any given day in the past few weeks, the Minnesota prison system is rife withCOVID-19 cases. For example, on Feb. 2, there were 1,542 positive cases among incarcerated peoplealone, not counting staff.Prisons and jails are doing double duty as their communities’ COVID-19 petri dishes. But while people on the outside can take precautions, incarcerated people can’t.The very nature of congregate living in prisons and jails precludes physical distancing, adequate sanitation and personal hygiene. When exposed to the virus, incarcerated people are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease and/or death, due in part to high rates of chronic conditions and limited staff capacity for health care services to meet incarcerated people’s complex healthneeds.These high rates of COVID-19 infections in prisons and jails aren’t just limited to the confines ofthese systems. The health of incarcerated people isinextricably linkedto the health of ourcommunities. We know that infectious diseases travel rapidly between communities andcorrectional facilities. We’ve seen it for centuries with tuberculosis, for decades with hepatitis C,and we’re seeing it now with COVID-19.Nationally, more than 405,000 correctional staff clock in, clock out, run errands in theircommunity and return home daily. Their movement from work to home and the potential tospread COVID-19 is particularly concerning, especially if you consider thatCOVID-19vaccination is lagging among Minnesota prison workers.The apparent trade-off to resisting vaccination in the spirit of freedom, is that staff end up withless freedom when people are out sick. Resulting low staffing levels give staff less freedom totake a day off, less freedom to socialize in their personal lives, less freedom to feel physicallysafe in the workplace and to do one’s work well. The implications of COVID-19 surges in prisons and jails aretaking a toll on workers,contributing even more to burnout, unsafe workingconditions for staff and unsafe living conditions for those incarcerated.Minnesota’s attempt to give state employees time to warm up to the idea of protecting publichealth has been a failure. It’s time for Gov. Tim Walz to insist the Minnesota Department ofCorrections (DOC live up to its mission of “transforming lives for a safer Minnesota.” Adequatelyprotecting people from COVID-19, and taking all the necessary measures to do so, absolutelyfalls within the scope of the mission the Minnesota Department of Corrections and other publicsafety departments across the state.With the omicron variant’s alarming surge, the state government should invest in makinghigh-quality masks (KN95 or N95 readily and consistently available to prison and jailemployees and the incarcerated individuals in their care. Even better, leverage funding tosupport other proven public health measures inside, such as HEPA air filtration systems.In the midst of America’s bizarre politicization of the behavior of an unpredictable virus, it’simperative that the state of Minnesota demand that employees in congregate living facilities dotheir part to protect the public’s health. In the absence of similar federal expectations, we call onthe governor to make Minnesota an example — and exemplar — of best policy and practice toprotect the health of staff, incarcerated people and our communities.Rebecca Shlafer, Katie Pierson and Ingie Osman are all employees at the University ofMinnesota, where they lead a CDC-funded project focused on COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake in prisons and jails."
minnpost_2022_140,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“I am not disappointed. I am disgusted with the city of Minneapolis,” Karen Wills, Amir Locke’s mother, said after it wasannouncedthat the police officer who killed her son would not be faced with charges. This verdict has left me wondering if anything has truly changed in Minneapolis since 2020 with the murder of George Floyd or even since 2015 when Jamar Clark was killed by the police. I’ve previously written about howMinnesota Nice makes race conversations difficultandHow pride and allegiance to Minnesota prevents equity and change, but what would happen if we shifted to focusing on healing, radical hope and joy?This idea reemerged when I read a recenttweetbyPatience Zalanga, a local freelance photographer who stated, “A city that has not fully reckoned with the murder of George Floyd is a city that is desperately avoiding healing. Healing is not only a personal responsibility, but a collective one as well.” This quote is a reminder that healing is not about ignoring the pain and the anger — that’s called avoiding. We can heal by creating new projects, but in order to create we need to feel all the emotions. Therefore, healing in Minneapolis will look like everyone acknowledging the pain, weeping together, empathizing with one another and being angry as a collective, but also taking that anger and sadness into action.Many community members are already doing this well, likeTangible Collectivethat creates space for healing, community-building and self-reflection with art orNorthside Healing Spacein North Minneapolis which heals trauma through rest, remembrance, resistance and revival. TheSelf-Care fair, which occurred last year and is happening again this year also brings together holistic healing modalities like acupuncture and movement healing andZenBinprovides services to heal trauma through classes like R&B Candlelit Yoga and a Namaste Fit Full Body Workout.However, there needs to be greater investment in these community initiatives because communities hold the answers and truly know what should be prioritized. Health justice and equity will not occur in the silo of these institutions in America, but especially not in Minneapolis due to the immense amount of trauma resting in this city. This is why academic institutions with a plethora of research dollars need to invest less in publications and more in their neighboring communities. Medical schools in Minnesota should make it required for medical school students to simply sit and just be with those in the community instead of requiring community based projects without any conversations on identity, power, privilege and cultural humility. The collective healing within this city will require people from different sectors getting out of the comfort of their offices and investing in communities who have been most marginalized in this city.Practically, that looks like more of us challenging the status quo of what’s being done within our sector. For example, if you are conducting research begin thinking: How could the research I do involve sharing my power, so that community members are the ones forming research questions and prioritizing their own needs? If you are working in healthcare, begin to ask: What would it look like to create healing spaces for healthcare workers where can they debrief after experiencing triggering patient encounters, so that their own trauma doesn’t hurt future patients? Or if you work in other industries, how could you speak up against a racist encounter directed toward your colleague?Overall, Minneapolis is a city in need of deep healing and there is hope that this city will become one others in America can mirror and look up to. As Bernie Lim, a community activist and medical school student who foundedFreedom Community Clinicsaid, “We can’t just know what we are against. We have to know what we are for.” Yes, we are against racism, sexism and all the -isms that exist, but it’s time that as a city we also know what we are for. Therefore, instead of simply announcing all the inequities that exist in these yearly op-eds, will we decide to keep being a city that avoids or will we choose to heal collectively?Ayomide Ojebuoboh is an MD-PhD student at the University of Minnesota."
leoweekly_2022_46,"By law, we stand free to express our deepest thoughts, publish our inner unsettlings, devote ourselves to something beyond our secular world, and peacefully assemble in an expression of our shared values. However, these freedoms are only as powerful as our privilege. For those who casually enjoy lives of extensive advantages, their freedom is as profound as the status they hold. Yet, for those who live without these privileges, for the people who fall between the cracks molded by those in power, their freedom is as absent as the privileges they cease to possess.Privileges, the ones that can so distinctly determine the pavement of our lives, are abundant for many — some out of our control, yet most can be adjusted for the good of others. Adjustment only comes, however, when injustice is realized, when we realize that the world we live in is not equal and that our current society is built only for the benefit of the privileged few. We live in a time when one’s characteristics — religion, gender, sexuality, skin color — can determine their path. That is not the freedom we so fervidly hold dear, but much rather the opposite. It is injustice.These injustices persist so profusely — some stimulated by physical appearance — but for what? What is gained from discriminating against someone based on their appearance? Rationally, the way someone is treated should never stem from the complexion of their skin, yet, in our world, it seems to be the only thing that matters. Now, some would say that after we abolished Jim Crow and adopted Civil Rights ideologies into law, we dissolved and dismissed the racist roots upon which our country was built; yet, in reality, we are nowhere close. By law, our country may grant the freedoms that one so rightfully deserves, but those liberties are torn down by the inhumanity that crawls amply within our lives.As humans, our quest for perfection is immutable yet unattainable. Even in its impossibility, however, our struggle for perfection inches us towards equality — towards a world absent of hatred and discrimination. But this change can only be obtained when privilege breaks from self-interest and is redirected towards the benefit of others. For many of us, the world we live in is already set up for our success; who we are does not blockade the life we wish to live, our beliefs are not swallowed by sieges of prejudice, the tint of our skin does not hinder our liberties and pursuits of happiness. We live openly, yet we are blind, oblivious to the fact that others do not have the same advantages as us; this blindness is the obstacle to our world’s needed change.We live in a country that has the potential to embody the freedoms it was supposedly built upon, but that potential can only be reached when we start treating people as people — not as us or them, not as poor or rich, not as Black or white, but as people. Privilege brings about self-advantage, but it can also bring about equality for others. Stop the hatred. Stop the aversion, the prejudice, the discrimination. Stop hindering someone because of who they are. Let your privilege disperse into the goodness of others. Create a world where skin color does not hinder liberties, where beliefs are not swallowed by sieges of prejudice, where who you are does not blockade the life you wish to live. Raise your voice, not so as to shout, but so that others may be heard. Let your privilege fortify the freedom of others, not deplete it.Editor’s Note: The Center for Interfaith Relations recently solicited essays from emerging young authors (ages 13-18 as part of its Young Authors Essay Contest.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_64,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°There comes a time when the social media-consuming public needs to step back and ask whether their continued use of a particular service might be doing more harm than good. Elon Musk’s Twitter might have reached such a turning point in the public’s eye, just as Donald Trump’s recent dinner with two well-known antisemites is causing longtime Trump supporters in the Republican Party to reach their breaking point.Both Musk and Trump profess ignorance for recent actions that helped empower white supremacists and antisemites. If they are, in fact, ignorant, that should be reason enough for the general public to shun them for the fools they clearly are. If they’re only feigning ignorance, that’s all the more reason to start treating them as pariahs rather than rock stars.The stakes are high for both: Trump is now in his third campaign for the presidency, while Musk, the world’s richest person, has just sunk $44 billion into his ill-advised purchase of Twitter. Neither can afford the kinds of dangerous relationships they’re cultivating, yet they continue to do it as if they’re playing some kind of game.Musk this week tweeted out a meme of Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that is the go-to symbol for alt-right racists and antisemites who have used the cartoon to honor Adolf Hitler and Nazi gas chambers. Musk wound up deleting the meme, but the damage was done. The posting came at a time when hate groups that were banned under Twitter’s previous ownership have received amnesty under Musk. He claimed to be abiding by the results of a seriously unscientific poll he conducted among Twitter account holders that, by his own assessment before he bought the company, might have included millions of fake accounts.By freeing the haters — along with Trump — to resume using Twitter to spread lies, cultivate hatred and promote insurrection, Musk crosses the line from supporting free speech to actively promoting and normalizing racism and antisemitism.Trump last week hosted a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate with antisemitic rapper Ye (formerly Kanye West and Nicholas Fuentes, an openly antisemitic white supremacist. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., generated controversy earlier this year by speaking at a forum in Texas sponsored by Fuentes, after which she professed ignorance about his background. Her 2021 social media posting expressing a belief that wildfires in California were started by “Jewish space lasers” suggests that, perhaps, her embrace of Fuentes was out of solidarity, not ignorance.That’s all it takes — ignorance and complicity by the likes of Musk, Twitter and Trump — to legitimize the fringe beliefs of kooks as mainstream forms of thought. Hitler rallied a nation and conquered a subcontinent without a tool as powerful as Twitter. We can only imagine the horrors to come if Musk insists on opening Twitter to modern-day brownshirts.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"
eugeneweekly_2022_15,"We ve got issues. It is a madly accelerating techno-world, one of endless interruption. So-called social media have clearly made social existence worse. Popular books and articles treat online immersion as a threat or an affliction.Outsmart Your Smartphone, by Tchiki Davis (2018 ;Overcoming Internet Addiction for Dummies, by David Greenfield (2020 ; “I Gave up my Phone for 30 Days to Tackle My Screen Addiction — and it Changed My Life,” by anon. (2012 , for example. It’s instructive that the designers and purveyors of social media are very likely to keep their own kids away from it. Apt to send them to Waldorf schools, where electronics are banned! “Detox” programs and camps proliferate, especially in summer. The negative and addictive effects of social media could hardly be more widely known, as per countless studies and reports. In the rushed technosphere, do folks daydream anymore? Some of us still write letters, but they’ve been pretty much replaced by tweets, “likes,” and the rest of fast-food-type “communication.” Even though we know that outside social media, people have more time and enjoy better mental/emotional health. “The Machine Stops” is an E.M. Forster story written in 1909. Forster envisioned people averse to human interaction and living in separate underground pods. They communicate electronically, controlled by a network called the Machine — until it begins to fall apart. Jaron Lanier, who, ironically, brought us virtual reality, finds hope in the storied collapse of the Machine as he tries to imagine a reformed model for social media. This could somehow be realized via a big changeover, called for in his 2018 book,Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. Social media needs a makeover because, after all, “We can’t afford to ditch it,” he asserts. We can’t afford not to try to fix it, “because otherwise we’ll eventually have to gut a whole universe of digital technology.” A whole universe that is carrying us further and further into the isolated, unhealthy, deskilled, surveilled, alienated dimensions of technology. Lanier is desperate to salvage this universe, but my hope is that it will collapse like the Machine in Forster’s story. It is really up to us to decide what needs to go. Always wired, ever more so?

suffolknewsherald_2022_210,"Published 6:15 pm Friday, January 7, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Chris QuilpaThere is promotion and a love of peace when there is education that is accessible to all. Education can change the mindset of people who have it, and it is what we all need at the moment to promote and safeguard world peace — not weapons that destroy everything, including our dreams and aspirations.Former South Africa president and 1993 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Nelson Mandela, once said education “is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world,” which has become more chaotic and less peaceful.In his annual message for World Peace Day on New Year’s Day 2022, to all leaders or heads of states/countries around the world, Pope Francis urged world leaders to have more funding on education of their people and less spending on their military weapons that contribute to world’s confrontation, competition and division, disunity, insecurity, instability and uncertainty.He encouraged all to “work together to build a more peaceful world, starting from the hearts of individuals and relationships in the family, then within society and with the environment, and all the way up to relationships between peoples and nations.”As people are back on the grind with caution, after the holidays, it is my ardent hope that COVID-19 will be a thing of the past, a lasting memory in world history (although not forgotten because of what it did to the world .What I would like to see is for our local, national and world leaders to be proactive and more concerned with more funding on education that empowers people to help themselves make the world a better, safer place for future generations and less spending on weapons that annihilate and destroy humanity and possibly the planet earth where we’re responsible to protect and to preserve.With access to (free or affordable education and healthcare worldwide, healthy children and the general population can be aware or assertive to fight for their human rights — the right to life, liberty, equality and justice — and contribute to nation-building and world peace, order and security. As Mandela said, with education, people can change their life and world better than what their ancestors have dreamt of.Weapons, by their very nature, are agents of destruction, killings, violence and lawlessness instead of agents or tools to promote peace and order and security. Education empowers one to be a good, law-abiding and upright citizen who cares about his/her life, the earth and environment and other societal issues that affect his/her well-being, relationships with others, and good disposition in life.Education is a catalyst of constructive changes and reforms. It spurs and stimulates a person or a nation’s growth and development. It encourages everyone, any group or organization or nation, to be better, useful, productive and responsible. It is an equalizer, leveling the playing field of opportunities for everyone who has it. With education, there is an opportunity to excel and be successful or progressive in his/her own way.Education promotes good faith, love, charity, fraternity, service, nationalism, patriotism, peace, social justice, equality, security and unity.Pope Francis said, “Education helps provide the skills and setting for dialogue between generations, cooperation and sharing expertise and experiences for promoting integral human development.” However, “there has been a significant reduction worldwide in funding for education and training, these have been seen more as expenditures than investments.”“Having dignified work is also part of building and keeping peace, as it lets people contribute toward a more habitable and beautiful world,” he said.He urged countries to cut military spending, boost investment in education and do more to “promote the culture of care, which, in the face of social divisions and unresponsive institutions, could become a common language working to break down barriers and build bridges.”Chris A.

suffolknewsherald_2022_59,"Published 5:24 pm Tuesday, June 14, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Holly ClaytorGuest columnistAfter 36 years, 22 at the helm, Special Olympics Virginia’s President Rick Jeffrey is turning in his whistle — although he’s never really been a whistle sort of guy.Most would describe him as a coach; in fact, many address him this way on the day to day. But it’s more than just a term given to the leader of a statewide sports organization because it’s about, well, sports. It’s because he truly is.Good coaches listen. Good coaches learn. Good coaches love. And since he stepped foot onto the Special Olympics fields of play on a hot day in August 1986, Rick Jeffrey has been all of those things – and more.After 14 years serving in several roles of growing responsibility at the organization, Rick assumed the role of president in 2000 and if you’re looking for a good sports analogy (something Rick also loved , he hit a home run. Or perhaps since he’s ready to swing his club into retirement, a hole in one.Under his leadership, the organization’s financial soundness has been unmatched, with a current reserve fund of more than $4.7 million and a $1.7 million endowment that was set up during his tenure to support strategic program initiatives. He has helped the program grow and diversify its fundraising channels, to include large-scale events such as Polar Plunge and Plane Pull, as well as individual and leadership giving, a space few Special Olympics programs currently champion.Prior to the pandemic, Special Olympics Virginia had the most Unified Champion Schools of any Special Olympics program in the country – and this number continues to bounce back as restrictions are lifted. He restructured the team and created positions that allowed the staff to develop, grow and support new programs such as Healthy Athletes, Young Athletes and ongoing fitness opportunities.A sports lover through and through, he continually grew the number of sports offerings and competition experiences in Virginia. He launched the first high-performance tournament in the country, the Special Olympics Virginia Tennis Xperience, an annual invitational for top-level Special Olympics tennis athletes across the United States and in some years even other countries. He held numerous roles on national and regional committees to include serving as the United States Leadership Council (USLC Sports Committee chair.Rick, also the longest-serving Special Olympics Virginia president, strengthened the Board of Directors to include leaders from across the state who provide financial support as well as important and valued guidance on how to grow and sustain the organization not only for the future, but for once-in-a-lifetime events like the COVID pandemic. He changed the culture of the program, allowing staff to be innovative, creative and collaborative, but always focused on organizational goals.It’s about sports. And it’s not about sports at all.Beyond the business, though, Rick notes his greatest accomplishment is steering the vision of the organization to run through the lens of sports. In the beginning, he said, while important, Special Olympics was more of a social experience: an opportunity for families and people with intellectual disabilities to come together and be a part of a community.That community remains one of Special Olympics paramount strengths, but for Rick, it also was about how sports changes the athletes – and how it changes us.“At its core, Special Olympics is about what is possible. We’ve shown people, athletes, parents, families and even ourselves what’s possible if they choose to see it. I’m not sure there is any work more incredible than that.”Great game, Coach.Holly Claytor is vice president of development & communications for Special Olympics Virginia.

minnpost_2022_156,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After several decades of declining business formation rates, the COVID-19 pandemic created a surprising surge in entrepreneurial interest in the U.S. and Minnesota. New business applications — a leading indicator of new business starts — rose by 26% in 2020 and 2021 in Minnesota. This surge has only gained momentum throughout the pandemic.In the Minnesota Chamber Foundation’srecent report, we unpack some of the critical trends shaping entrepreneurship outcomes in Minnesota, including how these outcomes vary across sectors, regions of the state and demographic groups.It is not just small-scale businesses gaining traction; the rise in new business applications pairs with significant growth in venture capital investment. Minnesota startups raised a record $1.5 billion in 2020 and completed a record 175 venture capital deals in 2021. This financial backing is crucial because research shows that a relatively small subset of all new businesses disproportionately drives innovation, job creation and output.Minnesota’s newest wave of innovative companies reflects the state’s diverse economy, with venture capital deal flow ranking high in many technology verticals such as agricultural, educational, financial and supply chain technology, as well as advanced manufacturing, 3D printing and wearables. The next generation of health care startups leads the way, ranging from digital health and biotechnology to medical devices and insurance, showing Minnesota’s ability to align its historical industry strengths with emerging technologies and verticals.Yet, it is not enough to just produce innovative new companies — those companies must also survive and grow past their critical early years to contribute to the state’s economy.Most new businesses in the U.S. fail to make it past their fifth year. However, the inverse is true in Minnesota, with over half of all businesses clearing this threshold. Remarkably, this held true even during the immense challenges of the pandemic. A nation-leading 56% of Minnesota businesses survived past their fifth year in 2020, helping to create stability in the state’s economy during the pandemic-induced downturn.All of this has occurred alongside a host of new startup support resources to provide funding, networking, mentoring and technical assistance to new businesses in Minnesota. This strengthening of Minnesota’s startup ecosystem offers an essential infrastructure to support further entrepreneurship gains in the coming years.But while entrepreneurship is at a turning point, it is not clear what lies around the corner. Notable challenges must be addressed to propel this recent momentum.Early-stage funding also remains a barrier for even the most innovative new startups. This may be particularly true for founders who lack access to the referral networks that can help them get the attention and trust of investors, especially historically disenfranchised groups. Increasing the number of local startup investors and widening access to startup capital will be critical to fueling entrepreneurial growth that is both robust and inclusive.Finally, while Minnesota’s startup ecosystem is gaining steam, it faces challenges related to sustaining awareness and support amidst the multitude of priorities that vie for our collective attention as a state. Entrepreneurs are often unaware of the resources that exist to support them. Individuals may have the ability and interest to invest in local startups but lack the knowledge of how to do so. Business support organizations may struggle to keep up with rising demand amidst resource constraints. Minnesota will need to broadly promote and strengthen the existing tools to support new companies in the future.All these issues require strategic action from business leaders, economic developers, chambers of commerce, financial institutions, policymakers and anyone else with a stake in Minnesota’s economic future. With a high survival rate and a track record of statewide innovation, we urge those with the financial resources to make the smart investment of trusting Minnesota’s ingenuity, funding our next generation of entrepreneurial greatness.Sean O’Neil is director of economic development and research, Minnesota Chamber of Commerce."
minnpost_2022_52,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I have never seen the musical “Hamilton.”Shocking for such an active political person, I know. But as I reached out to friends with my concerns about the rules of secrecy around the Minneapolis mayor’s new workgroups — and their stipulations of silence for participants — I have had several friends quote the song, “The Room Where It Happens.”Everyone in Minneapolis deserves to have what they need to survive, someone to call when they need help, and to not fear the help that may come. I joined Mayor Jacob Frey’s Community Safety Workgroup six weeks ago with the hope to find common ground with others hoping to make Minneapolis safer, and to bring forth my years of work on alternatives to policing.I believe that it is possible to come together across differences to advance solutions that we can all agree on. And I expected disagreement on how to approach the issue of violent policing — but it was my hope that a public workgroup would allow space for many options to be documented and shared for the public, city staff and electeds to consider.However, I am resigning from the Community Safety Workgroup.First, closed door meetings do not align with my values. I think that the best problem-solving happens out in the open, and I was unable to persuade my fellow group members to adopt a transparent approach.Public meetings on charged topics always carry the risk of certain media going for the sensational headline and glossing over the nuance of the conversation — something that has been described to me as a distraction risk. However, I think the benefits of public process far outweigh the risks, and with virtual meetings, it’s easy to make them available to the public. We only have to look as far as our neighbors across the river. TheSaint Paul Community-First Public Safety Commissionlive-streamed all of its meetings without issue. Would it be so different in Minneapolis?Second, I’m a budget person (my personal slogan is, “from the streets to the spreadsheets” , and this workgroup as structured is also not a good use of city resources, including the collective 200 plus hours of city staff’s time. I believe the resources could be better spent on carrying outthe city’s multiple community safety pilots, ramping upgrassroots safety strategydevelopment, or giving the Office of Violence Prevention afull-timeevaluator so we can see which pilots have worked and which haven’t, and build our strategies from data.I don’t think small, incremental reforms to policing are going to bring the change we need either. We have been trying to reform the police for along, long time. Cops think that they are above the law, and they are — the Hennepin County sheriff is a perfect example. Hennepin County Sheriff Dave Hutchinson, like former MPD police officer Derek Chauvin, assumes he can do what he wants and the system will protect him. And current evidence shows law enforcement that this is overwhelmingly true.Since swaths of MPD officers blinded, maimed and traumatized demonstrators after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the only one to be disciplined wasa whistleblower. Police have resisted being reformed, and many of the tasks assigned to police would be better done by other members of our community. When it comes to ending the violence of policing, prisons and surveillance, change requiresbig, structural change, not incremental reforms.People in Minneapolis are hungry to have conversations about safety, policing and justice. As community leaders chosen for this safety workgroup, we had the opportunity to lead by example and have difficult conversations in public. That won’t happen, but curious residents can check outReimaging Community Safetythrough community education, supportREP, a small alternative to police, and build uptransformative justiceskills.Process is as important as product in government. It’s not enough for me to just be in “the room where it happens.” I trust in the people’s ability to observe and analyze what’s happening and be involved along the way, not just be handed intermittent “broad overviews” with a final report afterward. The decisions that point us toward justice and safety for all are going to be the ones that happen right out in the open.Sheila Nezhad holds a master’s degree from the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota.

suffolknewsherald_2022_139,"Published 5:37 pm Friday, March 18, 2022ByStaff ReportsThe wisdom of Virginia’s plunge into legalized sports betting a couple of years ago is debatable, with valid points by both supporters and critics. The new revenue flowing into state coffers is unquestionably helpful when lawmakers are funding essential services like schools and highways, but the societal costs of addictive gambling are substantial, if harder to measure.Downright silly, though, is the refusal by state legislators, having already rolled the dice on sports betting, to allow wagers on Virginia college teams.As Kaitlyn Fulmore of the student-run Capital News Service at Virginia Commonwealth University reports,“Six Virginia men’s and women’s basketball teams made it into March Madness, but state law prevents fans and bettors from placing wagers on their favorite in-state college teams.”A Virginia resident can bet on Duke to win or lose, but not Longwood or Norfolk State? Incredible.Fulmore reports that lawmakers attempted to change the law with Senate Bill 576 by Sen. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg. The bill was approved by the Senate with bipartisan support, but died in the House General Laws Committee.Supporters of the ban foolishly believe they are preventing the shady practice of gamblers “fixing” a game’s outcome by paying a referee or player under the table, pretending, we suppose, that the scoundrels who engage in such activity pay any attention to state lines.A bettor wanting to improperly influence the outcome of a game can easily place his wager through an offshore sportsbook or simply visit a neighboring state. And his access to college athletes is easier than ever, thanks to social media and private messaging apps.“There’s so many ways to wager right now on colleges that carving them out from Virginia sportsbooks doesn’t really make a whole lot of sense,” Dustin Gouker, an analyst for the U.S. sports betting and sports fantasy news website Legal Sports Report, told VCU’s Fulmore.We agree. If anything, banning wagers on in-state schools encourages underground activity rather than curbs it.And the notion that gambling addiction is less of a problem if people can’t bet on their favorite Virginia teams is equally naive. Virginians have wagered more than $1 billion since sports betting became legal in January 2021. Put another way, the horse is out of the gate.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_72,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°It says a lot about the times in which we live when a decision reached by democratic process elicits outrage.Elon Musk, the controversial billionaire behind Tesla, SpaceX and now Twitter, reinstated Donald Trump’s account on Twitter Saturday, reversing a ban that has kept the former president off the social media site since a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as The Associated Press reported.Musk held a poll that asked Twitter users to click “yes” or “no” on whether Trump’s account should be restored. The “yes” vote won, with 51.8%. Previously, Musk had said Twitter would establish new procedures and a “content moderation council” before making decisions to restore suspended accounts.“The people have spoken. Trump will be reinstated. Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” Musk tweeted, using a Latin phrase meaning “the voice of the people, the voice of God.”But in our progressive national landscape, vox populi is nebulous. Political and cultural leaders are happy to tell the populi what they should accept or not, their vox be damned. And the less said about dei the better.That’s how cancel culture works. An opinion or position is aired with which the cognoscenti doesn’t agree, and a media mob busts out the flaming torches of dismissal.Free speech? That protection is selective.“After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” Twitter said in a 2021 statement.Yet clips of Rep. Maxine Waters telling Black Lives Matter protesters awaiting the George Floyd verdict in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, last year: “We’re looking for a guilty verdict. And we’re looking to see if all of the talk that took place and has been taking place after they saw what happened to George Floyd, if nothing does not happen, then we know that we’ve got to not only stay in the street, but we’ve got to fight for justice,” are still circulating on Twitter.Some speech is freer than others, apparently.The left is livid, of course, by Musk’s move. The Atlantic called it “terrifically stupid,” while Rep. Adam Schiff said that Musk made a “terrible mistake” by reinstating Trump.Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter with her response: “Idk man, last time he was here this platform was used to incite an insurrection, multiple people died, the Vice President of the United States was nearly assassinated, and hundreds were injured but I guess that’s not enough for you to answer the question. Twitter poll it is.”It’s no secret that the left despises Trump. But the idea that some Twitter users get a free speech pass while others are banned is antithetical to democracy. If you’re going to ban controversial speech, ban it all.Musk’s move riles the left not just for offering Trump a spot of the platform once again. It sent a signal to progressive leaders that they have to share the megaphone.— Boston Herald"
leoweekly_2022_50,"The last time I sued the Louisville Metro Jail, I got to question the former director extensively. He was a real character, sort of like if Jerry Bruckheimer and Vince McMahon co-conceived a tough-but-fair police chief for a movie about a heist at the Kentucky Derby or something. I asked him if he thought there was an overcrowding problem at the jail. “Yes, absolutely.” But did that mean the staff, afflicted with a chronic case of vacancies, couldn’t effectively care for 2,500 bodies in a facility that was only built to hold 2,000? No, he said. They can do it. That was bullshit of course; they couldn’t, they can’t, and they don’t. Still, I sort of liked the old director, insofar as one can like someone who has devoted a career to keeping human zoos.I don’t know outgoing jail director Dwayne Clark all that well, but I don’t envy him. After all those people died on his watch, Metro Council passed a “no confidence” resolution against Clark, the city launched a long and expensive investigation into the jail’s policies and practices, and Clark announced his retirement.I thought about writing a satirical piece about all these goings-on, but decided against it because American jails are just not funny. There was a time when you could laugh at an Otis-the-town-drunk-in-the-hoosegow type because Otis wasn’t strapped naked to a restraint chair and tased into submission. But today, clowning on a metropolitan jail is a singularly humorless act. People go to jail and get beat up, tortured, raped and killed. Nothing funny about that.It’s true that the Louisville jail is an abattoir, a stinking sewage pipe, a hell undreamt of by the wildest acid trips of Dante Alighieri, Clive Barker, or Supergiant Games. Clark and the rest of LMDC’s longtime administrators certainly bear plenty of responsibility for that. But I’ll make you a bet: Even if you get rid of Clark and replace the entire staff, people will keep right on dying in that jail, just as they did under the last director and the director before that. What, then, could be the root of the problem?If you are not part of Metro Council or Mayor Fischer, you may skip this paragraph. For the rest of you, I hereby offer to investigate the problem at the jail for half of what you’re paying whoever to do whatever. OK, my investigation is complete. My finding is this: We are locking up too damn many people. Please send a check to my office.It’s nice to have Clark, and by extension the jail itself, as a scapegoat for the problems inherent in caging thousands of people at a time. But how many decisionmakers are involved in locking someone up before they ever see the inside of that overgrown outhouse? In a town the size of Louisville, do we really need to segregate more than two thousand people from the rest of us? If so, is the best we can do for every last one of them a 6-foot by 8-foot box? Who’s responsible for making sure that a community has something besides an oubliette for people to go to when they need a little break from civilized society?A jail is supposed to be the terminal stop; the place we send folks when there’s nowhere left to send them. But in Louisville, as in most of America, the jail is pretty much the only stop. Are there genuinely good people working in corrections? No. But aren’t those people doing the best they can under the circumstances? Again, no. But still, what is Clark or anyone else supposed to do when we keep sending people downtown, even as bodies are mashed up against the interior bricks and limbs poking out of the windows? Turn them away? I submit that if a Metro jail director ever did something half so brave they’d be out on their ass within a week, with or without a vote of no-confidence.If you missed the LEO’s coverage of the death of Keith Smith while in LMDC custody, mark your place in this column,read it, then come back. What was your reaction to Smith getting locked up after nine — godalmighty nine — failures to appear? He had it coming, right? The judge did what most of us would have done: kept Smith in a cage, even while acknowledging that “he probably needs a little bit more assistance than what the criminal justice system can provide for him.”As a community, we suffer from a stunning lack of imagination combined with a deliberate dearth of resources. We are conditioned to believe that there are only two places for Smith and countless others like him: Jail, or back to the Seelbach to fuck with weary travelers who are full of veal and triple sec. We’ve believed it for so long that we’ve made it intractably, tragically true. It scarcely matters whether the visionaries among us can imagine alternatives. There are none.A default button marked “JAIL” makes for an easy solution to complex social problems. But here’s the catch: If prosecutors seek jail time or high cash bail (which is what prosecutors are trained to do , and judges send people to jail (which is the only place they can send them , and cops lock people up until their arraignment dates at the earliest (which is just how we do things for some reason , and we keep letting these folks run the whole show (sure, why not , then a jail is going to be overcrowded. No getting around that. Combine overcrowding with staff shortages and you will have deaths and rapes and torture and mayhem and layers of shit and blood and piss because what we’ve set up, after all, is a variation on a concentration camp, one that is treated as a necessary institution instead of an aberration, not a final stop but the first and only place to send our undesirables. We set these camps up in the middle of our towns and forget about them, noticing only when the stench of death overpowers.Here’s yet another set of questions to consider, one with implications so bleak that you might as well stop reading now. What if the deaths of the last few months are the only thing keeping our community engaged with jail conditions, or with criminal justice at all? Suppose the jail expanded to hold 10,000 people, and we locked up only 9,000. Suppose we paid an adequate number of staffers a decent wage and trained them to keep people more-or-less alive. Suppose there were no deaths or serious injuries again, ever. Just 9000 bodies warehoused in that hellmouth, subjected to moderate-to-severe levels of misery for weeks/months/years at a time. Would you give more than a passing thought to those people, or to the jail, ever again?Dan Canon is a civil rights lawyer and law professor.

The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as: “not partial or biased : treating or affecting all equally.” Virginia’s Oath of Office for elected constitutional officers (commonwealth’s attorney, treasurer, sheriff, commissioner of the revenue, etc. requires the office-holder to swear to “faithfully and impartially discharge all duties” to the best of their ability. Recent actions by Suffolk’s commonwealth’s attorney brings into question whether she is living up to this oath.Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney Narendra Pleas should immediately recuse herself from any involvement in the matter of the forged signatures on the Bredemeyer candidate petition and request the Suffolk Circuit Court appoint a special prosecutor. I believe Pleas has clear conflicts of interest that call into question the impartiality of her office.According to the Virginia Department of Elections’ campaign finance reports, the petition circulator under investigation for the alleged forged signatures, as well as Bredemeyer’s campaign manager, worked for Pleas’ 2021 campaign for Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney. On top of that, Pleas’ campaign accepted donations from companies or partnerships owned by both the former candidate and the Notary, himself a former city councilman, that acknowledged all 17 petition pages that contained forgeries.Isle of Wight Commonwealth’s Attorney Georgette Phillips recused herself from handling the Windsor traffic stop matter to avoid the appearance of impartiality. Virginia Beach Commonwealth’s Attorney Colin Stolle recused himself from handling the Scott Taylor campaign election fraud incident because he was related to some of the forgery victims. Special prosecutors are routinely appointed to ensure the impartiality of the system and avoid actual or apparent conflicts.I believe it is clear Suffolk Borough residents had a fraud committed against them when a circulator forged 200 names on a candidate petition. As I sat in the Suffolk Electoral Board special meeting on Aug. 16, having had my own signature forged, there was one common feeling — anger. Anger that someone chose to take away our voice and choice on whether to sign the petition. Anger that the board was slow to react. Anger that no one from the city had notified those whose names appeared to be forged.The Suffolk registrar and electoral board made the right decision in removing the candidate from the ballot. Suffolk’s commonwealth’s attorney should make the right decision in recusing herself and requesting a special prosecutor. Failure to do so will cast a shadow on the investigation and bring into question the impartiality of the justice system in the City of Suffolk.Will WebbSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_181,"Published 6:51 pm Friday, February 4, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:After reading Jimmy LaRoue’s article (“Mask requirement still stands for SPS,” Jan. 23 , as a student of Suffolk Public Schools, I am beyond pleased that the school board will still require the students, faculty and staff to wear masks.The protocols and things in place to stop the spread of Covid-19 are obviously not going to fully stop the virus from spreading, but they at least limit the contact. Not to mention, it would be safer for students to wear masks when in contact with one another. Asymptomatic people, or people who do not show signs of being infected, can spread the virus, and they would never know that they had it in the first place. Not wearing a mask means that asymptomatic people can spread the virus and other germs more easily. This could result in students bringing home the germs they carry from school and affecting other family members as well as the friends of their younger/older siblings or the coworkers of their parents, and the same thing can be said about faculty and staff members.Many SPS high schools were overcrowded even before the pandemic. This is still an issue today, and I can personally attest to this. Whenever the bell rang for the next block to begin, the halls would be crowded to the point where if one person stopped, they would block the way for at least five to 10 other people. Sicknesses are easy to catch in a setting like this because one student can sneeze and think it is OK, but that one sneeze can travel across a room and infect another person even if they did cover their sneeze with their elbow. The same can be said about a cough, because even if a student covered their mouth when they coughed, the germs are now on their hands. Moreover, if that student goes to touch another student or object without washing their hands, then they have already begun spreading germs. With students being so close together throughout the day, it just makes the spread of germs (and the virus easier.To all parents and adults that read this, please think about the safety of your child(ren and those around your child(ren . To those who are against the mask mandates, you are absolutely right, masks do not full-on stop the spread of Covid-19, but at least it limits the spread of the virus.

minnpost_2022_101,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In his State of the Stateaddress in April, Gov. Tim Walz explained that Minnesota is blessed with incredible natural resources, both with our people and our land. He also said there are “free market solutions” that can move us toward a sustainable future to protect the environment we depend on and our children can one day rely on as well. I care deeply about advancing climate solutions and protecting the environment. But there’s more than one way to make environmental achievements and Minnesota should follow its own path, one that makes sense for our people and our own unique economy.Unfortunately,Walz is championing a significant and non-free market policy in the name of environmental protection. The governor’s electric vehicle mandate is at its core consumer coercion. By forcing California’s electric vehicle policies onto Minnesota, we could jeopardize vital sectors that support the livelihoods of thousands of Minnesotans.A number of Minnesota leaders have pushed back on the mandate. On May 2, the Minnesota Senate approved the Consumer Choice of Fuel Act in its omnibus bill, a policy stopping the state from restricting the sale of vehicles and other equipment based on their fuel source and which would prohibit any requirement for auto dealers to have a certain amount of those vehicles in their inventory. I was proud to testify in support of this bill at a hearing in March to express my own concerns about a vehicle mandate and criticize the way this mandate was forced upon Minnesotans.Walz’s electric vehicle mandate wasn’t passed by elected leaders like most new rules. Instead, it was adopted through the administrative rule-making process by regulators. In other words, the people deciding the future of our state’s vehicle market weren’t elected by us, but appointed by the governor. We, the voters, essentially had no voice. Not even the people we elect to represent us, the members of the House and Senate, had a say. That’s why they drafted the Consumer Choice of Fuel Act to stop the electric vehicle mandate before it could become law.As Sen. Andrew Mathews correctlyexplained, “We should not be ruled by mandates and rule-making. We should be ruled by the rule of law, by our elected legislative bodies and being the voices of the people in our districts that have sent us here to enact statutes.”Unfortunately, during the proceedings Sen. Nick Frentz tried to remove the Consumer Choice of Fuel Act from the omnibus bill, claiming it would prohibit the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency from regulating tailpipe emissions. That misrepresentation by Frentz is disappointing. The policy protects consumers from mandates versus restricting a regulatory body that, candidly, isn’t suited to oversee these new rules on EVs given their charge is tailpipes, a part electric vehicles don’t even have.The reality is that Minnesota and California are two vastly different states with different economies, different air quality and different consumer preferences for vehicles. We shouldn’t tie ourselves to California’s standards, especially given our robust agriculture industry that relies on liquid fuels. One of Minnesota’s main sources of revenue is farming, specifically the corn and soybeans used in part to produce ethanol and biodiesel.Now, this industry is a serious economic driver,supportingnearly 19,000 full-time jobs in the state andcreating$1.5 billion worth of income for Minnesota households. Overall, biofuelscontribute$203 million to state and local government tax rolls. Today, this industry simply can’t run on electric vehicles. That’s why the Agricultural Retailers Association estimates there would be a$27 milliondecrease in U.S. net farm income by 2050 if there were a ban on internal combustion-powered vehicles. Mandates like the one Walz has pushed could set us down a dangerous path toward a ban on gas-powered equipment. That might be great for Californians, but it would cripple Minnesota farmers.We all want to do our part to protect Minnesota’s environment, but tying our future to California by mandating electric vehicles is silly and dangerous. It’s time to abandon this bad idea and protect Minnesotans through policies like the Consumer Choice of Fuel Act. Let’s start leaning on those “free market solutions” the governor alluded to and think more practically about ways to help the environment without threatening farmers and the Minnesota economy.Eric Zurn of Callaway is the vice president of Becker/Mahnomen Soybean and Corn Growers."
eugeneweekly_2022_9,"We ve got issues. As a wildland firefighter, fire policy analyst and fire ecology advocate, I’ve learned to respect the power of wildfire and its vital ecological role, and appreciate humanity’s unique skill in using fire to help nurture Nature’s balance and abundance. I thought I knew what wildfires would do in the westside Cascades, and long ago tuned out the newsmedia’s sensationalism and the Forest Service’s fear-mongering about “catastrophic wildfires.” But then came the 2020 Labor Day firestorms. East winds blowing warm, dry air down western slopes in the fall are rare but natural events, and are usually localized to a few mountain valleys. It is likely that many of the Cascades’ majestic old-growth Douglas fir forests were born in the flames fanned by such events centuries ago. But the windstorm that blew like a bulldozer’s blade from B.C. to Baja sparked new fires and whipped up existing blazes all along the Pacific West, each wildfire surging thousands of acres in the span of a couple days. Many of those fires were sparked by powerlines igniting fires in the worst places and conditions. One powerline fire in Oregon started inside a firefighter base camp, forcing hundreds of crews to flee for their lives. Another powerline ignition is a prime suspect for starting the Holiday Farm Fire, which burned like a blowtorch in a wind tunnel down the McKenzie River Valley. Firefighters were overwhelmed from the moment they arrived on scene, forced to do traffic control for residents evacuating with a minute’s notice because it was humanly impossible to directly engage the fire. Homes sandwiched between the McKenzie River and the highway ignited from a blizzard of embers, and eventually burned down to ashes. No firelines could have surpassed those features to save those homes. Corporate timber plantations in the surrounding foothills were totally incinerated from crown fires that swept through their tree farms. No amount of fuels reduction could have surpassed the clearcutting that took place before the fire. We now know absolutely that we cannot prevent wildfires, and firefighters cannot stop and put out all wildfires. Decades of Smokey Bear propaganda that conditioned people to wrongly fear all forest fires is now being amplified by the valid fear of climate change, and the specter that people are powerless in the face of climate-driven megafires. The despair and disempowerment known as “climate doomism” is expressing itself in a kind of wildfire doomism that wrongly believes there is nothing we can do to avoid catastrophe. But we are not powerless. There are tangible, practical steps that people can take to become safer in their homes, and to make forests become more resilient in a world where large-scale fire events are becoming more frequent. The first thing to do is to harden homes against flames and embers and reduce combustibles within 100 feet of your house. This greatly reduces the chance your home will ignite and burn even in the midst of a high-intensity wildfire. Knowing that people and property are prepared for fire will enable crews to perform beneficial ecological fire management instead of ineffective emergency fire suppression. It will provide more opportunities for prescribed fires and Indigenous cultural burning that are the most effective, economical ways to reduce fuel hazards and wildfire risks while also restoring fire-adapted ecosystems and cultural resources essential to Indigenous communities. The sooner we prepare homes and rural communities for fire, the sooner we can restore forest ecosystems with fire. The 2020 Labor Day firestorm was like a 1,000-year flood of fire, the most dramatic and terrifying sign of climate change we’ve experienced in the Pacific Northwest — so far. I admit that I was humbled by the ferocity of those firestorms that exhibited fire behavior beyond anyone’s living memory. While large-scale wildfires were formerly rare events in western Oregon, they will become more common in our future. For a hopeful vision that a new relationship with forest fires can be forged with practical actions that keep fire in the forest but out of our homes, I invite you to see the inspiring new documentary,Elemental, showing at the newly-renovated Bijou Art House Sept. 9 through 16. Opening night will feature a reception with educational displays from local nonprofits and a panel of wildfire experts to answer your questions following the film. We can relearn how to live safely and sustainably with fire on the land. Labor Day is the perfect day for all of us to get to work on preparing for that future.

He is co-founder and executive director of the Eugene-based nonprofit Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology (FUSEE and teaches fire courses at the University of Oregon and Lane Community College."

Commencement ceremonies inspire much of the same thinking in me.One of my favorite Christmas carols has always been “Do You Hear What I Hear?” The beautiful melody and hopeful ending inspire reflection and hope for a better world. Commencement ceremonies inspire much of the same thinking in me.Yesterday, the University of Hawaii at Hilo held its fall commencement ceremony, and the day before we held our first (and I hope only alumni commencement ceremony for those who graduated during the pandemic and did not get to experience a traditional ceremony. Both events were rich in tradition and goodwill, from the opening kipaepae to the joyful greetings with family afterward. And they were also full of joy and hope for the future.“Do you see what I see? A star, a star dancing in the night.” Each of our graduates is a star in my eyes. Some have had an easy journey, some a difficult one, but as they walked across that stage, any challenges they may have faced are absorbed in their successful completion of a university degree. I am sure many of them are anxious about the future, but what I saw were people prepared to take on the world. They have honed their communication and analytical skills, they have had opportunities to apply those skills in real-world settings, and they have had opportunities to learn deeply about the world around us and forge a path for themselves to meet the challenges of the future.“Do you hear what I hear? A voice as big as the sea.” What many of our students also do not realize is the impact that they have had on us and on our university. Every faculty and staff member has a story about a student or several students that change the way we think about life and our work. Maybe it has been a student in crisis that a staff member has been able to help overcome the challenge. Maybe it was a student who found her passion and future career through something learned in class. Maybe it was a student who saw a subject from a very different perspective than the professor, leading that professor to rethink the design of a course.The great thing about universities is the sheer variety of voices, ideas and perspectives. We all learn from these encounters with one another, and the combined voices that emerge are indeed as big as the sea. Like the sea, some waves of voices are louder or larger than others, but every one of them has a place in our story.For me, one of those moments came several years ago when I took a group of students to a conference in Washington, D.C. I had hoped that the students would have enlightening experiences in the meetings with other students from across the country and in visiting national monuments.But one of the students had a truly transformative experience in the hallway of our hotel when he helped one of the housekeeping staff navigate her heavy cart over a threshold. She was so very grateful and thankful that this student — whose own family had been evicted from their apartment when he was in high school — was stunned. He pondered if the depth of her gratitude came from the fact that most guests ignored the staff unless they needed something and did not take the time to really see these hardworking people struggling in their daily duties. He learned so much from that encounter about privilege and caring, and I, in turn, learned from his experience. That moment of human connection redoubled my commitment to always pay attention to the person in front of me, no matter who they are.I hope our graduates felt seen and heard on our campus and go out into the world not only to provide for their families, but also to see and hear the strangers that they encounter every day. The song ends with the line, “He will bring us goodness and light,” but truly that goodness and light starts with each one of us, and not just around the holidays.Bonnie D.

Cold weather is also the signal for Eugene-Springfield’s Egan Warming Centers to activate when temps drop to 29 degrees or below. Seven winters of serving at Egan Warming Centers remind me that unhoused folks in our community don’t have the luxury of “cozy” on bitter cold nights. For them, life is hard. Just figuring out how to survive one more night in decent weather is exhausting. Bitter cold weather shows no mercy. For unhoused folks, staying warm while unsheltered on bitter cold nights is a life-or-death gamble. Retired Maj. Thomas Egan lost that gamble on the night of Dec. 18, 2008. He froze to death in a snowbank down by the railroad tracks at the end of Blair Boulevard. He willingly served his country, and died alone, a broken man. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. In response to this tragedy, our community rose up and demanded: Never again! That’s who we are: people who know that human suffering, especially among our most vulnerable, is not OK. We’ve already shown ourselves that we are people who work together to ensure that no one is left out in the cold when exposure to the elements can kill you. I don’t “volunteer” at Egan, any more than I volunteer at being a citizen, or a decent human being. I proudly serve at Egan. Sure, I don’t get paid. That’s not the point. I serve at Egan because I see it as my duty, as both citizen and human being, to do my part to relieve suffering and restore the dignity of those who daily suffer the fallout of economic hardship in systems designed to keep them there. None of us alone can solve the problem of economic and social injustice. But every one of us who knows how good it is to be warm on bitter cold nights can do something. Thanks to St. Vincent de Paul Society of Lane County, Egan Warming Centers make it easy for folks like you and me to show up, pitch in, be a team, feel supported and do something not only nice but life-saving for our unhoused neighbors on bitter cold nights. If you haven’t served at an Egan Warming Center in the past, I’d love to serve beside you this winter, as would other seasoned folks, to show you the ropes, get you in the groove and help you find your niche.

Student loans are predatory in nature, preying on literal children who are told they must take out loans to secure their futures. As long as student loans are necessary to embark on a path to higher education in this country, millions of Americans will continue to be indentured to the student loan industry and to the government itself. All of that being said, loan forgiveness is a good thing.Approximately half of student debtorsowe less than $20,000. This is not a lot when looking at the loans carried by doctors, lawyers, MBA holdovers, and the like. But that is not who this forgiveness is intended to help. This helps the people who have been making payments for the past 20 years and are close to having their loans paid off. This helps those people who scrunched and saved and still had trouble affording “affordable” public schools.“Nothing could be more callous than making someone else suffer so they can share in your pain.”I will be in debt for the better part of my life. There is nothing but full student debt forgiveness that can save me from that fate. Butwhat about people on the margins — those who went to school because they were told that is what they had to do, even if they couldn’t afford it and even if the degree they earned had no chance of ensuring them a high-paying job to pay off the loans they took out to secure that degree? Those are the people this forgiveness will help — and it will help them in huge ways.With inflation and uneven wage growth in this country, taking a few hundred dollars in loan payments out of people’s budgets each month is nothing to sneeze at. But there will always be naysayers and cynics.

suffolknewsherald_2022_115,"Published 5:33 pm Wednesday, April 13, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceThe song “Lean on Me” by Bill Withers turns 50 years old this month, but it is a song that many people still know.The lyrics that give an invitation to “Lean on me when you’re not strong,” and the phrase “We all need somebody to lean on,” still resonate with us today. It’s probably still popular because the lyrics are timeless and true. We all need someone to lean on at times. We all need help from others.Helping others is a good thing to do, but there are times when the people we are trying to help seem to not benefit from our assistance. We should never allow ourselves to become jaded from helping others, but there are legitimate times we should re-examine how we are helping.When continued assistance does not seem to help someone, we should take a step back to examine the situation. There can be a fine line between helping and enabling, and there are times when it’s difficult to tell the difference.It is wise to look at the situation to determine if what we are doing to help is actually assisting the person in overcoming a challenging problem or allowing them to continue to make poor decisions. It’s not our job to judge others, but we should be judging if what we are doing is helping the person or putting them deeper into a bad situation. If our help only enables a person’s bad habits or poor decisions, it does not really help.We should also see if the help we are giving is costing us more than we realize. I am not saying that we should not help others if it costs us something. The very nature of help costs the giver something, and we should be willing to sacrifice to help those in need. However, sometimes when we try to help, we drag ourselves down more than lifting someone else up. It’s not a help if we end up in the same pit that we were trying to help someone leave.Lastly, we should realize that some people will never be able to be helped enough. It doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to assist, but we should be cautious when we see that we can never give enough. Some are just unable or unwilling to use the help given to grow out of a situation. There are various reasons they may not be able to move forward, but those who are never satisfied with the help given can be a sign that our support isn’t actually helping.When we run into situations like these, we should pause to consider if we are actually helping or if we need to shift the manner of our assistance. It doesn’t make us a bad or judgmental person, and it doesn’t mean we don’t want to help. It just means that we want to help wisely.As we examine the help we give, we should err on the side of generosity when you help others. It is better to give too much than not enough.

suffolknewsherald_2022_75,"Published 8:27 pm Friday, May 27, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonGuest columnistThis tragedy cannot be ignored. All America should be weeping.Precious little children, a part of our future, unaware of danger, unable to defend themselves, no opportunity to get away from a demented young man bent on killing, parents in shock, their hands over their mouths, soon possibly thinking of the last kiss, the bit of instructions they gave and now, not even able to give a last-minute hug.Worse yet, having to identify a tiny body in a shape very different from how they sent the child to school, their little one gone forever, a small casket and a gravestone the next step in their haunting experience.It is the second time in these past shortened weeks we have heard the age “18 years old.” What about these young males? Were they thinking about what they were doing? Under some influence, unable to think straight?But that can’t be so. because they made their plans. They had enough reasoning ability to carry out this egregious decision — first to determine a site, in one case a supermarket and in the other, a school. One young man, the decision to kill his grandmother.And what did he have against the little innocent children? What made him decide to go to where 7- 8- and 9-year-olds were in school? Just moments earlier these little ones were being taught the basics that create a life for our culture — reading or doing an assignment, even, perhaps, laughing, having a good day, each one learning something new.And then, very suddenly, fear! A traumatic turn the children as well as adults will never be rid of.There is no doubt those horrifying memories will grow. The pain and suffering will remain alive.To everyone who prays, please support them with your prayers. Ask God to comfort and strengthen them as they endure this trial. Only He can provide the needed help. We know that because Jesus loved children.Both a rifle and a handgun are blamed, but a gun is an inanimate object. It is a weapon only when it is used in the hands of someone bent on killing. The gun is not responsible; sadly, it was a human.The desire to kill and destroy came from Satan, who from the beginning has wanted to take over God’s world. Banning guns will not help the situation; the choice for a change of heart will. God offers new life to all who come to Him.The Texas lieutenant governor asked for prayer. Millions of people may ask the same question asked of this man, “What good is prayer?” The governor gave a positive response for his personal faith in Christ. I stand where he stands. “Righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people.”The enormous number of problems our beloved country is facing should make us realize something is not right. We have been given so much, but the discontent continues to grow. We have had a spiritual heritage, but the laws are being downplayed, irrelevant or no longer important in today ‘s world.I remembered Solomon’s prayer when he dedicated the temple (I Kings 8 . It was not a 30-second approach to God. Solomon “stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly and spread out his hands toward Heaven.” He began with acknowledging the greatness of God: “Oh, Lord … there is no God like Thee on earth or in heaven above who keeps His promises and shows lovingkindness to His people.”This is a king standing before the King of Kings. He asks for God’s blessing, but he also asks for judgment on the people. He asks God to ” hear from Heaven” when they sin, to ask God’s forgiveness and seek His ways.There is so much more to Solomon’s prayer, all a reminder of our need in America and in our world.Without God’s guidance and help we humans are not capable of solving our problems. Why? There is an evil power working to control us. God has given His laws and they need to be obeyed. Let’s seek Him for ourselves and for the sake of this younger generation.Myrle V.

suffolknewsherald_2022_284,"Published 6:37 pm Tuesday, August 30, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Charles QuallsAnytime a pastor moves, and starts up somewhere new, we tend to talk about where we’ve just been. It doesn’t take a Jungian therapist to figure out why. So, I’ve mentioned some of this before at least in my church. For those of you a little newer, let me bring you up to speed. The rest of you, please just tolerate me for a minute.One day in our Atlanta church, the new head coach for Georgia Tech football began visiting along with his family of course. Soon they walked down the aisle and planted their lives in our membership.For some unknown reason, owing maybe to the fact that his wife’s cousin had been in our Sunday School class in the church back in our North Carolina days, Susan chose Elizabeth and me as her new buddies.One day, she invited us to come with her to a football game. We were over-the-moon thrilled, of course. We had never sat in a box before at a major sporting event. Much less with the coach’s wife.After a second game, she said, “Y’all are going to be with me for the long haul, aren’t you?” So, for nine seasons until we moved here, it was our privilege to be her guests for every game.Right after “Tell me about the luxury suite at the games each Saturday,” the most frequent question I used to get about our friend Paul was “What’s he really like?” That’s because he’s a no-nonsense sort of guy. He was a tough, old-school coach. He does have a prickly personality at times. And he knows.The Atlanta media of course did what the media does. They ran with that. To anyone who didn’t know him, he was portrayed in a convincing way as basically the second-coming of Darth Vader.So, my answer was always surprising when I told them, “Well, we’re not going to probably run him for Deacon chair anytime soon. But, you’d be surprised.” Then, I would always add, “The stuff that actually counts, he usually gets pretty right. He just lacks the style-points along the way.”Hebrews 13: 1-8, 15-16 tells us to be known by our love. It doesn’t use those words specifically, but it very obviously makes that point among others. I guess my whole reason for mentioning my friend, the coach, is that if you only watched him in a shallow way, you could miss it.But if you watched him openly, with some emotional intelligence, you would notice that in reality he was quite capable of loving his players, coaches, family and friends. Hebrews 13, as well as Jesus himself often, both talk about getting the stuff that matters right most of the time. Even if you or I don’t always get the style points.If you think that the biblical understanding of love is all bunnies, kittens and puppies – with some small children sitting on Jesus’ lap thrown in for good measure – then let me pry the door open a little wider.Our incomplete understanding of what love means keeps us from getting as much out of this as we could.Yes, of course it does matter whether we are pleasant and healthy to be around. It does matter that we try to be as gentle and as conventionally loving with each other as we can be. It does matter that we do not damage each other relationally or emotionally. Being nice is always more attractive than not being nice.But sometimes the New Testament concept of the “love” that we should be known by can’t be confined to simply the gentlest and most pleasant understandings. When push comes to shove, and doesn’t life sometimes shove, this is not really just an emotion we’re talking about here in Hebrews 13.So what are we going to do with this in a contentious world where we don’t even like everyone? Sometimes, love is about making gritty choices and getting things right when it matters most.Biblical love will mean being people of strong grounding in Jesus who shapes and guides our ethics. It will cause us to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit so that we do the right things, and invest in things that matter.Love also means that we sometimes stay away from, or out of, things that aren’t reflective of Christ. Love can even mean doing something we don’t want to do. Love will sometimes mean doing things that are hard or costly. Occasionally, maybe even without a smile on our face.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_142,"Published 7:26 pm Tuesday, March 15, 2022ByStaff ReportsIn this, another annual observance of Sunshine Week, we’re reminded of the words of Bill Moyers — that “secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of.”Vladimir Putin regularly lives that dream in Russia, where journalists and, for that matter, anyone who questions the dictator’s authority are routinely snuffed out. Here at home, a country built on citizens’ right to know the affairs of their governments, secrecy is protected not by violence but by consistent, mostly subtle efforts to weaken open records and open meetings laws, or by simple disregard for the laws as written, knowing the consequences are minimal.Sunshine Week is a national initiative begun in 2005 by the former American Society of News Editors, now the News Leaders Association, to coincide with the birth week of the philosophical Founding Father of sunshine laws, James Madison, who famously declared: “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance. And a people who mean to be their own Governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.”It’s important to note that sunshine laws are not merely a tool for journalists. They are available to any citizen who wishes to know more about local, state and federal governments.At their core, sunshine laws exist for the public’s benefit, the right of the citizenry to be informed transcends any public agency embarrassment or loss of “efficiency.”As one state legislature put it in the preamble of its open government law, “The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for them to know; the people insist on remaining informed so they may retain control over the instruments they have created.”Sunshine laws secure the public trust and therefore must remain robust. When the public trust is broken, these laws are the best hope for holding public servants accountable.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

leoweekly_2022_4,"As we headinto the final weeks of the general election cycle, it is so important to ask ourselves: Are we really ready to move Louisville and Jefferson County forward? Many people I talk to are not happy with the nine choices they have on their ballot as candidates to be the next mayor of Louisville Metro.Every day, I have to tell my family and loved ones that it would be impossible to win a county-wide write-in because of how it is set up, restrictions and the amount of work and resources it would take to cover so much ground in so little time. Team Shameka continues to be amazing and knows that NOT voting is not an option or good strategy. There’s too much on the line and it is a danger to our health to not participate in democracy.We’ve seen too many heart-wrenching deaths in our jail recently. As other cities have experienced, building a new jail does not deal with the internal toxic work culture or stop people from dying while in custody. Our next mayor must be willing to improve the jail conditions for those incarcerated and the staff. The new administration has to be fully invested into listening, taking action and the evaluation of the proposed reforms. The next mayor cannot play the blame game or just say every city is dealing with this issue; he or she must also encourage judges and prosecutors to de-carcerate and get those jail numbers reduced to under a half of what they are today.We’ve watched as our homeless population has continued to grow. The next mayor has to give ongoing support to projects and initiatives that eradicate, prevent and reduce our housing crisis.Our city is splintered and we’re all too aware of the deep divisions, trauma and pain that exists with too many Louisvillians.It’s time for a change. It’s time to elect a mayor who is focused on the pressing issues with our public transportation, lack of climate change actions, youth engagement in decision making, growing homeless population, public safety resources that deal with the root causes of racism and poverty and, most of all, the disappointment across Jefferson County from the failures of the merger 20 years ago.It is past time for a change, and directly impacted leadership is the way to go. The time is now. It seems mayorships were set up for very rich white businessmen to continue to develop and keep the rich richer, especially those who put them in office. Louisville is still a mayor-strong city with the potential to set a precedent across our beautiful state that cultivates growth, diversity, quality of life, faith and innovation. We need a people’s mayor who actually cares.We need a mayor who understands the issues facing our city and county, and who has fresh ideas about how to solve them. We need a leader who isn’t afraid to take risks and who will work tirelessly to make Louisville and Jefferson County a better place for all of us. Nepotism, elitism, classism and gutting programs and services have not made us a more compassionate Louisville. We need better appointments to offices and boards that are actually skilled, diverse and/or immersed in the fields they seek. Our wages don’t match the real estate. Failed policies and empty promises have created more working poor, house poor and the working homeless. The lack of services continues to lead the race to the bottom. Those tasked with Louisville Metro and other service-based positions to help us survive and thrive are not making the best wages to care for their own homes, needs and families without public assistance.Let’s elect a mayor who will lead us forward in the right direction that benefits all of us, not just a few of us. We deserve better and we get there together.Vote for real change on Nov. 8. Please remember: Staying home is not an option. •Shameka Parrish-Wright finished second in Louisville’s Democratic Party mayoral primary this year.

suffolknewsherald_2022_22,"Published 7:18 pm Friday, July 29, 2022ByStaff ReportsOpponents have raised enough valid questions about the proposed Port 460 warehousing and logistics that the Suffolk City Council would be wise to hit the pause button.We’re not ready to call for rejection of the massive 4.7-million-square-foot project, but the city has a lot more due diligence — and listening — to do before we can give it our full-throated endorsement.When City Councilman Tim Johnson, who’s not been known for hyperbole or overreaction during his distinguished tenure on the council, said in a public meeting that the push to rezone the proposed site off Route 460 has lacked transparency, it got our attention. Throw in a less-than-unanimous endorsement from the city’s Planning Commission and we’re convinced that the council would do the community a disservice by hastily approving the project next month.The developer’s request is to rezone 540 acres bordering 460, Route 58, Pitchkettle Road, Murphy’s Mill Road and Kings Fork Road from general commercial and agricultural to heavy manufacturing.Plans call for 10 warehouse buildings and 24,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space fronting 460, also known as Pruden Boulevard. The site would be accessed by a main entrance at Pruden Boulevard and another on Pitchkettle Road.Despite promises of 2,600 construction jobs, about 9,000 jobs once the project is built out, and up to $34.1 million in property tax revenue for the city, the project got the shakiest of endorsements from the Planning Commission after a recent two-hour public hearing. An initial motion to rezone the land died for lack of a second. Then a motion to deny the rezoning failed on a 5-3 vote. Finally, a second motion for approval passed 5-3.Many in the overflow crowd were miffed that they weren’t given an opportunity to speak. The City Council’s first promise before voting on the rezoning should be to let every citizen speak who wants to be heard. While reasonable to impose a time limit on each speaker, there should be no limit on the number of speakers. If that means council members bringing their sleeping bags to their Aug. 17 meeting, where a public hearing is planned, so be it. Better yet, the council should hold the hearing at a special meeting on a different date in order to ensure that every voice is heard. This is what you sign up for when you run for public office: listening to the citizens, giving careful thought to controversial matters, then voting your conscience. That process should never be rushed.It’s important to note that the current council and City Hall administration have a solid track record on economic development. News on Friday that Fitch, one of America’s “Big Three” credit rating agencies, gave the city a maximum AAA rating on its 2022 general obligation bonds, in large part because of steadily growing revenue, was a reminder that Suffolk has pressed a lot of the right buttons economically. We tip our hats to those responsible.That said, concerned citizens have raised legitimate questions about whether the warehousing and logistics sector, which has driven explosive commercial growth on the Route 58 corridor, is nearing the point of a negative return on investment. Perpetually clogged roads — which many transplants moved to Suffolk to get away from — will surely backfire, chasing residents further west to Franklin and Southampton or north to Isle of Wight. Getting around by car in Suffolk is no longer a pleasant experience. Some days, it feels a lot like Chesapeake and Virginia Beach.Long before taking a vote on the project, the City Council should insist that staff make public and widely disseminate a detailed traffic study on the Port 460 project. If the one previously commissioned by the developer is deemed insufficient, a thorough study by an objective third-party consultant should be approved immediately.In short, city officials haven’t earned the citizenry’s confidence on this project. They still have a chance to do so, but it won’t happen with a rushed vote on Aug. 17.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_2,"I m a New Yorker, but I love the Eagles because of Donovan McNabb and, now, Hurts. I like to think of my race-based bias as a form of protest.To some, I am a traitor.I am a New Yorker who has always been a secret Philadelphia Eagles fan — so much so, I drove to Washington, D.C., last month to watchJalen Hurts face Carson Wentzand the Washington Commanders.In hindsight, it was a sports pilgrimage.I purchased the tickets on an impulse, after convincing my partner thatthe spontaneous jaunt to D.C. would be an exciting adventure. When we arrived at FedEx Field on Sunday, Sept. 25, 20 minutes before kickoff, stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic, I leaped out of the car, leaving her to park, and sprinted to the entrance as helicopters flew over the stadium and fireworks burst. I was desperate to witness the 24-year-old Houston native do his thing.And there is a lot he can do. Jalen Hurts has the arm talent to sling dimes downfield, the legs to “get freaky” — as he likes to say — “in the open field,” and the strength topound his way into the end zone likea fullback.When I finally found my seat in the nosebleeds, I couldn’t help but open my mouth. “I drove all the way down from New York to watch Jalen Hurts give Carson Wentz the business in enemy territory,” I said to the Commanders fan in the row in front of me.“Why don’t you go and root for the Giants?” he asked.I told him I was a Hurts — and before him, a McNabb — fan. He understood.It’s the quarterbacks that keep me coming back to the Eagles. Particularly, Donovan McNabb and now Jalen Hurts: great players, who played (and still play with verve and heart. They ran and dove toward the pylon; they zinged the football in tight windows across the field.But a key factor of my support was their race. McNabb and Hurts are Black like me.» READ MORE:Embracing the legacySometimes I feel conflicted accepting this truth. I worry that by allowing race to determine my rooting interest, I endorse race-based bias,something that has killed Black men in this country for centuries. I often wonder how my late grandfather — acivil rights attorney who worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Florida— would respond to my feelings toward McNabb and Hurts. Would he understand?Furthermore, what is it about the quarterback position that causes so much of a stir? Would I root for a basketball player with the same enthusiasm I have for Hurts? No. I simply would not. And I loved Kobe Bryant. I wept when I heard he passed. But my feelings for Hurts are more encompassing.The quarterback is arguably the most respected position in American team sports. Being a good QB requires excellent physical and mental skills. Not only are they asked to move the ball downfield with their arms and legs, quarterbacks also have to diagnose defenses, make calls on the fly, and lead men.The NFL is 57% African American, buta much smaller percentage of the starting quarterbacks this season have been Black.Conversely, 25% of NFL players are white, yet they make up the vast majority of starting quarterbacks.The statistics prove what I could never articulate as a child: My race-based bias for McNabb, and now Hurts, is a form of protest.That Sunday in D.C., each pass Hurts completed filled me with a sense of pride.That Sunday in D.C., each pass Hurts completed filled me with a sense of pride. I pounded my chest and talked that talk to the Commanders fan in the row in front of me as the young signal-caller put 24 points on the board and scored three touchdowns, just in the first half. In the penultimate year of his rookie deal, Hurts is playing to become the next face of the Eagles franchise, and be whatMcNabb was for meto the next generation of children growing up in the Northeast.On the drive back to New York, I recalled one of my first visits to D.C. My mom and I drove down in January 2009 to witness history. We triple-layered our socks and gloves, and I still felt like my toes and fingers could have fallen off. And the truth is, I didn’t even want to go. I was afraid that then-President-elect Barack Obama would be shot. I begged Mom to stay home. At 14, I doubted whether this country could handle a Black president. But I’m glad I went. That day still reminds me of what this country can be.It feels clear to me now.By rooting for Hurts, I cheer for a fairer, more equal society, where the right to play any position is determined by somebody’s skill set, not by their race.Bernard Mokam is a visiting scholar at the Arthur L. Carter Institute of Journalism at New York University."
minnpost_2022_29,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I moved to Minnesota knowing the state had a long record of police killings of Black men. Daunte Wright. George Floyd. Philando Castile. And so many more. Therefore, Amir Locke’s killing should not have come as a surprise. Yet it did.I know that excessive force and racial bias are embedded throughout the justice system. After all, 56 Black men and 37 Native, Hispanic, and Asian Americans havedied at the hands of Minnesotan police officerssince 2000 — and this does not include the 119 white men and women. My surprise is due to the ineptitude to learn and change as a result of the previous deaths, and the inability to respond to desperate and pragmatic pleas for practices and procedures that prevent loss of life. Even though we have long known about the dangers of no-knock warrants, a SWAT team officer shot and killed a young man trying to catch a bit of sleep in the early morning hours just nine seconds after encountering him.It is a volatile time in my new home state. It mirrors the temperamental nature of our country. We are all still reeling from the racial reckoning that shook our entire country in the summer of2020. We can no longer hide from the truth because the ways of the world are different. The global pandemic changed the pace of our life, forcing us to pay attention to atrocities like George Floyd’s murder with more deliberation. Handheld and body cameras graphically document the raw and real moments of excessive force and killings. These two factors impel us to personalize the realities of racism,just as televised feeds of the civil rights movement brought seething dogs, swinging billy clubs, and high-pressure water hoses into our living rooms — up-close and undeniable.Those who have studied history know that after a period of racial embarrassment like George Floyd’s death, a patch of obligatory quiescence and public denouncements occurs. It is when many Americans quiet while their fellow citizens who are Black, Indigenous, people of color or white allies mourn. Then comes slight progress, quickly followed by blowback. People get tired of being somber and begin to defame the victim by digging up personal flaws that distract us from the systemic causes of the event. They bore of their guilt from complicit complacency because it is burdensome, uncomfortable, and exacting. Changes are proposed, yet action is limited. Talk is plentiful, yet commitments wane as people fatigue from the personal work required to enact durable transformation.And Amir Locke’s senseless death, a heartbreaking error, reminds us again that the problem of police killings of innocent lives still exists — incensed and bubbling — and the efforts to address it have so far proven futile. We have a choice — we can follow the same patterns that aren’t working for us, or we can make radical change. We cannot tire. Our work must start with purposeful commitments to a just society that will take decades to accomplish while simultaneously undoing decades of the racialized policies embedded in the threads of America’s fabric.I moved here from Detroit to become president of the McKnight Foundation because I felt a calling to join the movement for social justice and inclusive economics from the place at the epicenter of our nation’s pain. The emotions coursing in the Twin Cities remind me of my hometown of Detroit immediately after the Great Recession. We thought it could not get worse, yet it did. Detroit had to break before it could experience a renaissance and begin to recover.Even amid pain and uncertainty, our community must lift out of the abyss and focus on designing the future, because we cannot afford to wait to co-create the society we all deserve. This future must go beyond the narrow question of whether a Black man can sleep on a friend’s couch without fear of being killed. This future must make available safe, affordable housing and jobs with living wages in healthy conditions, relish the democratic participation of everyone, and ensure all can enjoy the benefits of a thriving and sustainable economy and realize their aspirations.The nation’s eyes are on Minnesota — eyes brimming with incredulity, hurt, and uncertainty. This is a time when CEOs, civic leaders and residents can unify their voices and efforts to demand, architect, and marshal this more equitable future. If we do the hard, uncomfortable work now, then hopefully, all eyes will be on Minnesota as we imagine, change, enact and lead the country toward justice; eyes shining with wonder, possibility, and American promise.Tonya Allen is the president of the McKnight Foundation and serves asco-chair for the Executives’ Alliance for Boys and Men of Color."
suffolknewsherald_2022_292,"Published 8:16 pm Friday, August 19, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSuffolk’s City Council acted wisely Wednesday to delay a decision on the Port 460 warehouse project.There’s nowhere close to enough consensus among elected officials or especially citizen support to plow forward with a project that will irrevocably alter life as we know it for a big chunk of the city. It was telling to us that, during a really long public hearing, the only Suffolk people to speak in favor of the project were a hired attorney and the landowner.With due respect to the project’s Maryland developers and the Port of Virginia, which loves Suffolk for its geography, highways and vast open space for future warehouses, this is an issue that needs to be hashed out within the family, so to speak. There’s a time to be a team player for Hampton Roads, and there’s a time to look out for your own interests. In this case, Suffolk must take care of itself.Thirty days is likely insufficient, but we see the following as essential should elected leadership still have interest in pursuing the project:We keep an open mind as the extended process unfolds. We’d also like to hear more from Suffolk business and civic leaders — unelected and with no connection to the project — about why it’s a good thing, on balance, for the community. Their silence has been deafening.We’d also like to hear more from the three council members who said nothing Wednesday night when the collective eyes of Suffolk were watching. We can only conclude that a motion to approve or deny the project would have failed, further proof that city leaders are far from the consensus needed to make a decision in Suffolk’s best interest.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_154,"Published 12:46 pm Wednesday, March 2, 2022ByStaff ReportsI grew up in Suffolk.In the summer of 1970 our church and other like-minded churches in Nansemond County built a Christian — according to their definition — high school. In spite of the not-so-subtle pressure from their fellow church members, my parents decided to let me continue going to public school because it saved them from paying a hefty private school tuition.My girlfriend went to the all-white private school and I went to the previously all Black public school. I could go to her school functions, but her parents forbade her to go to mine. That budding romance ended within the first semester of integration. Poof! Just like that.Integration and the subsequent redistricting — aka gerrymandering — by local politicians meant that I had to go to a school where I represented a 12% minority. The first time a Black student came to my home, my Dad met him with a pistol in hand. I managed to position myself so that my friend could make a quick getaway.Word of that sort of drama gets around fast in high school. No other students, white or Black, ever came to visit me after that. I lost any chance of a social life after that. Poof! Just like that.Calvin, a fellow 10th grader, later showed me a book he wanted me to see. After he had flipped through a few pictures I said in a shocked voice, “I didn’t have anything to do with any of this” and backed away. What terrified me most about Calvin’s book was all the White people grinning at the camera, evidently confident that any photos of them at the scene of an ongoing first-degree murder — a lynching — would never be used against them in a court of law.I learned later that of the 4,467 documented lynchings in the U.S. between 1883 and 1941 about three-fourths of the victims were Black. That’s when I realized that I had been taught a carefully redacted version of U.S. history. The people responsible for my education had purposefully chopped out the uncomfortable — for them — parts. Poof! Just like that.More than 50 years later, while watching the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and seeing that hangman’s scaffold and noose in front of our nation’s Capitol building, I vividly remembered Calvin’s book. It occurred to me that if that mob had found their targets, then we would have seen something similar to the photos of Calvin’s book on the news that night, except this time our nation’s Capitol would be in the background and some of our duly elected officials would be hanging above a grinning lynch mob. And faith in a free and fair election would have been further eroded. Poof! Just like that.The J6 riot also reminded me of the time I was deployed to the former Republic of Yugoslavia in 1995. Over 7,000 Muslims were slaughtered by Serbs in Srebrenica during my deployment. It unnerved me how ironic my title was at the time: peacekeeper?Peace was impossible to keep given that the Serbian leader continued to foment his all-too-eager followers to annihilate their perceived enemies. Eventually he was brought to justice but it took several years to hold him accountable for his advocacy of “ethnic cleansing” — a clinically sounding, cold-blooded phrase for mass murder. He intentionally destroyed his country, which ultimately resulted in his own demise. Poof! Just like that!One of the reasons the oath required to join the U.S. military is to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic” is that the founders of the Constitution feared that given an opportunity, an elected leader could dismantle the democratic process and the institutions that support it and make themselves king. Kings demand absolute obedience. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the individual would then be lost under an authoritarian rule. Poof! Just like that!Calvin’s book graphically illustrates what happens when the Constitution is blatantly violated. For instance, the 14th Amendment states, “… nor deny to any persons … the equal protection of the laws.” Lynch mobs clearly violate this amendment as well as many other federal and state laws. Without adherence to law and order, we will lose our democracy. Poof! Just like that!Looking back over the decades, the best educational moment that ever happened to me was when Calvin showed me his book and then left me alone to draw my own conclusions. I bought a copy of Calvin’s book and gave it to my daughter. As a university professor, she uses it in her lectures.If we don’t teach our children about our history and how the Constitution is our nation’s guiding principle, then we will lose our democracy.

suffolknewsherald_2022_7,"Published 7:32 pm Friday, August 12, 2022ByLetters to the EditorTo the Editor:The Port 460 Logistics Center developer has presented a rosy picture, less traffic than what it could be, 9,000-plus jobs, and increased tax revenues. Increased traffic is coming either way because the port of Norfolk is expanding.I have looked at these claims and found them to be biased at the very least.The claim of less traffic than what could be, is based on a worst-case scenario for the B2 zoned commercial portion of the property. Commercial development in the B2 portion could generate 58,000 vehicle trips a day as opposed to the projected 22,000 for the proposed development.What is not mentioned is the worst case scenario for the proposed M2 zoning could be 110,000 vehicle trips a day. The developer would have us believe that the majority of these vehicles will be passenger vehicles. It seems improbable that a warehouse complex built to support the trucks coming into and out of the Port of Norfolk will not have a significant portion of truck traffic.According to government and industry sites the developer’s estimate of 9,000-plus jobs is three times the average for warehouse facilities. The number of jobs is more likely to be 3,000 and possibly even less depending on how much automation is included in the warehouses.The project’s financial impact analysis projects total tax revenues after 15 years will be $29 million, and $3 million annually after that. The developer estimates the cost of improvements to existing roads to support the complex to be $100 million. Combining the proffered $5.5 million for road improvements with the projected revenues, the net total cost after 15 years will be a $65.5 million deficit.Many will not be aware that a warehouse complex is already being built just north of the airport on land zoned for warehouses. There is about 500 acres of unused land just west of the dump with direct access to U.S. 58 that is zoned for warehouses. There is unused land behind the CenterPoint warehouses zoned for warehouses. How many warehouses does Suffolk need?The developer wants Suffolk to rezone the city’s last commercially zoned parcels to heavy industrial, putting the city $65.5 million in debt and ending the possibility of any future commercial development near the city center.

suffolknewsherald_2022_103,"Published 7:28 pm Tuesday, April 26, 2022ByStaff ReportsOne of the most underutilized tools in our democratic republic are the public hearings that most states, including Virginia, require when local governments are deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars.While the turnout wasn’t overwhelming, we were pleased to see some passionate citizens show up for last week’s Suffolk City Council hearing on a proposed city budget for the fiscal year starting July 1.City Manager Al Moor and staff have put together a commendable spending blueprint that presses a lot of right buttons. The $767.6 million budget would cut the real estate tax rate by two cents and reduce the assessment ratio for cars and trucks — both sorely needed provisions in a time when inflated home and vehicle values would sting property owners on their tax bills. Importantly, the budget would fully fund public schools.City Council has the final say on the budget, and a few of the speakers at last week’s hearing made points that the mayor and council members should consider.Jim Grandfield, a lawyer who leads the city’s Public Defender Office, made a compelling case for city funding to supplement state dollars, which are insufficient, he said, to recruit and retain competent counsel.“All we’re asking is that we be supplemented with city money,” Grandfield said, “much like you’ve been doing and have done for many years for the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office. Why? The pithy answer is basic fairness.“As a practical matter, you may be sitting here saying, ‘Why, Mr. Public Defender, should we give money to the office’ that, let’s face it, many people define as, ‘you represent criminals.’ Because in this day and age, what we need is a fair, robust and vigorous criminal defense system. We need good prosecutors and we need good public defenders, and candidly, I can’t keep them and I can’t recruit them.”Speaking of compelling pitches, Bob Hayes made a persuasive case for the Western Tidewater Free Clinic.Hayes, who is chairman of the clinic’s board, noted rising demand for its services and asked council members to reconsider the draft budget’s call for level funding. A 16% increase, from $185,800 to $214,650, would help cover a 21% increase in the annual cost of patient care. An expansion of dental and mental health services is planned to meet rising demand in both service areas.Even though we’re pleased with the draft budget’s plan for fully funded schools, we don’t begrudge the citizens who showed up last week to demand accountability by school administrators.Such voices are healthy and needed if city government, including its schools, is to be accountable to the citizens it serves.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_87,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On May 26, I watched the livestreamed Minneapolis City Council meeting, hoping to see the council vote in solidarity with the 75 city staff who put their careers and financial stability on the line to sign on to a letter about the toxic and abusive work environment at the city coordinator’s office.My heart sank as city staff filed out after the City Council decided to delay the vote on Heather Johnston’s appointment to city coordinator. As someone with a background in working with survivors of abuse, I was familiar with the looks on their faces.In over two hours of powerful testimony just two days before, these folks had shared examples of the ways their workplace was toxic and racist. Though they had been told that Interim Director Johnston (who is under investigation by the city’s human resources department would not take steps to punish them, they still must continue to show up in that same harmful environment to do the jobs they care about.These are folks trying to make change from the inside. They don’t get accolades from other city leaders. They create programs that make our city safer and rarely get credit — because that’s not why they show up. They do it because they care about our city.While watching the earlier testimony, I recognized Brian K. Smith, director of performance and innovation, who spoke at our Ward 11 Public Safety Meeting earlier this spring. Smith was willing to come out after office hours and share about the work he and his staff are rolling out. I asked some tough questions and he took them with grace. It must have been harder for him to stand before City Council last month and be told to cut his comments shorter after sharing how difficult his job had become due to the culture in the city coordinator’s office. At one point he stated that he might not even have a job the next day.That’s who pays the price for delays. That’s who burns out. That’s who deserves not only our sympathy, but our solidarity.As painful as it was to see city staff file out after the vote to delay on May 26, the most upsetting thing may have been Mayor Frey’s attempt to re-center this conversation on himself by claiming that he would not get to be the best mayor he could be when council members did not follow his decisions. No one is getting in Frey’s way but Frey. The mayor chose — on his own — to claim those staff who made themselves vulnerable in the city coordinator’s office had made no clear documented incidents of harm from Heather Johnston. However, as Council Member Aisha Chughtai pointed out, there were incidents documented in their letter, as well as shared in the two hours of testimony at the hearing on May 24, during which the mayor sat on the dais.Frey must have heard as staff recounted how they shook and cried on the floor of their offices because of the impossibility they felt of trying to get heard by those in positions of power. Frey showed that exact behavior by refocusing from their concerns to his mayoral power and attempting to minimize their testimony. What he did was diminishing, dehumanizing and harmful.This moment calls for leaders who listen to and act with those who are truly in the trenches. It is not about elected officials; it is not about appointees. It is about those who show up and do difficult, often uncredited work because they love our city and they want people to be in workplaces and city spaces free from the harms they face daily.My current council member, Emily Koski has shared repeatedly that she values and supports city staff and their commitment to change. Her votes during her tenure as a council member tell a different story. While sympathy sounds nice, it does not make change. I hope Koski chooses to use the real tools at her disposal — votes and relationships with others in power — to show her solidarity with city staff and alignment with the values she professes to hold.Rebecca Donley is a Ward 11 resident with over 15 years of experience supporting survivors of abuse and providing training about the dynamics of abuse."
eugeneweekly_2022_39,"We ve got issues. Every day, all over our county, we have friends, neighbors or even family members that may be facing a mental health crisis. Time and again we see folks turning to our emergency rooms, law enforcement, substance abuse and, tragically, suicide to manage their suffering. However, there are better solutions that would not only relieve our emergency services but also care for those experiencing crisis in a more dignified and holistic way. Lane County is working on one of those solutions right now — a crisis stabilization center. Lane County’s stabilization center model will provide a place for both youth and adults who need mental health, substance addiction or developmental disabilities support and stabilization. It will be a 24/7 walk-in service for anyone in need. Services will incorporate a trauma-informed and harm-reduction focus, and a people-centered approach that allow guests a universal entrance to community services and government programs — coined the “no wrong door” approach. We are planning for a center that will accommodate 14 guests for 23-hour respite care. There will also be 12 beds for youth and 16 beds for adults that can serve clients for up to 30 days. Law enforcement will have a separate entrance for those that are able to be diverted from arrest. The center will assist up to 42 people at a time, with a capacity to help up to 1,500 youth and 6,700 adults per year. Co-located in the center will be various social services, support for families, behavioral health and addictions treatment. The collective impact to the whole community will be substantial, a game changer, really, in the way we help our most vulnerable neighbors. Not only is this a more humane, less traumatic and holistic way to help people in need, it creates a more effective and rapid connection to core services. The approach will save an estimated $77 million annually from the emergency services system costs across all levels of care. It is a win-win model, propelling changes in care across the nation. It has been clear to many that mental health support is in great need both locally and around the country. We’ve seen folks who wouldn’t otherwise be in jail but for the lack of mental health care. We ache for parents whose children are sent out of the community for crisis care due the gap in services for youth. The pandemic has brought stress and strain for all of us and touches each person in different ways. Mental health care is for everyone and makes our whole community safer and stronger. Please join me in championing mental health care, reducing its stigma and supporting our community. ν Heather Buch, Lane County Commissioner, East Lane District 5"
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_48,"Upon taking office, every member of Congress must swear an oath to “support and defend” the United States Constitution. America is currently watching most congressional Republicans — including Missouri Sens. Roy Blunt and Josh Hawley and the state’s entire GOP House delegation — violate that oath in real time. What else can be said of supposed political leaders who sit silently while their party’s standard-bearer and presidential front-runner publicly calls for the “termination” of the Constitution for the sake of his own power?Ex-President Donald Trump’s contempt for the nation’s founding document has long been evident in his words and deeds, but he crossed a dangerous new line (even for him on Saturday.In a social media screed pressing his continuing lie that he was cheated out of reelection in 2020, he demanded that the Constitution be set aside so he could be restored to the presidency.“A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,” he posted Saturday on his Truth Social network.He later followed up with: “UNPRECEDENTED FRAUD REQUIRES UNPRECEDENTED CURE!”There was no significant election fraud, unprecedented or otherwise, but that’s beside the point. The Constitution is sacrosanct.Electoral disputes (both genuine issues and the bogus ones Trump keeps pushing must be settled within the structure of the Constitution, not by its “termination.” It would be shocking to have to explain that to the average eighth grader. Having to explain it to a former president — one who stands a realistic chance of being elected to that office again in two years — is terrifying.Not every unhinged Trump comment needs or deserves a reaction, but this one does. And yet elected members of Trump’s own party, whose condemnation would carry the most weight, have remained almost uniformly mute.The few who found themselves facing the question on the weekend talk shows generally mouthed some milquetoast rejection of Trump’s statements while carefully avoiding any condemnation of Trump himself for saying it.At least one, Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, said he would still “support whoever the Republican nominee is” for president in 2024, even if it’s Trump.If a major presidential candidate calling for eliminating the Constitution isn’t enough to merit a preemptive, party-wide rejection of his candidacy, what is?Most notable in this silent gallery of cowards is House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who needs to keep the Trumpers in his caucus happy to realize his dream of becoming the new House speaker in January.McCarthy has said that on the first day Republicans take over, they will read aloud “every single word” of the Constitution on the House floor.What a grotesque piece of theater that will be from a crowd that refuses to “support and defend” those words when it matters.— St. Louis Post-Dispatch"

But you’ll have to forgive us for being a little excited about plans for Suffolk Festival Park. That one’s personal.A surprise tornado that cut a path through downtown and Riverview in 2020 did a lot of damage, including to our longtime office on South Saratoga Street. Fortunately, it occurred late enough that all of our employees had gone home, but the storm tore through the front window, traveled vertically the length of the long rectangular building and blew out the back door.Enough of a shell was left to accommodate upscale apartments that will soon be complete. Just up the road, more progress is coming: a first-rate outdoor park and event venue at Saratoga and West Washington, stretching to the former Brandon House furniture store.We were pleased to see the project take an important step forward Thursday when the city’s Historic Landmarks Commission unanimously approved a certificate of appropriateness. All signs point to City Council approval of a conditional use permit, the final regulatory hurdle for a venue city officials project could draw more than 100,000 additional people downtown yearly.As reporter Jimmy LaRoue writes on today’s front page, that will be a big boost for downtown retailers, restaurants and service providers.The city has already set aside $150,000 for the park in the current fiscal year through its capital improvements program. That’s a big statement of intent to get it done, even though an additional $550,000 will be needed in the next two years.The hope is to have the park ready to host the 2023 TGIF summer concert series, one of Suffolk’s signature summer events. Festival Park could also be home to the Suffolk Farmers Market, which will benefit from more accessible, spacious digs.Throw in plans for a new library further west on Washington Street and that part of downtown is set for major revitalization in the years ahead.As a longtime occupant of the neighborhood, we couldn’t be happier.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2022_68,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021 was the deadliest year on record for drug overdoses in U.S. history. The agencyestimates that nearly 108,000 people died of overdoses in 2021, including more than 1,300Minnesotans. At the same time, according to the Minnesota Department of Health, therewere 14 nonfatal overdoses for every fatal overdose in 2020, and we’re anxiously awaiting2021 numbers.Government and community leaders are doing great work to stop drug trafficking, expandaccess to treatment, and make tools like Narcan and fentanyl testing strips more available. Butthere has been too little focus on one key factor: preventing drug misuse before it even starts.For many people, substance misuse starts small, perhaps by taking a family member’s leftoverprescription painkiller from the home medicine cabinet. It seems safe; it’s prescribed by adoctor. But all too often this opens the door to a much bigger problem: According to theNational Institute on Drug Abuse, 80% of heroin users first began with misusing prescriptionopioids.One easy prevention step is to decrease the risk of medication misuse in our own homes bysafely deactivating and disposing of leftover medications. Many of us have extra medicationbottles in the house, and more than 60% of people hold onto opioids indefinitely, greatlyincreasing the risks that a child, friend or relative could be harmed by the medication.At our Minnetonka company, Verde Environmental Technologies Inc., our mission is to combatthe opioid epidemic by getting safe at-home medication disposal tools into more people’shands. Every April and October since 2020, we partner with national nonprofit SAFE Project onthe Gone for Good® at-home medication disposal campaign to encourage people to clean outtheir medicine cabinets by giving out thousands of free Deterra® Drug Deactivation andDisposal Pouches, which allow users to easily destroy unused prescription and over-the-countermedications, including addictive opioids and fentanyl at home. Our plant-based pouches arealso safe for disposal in household trash and prevent harmful drugs from entering our waterand soil.As of May 2022, we have distributed more than 100,000 pouches to U.S. households — enoughto destroy over 9 million pills — through Gone for Good. But prevention can and should happenyear-round. I call on local, state and federal leaders, health care, first responders and everyoneon the frontlines of this epidemic to prioritize prevention.Increasing education on prescription drug misuse and proper disposal, particularly opioids, iskey. One great local example is the Minnesota Farm Bureau, the state’s largest agriculturalorganization.While nearly 75% of farmers and farm workers have been directly impacted by the opioidepidemic, only 1 in 3 rural adults have easy access to drug treatment. The Minnesota FarmBureau works hard to share resources and encourage open conversations about addiction,recovery and stigma at events across the state. It also distributes Deterra Pouches to ruralcommunities, where resources like drop-off boxes can be few and far between.Health care providers also play a pivotal role in prevention. While providers have significantlydecreased the number of opioids they prescribe — from a peak of 255 million in 2012 to 142million in 2020 — it’s essential that they talk to every patient about how to properly use anddispose of opioids when they are prescribed or dispensed.Twin Cities Orthopedics is providing a great model for health care organizations: Whenpatients are discharged from any of TCO’s surgery centers with a prescription, staff discussmedication disposal and give patients a Deterra Pouch to get rid of any leftover medications.Co-dispensing a disposal method at the time of prescription can be an incredibly powerful toolto encourage patients to get rid of leftover medications and decrease the risks of possiblemisuse.This funding is a huge boon to our state, and we look forward to seeing how local organizationsare able to use these dollars to expand education, treatment, prevention and recoverystrategies in Minnesota.The opioid epidemic is a complex problem that our state and country are faced with, buttogether, I believe we have the power to turn the tide. It’s our duty to do so.Jason Sundby is chairman and CEO of Verde Environmental Technologies, Inc., maker of theDeterra® Drug Deactivation and Disposal System, located in Minnetonka, Minn."

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_0,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The arrival of COVID-19 and the societal disruptions that accompanied it understandably drove a lot of Americans to drink. But even as life has returned to more or less normal this year, the drinking binge has continued. The consumer spending statistics compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis are the timeliest estimates of alcohol consumption available. They show November’s spending on alcoholic beverages, adjusted for inflation and seasonal spending patterns, to have been 3% higher than a year earlier and 15% higher than just before the pandemic. (1 Does that really mean Americans are drinking 15% more? Well, maybe. Consumers have been moving for years toward higher-quality, more expensive beer, wine and spirits, which implies that they may not have increased the quantity of their alcohol purchases by quite that much. On the other hand, restaurants’ and bars’ share of overall alcoholic beverage spending is still slightly lower than before the pandemic; given the big markups they charge on drinks, consumption could also be up by even more than spending. The annual consumption estimates published by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism are available only through 2020, and they show a 3% per-capita increase in alcohol consumption that year, even as real spending on alcoholic beverages declined 3% because so many bars and restaurants were closed.These statistics also show alcohol consumption in 2020 to have been the highest since 1990. Drinking declined sharply in the 1980s and 1990s, with hard liquor falling out of favor and beer consumption beginning a slower decline. The beer decline continues, but distilled spirits have made a big comeback.This comeback was in part a revival of cocktail culture and craft distilling, which is hard not to view in a somewhat positive light. There are four times as many distilleries in the U.S. as there were in 2001, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and almost four times as many people working at them. High-end drinks that people generally don’t drink in huge quantities have led the way — from 2016 to 2021, the volume of super-premium spirits sold in the U.S. rose 77% while that of value brands rose 23%, reports the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.But there is clear evidence that more people are drinking too much. Deaths from alcohol-induced causes rose from 39,043 in 2019 to 54,258 in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the population-adjusted death rate is now more than double what it was in the 2000s.The rise in drug-induced deaths has been much, much worse — going from 6.9 per 100,000 population in 1999, less than the alcohol-induced rate, to 33.8 in 2021. Provisional data also show an encouraging decline in alcohol-induced deaths in the first half of 2022, although that trend could change as final numbers become available. Even after the big increases of the past couple of years, U.S. alcohol consumption likely still lags that of many affluent countries, especially in Europe (the most up-to-date international numbers available are from 2019 . And yes, Americans drank lots more back in the 1970s — not to mention the 1830s, when estimated per-capita consumption was nearly three times what it was in 2020.Of all the things one can worry about, then, America’s current drinking binge maybe shouldn’t be at the very top of the list. But it deserves more attention than it has been getting. The alcohol-induced deaths statistics understate the true toll: The CDC estimates that the number of deaths from cancer, heart disease, homicide and other causes that are attributable to excessive alcohol use is several times higher than the official alcohol-induced number, and over-imbibing has plenty of costs short of death. One study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine estimated the cost of excessive drinking in 2010 at $249 billion in lost productivity, additional health care and other charges, an amount equating to $2.05 per drink or $807 per person. In 2019 a quarter of U.S. adults surveyed reported that they had engaged in binge drinking (four or more drinks within two hours for a woman and five or more for a man in the past month, a share that has surely risen since. This calls for a government-policy response, and there’s a pretty obvious one at hand. Not prohibition, but a reversal of the decades-long easing of alcohol taxation. Because federal excise taxes on alcohol are charged by the gallon, not as a percentage of price, and haven’t changed since 1991, they’ve fallen a lot in real terms. By modestly increasing alcohol excise taxes now and indexing them to inflation for the future, Congress could discourage over-consumption and reduce the federal deficit by an estimated $114.1 billion over the next decade."

I would like to address the current high crime rate of gun violence. For the month of January, the number of reports of armed robberies, carjackings and shootings are shocking. It is obvious that this matter has only worsened. We risk losing an entire generation to this violence. In the last few years, I have already lost friends and family due to gun violence.This violence is not only an epidemic going on all over the world, but it is happening right here in our city too. As residents of this city, we should not have to be in fear of going to the store, school, or even outside in general. Someone needs to take this matter more seriously. We need to produce preventable solutions to put an end to this violence. Weapons need to be safely secured and kept from children, criminals and unstable individuals.Place programs in schools and communities that help show us signs and signals before shootings happen. Also, we need more community involvement to support community-based violence reduction programs. Enable universal background checks including private sale and gun show sales. Most people who have used a gun for a crime have obtained firearms from off the street or in the underground market. Please contact our local police stations and legislators and demand reasonable and responsible change. Thank you.Jeanette ScottSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_43,"Published 11:46 pm Tuesday, July 5, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Donald McEachinGuest columnistJune was very busy in Washington as my House colleagues and I passed legislation that can truly improve lives.Last month, I helped pass the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act to reinforce the food and agriculture supply chain, assure fair competition in the meat and poultry industries, and lower food and fuel costs by providing support to farmers. The legislation will support our farmers by lowering costs for essentials such as fertilizer and providing new tools for nutrient management.Supply chain disruptions and stubborn inflationary pressures have created serious challenges for farmers and consumers, leading to higher costs in the field and the grocery store. The bipartisan Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act seeks to help address these issues by strengthening our supply chain, bolstering competition, and providing viable, cheaper biofuel alternatives for consumers.I also voted for the bipartisan Recovering America’s Wildlife Act last month to provide funding for the conservation, restoration and protection of wildlife and their habitats. I am excited to share that this includes over $22 million for Virginia to achieve those goals.Most wildlife management and conservation is carried out by state governments but the federal funding to support these programs has been inadequate and unreliable. This legislation will address those deficits. With the impacts of climate change, more species are going extinct and we are experiencing a biodiversity crisis.The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act will provide much needed funding to our commonwealth to protect wildlife and increase tourism, while addressing the adverse impacts of climate change. This bill will make a difference for our economy, for the earth and for future generations.Finally, I am excited to share more on the 15 Community Project Funding requests I submitted in June.Last year, we were fortunate enough to have every project we submitted receive funding and I am working to achieve that again this year. These projects range from enhancing community emergency communication systems, to training more health care workers and even supplementing broadband on a local HBCU campus.These projects were all submitted by the locality or the institution, so I am confident they are truly meeting local needs.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_87,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°In the debased discourse of American politics, it’s easy to characterize as “distinguished” the career of any long-serving public official. But the adjective is no exaggeration when applied to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who announced Thursday that she will not seek a leadership role in the Congress that convenes in January.Pelosi was not only a trailblazer as the first female speaker, she also demonstrated over a 35-year career in Congress exquisite political skills that she deployed to better the lives of her constituents in California and the American people in general.She has been a fearless leader, facing down critics even in her own party, not to mention the People’s Republic of China. She was unabashed in her disdain for former President Donald Trump — whose State of the Union address she memorably tore up in 2020 — a principled posture that earned her the enmity of the disgraced former president’s devotees.Cynics can argue that in withdrawing from House leadership Pelosi was making a virtue out of the fact that Democrats will be in the minority in the next Congress. Perhaps she would have sought to remain speaker if her party had maintained its majority, despite her assurances in 2018 that she would step down from leadership by the end of the current Congress.But the decision not to seek a leadership role might also have been easier in the light of the failure of a red wave to manifest in congressional elections as Republicans and many pundits had expected. Finally, she understandably wants to support her husband, who was brutally attacked in their San Francisco home by a domestic terrorist who had the speaker in his sights.Whatever the explanation, the decision of the 82-year-old Pelosi to withdraw from leadership marks the end of a momentous career as a leader of her party. It is equally significant that in her valedictory speech she called for transition to “a new generation to lead the Democratic Caucus.”Although Pelosi showed no signs of age-induced incapacitation, leading congressional Democrats — as well as President Joe Biden, who turns 80 on Nov. 20 — are much older than many of the party’s voters. It’s not ageist to welcome a generational shift in the leadership of either party.In her speech Thursday, Pelosi noted how the ranks of female Democrats in Congress had expanded during her career. The prominence of women in important positions — from Pelosi to Vice President Kamala Harris to incoming Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, another House member from California — represents profound progress toward equality. Pelosi both promoted and personified that progress.But in other ways Pelosi stood in the long tradition of public officials for whom the appellation “professional politician” is not a derogatory term. Pelosi came by that vocation partly as a matter of family legacy. In her speech, she recalled visiting Congress when her father, a future mayor of Baltimore, was sworn in as a member of the House.Whether or not a commitment to politics is a family affair, public servants such as Pelosi who use their mastery of the legislative process to improve the lot of their fellow citizens deserve praise and gratitude, not “populist” putdowns.— Los Angeles TimesHilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track. Contractor Nan Inc. began construction on the project in Dec. 2023, following a design and planning process that started in 2017.BOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

minnpost_2022_48,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I had my gym clothes and running shoes on and I was ready to get on the treadmill on Saturday, Jan. 15, when I saw the alert.Shabbat services at a Texas synagogue were interrupted by an armed person who had taken some worshippers hostage.We all have moments when we sensed that our reality shifted. JFK’s assassination when I was a junior in high school. The events of 9/11, when my daughter was on a ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with 750 other American college students, another potential target for terrorists. Jan. 6, 2021, when American democracy began to crumble. And that Saturday at the Texas synagogue.It certainly wasn’t the first, or the most, horrific act of antisemitism in the United States, but it paralyzed me because it seemed almost routine … a lone person terrorizing Jews in a place called a “sanctuary,” yet again.These acts are happening over and over again — just like the bigger picture of hate, which, writ large, is genocide.After the Holocaust, the world leaders’ mantra was “never again.” And then there was Cambodia. And Guatemala, Argentina, East Timor, Bosnia, Darfur, the Uyghurs, the Rohingya, the Tibetans. The list goes on and on.The list of anti-Semitic “incidents” in the U.S. goes on and on. Of all religiously motivated hate crimes in the U.S., 58 percent target Jews, despite Jews comprising only 1.9 percent of the U.S. population and just 0.2 percent of the population of the world.Scholars say that antisemitism is the world’s oldest and most-enduring form of hate. As an academic, I understand the forms of scapegoating that occur. As a Jew, those acts damage the essence of my soul.There are fine statements decrying this latest act of antisemitism coming from many organizations and individuals, including the United Nations General Assembly and President Biden. But these words do nothing. They don’t stop the hate and the scapegoating and the violence and the desire to lash out against this tiny minority as punishment for all the ills in the world.There are some well-intentioned actions. The U.S. may finally pass the 2021 “Pray Safe Act,” which will provide information on best practices and available federal grants for security at houses of worship. FEMA will probably increase funding for its Nonprofit Security Grant Program. The project’s current annual budget is $180 million, which increased several times in recent years due to the rise in antisemitism across the U.S. The program allows houses of worship to apply for grants of up to $100,000 each for security measures such as fences, cameras, stronger doors and security personnel.But stronger doors and higher fences don’t stop hate.On another front, a genocide is happening right now, at this very moment, on the other side of the world — the destruction of the Uyghurs in western China. Again, there are fine statements and intended good actions.Last month, the French parliament labeled the atrocities against the Uyghurs to be genocide, and the French parliamentarians applauded the Uyghur refugees who were in the room. The French have joined the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and the Netherlands with this pronouncement.The U.S. has issued economic sanctions and forbidden diplomats’ attendance at the February Beijing Olympics. It has threatened pressure on businesses like Abercrombie and Fitch, Adidas, Calvin Klein, Gap, H&M and Nike that use Uyghur slave labor in their supply chains.But the genocide continues — despite the pronouncements, applause and sanctions.And the antisemitism continues.Last month the New York City Police Department arrested a woman for harassing and spitting on an 8-year-old Jewish boy outside a Brooklyn synagogue.According to CNN, the woman approached three children outside the synagogue shouting “anti-Jewish statements” before spitting on the boy and walking away.The children’s father told reporters that the woman said “something along the lines of Hitler should have killed you all.”The 8-year-old boy replied to the woman that he would save his little sister. The woman then spit in his face and said, “We will kill you all. I know where you live, and we’ll make sure to get you all next time.”That little boy’s world must have shifted at that moment.Genocide and hate — “never again” means nothing when the hate endures.World Without Genocide will hold a webinar on Feb. 23, 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on “China: Politics, Human Rights, and Law.” Register by Feb. 22 athttp: www.worldwithoutgenocide.org/china. The event is open to the public at $10 general public, $5 students and seniors, free to Mitchell Hamline students and $25 for Minnesota lawyers for 2.0 Elimination of Bias credits.

suffolknewsherald_2022_123,"Published 7:09 pm Friday, April 1, 2022ByStaff ReportsThe name speaks for itself: Keep Suffolk Beautiful. And what a fine job this group of volunteers does in achieving its mission.Less than a month after a successful St. Patrick’s Day-themed cleanup event downtown, Keep Suffolk Beautiful is turning its attention to perhaps the community’s most important natural resource: the Nansemond River.The river cleanup, which will include adjacent land, is planned from 9 a.m. to noon next Saturday, focused on the downtown section of the river.We encourage new volunteers to show up and help out the faithful. At the last river cleanup in October, volunteers collected over 2,600 pounds of trash. While we’re saddened that there was so much to be collected, we’re grateful that at least one organization is devoted to correcting the damage done by those with no pride in their community.We agree with Keep Suffolk Beautiful board member Bill Farrell that “Suffolk is very fortunate to have a treasure like the Nansemond River.”“It offers many recreational and inspirational opportunities for us all,” Farrell said. “But, like any treasure, it must be respected and well taken care of. Participating in the Nansemond River Cleanup is a great way to show our treasure that we appreciate what it gives to us.”Volunteers are asked to meet a little before 9 at Constant’s Wharf to get their free litter-gathering equipment and bags.On March 19, some 60 volunteers gathered for the St. Patrick’s Day Cleanup downtown, collecting 56 bags of trash and four tires, totaling 1,600 pounds of litter. Here’s hoping the river cleanup attracts twice as many helping hands. They are sorely needed.Those who can’t help out next Saturday for one reason or another can do their part by being mindful of litter every day of the year. For example, Keep Suffolk Beautiful encourages businesses along Main Street to regularly clean their parking lots and empty their trash bins.

eugeneweekly_2022_19,"We ve got issues. Iknew it was coming, but when I saw the words “ROE VERSUS WADE OVERTURNED” splashed across my computer screen, I had no words – only tears. The Supreme Court’s decision inDobbshas triggered me in many ways — and I know I’m not alone. Many women and others throughout this country are in the throes of profound collective trauma and grief. My feelings after reading about the death ofRoewere a mixture of shock, outrage and profound grief. I came of age during the invigorating and hopeful days of the Women’s Liberation Movement. My generation worked hard to gain those rights. The Supreme Court’s decision inRoe v. Wadein 1973 validated the gains made by women and the pride we felt: We had a voice, autonomy and respect that was long denied. Now our voices, autonomy and respect are being dismissed, and the rights we fought so hard far are now being stripped away. I have worked hard through the years, as a therapist specializing in traumatic grief, in my own therapy and in my meditation practice, to let go of the myriad feelings of shame and trauma I’ve experienced as a woman. The court’s death knell to the federal recognition of a person with a uterus to have the right to make responsible choices about their body and life has brought those feelings back to the fore. It feels like we’re back to the days when it was believed that women’s voices and choices can’t be trusted, and shouldn’t even be heard. Justice Samuel Alito’s words justifying the removal of the Constitutional protections granted byRoereek of misogyny. TheDobbsdecision will lead many people like me to re-experience the shame and trauma we have felt in our personal or professional lives. A particular trigger for me is feeling invisible or left out. TheDobbsruling feels like a stab in the back, bringing back those feelings. I now remember like it was yesterday my days as an executive in the male-dominated music business, where I often felt invalidated and ignored. It is retraumatizing now to recall how I would make a point only for it to be ignored. And then one of my male colleagues would say the exact same thing and it was heard. So, my grief and outrage are now mingled with fear. The five hard-liners on the Supreme Court rely on the original intent of the Founders to justify their position. The Constitution doesn’t even mention the word “women.” I am experiencing trauma and fear as I think of whose rights will be stolen next. We are no longer the United States of America, but in a country fractured and divided seemingly beyond repair. I am grateful that I live in a progressive state that believes in and supports the right to choose. Nationally, rather than progressing and keeping up with the changing times, we have regressed all the way back to this country’s founding — with white men taking what was not theirs to take. The five hard-liners relied on the words and intentions of the white men who wrote the Constitution many centuries ago. Many of them were slaveholders, and all lived on lands stolen from their rightful owners. Using “original intent” as a justification to strip away a woman’s right to choose is egregious beyond words. As the dissenters poignantly wrote, “With sorrow — for this court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection — we dissent.” And so do I.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_68,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Let’s get right to the point: If and when Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Chuck Grassley ever again try to prop up their bona fides as supporters of U.S. troops and our allies abroad, they should be laughed out of the room.Last week, the two GOP senators defied a coalition including various lawmakers in their own party and hundreds of military veterans — from enlisted service members to high-ranking officers — by opposing the inclusion of the Afghan Adjustment Act in the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill that was just approved, dooming it to be left out.These scoundrels will try to weasel their way out of criticism by cynically invoking a supposed threat to national security, as if what they’ve done weren’t a threat ten thousand times greater. What that is is preventing tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees who’ve been paroled into the United States, largely during our botched withdrawal, from obtaining permanent status and keep them at risk of deportation.Included are Afghan service members who quite literally saved American troops’ lives, as well as all manner of support staff in both military and civilian roles large and small who kept the entire U.S. operation chugging along. Some of them may be eligible for Special Immigrant Visas, but many aren’t, and it’s not that only the Afghans directly involved in the war effort deserve protections. Plenty of the arrivals are regular families who saw the Taliban closing in and decided to seek a better future. Now, we are threatening to steal away that future and toss them to the wolves.Under the act, residency isn’t handed out willy-nilly; applicants would go through the same adjustment process that hundreds of thousands of people already use every year, and will be some of the most heavily vetted people on Earth. Turning our backs regardless sends a pretty clear international message that the U.S. will quickly forget even those who directly assisted us at great personal peril. How’s that for national security?The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

philinquirer_2022_27,"With few on-screen portrayals of African Americans, the death of actor Chadwick Boseman, who played the Black Panther, hit especially hard. A sequel helps fans find their way through the grief.Chadwick Bosemanwas a real-life superhero.He playedThurgood Marshall; he playedJackie Robinson; he playedJames Brown; he played theBlack Panther. Those who knew and loved the actor, whodied of colon cancer in 2020at age 43, would often say he was evenmore wonderfuloff-screen than on it. Consequently, for many, Boseman’s deathfelt like the end of the world. It left many wondering, what do you do when a Black superhero dies?Black Panther: Wakanda Forevergoes to great lengths to answer that question.Serendipitously, if not providentially, the film was always intended to revolve around grief. As the film’s director, Ryan Coogler, revealed duringan interview with Inverse, its original script centered on Boseman’s character, King T’Challa, still processing the loss — and return — of half the universe’s population in the two most recentAvengersfilms.Following Boseman’s untimely death, Coogler decided the film would confront the loss of Boseman’s character in ways that mirrored the loss of Boseman himself. Doing so would allow a grieving cast to honor his legacy without having toenlist another actor to replace him.This would not be the first time comic fans would have to reckon with the death of a beloved hero. Such notable characters asSuperman,Captain America, andWolverinehave all met their demise. Notwithstanding, the Black Panther’s death is different, particularly considering that he is the first mainstream superhero to hail from Africa.» READ MORE:5 ways ‘Wakanda Forever’ takes a new look at superheroesLosing Boseman carried a greater weight for many fans because of the dearth of representation of African Americans in film. As Jamil Smithwrote for Time, “relating to characters onscreen is necessary not merely for us to feel seen and understood, but also for others who need to see and understand us. When it doesn’t happen, we are all the poorer for it.”When asked to connect his portrayal of the virtually indestructible character Luke Cage to the social climate in the country in 2016, the actor Mike Colter told Ben Childs of the Guardian, “Every day I look in the paper — always someone getting gunned down, unarmed … It’s too close to home for me because it doesn’t seem as though it’s getting any better …”By then, names likeTrayvon Martin,Eric Garner,Rekia Boyd,Michael Brown Jr.,Sandra Bland, andTamir Ricehad become seared in our collective consciousness. Day by day, the nation relived the tragedy of their heinous deaths with each new headline. Each name forced the nation to confront not only those tragic deaths but also the idea that there werecountless othersyet to be memorialized in hashtags. Thus, in his 2016 review of the Netflix seriesLuke Cage, Childs describedPower Man— a bulletproof Black man — as the“superhero America needs now.”If much has changed since Boseman led us in rousing chants of “Wakanda Forever” following the 2018 release ofBlack Panther, even more has changed in the six years since Colter emerged as Luke Cage. If a bulletproof Black man was the hero America needed in 2016, in 2022, America needs a hero whose legacy reminds us that our sum is greater than its parts — that we can continue on in his absence. That life can go on, itmustgo on, in the midst of heartache.» READ MORE:With an Indigenous antihero, representation takes a step forward in ‘Wakanda Forever’ | OpinionWakanda Forevershowcases the futility of eschewing community and the rituals that sustain it.

Kim’s successful career as a mental health therapist exposed her to the plight of young children who have experienced traumatic experiences, and she wanted to do something to help them.I first became exposed to her vision when asked to do a soft blessing for their site. When I saw their facility, met their staff, saw how much they had invested in this and their passion for children, I was very excited.My experience working with first responders makes me very aware of how much violent incidents there are on our island on a daily basis. I have often wondered what happens to the 2-year-old that saw daddy kill mommy or was in a very bad car accident. Who helps them recover? Where are the resources to address this segment of our community?So, it has been with great disappointment that I have watched all the obstacles she has faced in getting this preschool open. We all know that there is a child care crisis that is having a huge negative impact on our community.I applaud Judge Peter Kubota, who ordered the state and Kim to together to get this worked out.I am by no means knowledgeable of all the requirements to get a preschool licensed, but I do hope that the powers that be will work hard at making them realistic and attainable that we can get more quality preschools like this one open and running to address this community need.Renee GodoyHiloBad for veteransVeterans in Hawaii and across the country experience numerous barriers to health care, and a new change being considered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs could leave them without access to lifesaving care.The VA’s proposal to cut its reimbursement rate for emergency air medical services would force air ambulance bases to close, causing devastating loss of critical medical care for veterans, particularly in rural communities.The air medical industry plays an important role in Hawaii — where there are over 112,000 veterans — connecting those without direct access to a trauma center to the nearest medically appropriate facility.These air ambulance transports take place within what trauma doctors call the “golden hour,” the first window after a traumatic injury when the right kind of medical care received can lead to vastly better patient outcomes. Without the high level of care provided by air ambulances, the lives of veterans and rural Americans are at risk.The VA is considering cutting its reimbursement rate to equal the Medicare rate. However, Medicare hasn’t updated its air ambulance rate in over 20 years and only covers around 50% of the cost to transport a patient.That’s why we all need to urge the VA not to cut its reimbursement rate for air ambulances and to preserve access to this lifesaving care. We must protect our veterans just like they protected us.PJ AmarteyWashington, D.C."
suffolknewsherald_2022_55,"Published 12:01 pm Wednesday, June 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsIn the contentious debate over how and what public schools should teach students about racism, one thing both sides purport to agree on is the need for unvarnished instruction on America’s complicated, often shameful, track record on race.“We must equip our teachers to teach our students the entirety of our history – both good and bad,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin wrote in an early executive order banning “inherently divisive concepts” in the classroom. “From the horrors of American slavery and segregation, and our country’s treatment of Native Americans, to the triumph of America’s Greatest Generation against the Nazi Empire, the heroic efforts of Americans in the Civil Rights Movement, and our country’s defeat of the Soviet Union and the ills of Communism, we must provide our students with the facts and context necessary to understand these important events.”Juneteenth, which will be recognized Monday as America’s newest federal holiday, is such a chapter in our country’s history that cannot be ignored.Also known at various times as Jubilee Day, Emancipation Day, Freedom Day and Black Independence Day, Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in 1865, when the announcement of General Order No. 3 by Union Gen. Gordon Granger declared freedom for enslaved people in Texas, the last state of the Confederacy where institutional slavery lingered.President Abraham Lincoln had actually issued the Emancipation Proclamation some six months earlier, but it was slow to have its intended effect. Texas, the most remote state of the former Confederacy, was one such place. Slavery actually remained legal in two of the Union border states, Delaware and Kentucky, until the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in December 1865.Informal celebrations of Juneteenth began in 1866 and took various forms over the decades that followed. Every U.S. state and Washington, D.C., have formally recognized the holiday in some way. In 2020, then-Gov. Ralph Northam signed an executive order recognizing Juneteenth as a paid day of leave for state employees in Virginia. But it wasn’t until last summer that Juneteenth, with the stroke of a pen by President Biden, became the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was adopted in 1983.As with many federal holidays, we hope it doesn’t become just another day off from work but an important time of reflection and, yes, celebration of righting one of our country’s greatest wrongs: the enslavement of a population of people who have greatly enriched the American fabric.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2022_31,"Accommodations are intended to level the playing field, and Fetterman’s didn’t come close.Like many people, we cringed aswe watched the debate between Mehmet Oz and John Fetterman— not because of Fetterman’s performance, but because of how poorly his needs were accommodated.Given Fetterman’s recently acquiredauditory processing difficulties, the idea that closed captioning alone would enable him to process, formulate, and coherently express his thoughts in 15- to 60-second windows was — to put it lightly — magical thinking.» SIGN UP:Election Day is coming. Are you ready? Get our free PA 2022 newsletter in your inbox and you will be.As a person with a disability who works in disability policy and as a speech/language pathologist for individuals with communication challenges, we know from our own experiences that this is simply not how accommodations work. Accommodations are intended to level the playing field so that the candidates can compete equally, and Fetterman’s didn’t come close.Accommodations, by design, are highly individualized. While neither of us is in a position to know the exact accommodations Fetterman required, we observed significant problems with what was provided.In this case, Fetterman, like some others recovering from a stroke, appears torequire extra time to integrate what he has heard and seen before he can respond. These accommodations have nothing to do with intelligence or ability to serve.» READ MORE:Voter s guide: Everything you need to know about the 2022 electionClosed captioning, the sole accommodation provided to Fetterman, can be helpful for someone who processes visual information better than auditory information. But during a debate, where multiple people were speaking rapid-fire, it would be difficult for Fetterman to integrate what he needed to read in order to process what was being said.Thus, closed captioning did not account for the competing spoken and written messages that occur during a debate. I (Fishbein have ADHD, Tourette syndrome, and a processing speed delay. I accommodate for a similar issue by using a notetaker in meetings because I cannot process what I’m hearing and write it down at the same time.» READ MORE:Why Pennsylvania is not ready for a disabled leaderPeople who have experienced a stroke often demonstrate delayed response times and can find it difficult to process large quantities of written information.Set up as high-stakes political theater, debates require candidates to respond within an allotted time, often to large quantities of information. Fetterman was expected to integrate what he had read and respond immediately with precision and concision.This type of pressure can be particularly difficult for individuals experiencing processing issues, resulting in increased difficulty formulating thoughts. During the debate, we watched with frustration as Fetterman formulated his response just as the buzzer went off, only to be cut off mid-sentence by one of the moderators as he attempted to locate the correct words.An appropriate accommodation would have been to plan for Fetterman’s language processing needs by allotting him extra time to digest what he’d read and formulate his responses. We understand the conundrum for the moderators, who were trying to maintain the debate rules. If it were to be truly accessible, the debate moderators should have started the clock when Fetterman started talking.Even the layout of the stage was problematic, given Fetterman’s needs. Oz was able to turn his head, talk to, and directly observe the reactions of his opponent and the moderators. Conversely, Fetterman needed to keep his eyes on the monitor. This made him appear awkward and stiff. It affected his ability to fully connect with the moderators and his opponent, and to derive information from their body language and facial expressions.The lecterns should have been positioned so that the candidates were facing each other with the screens for captioning on the lecterns or over each opponent’s head.“If elected, Fetterman will need to surround himself with people who know his challenges and can effectively support him.”Communication needs vary with context for any individual. If elected, Fetterman will need to surround himself with people who know his challenges and can effectively support him in overcoming the barriers they present. This is a reasonable accommodation and one that should be made available if Fetterman is elected to the Senate on Nov. 8.To advocate for the citizens of Pennsylvania, Fetterman will need to learn to advocate for the accommodations he needs to do his job. This starts with reaching out to experts who fully understand his needs, particularly as his condition improves and those needs shift.Had Fetterman received the proper accommodations for this debate, we believe Pennsylvanians would have been provided a clearer view of how the candidates compare with each other.Adam Fishbein is a disability policy expert and lifelong advocate for people with disabilities.

suffolknewsherald_2022_162,"Published 5:53 pm Tuesday, February 22, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceIt may sound strange for those of us who grew up without the Internet, but today’s kids don’t know a world that isn’t connected. The Internet has always been a part of their lives. Unfortunately, not all of them realize some of the dangers involved with being online. In this new world, parents must do what they can to keep their children safe in the real world and in the digital one.The first step to take is to realize how many items are connected to the internet. Nearly all gaming systems, tablets, phones, and computers are connected to the Internet. We’re long past the days of the family desktop being the only thing connected to cyberspace!Next, ensure that you talk with your children about the dangers that come from being online and help them understand what they can and cannot do online. This conversation will vary based on age and maturity, but this conversation must be held. The conversation should be ongoing, as well, and change as children age.Internet-connected items should be kept in an area that is viewable by everyone. Placing these devices in a shared living space ensures that you will see and hear what is happening, even if you are only catching glimpses. This includes game systems. Game systems can be connected to the internet, and many games allow unmonitored and uncensored audio, video and chat features.Many children have internet-connected devices in an area of their rooms where parents cannot see and wear headphones when they speak to others. This allows anyone in the world to connect with your children, giving them an unseen space where people you do not know can share anything with them.It’s also wise to install programs that help keep children safe on internet devices. Begin by researching the various programs for household computers and installing a program that fits your needs. At the very least, the software chosen should block inappropriate websites and not allow the program to be turned off without a password. Covenant Eyes is one of many programs available that can help in this area.Children who are allowed to have mobile phones or internet-connected tablets should have a mobile app installed that blocks lewd websites, monitors chats and blocks the download of questionable apps. While the Bark Mobile App is the most popular, other options are available.Lastly, consider blocking the internet to your children’s devices when they should not be accessing them. Most internet service providers have parental controls that allow you to set specific times that the internet will not be available on certain devices.I’m not paranoid about children being connected online. Being connected can be an excellent thing for children and adults alike. There is a real danger that exists online, but danger exists everywhere. We shouldn’t run away from the internet or ban our children from enjoying the good things that it can bring, but we should take steps to protect them as they enter the wild, wild west of the world wide web.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2022_5,"We ve got issues. As someone who was a downtown retailer for almost 30 years, I’m downtown’s biggest fan. But I’ve been scratching my head about some recent city decisions. And then when I read about the plans to relocate City Hall to the Lane Community College building across from the LTD bus station, I had to wonder if I was living in some dystopian version ofGroundhog Daywhere we are doomed to repeat the same conversations about City Hall over and over? The decision to put City Hall in the LCC space is such a bad decision, it’s hard to even know where to start. But let’s start with a little history. We only have to go back to 2016, when the city hired Project for Public Spaces at considerable expense to help us think about downtown. Out of this work, which involved comments from more than 2,000 people, the concept of a “town square” emerged. It involved siting the Farmers Market and City Hall close together. As I recall, there was also the suggestion to have a state-of-the-art playground and remake Oak Street and 8th Avenue as two-way streets. All this was specifically designed to increase access and create synergy. The city also went to considerable expense hiring architects to develop drawings and plans. I don’t see the good in hiring experts and ignoring their well-considered advice. We have a plan and let’s stick to it. Instead, the city wants to displace LCC and all the students using that building. Because it’s cheap? Is that what we really want? A cheap City Hall across from the bus station? The LCC plan would also leave us with a big gravel lot in prime real estate. Who thinks abandoning prime real estate right next to your Park Blocks anchor tenant without any idea of what you are going to do with it is a good idea? The plan to use the EWEB building is visionary in a kind of utopic way, but it leaves us with an isolated City Hall. And if you think that will spark riverfront development, I have two words for you: federal courthouse. How many people thought that would spark a riverfront renaissance? Better to leave the EWEB site for a future developer with deep pockets who can do it justice. We need to use our city dollars for the most impact, use them in a way that will not just give us a functional building but that will enhance our little burg and help all the businesses around it thrive. We have a well considered plan and, yes, we are short of money, but when there’s a will, there’s a way. Don’t throw all that well spent money away and start over again. Let’s be smart. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Jewel Murphy is a longtime Eugene resident and former owner of Passionflower Design."
hawaiitribune_herald_2022_29,"Is the age of nuclear fusion finally dawning?After many decades of not-so-productive research, scientists have been making serious progress toward an energy revolution. On Monday came news of the latest milestone: According to press reports, scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California recently induced a fusion reaction that produced a net energy gain — that is, it generated more power than it consumed.Although its practical consequences may be limited, it was a major symbolic and scientific achievement. “Net gain” has been the elusive lodestar of fusion research since the 1950s. Realizing it should give a major boost to global research efforts, provide crucial data for other scientists to study, validate the push for more government investment, and offer a tantalizing glimpse of fusion’s real-world possibilities.It’s no exaggeration to say that those could be revolutionary. A workable fusion reactor could produce effectively limitless energy, with no intermittency, no carbon emissions, no dangerous waste and nowhere near the material resources required by other renewable projects. President Joe Biden’s goal of a net-zero economy would start to look more plausible; humanity’s longer-term climate and energy challenges would seem much more manageable.Some skepticism is still warranted. Few technologies have been hyped quite so relentlessly over the years, and the remaining challenges to building a viable commercial reactor are immense. Many years of expensive research and problem-solving lie ahead, with no guarantee of success. Even so, the stars are aligning for progress, and potentially for more breakthroughs.One reason for optimism is that the federal government has gotten serious about fusion. In March, the White House announced a long-term strategy to accelerate commercial fusion efforts. Congress recently directed a record $713 million for fusion research and construction, along with some $50 million for a major public-private partnership. Fusion projects will also soon benefit from hundreds of millions in Inflation Reduction Act funds. All told, this is the kind of focused commitment that has been long overdue.Private enterprise is also entering the game on a significant scale. So far, investors have dedicated nearly $5 billion to about 35 fusion startups, according to the industry’s trade group, with funding roughly doubling since last year. Several of these companies have the backing of Silicon Valley luminaries, including General Fusion Inc. (Jeff Bezos , Commonwealth Fusion Systems (Bill Gates , and Helion Energy Inc. (Peter Thiel . Some are already breaking ground on new facilities.For now, it’s enough for policymakers to express guarded enthusiasm, and to lay the groundwork for future progress. As fusion science advances, global cooperation will be essential. Funding for research, educating a skilled workforce, and building up infrastructure should be redoubled. Above all, governments must avoid red tape — of the kind that has needlessly held up traditional fission projects — and prevent parochial interests from impeding innovation.Unlocking the power of the stars has never been an easy goal. But few scientific endeavors could have a greater potential payoff.

suffolknewsherald_2022_119,"Published 6:34 pm Friday, April 8, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Chris QuilpaOur world has been watching what has been happening in Ukraine since its invasion by Russia on Feb. 24. It is difficult to see images and photos of the destruction and loss of lives and property, historical sites and buildings of a freedom-loving, independent country.The aggression, atrocities, barbarism and savagery of Russian forces are inhuman and despicable. On the other hand, the defiance, resilience and unbelievable strength and unity, and leadership of the Ukrainian leaders, forces and their people, are commendable, honorable and worthy of praise.War is destructive, we know. War is evil. It dehumanizes and diminishes our worth as human beings. It destroys humanity and the balance and normalcy of living. It wreaks havoc on relationships and world peace, security and order. It divides families and nations. It is a threat to peace, stability and goodwill. War is the absence of love and peace. On the other hand, from a humanitarian standpoint, it can bring unity and solidarity to all peace-loving, caring humanity.As a peace-loving and freedom-loving citizen of the world, I don’t want war. I don’t want trouble. I want peace to reign and prevail all the time. Trying to be a good Christian exercising my faith freely and enjoying my freedom, I want to live a decent life with my family and friends. I want to be always united with the rest of the world that uphold the laws of the land and those of God.One restless night, while glued to our TV set, focused on what’s happening in Ukraine, I couldn’t control myself but shed tears, weeping for the graphic pictures of brutality, destruction, loss of lives, property and the millions and millions of Ukrainian refugees. It’s so unbearable to take. God, where are you? I prayed and prayed.On my notebook, I wrote these, my personal lamentation, sort of: What can I do but pray/And donate something/Of my retirement money or income. Watching what’s going on/And what has happened in Ukraine/Breaks my heart and I weep. Seeing photos of mass graves in Bucha/And any other bombed and bombarded/Places in Ukraine makes me sick and grieve, Praying and praying and continue praying/And feeling sad and mad and helpless/For not able to help much to Ukraine. Why is this happening, this brutality/ And this inhumanity of/by Russia/Towards a freedom-loving country like Ukraine? When will this war in Ukraine end?/And peace and freedom will prevail in Ukraine/So Love will reign in every heart and soul of all. I grieve for Ukraine; I feel their pain./And I mourn with those victims of war/And I pray for all those refugees and were displaced. God, protect those who fight for peace/And freedom and liberty of Ukraine/And strengthen their faith to face off their enemies. Mother Mary, spread your mantle of care/And protection to all the Ukrainian people/Who have been struggling to live in peace and be free. St. Joseph, our Spiritual Father of all, I pray/And ask you to intercede for all Ukrainians/Trying to suppress and fight their enemies and foes. Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, I pray/Forgive us our trespasses and our misgivings/ Pardon those of us who are “monsters” and “savages.” All the angels and saints, I pray, help us/And inspire all of us to love peace and harmony/With your intercession, we hope for peace in Ukraine. Amen. As the Christian world observes Lent, we, believers and followers of Christ, continue to pray fervently, give generously and serve faithfully to our brothers and sisters in Christ to all parts of the world, And, as the Holy Week is fast approaching, leading to Easter, we continue to pray, repent, fast, give alms and do penance, as we reflect and meditate on the passion, death and resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.We believe there’s hope and light, and life, and peace, after we experience darkness and brokenness in our life-world, especially in Ukraine. There’s love and joy, and charity, after all the hatred and indifference, sadness and sorrow we have experienced, especially our brothers and sisters in Christ in Ukraine and elsewhere.

eugeneweekly_2022_23,"We ve got issues. Oh, Oregon… Oh, Eugene… We are not on the same page. Let’s discuss white centering in solutions to anti-racism, and the lack of attention to anti-Blackness. I’m not going to belittle the 55.6 percent of the people who voted yes on Measure 112 — the measure which “amends the Oregon Constitution to delete a provision permitting slavery or involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime. Affirms that courts can issue sentencing alternatives to incarceration, including mandatory education, counseling, etc.” That is the actual verbiage, and I need you to see the foundational issue; it is not the voting numbers, although we will get to that in a moment. This amends the OREGON CONSTITUTION. If you are unfamiliar with the history of Oregon, there it is. The Constitution also stated that Black people literally were not allowed within its borders at the time the state joined the union. The families who were here lived comparatively in deep distress, focusing on being unheard, unseen, flying under the radar to maintain their safety, which even then they had little control over. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. So what am I saying? That 44.4 percent of the Oregon voting population in 2022 who believed that endingslaveryas a punishment was not a good decision. I’m truly uninterested in the caveats of why or why not. Is this a win? Before you answer that, can you decenter yourself in that answer? I’m going to guess eight out of 10 people reading this column would agree that the idea of slavery is barbaric and inhumane, but don’t attach the structure of the institution as a means to an end. It is a direct byproduct of white supremacy culture, in which as a whole, affectsanyoneoppressed by systemic superiority. That includes socially economically disadvantaged white folx, too. I wonder if the white voting population tied this act to only Black and Brown people? You read slavery, you think Black. With that idea, I’m curious — the 44.4 percent, if they were thinking the same thing — with this “win,” are we building for the discussions around the safety for the Black and Brown people that the population was hoping would stay in some sort of state protected punishment? The truth of it is, the measure itself was only one branch of a much bigger tree. It’s amended, not removed. It is not the practices or process of the district attorney, police force or education system, which are all inexplicitly tied together. It is effectively a way to feel better about the wrongs of the past, with very little direction to protect the very people targeted in the future. So who are the 44.4 percent who think the same thing from their very centered, very privileged perspective? Undoubtedly, your nurses, doctors, executive directors of nonprofits, your favorite festivals, your longtime established markets, your whitewashed Black folx, your socially blind white folx and everyone stuck in the middle. I am encouraged to see the vote, and that the vote indicates a suggestion for more. However, we are not safe until the systemically privileged majority can openly accept radical change within themselves and of the system that feeds them.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_52,"Back in 2001, precious few Americans could have explained what Houston-based Enron did as a company and how it got so spectacularly wealthy. But when it filed for a record-breaking bankruptcy, Americans got schooled fast about not putting their trust and money behind swaggering, fast-talking con artists. But fools and their money regrouped over the years, and along came FTX, a $32 billion cryptocurrency exchange that repeated many of Enron’s mistakes and yielded the same abysmal results. We suspect that a lot of investors who lost their shirts in the FTX failure would have trouble explaining exactly what FTX did, and that’s largely because the entire cryptocurrency industry is built on fantasy.Even the person in charge of the company, Sam Bankman-Fried, didn’t understand it completely.“I didn’t know exactly what was going on,” he told The New York Times last week in a DealBook video interview.A year ago, Bankman-Fried was worth an estimated $26.5 billion. Today, the 30-year-old might have around $100,000 in assets. “I’ve had a bad month,” he told The Times.The losses he and his investors suffered are far more complex to explain than what happened at Enron.That company actually dealt in a tangible asset — energy — but was guilty of creating fake companies and shuffling money-losing accounts among them to hide its financial losses.In the case of FTX, it was an exchange where people bought and sold imaginary cryptocurrency, whose value was based on nothing that anyone could see or touch.And yet millions of people around the world poured billions of real dollars into it.When the imaginary world of cryptocurrency and FTX came crashing down, investors demanded their real, tangible money back. But it was gone. That prompted the equivalent of a bank run that exposed the myth behind everything Bankman-Fried was doing. He invented currency.When that wasn’t enough, he invented an exchange for other invented currencies.As long as everyone believed in the myth, the money poured in.Company officers apparently used FTX assets to take out real loans to make investments in real, money-based enterprises.When the run on the bank began, they apparently began using customers’ money to pay off other customers — a Ponzi scheme, in other words. Former President Bill Clinton was among the prominent personalities who got burned by associating themselves with FTX.To his credit, though, Clinton gave a talk at the FTX headquarters in the Bahamas reportedly warning all involved to “do right by it in the regulatory space,” meaning to make sure FTX operations abided by U.S. securities and banking regulations. Because the industry took off way before U.S. regulators could catch up, it’s not clear what they can do now to hold FTX officials legally accountable.That shouldn’t stop Congress from trying.The internet isn’t going away anytime soon, nor will its imaginary currency market.— St. Louis Post-DispatchBOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

leoweekly_2022_70,"The only thing my middle daughter wanted for Christmas was a pooping turtle. The ads for theLittle Live Pets Gotta Go Turdlepromise “an interactive, toilet-trained turtle who loves to sing, dance, chat back, eat, and poop – on the toilet!” To a 5 year old, that’s a persuasive pitch. For weeks, all we heard was:Pooping turtle!Pooping turtle!Pooping turtle!A visit to a hard-of-hearing Santa resulted in some confusion, since my daughter’s residual babyspeak screamed through the filter of a cloth mask made her persistent request sound like “POOPOO TWODDLE,” which, unlike “pooping turtle,” is a silly thing to ask for. To make extra sure, she dictated a letter to the North Pole which, in her mother’s pristine handwriting, unmistakably listed “Pooping Turtle” as the first of only five total items. And so we were obligated to buy her a pooping turtle.She doesn’t like it all that much. At first, Shelbert (or Lena, as our daughter has renamed her (the renaming plus the inherent difficulty in sexing testudines forces me to guess at proper pronouns (Lena: please forgive me if I have misgendered you was of great interest to the whole house. It was not merely scatological curiosity driving Lena’s early popularity. She repeated whatever the kids screamed at her, she made delightfully weird digestive noises, her giant prehistoric neck shimmied and wriggled like a fuzzy purple tube man, and the pièce de résistance: When the time came to move whatever analog turtles have to bowels, Lena erupted into song.Uh-oh! Gotta go!Uh-oh gotta go!What better song for our troubled times? Yes, Lena, there is cause for alarm. Yes, we do gotta go. The “going” itself seemed a miracle of innovation. Pink sand is scooped into Lena’s beak and emerges from the other end only when she is placed on a tiny plastic toilet. The sand mingles with a half-cup of toilet water and becomes a congealed mass of droppings, but returns to sand form as soon as it is pulled out of the water, allowing it to be fed back to the turtle. Incredible!But a miracle oft repeated is no miracle at all, and we soon recognized Lena’s limitations. Her limbs don’t move, so she is perpetually in a squat. She just sits on the pot waiting to be fed, and then waiting to poop, and then waiting to be fed again. The “chat back” feature adds a bit of novelty, but all she can do is repeat, repeat, repeat. The Furby was a more adept conversationalist, and that toy is — brace yourself Xers — nearly a quarter-century old. Even the “gotta go” song, catchy and poignant though it may be, is the same four words over and over. After a day or two, the pooping turtle was left silent and untouched on the kitchen table, abandoned in favor of more pliable, non-defecating toys.This New Year, my sole resolution is to ask, at regular intervals, whether I am doing any better than a Live Pets Gotta Go Turdle. Lena’s rut is surely unique to plastic, sand-crapping reptiles, but a close human equivalent might be dysthymia, a mild-but-chronic cousin of clinical depression. The condition, sometimes referred to as persistent depressive disorder, doesn’t involve episodes requiring hospitalization or anything quite so dramatic. It’s subtle. It manifests itself as a hazy distaste for life; a stagnant, swampy air that burdens the lungs, leaving you with enough energy to carry out your daily obligations but little else. So you plod through the mud, aspiring to nothing other than getting through the day, because why bother with more? When you look at the grand design of the universe, all you can see is turtles, toilets and excrement all the way down, with nothing more to offer, no better songs to sing, and no reason to move from where you are.Persistent depressive disorder can be effectively treated (antidepressants work surprisingly well but is devilishly difficult to diagnose. Mental health professionals generally agree that you must have experienced symptoms for at least two years to be considered dysthymic. As such, most cases go untreated. Once you’ve lived more-or-less successfully with low-grade depression for a period of years, you aren’t likely to spend a couple hundred bucks to trade your familiar couch for an uncomfortable Freudian model. And who could look at these last two years and say that a simmering revulsion for existence is abnormal? How can you even call that a “disorder?” Most folks I know are stuck right here with me, our knees forcibly bent, eating the same shit we ate yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that.Listen, reader: I want to confide something in you. For all the bleak cynicism I squeeze out onto these pages every couple of weeks, I still believe that the year to come holds bright, beautiful things worth getting off the pot for. There will be new toys to play with, new friends to make and new pills to take. At the very least, there will be new extended metaphors that don’t involve pooping turtles. I hope you’ll explore all of that with me. And when next Christmas comes around, I hope we get all the gifts we ask for, even the stuff we don’t know about yet.. ( ."
suffolknewsherald_2022_96,"Published 6:32 pm Friday, May 6, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle ThompsonGuest columnistTurning the calendar page for May reminded me how fast the days have passed. Our year has not been static!May reminds us it’s time to celebrate moms. Mother’s Day is always the second Sunday in May. That’s May 8 this year. Before we become adjusted to a new month, we have a remembrance day we shouldn’t forget: Our mothers need to be honored!God first created Adam, then Eve, the first couple to whom He gave responsibilities for sharing a life together. We women have the unique privilege and great blessing of being the reproductive part and nurturing children, of training our children, of loving and teaching them to love, of correcting and showing them how to live. We moms can’t be replaced. Thankfully, this day reminds us of our God given purpose.Have you noticed God also gave the animals the same tenderness for training their litter? The young follow and do what the mother does. The mother bird tenderly cares for the eggs in the nest, keeping them warm, then seeing to her baby birds’ need for food. She watches over the nest until they can fly and be on their own.It is a God-given honor to be a mom. Right here is where God’s great love lights our world. The Scriptures tell us we are created in His image. When we give our lives over to God, He calls us His children (I John 3:1. We can rely on Him to help us guide our children in the right way. Because He is God, He is able to do for us what we are expected to do for our children.I was in a restaurant when a group came in with a 2-month-old baby boy who had just been christened. I knew I had to greet and congratulate them. When I turned my attention to the baby, the little guy immediately smiled. He already knew he was loved, cuddled and being cared for. That is God’s purpose for motherhood.This Sunday I feel sure our church like most others will focus on mothers. Since I teach a class, I wanted to review mothers in the Bible. Many were very godly, praying women, a few not so much so. I thought of my mom.My parents already had seven children when Mom knew she was going to have another baby. She wasn’t sure how they could meet the needs of the ones they already had.I had never heard that story until the night before my husband and I left to go overseas as missionaries. It was then she told me I was the child about which she had felt so desperate. She said she had gone outside where no one could hear and cried out to God, asking Him to make her love this baby and if He did, she would give the baby back to Him.God very graciously answered that prayer. With age comes wisdom. I know today she was a wonderful mother who had to make sacrifices. When I put flowers on her grave I stand for a moment and thank God for her. My praise and thanks go to Him for a mother who did all she could with the little they had to see that our needs for food and clothing and shelter were met — not high-class things but our needs.Solomon set a high standard for women when he wrote Proverbs 31. He asked who could find a “virtuous” woman and said “her price is far above rubies” — not diamonds. He knew high-quality rubies were a rare, very costly stone, worth more than a diamond even today. He put virtuous women in that class.He then said her husband trusts in her. That’s loyalty, no playing around. Solomon was brilliant and wise, not a particularly good biblical example of what he taught, but he had excellent praise and insight into what God intended for women.“Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.” (Proverbs 31:30, 31 May the mothers of today see those godly virtues about which Solomon wrote and become that kind of women.Suffolk resident Myrtle V.

suffolknewsherald_2022_79,"Published 5:40 pm Tuesday, December 6, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardWe shared in this space a couple of weeks back about area residents’ political views in the 13th annual Life in Hampton Roads survey by the Social Science Research Center at Old Dominion University.The survey, conducted May 31 through Aug. 19 in Hampton Roads’ major cities, including Suffolk, reveals additional interesting data about citizens’ perceptions of police, the economy, education, health care and COVID-19, and transportation, among other issues.More than 81% of respondents rated the quality of their health as excellent (26.2% or good (55.5% . This is about nine percentage points higher than the prior year (72% , with most of the increase being in the excellent category (increasing from 17.9% . That means an increase in self-reported good/excellent health close to levels reported pre-COVID (for example, 82% in 2017 .In the 2021 survey, Hampton Roads residents were asked if they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 74.3% indicated yes. This year, 85.2% reported they had received at least one dose – an increase of more than 10%. Last year, 69.9% of respondents indicated that they were fully vaccinated (defined as two shots and 25% indicated that they were not vaccinated (even partially . This year, the number of fully vaccinated residents rose to 78.6% and only 14.1% had received no vaccinations.There was significant variation across cities in the proportion of people who were fully vaccinated this past year (two doses or more . Suffolk and Newport News led the way at 90%, well ahead of Hampton (70% , Norfolk and Portsmouth (both 71% , Virginia Beach (78% and Chesapeake (82% .Respondents were asked to rate the quality of their local public school system, and there was considerable variation in the responses. About 15% reported that their public school system was excellent and another third (32.5% reported their school system was good. Still, 27.2% rated their local public school as fair and another 13% rated it as poor.Parents with children in public schools were less likely to report that they did not know about the quality of the public schools. Second, they tended to view the schools more favorably than all respondents as a whole. Parents with children in public schools were by a margin of 8.2 percentage points more likely to describe them as excellent and by 7.2 percentage points more likely to rate them as good.Perceptions of the quality of local public schools varied significantly across cities. In Suffolk, 42% of respondents rated local schools good or excellent, far below Chesapeake and Virginia Beach at nearly 75% and Newport News at 62%. Perception of the public schools was lowest in Norfolk with only 22% rating them as good or excellent.

minnpost_2022_72,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Most years, conversations around the Capitol building in St. Paul are heavy with a tone of financial scarcity. That should not be the case in 2022. Minnesotans must call upon their lawmakers to seize this rare opportunity and make a monumental investment in our future.Thanks to a historic $7.75 billion surplus in the state budget, excellent rates for bonding and a windfall of federal funding, Gov. Tim Walz and state legislators can make strategic, long-term investments that will meaningfully improve all Minnesotans’ quality of life. An investment in our lands and waters would do just that.Minnesota’s iconic lands and waters are famous for their beauty and the immense opportunities they provide for outdoor recreation, from our wilderness areas, city parks and everywhere in between. An ever-growing stream of visitors are enjoying the outdoors: In 2020, an estimated 12.3 million people visited Minnesota state parks and recreation areas, which was a 25 percent increase over 2019. This love for outdoor recreation is key to the state’s $16 billion per year tourism industry, which supports 11 percent of all private-sector jobs and benefits communities of all sizes throughout the state.Nature also happens to be one of our most cost-effective yet underappreciated forms of public infrastructure. Grasslands, forests and wetlands act as a natural filter to keep our rivers and lakes clean, providing affordable drinking water. Floodplain habitat and wetlands help protect lives and property from flooding by slowing down and holding water. Expanded parks with vibrant tree canopies temper extreme heat in our cities and towns while providing places of rejuvenation. And nature does all of this while removing massive amounts of carbon from the air.When we let it work as intended, nature is a mighty tool to address climate change and improve health and quality of life for Minnesotans.Despite its multiple benefits, the state’s investment in nature is falling behind. Twenty years ago, spending on the environment and conservation was just over 2% of state general fund spending; today, it’s less than 1%. Even with dedicated funds like the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund and the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment, Minnesota is underinvesting in nature.Consider the example of a healthy tree, whether along a sidewalk or a riverbank. It pulls carbon from the atmosphere and emits oxygen, providing us with clean air to breathe. The tree’s roots capture rainfall, reducing pollutants and sediment in our water. Its leaves shade our homes and streets, reducing our need for energy consumption and lessening the effects of extreme heat. Even on a small scale, trees can have a measurable impact.Minnesotans should call upon the governor and state lawmakers to seize the opportunity in 2022 to deliver funding for nature that will help mitigate climate change, make our cities and towns more resilient to extreme weather, and improve air and water quality. Investing now is the best chance we have to sustain the nature Minnesotans love.Kris Larson is the executive director of Minnesota Land Trust, Ann Mulholland is the director of The Nature Conservancy in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, and Susan Schmidt is the Minnesota state director of the Trust for Public Land."

leoweekly_2022_27,"LGBTQ Pride has exploded like a resplendent rainbow all across Kentucky and the whole U.S. You can’t scroll six inches without hitting a rainbow rendition of a corporate logo. There are more than 20 Pride events around our commonwealth. Twenty-three Kentucky communities have passed local Fairness Ordinances to prohibit LGBTQ discrimination. We’ve had marriage equality for nearly seven years. National polls show support and acceptance for our LGBTQ community at the highest ever, including in virtually every major religious group.So why does the fight for LGBTQ rights feel harder than ever? Why are we seeing some of the most regressive anti-LGBTQ attacks — particularly against trans kids? How did we get here?Simply put, progress breeds pushback.I yearn for the glory days of the Obama years, when hope truly did spring eternal for so many social justice issues. But looking back now, the turning points in our movement appear in sharp relief.The freedom to marry had seemed like a distant dream for so long. For years, it was the widest wedge among political issues. President George W. Bush’s campaign effectively used it to catapult him to reelection in 2004, placing the issue on the ballot in key swing states. Kentucky got caught up in the mix as well. Voters in our commonwealth codified LGBTQ marriage discrimination in our constitution by a vote of 75% to 25%.Nearly a decade later, LGBTQ marriage was still a toxic issue in our state. By 2013, only two statewide officials publicly supported same-sex marriage — then-Auditor Adam Edelen and Lt. Governor Jerry Abramson. Voters still overwhelmingly opposed it by 65%, with 54% opposition from state Democrats.Left to the voters in our state and nation, marriage equality wasn’t to be a reality for at least another decade. But the U.S. Supreme Court had other plans. In 2013 they approved federal marriage recognition, and, two short years later, the freedom to marry for LGBTQ couples all across the U.S. And suddenly support for same-sex marriage spiked.Opponents were incensed. Baffled. Scrambling. LGBTQ marriage had been their most reliable wedge issue for more than a decade. What were they to divide our nation with now?Conservative conferences festered with feverish debate to find a solution.Broad opposition to marriage relied heavily on people’s ignorance of LGBTQ people and their relationships. As more Americans came out, as more mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts and uncles had to confront the issue at home — and had to accept an LGBTQ family member they loved — that opposition eroded.Polls showed that most Americans now knew someone who was lesbian, gay or bisexual. But they still didn’t know someone who was transgender. With ignorance, fear can most easily be deployed. Lies can most easily be told — and weaponized.National anti-LGBTQ hate groups pivoted with a swiftness. By early they sent their first round of anti-trans bills to state-based groups like Kentucky’s Family Foundation.At first, efforts backfired by focusing exclusively on bathrooms. Kentucky defeated one of the first anti-trans bathroom bills in the nation in . The pushback against North Carolina’s bathroom bill in 2016 was severe. But polls showed the strategy was working. So opponents persisted until they found a battlefront as American as apple pie — sports.Suddenly, every conservative under the sun pretended to cared about women’s sports — for the first time ever. When Florida fell to an anti-trans sports bill last year, we knew we were in trouble. Our neighbors went next — Tennessee and West Virginia, which was Kentucky’s canary in the coal mine. Our friends at Fairness West Virginia had killed every anti-LGBTQ bill in their state legislature just like we had for years. But an anti-trans sports bill eked through.That’s when I knew our time was up. We’d been building difficult, meaningful relationships with Kentucky Republicans for years to successfully stop anti-LGBTQ laws for nearly a decade. But the national strategy against trans kids had gained too much momentum, and this year Kentucky passed its first anti-LGBTQ laws in recent memory — the same anti-trans sports ban that had been peddled to our peers.These are the challenges we will face for the next several years. In states where conservatives won the anti-trans sports bill, they’ve already moved on to more restrictive measures — denying trans kids healthcare, banning LGBTQ books in school libraries and promoting “conversion therapy.” These bills are coming here too. And we’ve got to be ready.Celebrate Pride, but prepare to fight. Never forget the first Pride was a riot — with bottles and bricks thrown by Black and Brown trans and queer people against an oppressive system. Pick your brick. Our lives depend on it. •You can join the Fairness Campaign’s fight for LGBTQ rights in Kentucky at fairness.org.Chris Hartman is the executive director of the Fairness Campaign, a Kentucky LGBTQ advocacy organization founded in 1991..You Filthy Man Sl*** Better Watch Your Mouths."
leoweekly_2022_8,"Heine Bros. workers are to be congratulated for their recent success in unionizing all seven area locations. They join in coffee camaraderie with the more than 200 Starbucks shops that have organized in the last year, along with a slew of other regional chains and a smattering of worker-owned cafes, including our own Old Louisville Coffee Co-op.When so much seems so bleak, and those in power so apathetic, the rejuvenation of the American labor movement is one of the few events that could conceivably turn things around. There’s still a long way to go, though. Only a small fraction of Starbucks stores nationwide are unionized, and less than 2% of all food service workers belong to a union. What if we add a little accelerant to the roaster, an extra espresso shot to our solidarity latte, some caffeine to our extended metaphor, etc.? Progress-minded baristas can do just that in their upcoming contract negotiations by insisting on the right to form not just coffee unions, but coffee militias.Hear me out. In addition to the increase in wages, retirement plans, health benefits and better working conditions that coffee unions will undoubtedly ask for, why not add a semiautomatic rifle and basic combat training for every new hire? Arming of drink artists should easily pass muster as a reasonable safety measure in 21st-century America. Coffee shops aren’t necessarily a top target of mass shooters, but they get hit every now and then, and you never know what the next mass-shooting fad will be. Besides, isn’t violent crime on the rise or something?Anyway, crazed criminals are not the only danger facing our java slingers. A disciplined fighting force might make angry customers think twice about throwing their drink back through the drive-thru window (I am told this sort of thing occurs with some regularity . Hot coffee can cause third degree burns, so chucking it at someone sounds like deadly force to me, and under the ridiculously broad self-defense laws of Kentucky and Indiana a barista could be well within their rights to blast away in response. I’d go so far as to say a well armed coffee militia would greatly improve customer relations overall. If you’re the kind of dickhead who regularly berates service industry employees, you might lighten up a bit if you knew it was a decorated sharpshooter who fucked up your drink.But the biggest reason to arm up is the rising threat of right-wing extremist coffee shops. You don’t want to get caught flat footed when fascist baristas storm your café, steal your beans, burn your pride flags and scald your milk.If you’re having a chuckle or rolling your eyes at the idea of coffee militias, perhaps you are blissfully unaware of just how stupid everything has gotten. You are to be forgiven if so, because things are fantastically, unfathomably stupid. So stupid, in fact, that “coffee fascism” is a real thing that we should take somewhat seriously. I’m not talking about all those tattooed-and-pierced, abstinence only, hate-the-sin-type Christian coffee shops. I’m talking about the straight up, militant, far-right beanery.Let’s start with Black Rifle Coffee. The company name is perplexing enough if you haven’t yet embraced the idea that caffeine and combat are a natural combo. The apparel section of their website features designs that don’t seem to have anything to do with coffee — hats with guns superimposed over flags; a shirt that says “Live Free or Die.” Their coffee names themselves are pretty much just bumper-sticker slogans — Thin Blue Line medium roast; Gunship light roast; AK-47 espresso. The whole vibe of the website is “own the libs for drinking frou-frou beverages.”I mention Black Rifle by name only because they are the relative moderates in this scenario. “Denouncing extremism” seems like an odd move for a company whose brand is flag-humping ultranationalism, but Black Rifle did it anyway, in a New York Times article no less. This prompted backlash from the true patriots of the coffee biz, entities I will not mention by name here because I’d rather not have a Molotov cocktail through my office window. One of them requires you to click that you didn’t vote for Joe Biden before entering its website. When its Twitter account was suspended, fans took to shady message boards to proclaim that it was “way past the point of stacking bodies” and to celebrate Senator Joseph McCarthy as an “American hero” who was “right all along.” You can buy mugs that say “GOD’S ARMY” and “NUCLEAR MAGA” from one Georgia coffee seller. Another company from right here in Indiana has gained some notoriety for being outright Nazis who brag about not being kosher certified. Their logo is a swastika made of coffee beans.These are scary people. A lot scarier than a heavily-caffeinated, well-trained 19-year old social justice warrior with a union card and an AR-15 (and maybe a surface-to-air missile or two, as it’s only a matter of time before some chud decides to drone-drop a live grenade into someone’s PSL .Once you know what else is out there, fully girded coffee unions don’t sound so silly. In fact, there’s an argument to be made that they are a prudent, even necessary feature of our increasingly stupid sociopolitical universe. There is little doubt that brownshirt baristas are already armed to the gills and would happily take over a soft-target coffeehouse upon the boss’s say-so.

minnpost_2022_25,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .My television gear wasn’t working last night. I couldn’t get Netflix, and other aspects of my remote were balky. It was a challenge. I could only go from channel to channel one by one.As I plodded by CNN, I decided to check it out, just out of curiosity. I don’t think I’ve deliberately watched CNN since the United States invaded Iraq. The image on the screen was of a man standing on a hotel roof with a panorama of a large city behind him. This is crazy, I thought, because the last time I watched CNN, there was a guy standing on a hotel roof in Baghdad with the horizon glowing with the after effects of American cruise missiles.Astoundingly, right on cue, the reporter turned with a surprised look on his face, sort of a “what the hell was that?” reaction. There had been a loud explosion in the distance. In the next few minutes, I watched as the reporter put on a flak jacket and a helmet.This wasn’t Baghdad, of course, it was Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. And it wasn’t the United States attacking, it was Russia. Just like the onset of the Iraq war, the Russians were aiming their missiles at command and control centers and airfields in preparation for an invasion.Military intelligence, the most famous oxymoron of them all, had warned this invasion was coming, but I think most of the world didn’t think the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, would really have the will to pull it off. Most of the world continues to be a cockeyed optimist.As I tuned back into CNN later (but still early in the morning, the news was grim. The American stock market was down 800 points. The Russians were now moving tanks and troops into Ukraine from four directions. The news agency Reuters called the invasion Europe’s darkest hour since World War II.I have two initial thoughts about the invasion. The first is my attempt to understand why Putin would do it. I think it has a lot to do with the malaise that has dogged Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia is an amazing country, full of chess champions and figure skaters and some of the world’s greatest writers. It is huge and populous nation, one that probably had more to do with the outcome of World War II than any other nation, including the United States.Putin sees his job as restoring Russia’s self-esteem, making Russians proud of their nation again, and reasserting Russia’s prominent place in the world. He has been aggressive, almost maniacal in his efforts to revive the wounded bear. Ukraine is the next domino in that march toward respect.A commentator on CNN was asked about the severe and crippling sanctions the U.S. and other nations will impose on Russia. He laughed and said it would be two years before the average Russian citizen would notice them.No, our response has to be more than tit for tat, eye for eye. Somebody, not me, has to be smart enough to figure out what to do about a situation in which a foreign tyrant in trying to restore the pride of his nation has sent the world into a tizzy – and he’s using our blueprint to do it. It might sound like Pollyanna, but we really need to figure out a world where tanks and missiles are not going to be the solution to our problems. Good luck with that one.Al Zdon is a retired newspaper editor."
minnpost_2022_121,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Urban liberal that I am, I have a message and a proposal for you, my MAGA neighbors. I propose that we make a pact. I like the word “pact.” It comes from the Latin “pax” meaning peace, and that is precisely what I am offering here, a peace proposal. Let me explain.I’ve meant to reach out to you earlier, ever since the 2016 election season, when you seemed to come out of nowhere. I feel some urgency to connect now, though, because there is something that is bothering me. More and more I’m hearing the term “civil war” tossed around, and recently by more mainstream voices. I’m sure you’re hearing it too and it seems that all that talk is really about war of some kind between us, you and me. It is talk that presumes that there is so much animosity between us that we are on the cusp of committing violence against each other on a broad and sustained scale that we are on the cusp of war.As we speak the horror and brutality of war unfolds daily in Ukraine. Although not a civil war as most understand that term, the violence and suffering there offers us stark warning for us, a warning about what can happen when grievances over national identity are not resolved peacefully. With Ukraine as our backdrop, can you even imagine being at war, any kind of war, with your fellow-citizens?I can’t.As Americans we have some familiarity with actual civil war, don’t we? And given our history, how misguided would we be to allow that to happen again? After all, from our first (and to date only civil war, we know that our country was brought to its knees: five years of bloody slaughter, some 800,000 dead, many more wounded and disabled, whole towns wiped off the map, a decimated citizenry and economy. The scars of the Civil War – economic, psychological, social and cultural – lingered for decades. Some linger still.Of course, a civil war like our first or a war like that in Ukraine, with standing armies and well-defined geographic and ideological dividing lines, isn’t likely. But how reassuring is that given the deep vein of political hostility, of rage really, that currently pulses through our country? As sure as we might be that we won’t see again a clash of standing armies on American soil, are we as certain that we won’t see marauding militia groups with competing agendas threatening each other, or threatening the most heavily armed civilian population the world has ever known? Indeed, isn’t commentary about civil war growing – aren’t I writing this very piece – precisely because it seems there is grave risk that an act of political violence or even assassination, a senseless spark, could lead to cascading violence?Whatever its definition, the outbreak of civil war in any form would surely mean constant threat to our lives and safety. It would mean disruption all around us, to government at all levels, to all our institutions, schools, churches, clubs, and businesses. In a state of civil war, there would be no security, but only profound instability and at a time when pandemic instability has already stretched us thin.If we’re disturbed now by supply chain woes, imagine how those woes would be compounded by civil war. In a climate of widespread violence and fear, how do businesses function? How do they make or move the goods, supply the services that we need and rely on? With businesses under siege, wouldn’t we see widespread loss of jobs and loss of the income derived from those jobs? If we’re feeling that we’re merely treading water now, how soon before we drown – before we drown each other – in the chaos of civil war?And what of our families? How would we keep them safe and healthy? If we’re already exhausted by virtual learning, by the emotional and academic toll that our children have suffered in the pandemic, wouldn’t that suffering be exponentially greater in a state of civil war? I don’t think it hyperbolic to say that, if we can’t figure out how to resolve differences without violence, it would all come crashing down, not just government and businesses and schools, but everything we hope for, all our dreams.The alternative, and antidote, to civil war is that we figure out how to get along. And doesn’t a bit of empathy and compassion for each other sound more sensible, more patriotic? I also have a hunch that if we got to know each other better we might just see eye-to-eye on more than a few things. We might just realize that what binds us together is far greater than what pulls us apart.For instance, that urban-liberal moniker. It is only a small part of who I am and not the most important part. Family is most important. I am married and have children, three girls and two boys. Three are out of the house, done with school, and starting to make their way in the world. The two youngest are teenagers, doing what teenagers do. They go to school, play sports and music, hang out with their friends, and listen ever less to what their parents have to say. Like their older siblings, they expect to get a good education, and to have the sort of work and life options that their parents have had. Our version of the American dream.Might you have similar dreams, and might there be much more to you than that MAGA tag?I was raised in the Catholic tradition where, as with most religious denominations, the central principle is love thy neighbor. I’ll bet we share this tradition too. I’ve fallen away from my Catholic roots but believe, more than ever, in that first principle. I feel morally compelled to abide by it, while also deeply aware of how often I fall short of it. I know we can relate on this point: sinners all, and in need of forgiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I know there are deep divisions between us. I understand too that some won’t be easily resolved, and some perhaps not at all. We aren’t likely, for instance, to see eye-to-eye on a certain former President. I admit that I find your affinity for him confounding, sometimes infuriating. I offer this not to pick at a fresh scab, but in the spirit of full disclosure, so that you know how I think or, as you may see it, where my blinders are. I can assure you, though, that whatever our disagreement over President 45, he is not, in my view, worth starting a war over. Rather, I’m willing to accept that our best option may be to simply agree to disagree, about his character and competence, and let the chips – or, in this case, the voting ballots – fall where they may.And about those voting ballots. Am I right that this may be a sore spot for you, and a fundamental point of contention between us? I hear constantly that you believe that the last election was rigged or stolen, that Joe Biden is not our legitimate president. Truth be told? I might agree with you that, if anything is worth fighting over, it would be a stolen election. Fighting to create and preserve democracy is central to our DNA as Americans, isn’t it?However, before we fight or, God forbid, start a war, over election chicanery or anything else, don’t we owe it to each other to be certain of our suspicions, to be sure that there are good facts, and not bad assumptions, undergirding our beliefs? I mean, how much regret, how much shame, would we carry if we were moved to violence – against each other, against neighbors, and fellow Americans – based on bad facts and a false narrative? What if we brought about collapse of all that is good in America because we were misled and wrong?Can we at least agree, then, that there should be good fact to support any belief that would lead us to civil war? Given the stakes, that’s not too much to ask, is it?Now if you hear judgment in my rhetorical questions, I admit there may be some because I firmly believe, after close study of the available evidence, that the election was neither stolen nor rigged. Nonetheless, as part of the pact I’m proposing, I will promise to examine closely every bit of evidence that you offer to support your belief, and I’ll try to do so with an open mind, if you will do the same for me. Don’t we owe this to each other, to our families, communities, and our country? Isn’t this the least we can do?So here’s my peace proposal, that pact that I would like us to make as citizens of one great country: that we strive to know each other better, listen better to each other, listen less to those that gain from dividing us, and that we commit to grounding our strongest beliefs – about each other and our politics – on fact and truth.Wouldn’t a pact like this be in keeping with the commandment that we love our neighbor? Wouldn’t it be a far cry better than civil war? What do you say?Urban liberal that he is, Bill O’Brien lives in Minneapolis and works as a labor and civil rights lawyer."
minnpost_2022_6,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s recent cancellation of two federal mining leases in the headwaters of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota was a clear affirmation of the rule of law – the prior administration had illegally renewed the leases in favor of a Chilean mining conglomerate – and of the imperative to protect America’s most popular wilderness area. The cancellation also signaled that the pieces could very soon be in place to provide this national treasure the permanent protection that it deserves.Every year since 1964, when the Wilderness Act was passed, more people have visited the Boundary Waters than any other national Wilderness. Covering 1.1 million acres along the Canadian border, it has more than a thousand pristine lakes spread out through vast stretches of forests and wetlands. The Boundary Waters is home to hundreds of species of mammals, birds, fish and other creatures. People of all ages and abilities come from all over the U.S. and around the world to travel by canoe and experience the incomparable beauty of this watery landscape.All of this – plus the flourishing wilderness-based economy in northeastern Minnesota – would be at serious risk if sulfide-ore copper mining were permitted in the watershed of the Boundary Waters. Sulfide-ore mining, which the EPA has called the most toxic industry in America, generates sulfuric acid when the ore comes in contact with air and water, resulting in the release of acid and dissolved heavy metals into groundwater and surface water.The Obama administration took steps to protect the Boundary Waters in 2016, but as wasreported, the Trump administration, after a heavy lobbying barrage by Chilean mining giant Antofagasta, twisted the lease language and the law and improperly reversed the Obama administration action. The recent decision by the Biden administration meticulously details the sweetheart deal and favorable treatment received by the South American conglomerate.Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, who is showing growing interest in the issue, found the recent Department of Interior decision “persuasive” and added that it “represents a clear commitment on the part of the Biden administration to make sure we follow the law.”Even prior to the cancellation of the mineral leases, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management had begun the “mineral withdrawal” process under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act for 225,378 acres of federal land and mineral rights in the watershed of the Boundary Waters. The major component of this process is a scientific, cultural and economic study of the likely impacts if mining is permitted on the lands proposed to be withdrawn. If the study concludes that sulfide-ore copper mining in the watershed of the Boundary Waters will likely result in serious harm, the Secretary of the Interior can impose a 20-year moratorium on mining in the withdrawal area.A 20-year moratorium, or “withdrawal,” seems likely. That action, based on the study currently underway, would be a clarion call for permanent protection for this unique and precious place. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota has introduced a bill, HR 2794, providing for a permanent ban on sulfide-ore mining in the Boundary Waters watershed. Minnesota’s Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Smith are both firmly committed to a science-based approach – the kind of approach that is the essence of the mineral withdrawal study – for determining the fate of the Boundary Waters watershed.My friend and former boss, the late Walter Mondale, canoed and fished the Boundary Waters for most of his life. He worked tirelessly in his final years for its permanent protection. If he were still with us, he would be cheering on the Biden administration, Rep. McCollum, and Sen. Klobuchar and Smith.The star most appropriately aligned with this effort is L’Etoile du Nord, the Star of the North. It is the motto of the State of Minnesota, chosen in part because the North Star guided the voyageurs through the waters of northern Minnesota. May it guide us now to permanent protection of those waters.A native of Minnesota, Richard Moe was president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation and a board member of the Conservation Lands Foundation. He served as chief of staff to Vice President Walter Mondale and as an assistant to President Jimmy Carter."

When I first learned of this project, I was willing to keep an open mind about its benefits for the city and its residents, but as time went on and I learned more, I became less and less convinced that this property is the right location for this project and that taking this rezoning request up before addressing other community needs is the wrong thing to do.Thanks to the “monumental” efforts of many good “old” and “new” Suffolk citizens, I was able to learn much about the project and the needs of our community. While I have been frustrated by most city council members’ failure to address citizens’ concerns, I have been heartened by the civic interest in a project that would have immediate and long-term impacts on our city’s economic vitality and quality of life. In trying to understand a major project that our city seemed ready to approve with little long-term view or vision, we citizens came to understand how much knowledge we collectively have, why we came to be or remain Suffolk residents, and what we believe our role should be in the city’s decision-making process.Many have told me these statements express their views as well:I hope that City Council will use these points in its internal discussions and debates as a summary of the many messages you have received, speeches you’ve heard, and comments you’ve seen on social media. While we have heard clearly from some of the council members regarding where they stand, too many have remained quiet while we await your vision and leadership.It is clear we citizens care about our city and its people. With one current exception, you were all elected to carry out the will of the people for the good of the people. If you decide to ignore us, I am sure this issue will not be laid to rest after your vote. I implore every one of you to vote “no” on this request and move our city on to a better vision for our community.Denise M. MurdenSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_267,"Published 6:01 pm Friday, September 16, 2022ByStaff ReportsOnce a teacher, you’ll always be a teacher? I find it to be true, I believe. (The liberal arts education I’ve had from Divine Word College, in Vigan City, a UNESCO world heritage site in northern Luzon, Philippines and that inquisitiveness in me always kicks in. Before I immigrated here in 1983 to join my folks and relatives who have been here for more than 70 years, I used to be a high school classroom teacher/college instructor back in the days in the late 70s and early 80s in the Philippines, where I was born and raised.After working in an electronics company for two years in California, I joined the United States Navy in 1985 and, eventually, retired in 2005, after 20 years of honorable service to my adoptive country, the United States.I’ve heard that opening statement back then when I was still in college and having enrolled in a number of education courses to qualify me to take and then passed the board exam for teachers.I don’t know about you, but I love to share what I know and what I have, what I’ve learned and continue to learn as we go along with life’s journey. After all, we live for one another. We need each other. No man is an island, as they say. And, whether we like it or not, we all have a lifespan. That’s the law of nature. That’s reality.The new 2022-2023 school year is underway. In schools, students are in and so are the teachers, administrators, staff personnel and volunteers. As summer season is departing, the cool fall is coming in with its offerings to enhance and inspire, I do believe, learning and teaching.Schools are breeding grounds for education, expansion, growth and development. They are portals to immense possibilities and opportunities. They are also venues for changes and challenges that will shape and transform what society we are going to have.There are innumerable challenges that schools face or deal with, day and night. To cite, you have safety, security, peace and order, funding or budget allocation (adequate or inadequate . In addition, you have the problem of drugs, mental health, and high stakes testing.Although schools have these “Drug-free school zone” under penalty of law signs posted in designated places on school grounds, how sure are we that students are not taking drugs or don’t bring drugs to school?Influences are everywhere, especially if/when they have their cellphones. Influences are in and out of schools. Besides teachers and school staff-personnel, family and friends and outside forces play a crucial role in combating or eliminating drug problems in schools. Everyone in schools, I do believe, is trying to practice and adhere to teamwork as a crying battle for a successful mission accomplishment. All are eyes and ears, brains and hearts of successful school year activities brought about by coordination and cooperation of everybody.Mental health is another concern nowadays, not only in schools but in the community as a whole. Students, and teachers as well, come in school with varied capacities and capabilities. Assessment, (mis diagnoses, underestimation and uncertainty come to mind when we deal with students from different backgrounds and all walks of life. Each student (or anyone of us is as mysterious as our life is, I think.School health personnel, school counselors and school psychologists/psychiatrists are there to do what they have to do or required to do when dealing with behavioral, unstable students. Again, teamwork is paramount to solving whatever problem arises in students. Home and school and community all need each other to help our students succeed.Testing is important. In fact, it is employed almost everywhere in business and industries, occupations or professions.In the case of education, students are tested to gauge their range of learning, to find out if they understood what has been taught to them, per the curriculum instruction by their teachers.The common pen and paper or online testing has become the norm in education. Ready-made or “manufactured” tests, such as “select the best answer” or multiple choice test, have always been used in the classroom. Nothing wrong with that. Test results are annotated or recorded for various purposes. As it has always been, students’ test scores have become so important as if they are the ultimate predictors of students’ successful learning and teachers’ effective teaching.Not to discount the pen and paper test, there are other ways of testing, assessing and evaluating students’ learning. One is active classroom observation and participation, particularly graded individual classroom recitation. Asking to and answering correctly a question by a student is a form of testing. Observing a student helping another student solve a problem is testing. Giving essay-type tests in the classroom is another way of testing students’ critical thinking, thought-organization, mastery of the language and/or effective communication skills.Nowadays, students and teachers have been under a lot of pressure from all sides of the education spectrum. Much more so to our classroom teachers who are always instructed to assess or evaluate their students’ learning with the periodic and mandated state and federal standardized tests that take precedence or given importance over their individual creativity to teach. Hence, they are teaching their students to take the test. And, thus, their students’ test scores become the basis to evaluate their teaching performance? If their students did not do well in those tests, the educated professional teachers are to blame? I say, professional teachers or educators because they have passed through all the rigors of becoming a teacher/educator such as teacher training education and certification or recertification process.There are members of society who are quick to point their fingers on educators for students’ failures. Yes, teachers become the scapegoats for students’ failures. But, in all honesty, who is to blame for students’ failure to pass, learn and succeed in schools? Blaming the teachers for students’ failure to pass any kind of standardized testing is just absurd and counterproductive. Who wants their students to fail in class? Students are their responsibility in school. But that doesn’t mean they are responsible for everything in their students’ minds. They have a mind of their own. They have the will to learn or not what is being taught in school, the ability and capability to disrupt a class and, therefore, jeopardize the day’s learning for those who want to learn. What about the responsibility of that student, his or her family, other entities or agencies charged with helping to educate our students?The voice of education professionals and largest labor union of educators in America, the National Education Association, has launched a campaign to end “toxic testing” in an effort to end the abuse and overuse of high stakes standardized tests and reduce the amount of student and instructional time they consume. Lily Eskelsen Garcia, NEA past president, has said before that she would continue to push the president and Congress to completely overhaul the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or the No Child Left Behind program, and to end mandates that require states to administer outdated tests that aren’t aligned to school curricula. Furthermore, NEA has called on lawmakers “to repeal requirements that state standardized tests be used to evaluate educators, and instead implement real accountability in our public education.”Eskelsen Garcia noted that high stakes testing is corrupting what it means to teach and what it means to learn. “It’s corrupting the collaborative relationship we have with each other as we’re told to compete against each other—district against district, school against school, teacher against teacher, and support professionals against each other.” By the way, the current NEA president is Rebecca S. Pringle, a middle school science teacher, social justice warrior and defender of educator rights.As a family of educators (my wife Freny just retired in July as a veteran chemistry teacher for over two decades; daughter a high school counselor, and son, an IT instructor/theater-voice over actor , we believe it takes a village to raise and educate a child.

suffolknewsherald_2022_158,"Published 2:23 pm Sunday, February 27, 2022ByStaff ReportsTypically, we’d be skeptical of a proposal to eliminate Virginia’s sales tax on groceries. While crowing about cutting taxes, Richmond politicians would just find a creative, alternative way to take the same amount of money from taxpayers.This time is different.The proverbial perfect storm of circumstances has created a rare opportunity for the General Assembly to give citizens some sorely needed relief without cutting important government services or levying new taxes or fees elsewhere.Anyone who has been to the grocery store lately has felt the sting of soaring prices on everything from bread to milk and all of the nonessential items in between. The fundamental responsibility of feeding one’s family has pushed many people to the breaking point. Those who live paycheck to paycheck even in “good” times find themselves on the verge of food insecurity.Rapid inflation and lingering problems with supply chains show no signs of easing, so relief from high grocery bills is nowhere in sight.Meantime, the commonwealth of Virginia finds itself flush with cash — a record $2.6 million budget surplus, to be exact, thanks to federal COVID-19 stimulus money over the past couple of years and an economy that performed much better than expected during the global pandemic.New Gov. Glenn Youngkin campaigned on a promise of eliminating the state’s 2.5% grocery tax. He’s made it a priority during his first tango with the General Assembly, which, thanks to a Democratic majority in the Senate, has handed him more defeats than victories to date.This looks to be one of those rare issues where bipartisan consensus is possible. The Senate’s proposed budget would eliminate the state’s share of the grocery tax but preserve the 1% that currently goes to localities. That might be necessary unless lawmakers find a way to keep local governments whole. The budget passed by the Republican-majority House would eliminate the tax entirely.Not surprisingly, 76% of Virginia voters like the idea of relief from the grocery tax, according to a recent Christopher Newport University poll.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_13,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Los Angeles voters approved a ballot measure in November to address the city’s housing crisis, which has left tens of thousands of people with no place to live, many others priced out of the area, and prompted recently elected mayor, Karen Bass, to declare a state of emergency. The measure, known as United to House LA, or ULA, is designed to provide both immediate protections to vulnerable tenants and to fund longer-term housing solutions.A similar housing crisis rages across the country, with reports indicating that even places that used to be affordable no longer are. In Los Angeles, ULA’s rollout and implementation could become a model for addressing houselessness in other cities and states.Before Los Angeles enacted an eviction moratorium and rent freeze in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, dozens of evictions were filed each day. With these protections most likely expiring in 2023, this could be the reality again for thousands of households across the city.Nationwide, many are already living this reality. Communities across the country are facing rising rents, housing shortages and eviction rates approaching or even surpassing pre-pandemic levels.But in Los Angeles, ULA’s passage raises hope of preventing this looming crisis for people at risk of losing their homes by instituting new tenant protections, directly assisting vulnerable people and funding new affordable housing. Eviction is among the leading causes of houselessness across the country. Currently, few tenants in eviction proceedings are represented by a lawyer, reducing their ability to raise defenses or assert their rights. The ballot initiative works to solve this problem by dedicating funding to legal services for low-income households facing eviction.The measure will also help to prevent eviction cases from being brought in the first place by providing short-term rental assistance to vulnerable households, including rent-burdened older people and people living with disabilities, as well as other low-income households that fall behind on rent due to economic shocks.Over the longer term, the initiative is estimated to add over 26,000 new affordable homes over the next 10 years. Funded by a 4 to 5.5% tax on the sale of property worth more than $5 million, it will begin to address the dire shortage of affordable homes for the lowest-income households.The new housing that the initiative plans to create also avoids the common shortcomings of other housing programs by guaranteeing permanent affordability for low-income households. The affordability protections of many current housing subsidy programs are allowed to expire after a set period. In Los Angeles alone, about 6,000 homes will lose their affordability restrictions by 2026, giving landlords the option of raising rents and putting tenants at risk of displacement.Tenant protection, rental assistance, and more permanently affordable housing all address the root causes of houselessness. This holistic approach is a break from policies that harm those who already bear the brunt of the lack of affordable homes.In approving the measure, voters made the choice to create fairer cities where everyone, regardless of income, can have a place to call home, a choice that communities across the country should mimic.."

The same as they have so many times before.Our own Senators Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell have offered condolences with no actions… unnecessary lagniappe.Horrified and heartbroken by reports of the disgusting violence directed at innocent schoolkids in Uvalde, Texas.

How much can we rationalize another shooting, whether it is one person, like Omari Cryer — who was shot by federal marshals in Louisville on Friday May 20 — or the 21 people in Uvalde, Texas on May 24? We listen to politicians, we write letters, we protest, we cry and we ultimately become lulled back into accepting that lives in this country are collateral for political pandering. We’ve been completely desensitized to the gravity of loss.As a mother, I gave birth to a little person nine years ago. I fed him, clothed him, watched his first words, first steps and with each milestone, I m overwhelmed that I’m allowed to be his mother and to witness the preciousness of his growth into an interesting and good being. When I hug him before school, I expect that he will arrive there safely and be able to learn in an environment of love and comfort. Then, when events like the one in Uvalde happen, I’m paralyzed with fear about letting him get out of my sight. These children could have been my own. They are mine. I need to accept them as my own and feel the weight of their parents’ grief. I need to let that humble me so I can go forward knowing I cannot accept this as OK, as just another day in America. This is fucking heavy and heartbreaking.When I see the very anti-Christmas Christmas Cards like those of Rep. Lauren Boebert or Kentucky’s own Rep. Thomas Massie where children or young men are toting guns, I know that these are the children who have been taught by their parents that guns are holier than lives.Merry Christmas! ?ps.

It is happening in the bright light of morning in our schools, workplaces, restaurants and churches. There are no “white” knights, no good guys with guns. There is only the mythology of an America that never existed.

suffolknewsherald_2022_38,"Published 6:20 pm Tuesday, July 12, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Deborah DiCroceThis is the third year that we have been living with the coronavirus. Indeed, with the myriad mitigation vaccines and protocols, most of us have made peace with its disruptive forces.At the Hampton Roads Community Foundation, we have also gained powerful insights into the business of work — both ours and yours. Throughout the pandemic, for example, we have marveled at our technological infrastructure as it powers a transparent “open for business” presence to the public and our multiple stakeholders. And while today the doors of our physical offices have fully reopened, we have a newfound appreciation for the efficiency of technology in conducting foundation business and outreach.Where exactly the foundation lands in its deployment of the lessons learned on the technological front remains to be seen. For now, we are piloting a hybrid work arrangement that provides most staff with the flexibility of a two-day remote option within the work week. We also no longer presume that every meeting or event is “in person” and have become more strategic about setting the location — i.e., face-to-face or virtual — within the context of what best advances the individual activity’s goals and deliverables.Of course, what remains steadfast from our pre-COVID world is our commitment to providing superlative stewardship and service to our donors and other partners in philanthropy.That said, perhaps our most insightful lesson from the past two years is the vital role that child care plays in undergirding a thriving economy. On the one hand, this area is not new to the foundation. For example, some 15 years ago, the foundation was instrumental in launching Smart Beginnings networks across Hampton Roads with a goal of ensuring that every child in the region had access to high-quality early care and education.Years later, in 2016, we stood up Minus 9 to 5 in partnership with the M. Foscue Brock Institute for Community and Global Health at Eastern Virginia Medical School. Deploying a collective impact framework, this program focuses on conception through the child’s fifth birthday. Its vision is to ensure that each of the region’s families is “equipped and supported to raise children who are healthy, thriving, and ready to learn.”These efforts, as well as such statewide organizations as the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation and Elevate Early Education (E3 , have become informed advocates for the vital role that early education plays in providing equitable opportunities for a child’s future success in kindergarten and primary school.And then, in 2020, came the coronavirus, which closed most schools and day care facilities, often leaving parents to fend for themselves. The result forced mostly mothers to quit their jobs. It also left child care workers, who were already in short supply with hourly-rate pay below the minimum wage in most cases, to be laid off.Of course, the eureka moment here is that child care is a public as well as a social good and, as such, is a crucial piece of the infrastructure that advances the American economy. The pandemic uncovered this structural hole in our child care system at multiple levels, forcing us to find a more strategic answer to the questions of cost for one — i.e., what should quality child care cost — and, for another, who should pay for it.While there are no easy answers here, the questions are critical to a thriving economy. Public policymakers at all levels of government, private businesses and consumers all have a stake in them. So, too, does philanthropy, which needs to rethink its historically short-term programmatic approach to the child care crisis and find its role in helping to recognize the greater public good inherent in early care and education.Stay tuned.Deborah DiCroce is president and chief executive officer of the Hampton Roads Community Foundation.

suffolknewsherald_2022_271,"Published 5:43 pm Tuesday, September 13, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSuffolk Police Chief Al Chandler is new enough to his post that he doesn’t bear full or even primary responsibility for the rash of violent crime and death that has engulfed the city in 2022.In fact, we give him credit for several important actions that, in time, should help restore order.That said, the rookie chief must choose his words carefully during what is, by any measure, a crisis for Suffolk, especially its downtown area, which is on the cusp of greatness but could blow that potential if the current crime wave continues much longer.Chandler, a veteran lawman but new to his role as a community’s top cop, will learn quickly that leadership requires earning and maintaining the confidence of the citizenry you serve. That means owning a problem, not minimizing it.In a recent interview, Chandler seemed to downplay the surge in violent crime this year, when homicides are on pace to more than double the six recorded in each of the last two years.“We’ve always had gun violence as long as I’ve been here,” the chief told a reporter. “We are seeing it at a higher-than-normal level, definitely, but I guess I try to be careful not to sensationalize it because the more people hear about it, the more people look to hear about it. It’s the topic of the day.”He continued: “The numbers are higher, but it’s not earth-shattering. But, of course, any life that is lost is a tragedy.”Actually, the current crisis is quite shattering, both for the families of those killed or maimed and, significantly, the many law-abiding residents who are living in fear, scared to leave their homes lest they be robbed or walk into the path of random gunfire.We were struck during the last City Council meeting by the heartfelt words of a downtown resident, a recent transplant who sang Suffolk’s praises for attracting her here in the first place but added that safety concerns might soon drive her family out. She, like we, noted the less-than-comforting words from the city’s police chief, who’s essentially telling the citizenry to chill out.Chandler would be better served to accept the crisis for what it is and speak forthrightly to the community about solutions. He’s got much to talk about, including installation of portable cameras in hot spots like the intersection of Saratoga and West Washington streets, gunshot detection technology, and special cameras that capture images of the rear of vehicles. We commend his proactiveness.To his credit, he’s also been quick to talk candidly about challenges, including the enormous time officers are having to devote to mental health calls and a broader manpower shortage due to unfilled patrol slots.We encourage Chandler to continue to beat the drum for changes, likely by the General Assembly, in the way government and society manage the growing mental-health crisis. The current burden on police proves again that the state is treating mental health as a criminal problem, when the solution is better and more widely available treatment.The chief must also press the City Council for better wages, benefits and incentives for his officers in a difficult labor economy that shows no signs of waning.We continue to have high hopes for Chandler in his important role. Aligning his words with his actions will position him to not just endure the current crisis but make Suffolk safe again.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2022_80,"Published 6:15 pm Tuesday, May 24, 2022ByStaff ReportsBy Stephen D. HanerGuest columnistAttorney General Jason Miyares was partially successful in his efforts to challenge much of the secrecy shielding key data in Dominion Energy Virginia’s application to build its planned offshore wind facility, with some useful precedents set for the future.Just before the hearings on the application began last week, a State Corporation Commission hearing examiner accepted the Attorney General Office’s motion in part and rejected it in part. As a result, several portions of the SCC staff testimony have been filed again with dozens of previously redacted sections now open.Virginia law designates the attorney general as consumer counsel, charged with representing the interests of consumers, accomplished by a Consumer Counsel Section in the office. Senior Assistant Attorney General Meade Browder led this effort to bring more data into the sunlight.In conceding the point, Dominion proposed, and the hearing examiner accepted two broad categories where secrecy could continue: information from confidential internal presentations to the company’s board of directors, and information about individual third-party bids, contracts and prices.Pleas to Miyares’ predecessor to act were ignored. Miyares also recently pushed back on secrecy in an application from the other major electric utility, Appalachian Power Co. Perhaps pushing for transparency will become a regular part of the process, changing the insider culture of that courtroom and its cast of regular players.Despite the apparent retreat, Dominion had the major role in deciding which portions of the testimony to reopen, even going so far as to create a table of unnecessarily redacted portions by page and line number (see page 5 of its brief . In several other cases, however, information remains covered up simply because the motion from the attorney general did not specify its challenge by page and line number.That is part of the precedent the ruling seems to set. The items withheld may need to be challenged in greater specificity. It was also the case that the motion was filed very late in the process, months after the initial assertions of secrecy back in 2021, and while all the parties were busy preparing for the hearings and before Miyares took office in January. Dominion promised in a footnote:“In the future, the Company is open to Consumer Counsel reaching out to the Company informally, as Staff and other parties have done, to discuss concerns it may have with confidentiality markings prior to filing a Motion with the Commission. The Company commits to working in good faith with Consumer Counsel, Staff, or any party to work out any disputes of this sort prior to bringing motions to the Commission.”All the parties to the case, including representatives of non-government environmental groups and business groups, do have access to all this information. They sign non-disclosure pledges. But the general public is not a party to the case or the non-disclosure agreements, nor are media representatives. Why would a reporter want to sign an NDA?The attorney general did not challenge any of the company’s original designations of confidentiality from the beginning. He focused on later testimony from the SCC staff, which sought to maintain that secrecy in their own analysis and testimony. The result was documents riddled with exemptions.Several tables and charts outlining how various construction or operational problems would impact the cost of the project to consumers are also now visible, having been blacked out before.Much of importance remains off the record, hidden from the public, and it is not just board presentations or data about individual vendor bids. In the future, if the hearing officer’s ruling is precedent, the challenge to confidentiality should be made early on, when the utility cannot plead that it lacks time to respond.No formal news media organization objected to the secrecy or asked the SCC to review the utility’s assertions it needed the data hidden. Under the SCC rules, only the parties who sign the NDA can do that, and since they have the data for their own use, it has seldom happened.Stephen D.

leoweekly_2022_66,"Over the past11 years, I have worn many hats atBellarmine University. When I first stepped foot on campus, it was as an admissions counselor, tasked with recruiting the best and brightest to Kentucky’s premier private university. As a graduate student, I learned from world-class professors such as Kyle Barnett and Ruth Wagoner in the communication department. As an alumnus, I’ve served as a mentor to several students interested in the law as a profession through the alumni mentor program: one of the largest in the nation. And back when I was DJ Joe Dubb, I spun records at numerous school dances on the Belle of Louisville and the Muhammad Ali Center.One role that has eluded me at the School On The Hill, however, has been that of guest lecturer. Since I began my sexual assault prevention work in , I have longed to return to my alma mater to work with the current generation of Knights. Numerous Instagram messages to the school’s Greek organizations and a courtesy meeting with the Dean of Students were unsuccessful in opening this door. Luckily, Bellarmine offers a fantastic stage for those with ideas worth spreading:TEDxBellarmineU.This year’s installment of TEDxBellarmineU, which I will speak at on Feb. 18, is themed “Now What?” The event webpage provides a description of the program, stating:“Unprecedented changes have wrought havoc on our world, continually pushing and pulling humanity through challenging situations such as a global pandemic, racial tension, mass shootings, and extreme political division. In spite of these challenges, we must listen to one another and forge onward, seeking answers to quell turmoil with safety, unity, justice, and peace. From a wide range of experience, disciplines, and genres, our selected speakers will share their ideas on what to do now as we move forward.”With such a robust theme, what better place to discuss the next steps needed to advance sexual assault prevention?But #MeToo was more than just talk. It was about action as celebrity serial abusers such as Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and R. Kelly finally faced justice for their decades of inflicted abuse. Other celebrities such as Aziz Ansari and Louis C.K. would be “checked” for their questionable behavior. #MeToo even made it to some of the highest offices in the country as we tuned in to hear Dr. Christine Blasey Ford bravely recall her experiences with then Supreme Court hopeful, Brett Kavanaugh. From 2017-2019, no star shined brighter in the social justice sky than #MeToo.Until one day, it didn’t.It’s certainly not uncommon for social justice movements to cool off after a period of glowing in the spotlight. The 24-hour-news cycle delivers us stories at a pace that forces us to move to the course before we have a chance to fully digest what is currently on our plate.Most importantly, men must hold other men accountable. Be it correcting a friend that catcalls a woman walking down the street, or physically interfering when we see an assault in progress, we must intervene. Not being a bad actor yourself is no longer enough. We must take the tone-deaf hashtag of #NotAllMen, and work tirelessly until we can say #NotAnyMan.In Veritatis Amore.James J.

hawaiitribune_herald_2022_44,"If you listened closely, you could hear millions of Americans sighing with relief Tuesday night, as the results from Georgia’s runoff Senate election came in.It was close, but not too close. At night’s end, Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, bested opponent Herschel Walker, the Republican, by a margin of almost 3%.Warnock adds to the Democrats’ majority in the Senate, 51 seats to 49. That will help the party in some ways, although faced with a Republican House majority and the filibuster, real legislative progress over the next two years will be difficult.No. America’s deep breath wasn’t based on blue versus red politics, but on a firm understanding that Walker should never have been anywhere near a U.S. Senate seat. He may have been the worst major party Senate candidate in modern history.The former football star repeatedly demonstrated a lack of understanding of the basics of American constitutional government, committing gaffe after gaffe that revealed his utter lack of preparation for public office.He ducked interviews. On GOP-friendly Fox News, he needed assistance from Sen. Lindsey Graham and others. His personal challenges, involving alleged abuse of spouses and girlfriends and children, became common knowledge.Not even the most Walker-friendly Georgians could have believed that a U.S. Senate seat was the highest and best use of Walker’s abilities. Yet he still earned more than 1.7 million votes, an astonishing number. How did that happen?Part of the answer may be Walker’s celebrity — college football is a pretty big part of many Georgians’ lives. The more disturbing answer is the hundreds of thousands of Georgians who apparently cared more about the R next to Walker’s name than his character, experience or preparation for the job.The nation’s founders would be aghast. They believed character was immensely more important than party, which they resisted and feared.That idea has been turned on its head. Donald Trump is the worst example of partisanship overwhelming character and personal integrity, but Walker — endorsed by Trump — was in the running for the same trophy.Perhaps Tuesday’s results offer a reassuring sign that a majority of voters, albeit a slim majority, still believe that quality trumps party — whether it’s in Kansas, where Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won a second term in a state dominated by Republicans, or in Deep South Georgia, where many Republicans crossed party lines to vote for Warnock, the Democrat.Certainly, Republicans around the country should engage in rethinking its approach to these races, and others. That’s true in purely political terms: Republicans are losing voters in suburban places (see, for example, Johnson County, Kansas precisely because residents have grown tired of Trumpesque bluster, or Walker-like incompetence.It’s also true morally. Republicans had to have known of Walker’s problems, yet they nominated him anyway. It was deeply cynical, and dangerous.Congratulations to Sen. Warnock, whose election night promise to serve all Georgians was eloquent and welcome. The nation could use more people like him, and if Republicans push more people like Herschel Walker, the nation will get them.— The Kansas City StarRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track. Contractor Nan Inc. began construction on the project in Dec. 2023, following a design and planning process that started in 2017."
eugeneweekly_2022_35,"We ve got issues. Igot divorced last year. Cue standard response: Awkward platitude combined with a head nod, a move made famous by Tom Selleck’s character, Richard, onFriends. No, really, it’s OK. It’s mutual and amicable — a best-case scenario. I’ve perfected my response. Divorce has been common for decades, but as a society, we still don’t know what to make of it — or even how to respond. According to the CDC, there were nearly 750,000 divorces in the U.S. in 2021. That’s one and a half million divorced individuals — roughly the population of San Diego — in one year alone. I’ve been dismayed by the way people — family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances and even strangers — have responded to the news of my divorce. These responses become labels representing the tired view that divorce is tragic — shocking, shameful, utterly untouchable. Well, guess what? Divorce isn’t always bad. “I’m so sorry!” Yes, “feeling sorry” is a standard way to express concern — but it often comes across as pithy and pedestrian. For many couples, divorce isn’t a calamity. It’s an act of logic, reason — the courage of your convictions. Plus, haven’t we all figured this out by now? You have no need to be sorry if you weren’t responsible. “Oh, that’s so sad!” Yes, absolutely there’s an inherent sadness to divorce. It’s an ending, and closed doors invoke nostalgia, loss, regret. While I won’t go so far as to say that my divorce is “happy,” my life is now open to the possibility of happiness — a prospect lost long ago in my marriage. I’m not sad it’s over, I’m sad it didn’t work. And that’s a big difference. “Oh, dear.” Yes, I’m now that pitiful soul — the one who must check the box that says single, the one eating dinner alone on a Friday night, the one whose children have two homes. These losses are real and they sting, and this response feels like judgment camouflaged as concern. Our divorce was healthy, and we’re all OK — better, in fact. “What happened?” It’s complicated, so forgive me if I don’t want to give you a complex marital history in the produce aisle of the neighborhood organic market. This usually feels nosy. But maybe you’re struggling in your own marriage? Or maybe you really care and want to be a good listener? If that’s the case, let’s get together for coffee or a walk. I’d appreciate talking with a trusted listener. “No! I can’t believe it! You two seemed perfect together.” To the outside world, many couples appear happy or at least content, stable. Even in the age of social media, dirty laundry isn’t always aired. You can never presume to know what’s going on in someone else’s marriage. We were perfect together — for a while. And then we weren’t. “Want me to kick his ass?” No, not his fault. He didn’t wrong me, though I appreciate you being “on my side.” Here’s what you need to know: The moment we made the decision to divorce, the years of resentment and anger washed away. If you’re willing to kick his ass, would you also be willing to help me assemble my new furniture? “Did you try marriage counseling?” Yes, more than once. We didn’t just wake up one morning and decide to get divorced — it was a process long in the making. In counseling, we learned about love languages, communication styles, and working through conflicts. Through 16 years of life together, we learned that we weren’t each other’s best friend. “Welcome to the club.” This response makes it about you and your story — not mine. While I appreciate the reminder that I’m not alone in this experience, I don’t want to be part of this “club.” It’s not a game or a social spectacle. It’s my life. Cue Bon Jovi. “Congratulations!” This isn’t a celebration to me — I didn’t earn something, produce something, win something. We knew things weren’t working, and we made a difficult decision that has real ramifications. If you’re feeling so positive, consider inviting me to lunch or some other lighthearted outing. It’s good for me to stay busy and have support right now. To a large degree, I get it. We don’t always know what to say. But your response — intended or not — affects me. Language matters, always. So, what is a proper response? “Thanks for sharing that with me. How are you?” Perfect. You’re showing empathy, and, most important — you’re letting me guide the conversation. I recognize that I come from a position of privilege in writing this essay. Violence wasn’t involved in my marriage or my divorce, nor was scandal or heartbreak. So, I can take myself lightheartedly in writing this quippy (and hopefully helpful essay. But that doesn’t equate to me taking divorce lightly. Some divorces are devastating for all involved. You just don’t know. And that’s my point. Ask me how I feel about my divorce before putting it through your lens.

minnpost_2022_64,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In children’s and young adult (YA literature, representation matters. According toan article on the University of Wisconsin – Madison’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion website, the Cooperative Children’s Book Center (CCBC has found that the highest percentage of available books by African American authors or illustrators between 1985 and 2014 was 3.5%. The percentage was even lower for other communities of color in that same period.The CCBC has indexed every new book to track diversity trends in children’s and young adult literature since 1985. By looking atthe CCBC’s 2020 statistics, one finds that the percentage of books about Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC by U.S. publishers is approximately 30%, or 949 out of 3,115 books.Housed in the University of Wisconsin’s School of Education, the center annually publishesCCBC Choices, a list of 250 best children’s and YA books selected from upwards of 3,500 titles. The list highlights great books with emphasis on diverse voices. A quick search for the keywords “refugee” and “immigrant” in this 2021 publication yields 21 and 22 entries respectively — a theme that is of interest to me as a storyteller writing about the experiences of Somalis in Minnesota and beyond.The center’s reasons for promoting and supporting diverse children’s literature include validation and representation. The UW article notes that hashtags such as #WeNeedDiverseBooks and #OwnVoice were also born out of a need to change the status quo on two fronts: low percentage of books with BIPOC characters and misrepresentations of communities of color in literature. The #OwnVoice movement particularly advocates that “cultural insiders” write about BIPOC characters and tell their stories in their own voices.In the early 1990s, Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop penned an essay titled, “Mirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors.” The essay explores the importance of giving BIPOC children the opportunity to see themselves represented and reflected in literature. And since currently “more than half of K–12 public school students are children of color,” the need for representation in literature is real — and immediate.A piece on the PBS blog observes:“Seeing ourselves in literature is a gift. It is an empowering experience as a reader to see a protagonist who has a similar name to us and shares a similar background.”Reading brings joy and expands a child’s horizon. As is often said, literature teaches empathy. And the promotion of BIPOC literature is not a demotion of any other type of literature. Instead, it’s an assertion that these underrepresented voices are also an integral part of America’s literary tradition: E Pluribus Unum — Out of many, One.Abdullahi Janno is a storyteller and educator. He writes short stories both in Somali and English. He lives and works in St. Paul."
minnpost_2022_160,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Among the critical issues facing state lawmakers this session is the obligation to address severe workforce shortages in senior care. The state must take action or risk collapse of the sector throughout Minnesota.At the start of the year, 23,000 caregiving jobs – approximately 20 percent of all positions – remained vacant. The impact has been staggering. Seventy-eight percent of nursing homes and 35 percent of assisted living facilities continue to turn away seniors who need their services due to staffing constraints.Ten nursing homes in Minnesota have been forced to close their doors since the beginning of the pandemic, including three in 2022 alone. Just last week, county commissioners voted toclose Ramsey County Care Centerin Maplewood due to insurmountable operational costs. Ninety-five residents must be relocated. The impact of one closure is staggering, and dozens more face staffing crises that could lead to closure if lawmakers don’t act soon.Senior care communities are stuck in a vicious cycle. Inadequate state funding means we can’t raise wages to recruit and retain caregivers. We can’t find the workers we need to care for the growing number of seniors who need care. And that means we can’t admit new residents into our settings. Fewer residents mean senior care settings cannot generate the revenue needed to operate. This is a sector that is on the brink of collapse, and we need state lawmakers to act now, before it’s too late.A collapse of the senior care sector will have wide-ranging consequences; Minnesota seniors and their families will have difficulty accessing care they need when they need it in their home communities and hospitals may continue to experience backups as they struggle to find appropriate settings to discharge patients.You may be asking why senior care settings don’t just raise caregiver wages on their own, just as many other employers have done. The answer lies in the role lawmakers play in controlling funding for senior care. State legislators set both Medicaid and private pay rates for nursing homes. If wages are going to permanently increase, funding must come from the state.While funding for assisted living and other care options is different from nursing homes, the fundamental problem doesn’t change – the State of Minnesota is a critical partner in improving Medicaid reimbursement rates to support improved caregiver wages.Much of the legislative discussion has been focused on one-time “hero pay” bonuses for frontline workers. While a bonus is long overdue and would show appreciation for the hardworking caregivers who sacrificed much during the pandemic, we need permanent solutions to keep these workers, to recruit workers to fill open positions, and ultimately to ensure access to care for seniors.As of this year, one million Minnesotans are 65 or older, and 70 percent of them will require some form of senior care by 2030. We can either invest in our elderly loved ones and their caregivers or watch as this essential sector collapses and access to long-term care diminishes. We hope the choice is clear for Minnesota’s leadership.Patti Cullen is the CEO of Care Providers of Minnesota. Kari Thurlow is the CEO of LeadingAge Minnesota.

suffolknewsherald_2022_226,"Published 7:01 pm Friday, November 4, 2022BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAmerica pays tribute each Nov. 11 to the millions who have served in the defense of our country. Veterans Day is a necessary time of reflection and showering of appreciation on those who stand watch over and risk everything on behalf of our country.It is also an annual reminder that we should keep up our end of the bargain by offering more than just “thank you” in exchange for their service.We pay homage again in this space, days before an election that should serve as a bipartisan reminder of the freedoms American servicemen and women have worked selflessly to preserve.One of the issues that doesn’t receive much attention is the availability, quality and promptness of the care and support our country offers its veterans. It gets lip service from politicians left and right, saying many of the right things about their intentions.It is easy to express admiration for those who have served, but it has proved much less of a priority once leaders of both parties are elected. There is blame to go around.Much more attention is required. We have a relatively young generation of volunteer warriors who have been asked to sustain deployments that leave them with scars deeper than skin and bone that will last a lifetime. We also have an aging legion of Vietnam veterans, many of whom have already been failed enough by the nation.We hope everyone spends some time this week in reflection on the important service of our veterans and, more important, find at least one to personally thank.A good opportunity to honor deceased servicemen and women comes Wednesday, when volunteers are invited to place flags on grave sites at Albert G. Horton Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery on Milners Road off Lake Prince Drive. Student groups, including scout troops, will do the same at 3:30 p.m.We can never do enough to honor those who served for this country, but should never stop trying in tangible ways.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.
