minnpost_2020_111,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Thisstorywas produced byThe Hechinger Report,a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.Michelle Obama was once asked by People magazine what it was like to travel with Jill Biden on Air Force One.“Jill is … oftentimes she’s grading papers,” the former first lady answered. “Which is always funny, because I forget, ‘Oh yeah, you have a day job’… and she’s so diligent.”Grading those community college papers on Air Force One immersed Jill Biden in the dichotomy of the great American experiment, the inequality that permeates higher education. So, what will it mean to have a “first professor” as first lady in a new administrationA great deal. Jill Biden’s continuedcommitment to teachingis profoundly indicative of the quality of her approach to education. The best professors know that teaching is both an art and a science.Biden’s choice to teach community college students, who represent over 40 percent of all undergraduates in the U.S., is of particular significance. Unlike highly competitive selective colleges, where only 16 percent of students are from the bottom half of the economic strata, community collegeshave almost 60 percent from the bottom half.Teachers’ aspirations for their students’ achievements are balanced by the lives of the students in front of them. The best faculty combine personal teaching experience with research-based knowledge.This deep well of knowledge and experience will heighten the impact of a “first professor” in the White House, in this era of ever-widening income gaps between those with a college education and those without.Racial, ethnic and gender inequities have all been exacerbated by the impact of the pandemic. Before, many community college students wove together minimum-wage work with college, studying to be nurses and EMTs, retail managers and computer system technicians.Now, community colleges are hemorrhaging students whose jobs are gone, and whose families are eating from food banks or being evicted from their homes. Too many are struggling to keep up with online classes, using cell phones as their only digital devices.They are often focused on obtaining the skills necessary to secure near-term jobs to support themselves and their families, rather than to embark on stable, promising careers.Community colleges have been called “the people’s colleges.” Their students typically attend college in their hometowns, and over half work more than 20 hours each week, balancing school with the financial demands of making a living. Many are parents.To heal a divided nation, having a first lady telling the truth about the realities of their lives is a critical first step. To work with community college students is to encounter an America where the hope for opportunity is still strong, but the reality is slipping away.Stark funding disparitiesexist in higher education. In 2015, public subsidies, not including real estate tax exemptions, totaled $105,000 per full-time student atPrinceton University,and just $2,400 atEssex County College,the two-year school an hour up the highway.Jill Biden understands this. She’s written op-eds, given keynote addresses, saluted graduates, and honored scholars to underline the undeniable power of a great education to transform individual lives. Earlier this month, shepledged her supportfor free community colleges.And yet it is reading student essays from her English class that provides her deep understanding about resurrecting the promise of education as a pathway to economic security.She will know the names and faces of students who have lost minimum-wage jobs or dropped her class because they can no longer afford child care.She will understand the student who is the first in his family to go to college, amid derision from friends in his neighborhood about his stack of books. She will continue being a tireless advocate for education and education equity.She’ll be looking to strengthen pathways — and create new ones — to link education with economic prosperity, like theWorkforce Partnership Initiative of the Business Roundtable,with CEOS of leading businesses partnering with local colleges and universities to prepare students for a 21st-century workplace.She’shighlighted these programsat a time when community colleges across the country are working in new ways to create partnerships between education and business that are aimed at increasing the diversity of U.S. employees in stable, well-paying jobs.In New York, theNew York Jobs CEO Councilis bringing business, education and the community together to equip New Yorkers for the jobs of tomorrow, with a goal of hiring 100,000, including 25,000 from the City University of New York.Jill Biden understands using education as a strategic initiative to create and sustain a middle class, and that it will take, as political scientistRogers Smithwrites, “a broad coalition in support of a more egalitarian and inclusive vision of America.”That is the vision of a revitalized educational system that is possible with Jill Biden in the White House, someone who understands how community colleges can fit into this picture — and who is still grading her students’ papers.Gail Mellow is president emeritus of LaGuardia Community College of the City University of New York and executive director of the New York Jobs CEO Council."

minnpost_2020_21,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the legislative and campaign seasons collide this year, the politics that are always part of the process have had an increasingly intrusive role in governing. Some of this is a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to call the Legislature back repeatedly. But this is also an unintended consequence of how our state-level legislative bodies are organized in Minnesota.During campaign season, partisanship, competition, and differing views of governance are appropriate – campaigns are contests, after all. In November voters will go to the polls and decide which candidates will win, but most important: who will control the State House and Senate.There are a lot of benefits in winning a majority, which is why the parties work so hard to achieve that goal. However, the infrastructure that encourages continued partisanship and division after the polls close is a problem. The Minnesota Legislature should take three steps to dismantle the structural partisanship that currently exists at the Capitol. How do we fix the gridlock In part, we fix the rules and traditions that create the “winner take all” system.First, integrate legislators’ offices. Currently offices are segregated by body and party. At the start of each biennium, offices are distributed based on seniority – the majority members pick within their space, and the minority within theirs. Instead of encouraging that separation, we need more opportunities for members to connect informally and build relationships – say hello in the hall, make small talk while waiting for the microwave, share photos of their kids. The floors and wings that are currently divided should be mixed up and offices be picked by seniority across the chamber, not solely within caucuses.Or, as a more extreme fix, at the start of the 2021 session, do a lottery for offices that will become the permanent home base for that district moving forward – even if the person holding the seat changes, the office location would stay the same.Second, it’s time to depoliticize the staff. Campaigning is about activism and winning. Legislating is about governing and coalition building. As long as the same people are doing jobs supporting both goals, with the opportunity to use one as a vehicle to advance the other, the culture at the Capitol isn’t going to get any better. Governing should not be about winning – or worse, obstructionism with the intent of denying the other side a win. Fiscal and legal staff are already nonpartisan, so reclassify committee administrators, legislative assistants, constituent services, and research to match.Third, reform the committees. Instead of having all committees chaired by members of the majority party, have them co-chaired by members of the majority and minority. This would mean the co-chairs trade holding the gavel and running the meetings — much as members of conference committees do — and would share the responsibility of determining which bills get hearings. Having co-chairs and a nonpartisan committee administrator would also ensure that any omnibus bills coming out of committee would be created with input from members of both parties. (This move in and of itself could drastically reduce the number of amendments being proposed from the floor. Much has been talked about how this year’s bonding bill has been held up by the minority in the House. From my perspective, I’m not surprised. The 60% supermajority is the only issue on the agenda this year that requires the minority caucus’ participation and approval to pass. When you give a caucus one place to participate, a chair at only one table so to speak, of course they’re going to use it. When you only have one card to play, you make it count.The only detriment in being in the minority party should be that you have to work harder to get members to vote for your ideas. But right now the structure in both chambers works against too many elected members and their constituents, just because they were elected to the minority.A pandemic situation can’t be changed. But the structural issues that add to the dysfunction can. Even casual observers of the “inside baseball” inner workings at the Capitol know that there’s way too much campaigning that’s conflicting with governing. Let’s fix the system. Let’s reform the infrastructure to support a focus on governing for the people of Minnesota, and minimize the campaigning at the Capitol.Shannon Watson serves as the director of public affairs at the Saint Paul Area Chamber of Commerce and is the founder of Definitely Someday. Watson worked on campaigns on both sides of the aisle for 20-plus years, as well as the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Minnesota Senate.

minnpost_2020_238,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesota is among the worst states in the country when it comes to racial disparities. Our state has the second largest racial income disparity in the country, and the Black poverty rate in the Twin Cities metro is four times higher than the white poverty rate. Our state’s racial disparities in high school graduation rates are the worst in the nation.These inequities did not occur randomly but are due to systemic racism. There’s been too little attention focused on the discouraging reality that the pandemic is compounding these disparities. The four ZIP codes in the metro with the highest COVID-19 rates have populations that are at least 45 percent people of color. This is not surprising because in the Twin Cities, BIPOC households disproportionately live in pollution hot spots. A recent Harvard study demonstrated that increases in pollution correlate with high infection rates for COVID-19. BIPOC workers also tend to work in industries that bring them in close contact with the virus.Any recovery effort must prioritize concrete and measurable investments in the communities most affected by the economic downturn. Given the lack of racial diversity in the construction and electric utility industries, and the historical tendency to prioritize expediency in crisis situations, any economic development ambitions of the PUC will not adequately benefit BIPOC Minnesotans without explicit and diligent intervention.The PUC asked Xcel and other utilities to provide lists of projects that would provide utility system benefits, reduce greenhouse gases and other air pollution, and grow jobs. The utilities will provide details on the first of these projects, those that can begin in 2021, by today, Sept. 15. If the PUC simply fast-tracks projects without adopting thoughtful, ambitious and specific criteria for where and how capital is dispensed, it will not support economic recovery for BIPOC communities but instead risks deepening existing racialized disparities.We must ensure that Minnesota’s most marginalized communities are not bypassed by an approach to economic development that ignores the history of BIPOC communities and our current needs in the economic downturn.Roxxanne O’Brien is the co-founder of Community Members for Environmental Justice.

On the mainland, employers and employees alike are shaking their heads at how easy the transition has been for people commuting from home to office every day and instead working from home.Zoom communications have almost replaced the need to have two cars in a household or a yearly pass on the commuter train. Plus, working from home is good for the environment.Hawaii’s leaders need to make a concerted effort to recruit more individuals and families to leave the mainland and settle in Hawaii. Also, Hawaii’s educated youth would have reasons to remain here, raise their families here, support the local economies, and not have to leave their parents.LeAnn McGranahanPapaaloaDowntown revitalizationRevitalizing downtown Hilo with an improvement district is a great idea.Taxing local residents to shop there with parking meters is a really bad idea. Can’t you do better than that?My personal story was I used to try very hard to patronize downtown businesses. Then I got a $20 parking ticket and never went back again.They got smart and took out the meters, but it was too late.There is a proposal to turn a small section of downtown Hilo into the first phase of a replacement for the International Marketplace in Waikiki. That tourist shopping niche was replaced by upscale shopping for the super rich.Putting small local kiosks on both sides of each businesses front door is innovative and could make it a must-go sightseeing adventure. Requiring local crafts and a part-time opening schedule to fit tour bus and cruise ships could employ hundreds of our kupuna.While being very creative, it’s not really thinking out-of-the-box. Visitors to Virginia City, Nevada, enjoy a replica gold-mining town. Visitors to Williamsburg, Virginia, can interact with the Civil War. There are dozens and dozens of examples. Let’s be one of them!They had to work to create their niche, but we have aloha, and our friendly, honest and wonderful people sell themselves!Face it, downtown improvement districts are across the entire country, and very few have the advantage that we do! Right now, we have the time to put everything in place before our 7.5 million annual visitors return. We need to be a desirable stop for the million visitors who visit the No. 1 rated national park in the country!Get to work.Michael Xavier MamczarzKurtistownMaunakeaMaunakea is an elemental part of the primordial universe, as Hawaiians know.

minnpost_2020_146,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In the wake of George Floyd’s tragic killing, Minnesotans are searching for answers and demanding change. As we mourn the loss of a neighbor, we also remember Jamar Clark, Philando Castile, and countless other black men and women across this country who have lost their lives to police violence.As protests and unrest rock our community, we must not only advocate for responses to this horrific incident, but also address larger questions: How will policymakers and lawyers lead the way for real systemic change How will our current and future leaders move beyond just thoughts and prayers alone Where do we, as individuals, standWith the weight of our institutional namesakes, our students, alumni, and all who entrust our schools to lead, we applaud those who have risen up to advocate for justice and to demand that more action be taken. For our Twin Cities community to thrive, we cannot remain silent or complacent in the face of such blatant injustice.As legal and public policy educators we insist on evidence-based decision-making and advocate for the rule of law. We, however, need no more evidence or jurisprudence to convince us that the death of George Floyd was unnecessary and wrong. It was a fundamental betrayal of the public trust. We fervently hope that the fatal, race-related violence against an unarmed African-American at the hands of the police will never happen again. Sadly, the facts suggest it will.Although this is a national problem, solutions must come from state and local communities. To be sure, the swift action by Mayor Jacob Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo in terminating the four police officers most closely involved in the death of Floyd was an important first step. Then another critical step was taken when fired police officer Derek Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter by Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. But, ultimately, we will all need to do more.Change often requires agitation and always requires hard work. All institutions must make the necessarystructural changes to confront racism and race-based violence, whether intentional or unconscious. Yes, more officers should be held to account for killing unarmed people of color, but we also need new legislation, new policies, new training, and fundamentally new organizational cultures to begin to fix what lies beneath and progress toward true justice.Over half a century ago Hubert Humphrey offered us wisdom that seems particularly resonant today:If there is dissatisfaction with the status quo, good. If there is ferment, so much the better. If there is restlessness, I am pleased. Then let there be ideas, and hard thought, and hard work.Despite the current pain and anger, we firmly believe that the path forward will require citizens to learn from each other and from experts, to talk honestly and openly, to listen with open minds, and, ultimately, to reshape existing policies, practices, and perspectives.Minnesotans must channel our outrage into action andinsist on a world in which safety and human rights are not dependent on one’s race or ethnicity.We commit and rededicate ourselves to preparing our next generation of legal and public policy practitioners who will challenge racist and dysfunctional systems and devote their professional lives to the pursuit of justice and civil rights forallof society.As Minnesota’s flagship law and public affairs schools, we will double down on our responsibility to serve and support the Twin Cities community — through our clinics, courses, internships, policy engagement, and scholarship. We need new voices and new partnerships, and we need them now.We are deans of two of the nation’s pre-eminent law schools and graduate schools of public affairs; a black man and a white woman. Both Minnesotans and both Minneapolitans. Both heartsick, but also both more determined than ever in our quest to ignite change and advance justice in our troubled community and nation.Garry W.

suffolknewsherald_2020_92,"Published 11:09 pm Friday, June 12, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Troy Cooper“I see you. I hear you. And I will fight for you.”Being in my 40s, I grew up in the ’90s. That was a time when the young black male was the most feared profile you could have in this world. Though I lived in a pretty rural area, got pretty good grades in school, and hadn’t really even seen hard drugs in my young life, I was seen by many as an urban, ignorant, violent threat.In college, I had those moments all young black men had. The proprietor of a store eyeballing you the whole time you patronized their store. People rolling up their windows when they saw you walking past their car. Even people crossing the street to avoid passing you in broad daylight. And you could never really tell if these incidents were actually racially motivated or if it just felt that way.As I got older, I developed a way of thinking about racism that has kept me in good stead, philosophically and emotionally. I chose to see racism as a disability. After all, a disability is something that prevents you from doing things and diminishes your quality of life. Being racist essentially means you choose to prevent yourself from getting to know people as individuals, by assuming certain characteristics are present in them, based purely on race. And limiting oneself in that way greatly diminishes the quality of a person’s life. Isn’t that a disability? So, I truly came to feel bad for people that were racist. They limit themselves needlessly.But even with my way of viewing racism, I still had to come to accept certain things about my reality. Racism will always exist. And it will always be just our cause to take up in life.But some 30 years later, I attended a small protest on College Drive in response to the tragic and needless death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis, Minn. As I shot photos among the still-assembling protesters, I saw a young woman — not of my race, mind you — spring from the sunroof of a car and yell out a common rallying cry during this crisis, “I see you. I hear you. And I will fight for you.” The words rang out pure and clear. They seemed to really resonate with me at that moment.In that moment, I couldn’t help but ask myself, would someone have spoken out so freely and assertively against racial injustice back in the ’90s? Given the climate at the time, I’m sad to say probably not. Our rage over injustice felt largely unnoticed back then.So if we’re trying to measure our progress as a society in ending racial injustice, I feel like eyes are opening. This isn’t just black people’s fight anymore. The black community is not going through this alone. People of all races are grabbing the yoke with us and plowing in the right direction. That makes the young black man in me feel less alone in the fight.In the end though, systems can be put into place with the best of intentions but, sadly, it is individuals that operate within it. And the reality is that there are individuals who still exist having been raised in the hidden and not-so-hidden fields of racism. And if racism is a disability, there is no test to detect it. The main problem with that is it goes undetected until it’s far too late and someone else dies.But, I find hope because I truly believe those fields that cultivate racism are significantly smaller than when I was younger. I want to believe that with every fiber of my being, for the sake of my nieces and all the generations to follow.It may be hard to see the good taking place right now. But the fact that more people from all walks of life are standing up for justice that previously kept silent or turned a blind eye and deaf ear are steps in the right direction. This plugged-in, social media-obsessed society does have the huge silver lining of bringing injustice right into everyone’s home and consciousness with irrefutable hi-def clarity. People witnessed nine undeniable minutes of George Floyd’s death. Nothing is left up to grainy, split-second interpretation.Racism can’t be completely stamped out. That’s just the world we live in. But racist actions can be deemed so unacceptable by the system and by all races, that the actions we all witnessed in Minnesota could actually be stamped out for good. That’s progress, isn’t it?Troy Cooper is a Suffolk resident, former News-Herald designer, and current designer of Suffolk Living Magazine.

minnpost_2020_99,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As one who has spent years as a communications practitioner, including time as a speechwriter for a respected Clinton administration Cabinet secretary, I was delighted to see that Joe Biden has become the first president-elect to name (highly qualified women to all of his communications leadership posts.This makes sense on lots of fronts,including the fact that although women hold a majority of jobs in the public relations/communications field, comparatively few females are found in the very top levels in the industry.No matter if the organization is the White House or a family-run store.But what nagged at me was some of the social media commentary that followed the appointments, commentary in the vein of, “Well, things are going to be a whole, whole lot shinier, happier and professional on the White House communications front now that women will be calling all the shots.”Which, to be fair, just might be true. We know thatscience has established a number of areas where women can out-perform men, including scoring on intelligence tests, dealing with pain and reining in narcissistic tendencies.All of Biden’s appointees (including Jen Psaki, incoming White House press secretary and a former State Department press secretary enjoy good reputations among journalists as well as political operatives. Then again, it might not be that all of the White House communications offices will be models of complete humanity and efficiency under all-female leadership. Remember that three of President Trump’s four press secretaries have been women. Appraisals of their qualifications and work by journalists, communications professionals and a large portion of the American public have been anything but positive.And while it doesn’t require explanation that women need to be much better represented in a good many professions and trades, I don’t think it helps women if they are only considered saviors from the realms of the gods, here to kick serious ass and achieve nothing but tremendous, history-making deeds. Such thinking is nearly as damaging as believing that any woman who gets a great job in a male-dominated field either must have slept her way there or had an influential parent call favors in, as opposed to getting the position through hard work, possible sacrifice and traversing maddening gender hurdles.At times like this, especially when people worldwide are excited that the United States will at last have a woman vice president (as well as treasury secretary , it might be wise to think aboutthat ad from the 1980s, the one that showed an immaculately coiffed woman with nearly superhuman qualities,able to work long hours at an executive job and still come home to cook the bacon and “never let her man forget he’s a man.” I’m one who still hopes we’ll one day get beyond expecting so much of all women.These women suffered as a result, with some of the suffering self-inflicted, and some foisted upon them by a system that remains far from gender neutral in administering employment justice. Sarah Palin, who was named John McCain’s running mate in 2008 when she only had served as Alaska’s governor for about 19 months, is one of the most notorious of these examples.McCain later said he regretted the Palin choice for a number of reasons,including the fact that she just wasn’t qualified for such a role.Kim Campbell, who served as Canada’s first female prime minister for five months in 1993, was once thought a brilliant star with supernova capabilities in Canadian politics. Her tenure was marked by some accomplishments and some troubles that many have said were not all her fault. Still,there is wide consensus that she was one of the weakest of Canada’s prime ministers.So, while I wish Biden’s female appointees success, I won’t expect every one of them to turn Washington into a Capital Lotusland. It would be wonderful if they don’t experience the unfair difficulties that have plagued other women who were first or near-first in their fields. And I’m hoping that all of them prove true these words from Eleanor Roosevelt: “A woman is like a tea bag. You never know how strong it is until it’s in hot water.”MaryStanik, a writer and public-relations professional, recently moved from St. Paul to Arizona.

eugeneweekly_2020_27,"We ve got issues. The University of Oregon is on the verge of losing one of its only professors who studies race and the criminal justice system within a social justice framework. Ironically, this is happening at a historic moment of national crisis, where anti-Black violence is not only rampant but newly visible, where multi-racial coalitions all across the nation are demanding justice, and where leading scholar-activists have an enormous role to play in helping us understand a way forward. Professor Michael Hames-García is a national leader in the study of race, incarceration and policing. He has been teaching and institution building at the UO since 2005, and he has earned two of the UO’s most prestigious research and teaching excellence awards. Currently, he is being recruited by another esteemed university, but the UO administration has decided they will not match Hames-Garcia’s outside offer. They claim this is because of the budgetary crisis. Yet, we see where their financial priorities rest: an unnecessary police force, million-dollar jumbotrons, massive stadiums, a president’s exorbitant salary and publicly-funded assets (including his housing and transportation and new residence halls. If the UO administration is truly invested in racial justice, when might we expect this value to match their practices? Might the active retention of a leading scholar of race, incarceration and policing — at this historical moment — be a good start? The UO Makes Excuses and Undermines Activist Scholars of Color We often hear white faculty and administrators at the UO say that the UO can’t recruit and retain top ranking faculty of color because they don’t want to live in Oregon. The irony of this statement is that Oregon is Hames-García’s home. This is where he grew up, this is where his extended family currently lives, and this is where he would continue to maintain his active commitments to community development. He will be forced to split his time between a job in one state and his life’s work in another precisely because the UO administration refuses to admit that its commitments to racial justice, at this historical moment, remain thin. They are rhetorical gestures that allow the administration to claim to value racial justice at the same time that they actively undermine justice in practice. Hames-García’s case is an example of how “the academy” does not necessarily have to be considered an ivory tower apart from “the street.” In direct connection with social justice movements around the world, Hames-García has invested decades of teaching, research and service, working to better understand and transform the criminal justice system in the very place he lives. He continues to serve on the Eugene Police Civilian Review Board in addition to past and current work with Sponsors Transitional Home and Social Services, Oregon State Correctional Institution at Salem, and a long list of community, labor and student activist groups committed to social justice. He is a community leader and major force for transformative change here in Oregon. Some of us have been at the UO for decades. Our perspective is informed by previous moments where the “revolving door” for faculty of color at the UO resulted in an endless stream of departures. For a brief period, from 2008 to 2016, we built a strong body of faculty of color through strategic recruitment and retention efforts. In 2016, the UO lost a Black woman tenure-track faculty member who actually took a salary cut to join another university rather than endure the racist indignities in her department. In the past few years we have seen another exodus of Black faculty from the UO, including the only Black woman full professor in the College of Arts and Sciences. We have also seen faculty of color consistently diminished, used as tokens, then removed when they don’t meet the administration’s goals for either optics or compliance to meaningless program building. Black women faculty on this campus are expected to toe the university line of racial harmony, and when they speak out, they pay dearly and often publicly. In 2002, the university signed a racial discrimination settlement, known as the Joe Wade settlement agreement, that established a number of affirmative action requirements, among them a promise to conduct exit interviews of all faculty and staff of color leaving the UO. To this date, those exit interviews do not happen. Many faculty of color have left in just the past five years, so many that we have lost count, and we have yet to see university accountability measures that take stock of why these faculty left and what their experiences were. Faculty of color have nowhere to go with complaints of racial bias, hostility or discrimination. We used to have an Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity. At a time when a large group of faculty of color reported a systematic experience of racialized harm by a white dean, the university fired the affirmative action officer overseeing the complaints. Notably, that officer was the only woman of color to ever hold that position. She also happened to have made comments that sounded supportive of the faculty union. Once fired, faculty of color were diverted to a newly restructured system of “Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance,” which was overseen by a hand-picked former UO law school graduate. Does any of this sound familiar? Show, Don’t Tell: Support and Retain Social Justice Scholars at the UO The UO administration is hand-picked with people who refuse to implement meaningful change, and the voices of faculty of color continue to be minimized. The College of Arts and Sciences dean’s office has only been led by white men and women. In at least the past 20 years, there have been zero deans of color at any rank, and almost no staff of color in the CAS administration office. Hames-García has certainly used his voice and First Amendment right to raise criticisms of the UO administration. He has also been instrumental in creating an intellectual and supportive community for the faculty of color who have remained here. This cadre of faculty of color are on the front lines, educating students about systematic racism and validating and supporting students of color to help them thrive despite the challenges they endure at a predominantly white university. Hames-García’s departure will leave a gaping hole in the faculty of color community, and the community of color more broadly. We urge the UO administration to, as the saying goes, put its money where its mouth is. We have had enough lip service, with a thousand empty proclamations of support without willingness to step up when the moment calls for it.

He is a resource that all UO students and our state desperately need.

minnpost_2020_4,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs figures are both sobering and explanatory. Officially, 13 percent of Blacks were unemployed as compared to 7 percent of whites. Twenty-five percent of Black teenagers as compared to 14 percent whites.A few weeks ago a problem waiting to happen actually did. Until Aug. 26, 2020, Minneapolis had escaped what many major U.S. cities had not until then — the trashing or a partial trashing of its high rent district. Rebellions, riots, looting and vandalism going back to the 1960s had never taken place downtown. But any observant and knowledgeable downtown resident could see it coming. Exactly the day before I thought, maybe, it could be avoided. A larger Mad Dads contingent, a Black civilian law-and-order operation, in front of the U.S. Bank building on Nicollet Mall gave cause for a bit of optimism; less provocative than the police.For more than a month growing numbers of young Black people were hanging out on the Mall, first in front of Dayton’s. About two weeks later they migrated a block away to the US Bank sidewalk, which is more accommodating to larger groups. So striking about them is that they were there because they had nothing to do — nothing. It was all so evident. If Minnesota has one of the highest racial disparities in the U.S., I suspect Black teenage unemployment is even higher than the national rate.I arrived at Ninth Street and Nicollet Mall about 20 minutes after the tragic suicide in front of the U.S. Bank building between Ninth and Eighth. Yellow police tape confined crowds a block away on both sides of the suicide scene. Some in the crowd I was in, in front of the Target store, began to get rowdy as rumors spread amongst their so-called “smart phones” alleging another police killing of a Black man — the suicide victim. When the police regrouped to protect the store’s entrance, that only increased tensions. Water bottles began to fly, then firecrackers. I sought refuge, not knowing if I could tell the difference between firecrackers and gunfire. As the crowd moved northward on Nicollet Mall, I decided to leave. Less than an hour later at home four blocks away, I began to get messages about what was taking place and saw the TV images I had feared.As an eyewitness to what began to unfold and a four-decade-old participant in anti-police brutality protests, I assuredly say that the looting and vandalism — and that’s solely what it was — had nothing to do in any way with protests against police brutality. It was a mini-rebellion of the alienated dispossessed. There was nothing inherently progressive about it. To claim so — as the person who spray painted “keep looting” on the bus stop panel in front of Saks Off Fifth — is to lower the bar for what disciplined mass anti-police brutality protests mean.Local ruling elites thought that they could confine the unemployment problem to majority Black neighborhoods like the north side and elsewhere. Bad behavior could be ignored as long as it wasn’t in “my backyard.” Increasingly, Black youth, like others, sought to come up for air in the pandemic — from having been confined to spaces where they could be forgotten about. A few blocks in the now desolated downtown became their playground — to challenge the state sanctioned “social distancing.” If a crowd could do the same in downtown Sturgis, S.D., why not closer to homeTo view what happened simply through a racial lens is easy because it doesn’t address the more difficult problem. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is quoted these days about looting, “the cry of the unheard.” Forgotten and ignored is something else he said, repeatedly in the last year of his life. Reflecting back on the legislative gains of the movement he led, and what those hard-won achievements had not brought about, birthed an epiphany: for there to be racial equality in the U.S., he concluded, “a radical redistribution of economic and political power” was needed. Again, not a one-off comment.We’ll never know if the civil rights leader fully understood what that meant. But is there any doubt about the continuing validity of his insight Does anyone believe the jobs crisis that disproportionately penalizes workers in black skin will be solved with anything less than such a radical transformation of society It’s the discussion ruling elites and their governing enablers avoid. Not to even mention another very visible and related phenomenon on Nicollet Mall — the disproportionate number of the homeless who are Black. And the eviction crisis is just beginning.A kind of whack-a-mole game is now playing itself out on the block where the suicide took place, between the Mad Dads in collaboration with the police, and the unemployed youth. The latter are trying, inch by inch, to reoccupy the space they appropriated for themselves while the two other parties are trying, Minnesota-nice-like, to disperse them. How successful either party will be is up for grabs. But to assume that something like what happened on Aug. 26 won’t happen again, if not there, then elsewhere, is to be in deep denial.August H.

minnpost_2020_76,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As is true of most white Twin Citians, and Minnesotans in general, really, I first learned about copper sulfide mining risks in Minnesota through the lens of protecting theBoundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, a place that I have enjoyed many times. That was, and is, an important objective for environmentalists and outdoor enthusiasts. Well, and for me, too.The more I studied the issue, though, the more I came to appreciate that the Boundary Waters and the Rainy River watershed, which would be affected by the Twin Metals mine proposal, were only part of the story. The rest of the story — the St. Louis River watershed, Lake Superior, and the Lake Superior Chippewa Bands — was receiving short shrift by many people, including policymakers, regulators, the media, and the public, including some environmentalists, in what seemed like a devil-take-the-hindmost approach.The proposed PolyMet open pit sulfide mine near Hoyt Lakes has received the necessary permits from theMinnesota Department of Natural Resourcesto begin mining on the headwaters of the St. Louis River, a major tributary to Lake Superior. It is only because of the dogged efforts of the Ojibwe Bands and environmental organizations such as theMinnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy,WaterLegacy, and theFriends of the Boundary Waters Wildernessthat litigation in the Minnesota Court of Appeals has stayed these permits for the mine and sent the case back to the DNR for a “contested case” proceeding. PolyMet and the DNR have taken the Court of Appeals decision to the Minnesota Supreme Court to reinstate the permits, skipping the contested case; oral arguments will take place there in coming months.If the appeals by the Minnesota DNR and PolyMet succeed, major obstacles to building the mine will be removed. If the Ojibwe and the environmental organizations prevail, the permits will be sent back to the DNR and the Office of Administrative Hearings for the contested case.In a contested case, the DNR would have to produce evidence and stand for examination under oath about its decision to issue the permits. Moreover, the parties opposing the permits would have a chance to make the case to an administrative law judge, who is not part of the DNR, as to why digging the mine and storing the tailings is improvident and dangerous. Importantly, this would all be done publicly, with a record created and testimony under oath, with the opportunity of the parties to employ the great engine of truth: cross examination.Scoping an environmental impact statement is really asking the question:What do we need to worry about In PolyMet’s case, the EIS was scoped by the DNR and the Army Corps of Engineers. Any good advocate will tell you that it is much easier to get the answer you want when you get to ask the question.The final EIS executive summary saysthat the Bois Forte, Grand Portage, and Fond du Lac Ojibwe Bands participated in the EIS, but they didn’t participate in the scoping phase of it.Absent from the scope of the PolyMet EIS was a consideration of the effect of a catastrophic failure of the deferred-maintenance bankrupt LTV tailings dam that PolyMet wants to use. We know that three “upstream” tailings dams of the type at the LTV site have failed spectacularly in the last half-a-dozen years: two in Brazil, and one in British Columbia. (There are more, really, but these are the big ones. Consultants to PolyMet and the DNR did design or consulting work on two of the three dams that failed. If there were a contested case hearing, the public would learn more about the risks inherent in this type of mine tailings storage.When they did get a seat at the table, the Ojibwe Bands’ scientists complained vigorously about the limited scope of the proposed EIS, and its failure to address in a direct the way the consequences, environmental and financial, of a catastrophic tailings dam failure, especially to the Bands.Another consultant to the DNR offered the opinion thatit was a question of when, not if, the dam would fail, but the DNR dismissed it.The use of the bankrupt LTV crushing plant and tailings dam and basin wascritical to the economics of the PolyMet proposal, according to Edison Investment, an advisor to PolyMet.Under rules of the Minnesota Environmental Quality Board, an EIS must ordinarily consider alternatives with less environmental impact. But the DNR and Corps said this in theirscoping document:An alternative processing plant site may not be feasible or achievable in the time frame of the project.That’s a remarkably facile statement.When you look at the destruction of persons, property, the environment, and livelihoods in places like British Columbia and Brazil when tailings dams have failed, you can understand why the DNR and PolyMet are loath to bring it up.Questions for a contested case hearing might include:If the PolyMet tailings dam failed, the Embarrass River would probably look a lot likethis photo of Hazeltine Creek in British Columbiaafter the dam collapse at Mount Polley in 2014. Miles of and millions of cubic yards of toxic heavy metals (including mercury and sulfides sludge that would leech into the St. Louis River watershed for what A century, a millenniumWell, this dam is different, said the DNR’s commissioner recently, well after the EIS was scoped and then completed a few of years later, and without explaining, at least very convincingly,whyit’s different. The Court of Appeals obviously had misgivings when it stayed the dam permits and sent them back to the DNR.We shouldn’t accept the commissioner’s remarks in lieu of a record made under oath and subject to cross examination. Especially for the riskiest mining project ever permitted in the state.The St. Louis River is already classified as an impaired stream, which means there is supposed to be a plan to clean it up, not a risk of making it a lot dirtier.The St. Louis River runs through the Fond du Lac reservation and feeds important wild rice –manoomin– water for the Ojibwe. The fish in the river, which for the most part can’t be eaten very often (and by Ojibwe children not at all , because of the methyl mercury in them, and the wild rice beds are part of the patrimony of the Ojibwe, guaranteed to them by a federal treaty, the Treaty of LaPointe, made in 1854. Themanoominbeds are already in decline because of sulfate pollution.The PolyMet sacrifice zone extends to the City of Duluth and Lake Superior, too. People need to know that whether or not the tailings dam fails, the PolyMet mine and tailings basin would discharge pollutants that impair wild rice and increase mercury contamination of fish. The Bands and environmental organizations have stressed the certainty of mercury and sulfate pollution as well as the potential for catastrophic ruin that would result from the PolyMet mine.Imagine what would happen if a similar threat hung over an important and yes, sacred, asset of white peopleWe don’t have to imagine; we just have to observe the difference in the reaction of the public to PolyMet and to Twin Metals. It’s remarkable. A new, separate organization was created to raise money just for the Boundary Waters, and ithired the former commissioner of the DNR, the person who signed the PolyMet permits that are now in litigation, to resist the Twin Metals proposal. (I should mention that the Friends of the BWCAW is one organization with “Boundary Waters” in its name that has fought PolyMet all along with its theme:Two Mines. Two Watersheds. One Threat, and it has big paddles in the water in the PolyMet litigation. Editorialists wax poetic about the Boundary Waters, saying “Not this Mine; Not this Location,” and receive awards, while remaining virtually silent about PolyMet. Parts of the two projects are 12 miles apart, and they are subject to the same Clean Water Act and the same Clear Air Act.We’ll move heaven and earth to stop one, but not the other.

And while many recognize the people who are truly heroes in our community, it may have taken something like the COVID-19 pandemic for us to really see it.When some people think of heroes, they may think of celebrities — actors, musicians, athletes. But the pandemic has put a lot of things into perspective, and one of them is just how much we depend on the people we don’t always think about.We depend on doctors and nurses, truck drivers and grocery store workers, farmers and trash collectors and letter carriers. We depend on electric linemen and the folks working at the treatment plants and distribution systems for our fresh water and sewage. We depend on police officers, paramedics, firefighters and dispatchers. We depend on restaurant workers and delivery people. We depend on teachers and the people who keep the phone lines working, the people who keep our roads and traffic signals operational, and the people working in public health and social services. We depend on the people working in nonprofit organizations serving those who are most vulnerable.And it is these people — these heroes of the community — that we wish to honor with a special section that you’ll find inserted in today’s newspaper.

I said, “Remember to cut the top at a slight angle, so the part you cut doesn’t fall into the pumpkin.” “I know,” he replied. “You told me last year.” His answer surprised me, because I didn’t think he listened to most of what I said, and I didn’t think what he did hear actually stayed with him.This one moment let me know that he heard one thing I said and that this insignificant piece of advice had stayed with him for a year. It made me wonder if other things I told him still had a place in his brain. It made me also think about what we had talked about throughout the years and the lessons that I hoped he was learning. Perhaps there was hope yet in getting through some things I wanted him to learn, and maybe some of my advice was lingering somewhere in his cranium.I tell you this today because I know there are times when it seems like every word you speak falls on deaf ears, and conversations you craft carefully appear to have no impact. Hang in there, keep teaching, and keep working.We must continue to utilize each opportunity that we are given to teach and train the children who have been entrusted to our care. This involves keeping an eye open for moments we can use to share some facts about life or teach them something new. It may mean slowing down in some of our own tasks, allowing them to assist or to watch us while we complete something with an explanation of why we do things in a certain way. Other times, it takes a scheduled time to have a conversation or to teach something in a more structured way. Opportunities abound for us to teach them, but we must be willing to spend the time to do so.We also need to realize that the way we do things, how we behave, and what we say when we aren’t explicitly trying to teach them will impact them in a more significant way than any of the words we share. Children observe much more than we realize, and they are watching what we do and the way we live our lives. The lessons we try to teach will be voided if our actions contradict what we say.This means that our lessons are not always verbal. We must demonstrate the lessons we want our children to learn and display the character we want them to build. Most things they will learn do not come from a “teachable moment.” Rather, they come from a lifetime of watching how you act.This does not mean that our words are not important or that we never teach them things verbally. It means our words must match our actions for any lesson to be effective.It’s our job to teach. It’s our job to train. There will be times when it all seems pointless, and there will be times when we question if anything we say enters their ears. They are listening, and they are watching.

philinquirer_2020_19,"Maybe you learned growing up that you should avoid writing in the passive voice. But no one told you that doing so can be a matter of life and death.A month after George Floyd was killed, protesters — who sometimes clash violently with police — continue to fill the streets of Philadelphia and cities around the world.Ugh, no. Let’s try that sentence again.A month after police killed George Floyd, the streets of Philadelphia and cities around the world continue to be filled with sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters.Maybe you learned growing up that you should avoid writing in the passive voice. But no one told you that doing so can be a matter of life and death. These two sentences are textbook examples of why: because passive voice eschews responsibility for action. The sentences are factually equal, but their active/passive-voice dance affects how you feel about what occurred.“George Floyd was killed” is in the passive voice, which allows a grammatically correct sentence without assigning any agency — that is, without telling you who killed George Floyd. After the comma, however, the sentence switches to active voice: The protesters are the ones who “clash violently” and “fill the streets.” Protesters are bad, and police are off the hook.Now look at the second sentence. Before the comma is active voice — ”police killed George Floyd” — but then the second half switches to passive voice to favor the actions of the protesters.Every article you’ve read for the last month has subtly shaped your perception of what’s going on by performing this active/passive voice shift.Take, for example, the New York Times. In asingle articlethis week, the Times wrote:“George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died in Minneapolis on Mondayafter being handcuffed and pinned to the groundby Derek Chauvin, a white police officer” — you have to get to the very end of a long sentence to learn that Floyd died under the knee of a police officer.“That night, hundreds of protesters flooded into the Minneapolis streets. Some demonstrators vandalized police vehicles” — assigning responsibility to protesters through active voice.“In Indianapolis, aperson was killedand three others injured after shots were fired at demonstrators” — no agency for who committed the shooting at all.“Protesters clashed with the police” — protesters, as the subject of the sentence, are responsible for “clashing.” Police are the object, and therefore not responsible and not accountable.» READ MORE:Brawl ensues near South Philadelphia Columbus statue after march, protest at Municipal Services BuildingNot to single out the Times. Over the last month readers could find similar examples in coverage fromNPR(“Peaceful Protesters Tear-Gassed to Clear Way for Trump Church Photo-Op” ,CNN(“Kendrick Sampson says he was shot with rubber bullets” ,ABC News(“Journalists have been arrested, tear gassed and more — sometimes live on air” ,The Hill(“Both were shot with rubber bullets and faced the tear gas thrown at protesters near the White House” ,Salon(“The protesters outside of the White House were shot with rubber bullets, choked with tear gas, and beaten by police” ,Fox News(“Authorities deny tear gas used on protesters prior to Trump’s walk to DC church” ,USA Today(“Government agencies andprotesters …are at odds over whether the chemical irritant deployed near the White House was tear gas” ,USA Todayagain (“Journalists blinded, injured, arrested covering George Floyd protests nationwide” , and most every hyperlocal news operation in America, many of them the only source of information in their communities.Each one of these sentences is a micro-influencer on how you interpret what you’re reading. They ignore or bury the fact that it was people who shot those rubber bullets or fired those tear gas canisters. They can shape whether you fault police or protesters for violence, and whether you think cops acted appropriately or too aggressively. Under scrutiny, they reveal the sometimes conscious, sometimes unconscious biases of reporters.Passive voice has its place. But question every verb as if your life depends on it.

eugeneweekly_2020_31,"We ve got issues. At the beginning of my police career a seasoned training officer uttered words to me that would echo throughout my 35-year Oregon law enforcement career: “If you lie, you die.” Police officers are human and, like other humans, they can and will screw up in a multitude of ways. But, she said, unlike other humans, police officers must be completely accountable and own their mistakes, being forthcoming and accountable with and to the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. For in policing you can survive a multitude of mistakes of all shapes and sizes, but if “you lie about it , you die.” The sentiment behind those words is more important now than it has ever been in American law enforcement. Now, more than ever, communities demand trustworthy individuals of integrity and credibility in law enforcement. Truth is central to our sworn oath as police officers and, if you are proven to lie, you cannot and should not be trusted by the public you serve. But truth — especially that which expresses an unwelcome or controversial opinion — is where truth is facing challenge, even oppression in some law enforcement agencies. As a police manager and internal affairs investigator, I uncovered, spoke out and objected about truth which was supposed to be kept secret in Springfield. My spoken truth exhumed truths that were deliberately and officially buried inside files deep within police department archives by a small but formidable element of good old boys who subscribe to a noble-cause form of justice, wherein they decide to whom and how the Constitution applies. Resurrected, these ghosted-truths began to open doors, break windows and shake foundations in Springfield and beyond. These truths created justice and constitution where it had been denied: A Springfield man who had been screaming for justice for seven years from inside the Oregon State Prison was suddenly and quietly released 13 years early last November; a former cop with a known predatory history was prevented from practicing law in Oregon; a heavy-handed cop was put on a strict leash; and most recently, the secreted truths surrounding the unpunished intentional murder of Steven Ray Scott, a 51 year-old poor and Black homeless man, beaten to death by known assailants in Springfield in 2017, were revealed in a KEZI 9 News Special Report. Cowardly men exposed and threatened by these truths attacked me with false allegations, lies and deliberate omissions; their theme, untruthfulness. Inside the police department, after hours, they trespassed, mocked, manipulated, defaced, defamed and fabricated. While exonerated by truth, I had lost faith and confidence in the honor of men around me. I collected my personal possessions from my private office inside the secure walls of the Springfield Justice Center. Among them, a personal symbol of American truth and justice, which has deliberately followed my police career for years; a large black and white textured-lithograph image of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he delivered his famed “I Have a Dream” speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Aug. 28, 1963. This is when I discovered a parting cowardly gesture, secretly and permanently penned to the inside back of this proud symbol of truth, hope and justice for all people: “Lt. WiGGER.” Such a shameful act of cowardly bigotry, I thought at first. Wikipedia defines “Wigger” as a word used in a racist manner, much like the N-word, by the white culture, to belittle a white person perceived as “acting Black,” and also demeaning Black people and culture by association. On second thought, I had a notion which has caused me to covet this extraordinary and now one-of-a-kind, historical artifact more now than ever before. The ironic symbolism of this ill-intended message of bigoted hate; that sometimes hate and evil does indeed hide behind truth and justice. The Springfield Police Department is comprised of mostly honorable men and women, but if freedom is to ring the same for everyone in Springfield, in the words of King, there are still “crooked places to be made straight.” Scott McKee is a 34-year Oregon police veteran. He served with honor as a Eugene police officer for 28 years. He was hired as a police lieutenant in March 2015 by the Springfield Police Department, where he served with honor, dignity and respect; conducting sensitive internal and criminal investigations at times of difficulty and transition within the SPD. He honorably separated from the Springfield Police Department last month after he was completely exonerated of all false allegations against him. Pursuant a severance agreement Lt. McKee agreed he would not file suit against SPD or its representatives for any activities occurring prior to Sept. 3, 2020. He discovered the King hate message eight days later."
minnpost_2020_150,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minneapolis has a police problem. It has a race problem. We have known both of those facts for years.The question is the cause — and what are the possible solutions There is no simple answer, but one is that Minneapolis Police Department needs to have a major cultural change that can only be effected by either state takeover of it or by merging it with (or having it taken over by the Hennepin County sheriff or placed under receivership and operation with another jurisdiction.Minneapolis has long had a problem with its police department. Muckraker Lincoln Steffens in his 1904 classic the “Shame of the Cities” and in his1903 McClure Magazinecover story highlighted the corruption and problems in the Minneapolis Police Department that included graft, corruption, and a host of other issues. There is a problem in controlling the police that goes back over a century.There is also a well-known racial problem. It is one of the most racially segregated cities in the nation with terrible disparities in education, health care, incarceration, income, and employment. Combine them together and they yield a racial problem with policing, especially including excessive use of force.Twenty years ago I taught a class on police civil and criminal liability law. Minneapolis was a living laboratory in what not to do. The city made constant payouts to victims and families, and across two county prosecutors that included now Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Mike Freeman little had been done to hold officers criminally liable. There are lots of reasons for this. Some are political and not wanting to take on the police or wanting to appear tough on crime. Others are the fact that the law on police criminal (and civil liability favor them over victims. As a result, Minneapolis is perhaps the most notorious example of police racial violence against people of color.What do we do now Addressing the underlying racial and economic disparities in income, education, and health care are needed but they will not change police behavior. There is a persistent cultural problem with Minneapolis police practice that needs to be addressed.Others blame the police unions. It is not so much the unions as it is the psychology of the “thin blue line” where in a view of us versus them, police are hesitant to take action against or buck other police officers. This is just the most extreme version of no one likes a snitch or fink.Maybe the fault is with the public. Generally suspects and defendants do not garner much sympathy from the public. Racism may be a factor when often it is white police interacting with people of color. Of course the exception in Minneapolis was when a black police officer shot a white woman and there was a rush to convict him. Many felt good about themselves here indicating they could now support a victim over the police.There is also a culture of complacency. By that, Minneapolis has a reputation of being one of the most liberal cities in America. Mayors, City Council members and voters can say all the right things about race, but at the end of the day the solutions fall from short of anything beyond rhetoric.Finally, mayors in Minneapolis are weak. They cannot do much. The city is effectively a one-party town where the establishment is not going to challenge anyone in power for fear it will hurt their career.Now firing four police officers and calling for them to be charged with murder will placate some, but it still will not change the culture and administration of policing. What should be doneIt is clear, if Steffens was correct, that the police have been a problem for Minneapolis for more than 100 years. The city has shown it is incapable of reforming or correcting the problem. It is doubtful people of color have much confidence in the city of Minneapolis to fix the problem. Someone needs to step in.Solution one is a takeover of the Minneapolis Police Department by the state of Minnesota. This probably would require legislation altering or pre-empting home rule authority of the city. Across the country states such as New Jersey have employed similar solutions when it comes to education. Maybe the state of Minnesota putting the city’s police department under its control would be an option.Solution two is disbanding the department entirely and letting the Hennepin County sheriff perform public safety functions in Minneapolis. A variation of that is merging the Minneapolis Police Department into the sheriff’s office or putting the former under some type of receivership with another jurisdiction. Perhaps this what should have been the remedial basis of a previous civil rights lawsuit.Overall, continuing to believe that the city of Minneapolis can administer and reform its police in a racially neutral manner increasingly looks unlikely and a new entity needs to run or provide for the public safety needs there.David Schultzis aHamline Universityprofessor of political science.

Danke also for “O Tannenbaum” or “O Christmas Tree,” a song we sang at elementary school holiday programs, even in good ole Hilo, Hawaii.I have many stories about evergreens including this one from Deutschland, where we spent several years.At Weihnachten, Germans waited until children went to bed on Christmas Eve before putting up their fir. The next morning when keiki awoke, they found a magnificent magically decorated tree! The wow factor must have been huge, but my brood never experienced it because all I could think was: You mean in addition to waiting for hyper kids to fall asleep so we could assemble the new bike, the doll house and wrap the “Santa” gifts, we also had to trim a tannenbaum on Christmas Eve?Sorry, kiddos. No can do. I was glad to get back to the islands.In Hilo in the 1950s and ‘60s, the Christmas tree we decorated was the Norfolk pine, brought to Hawaii from the South Pacific in the 19th century. We were happy until pictures of A-shaped tinseled specimens from America started appearing. That’s how it goes, doesn’t it? We’re good with what we got until something else shows up from the outside world.By the 1970s, evergreens were being shipped in for the holidays. Many of these imported trees are pricey Douglas firs from the Pacific Northwest with an earlier and unexpected link to Hawaii Island.A cousin told me that Douglas firs are named for David Douglas, a Scotsman and a botanist. He was sent out by the Royal Horticultural Society of England to gather plants and in the late 1820s, spent time on the northwest American continent. In 1834, on his way back to England, he stopped in Hawaii and met his untimely death on the slopes of Maunakea, trampled by a bull after falling into a pit.I narrowed my eyes. “Is this bull?” But no, because Cuz has even seen a monument called Ka lua kauka, or the Doctor’s Pit, where several Douglas firs are planted in his honor. So no need fork over half a paycheck for these prized trees since some are already growing on the island.This year, not many trees are being imported because of COVID. Who has kala for an expensive evergreen when islanders are in food lines? Besides, invasive species have been hitching rides on these foreign firs, such as the foot-long alligator lizard that turned up in Hilo last year.Oh, goody. More reptiles.This pandemic has forced us to rethink priorities. At the top is tourism, a lopsided industry providing menial jobs for islanders and impacting precious natural resources, so there’s much-needed talk about diversifying. One possibility is Christmas tree farms, and I’m happy to report that such enterprises are already underway. We can support them by buying trees grown on this island.There are also ecologically minded mainlanders who, bypassing cut holiday firs that only end up dead in the landfill, are looking at Norfolk pines because our faithful standbys are not only air purifiers but can be grown in pots and reused every year. In cold-weather winter climes, these tropical trees should remain indoors or at least in a screened porch, but they’re quite hardy.So, here’s a novel scenario: Norfolk pines from our island becomes an exotic export to the continent. Fundraisers importing evergreens find another way to raise funds, and islanders stop encouraging the importation of firs and critters. Locals are lauded far and wide as ecological trendsetters when we choose the Norfolk pine as our Christmas tree.And something old becomes new again.Frohe Weihnachten and Mele Kalikimaka.Rochelle delaCruz was born in Hilo, graduated from Hilo High School, then left to go to college.

minnpost_2020_60,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In the early morning hours of July 28, 2017, Sen. John McCain made one of the most consequential votes in the history of American health care when he gave his memorable “thumbs-down” to block Senate Republicans’ effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA . It was the dramatic culmination of a battle that had raged for more than half a year as Republicans in Washington tried to repeal and replace the ACA. No matter that it protected millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. No matter that it helped millions more access coverage that would otherwise have been unaffordable.Before even taking office Donald Trumppromisedthat Republicans would repeal the Affordable Care Act on day one of his presidency. In October of 2016 during the election he said it is “going to be so easy” to get a new health care law. But by February 2017 he was complaining that “nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” Had he asked anyone who actually worked in health care he would have known this much sooner.Americans across the country watched through the spring and summer of 2017 as plan after plan was floated attempting to devise a better solution. Every moderately serious proposal was nothing more than an inferior copy of the ACA that would have resulted in an increase in the uninsured rate and deep cuts to vital public health care programs for the elderly and people with disabilities. All were opposed by nearly every major medical, health care, and advocacy organization.When McCain cast the deciding vote against his own party’s signature issue of the last decade he was offering Republicans a path away from their quest to repeal a law that provides health care for more than 20 million Americans. The members of his party could have realized that the ACA, while imperfect, was still better than anything they could devise, and worked with members on both sides of the aisle to improve the law and make it work better for Americans of all stripes.Instead, they chose to double down on the harmful repeal agenda by trying to do in court what they couldn’t achieve legislatively.At stake in the lawsuit is coverage formore than 265,000 Minnesotans— and protections for themore than 2 millionwith pre-existing conditions, not to mention the millions of Americans who have contracted the virus. It would eliminate the Medicaid expansion, raise drug prices for seniors, kick adult children off their parents’ health coverage, undermine the fight against the opioid epidemic, increase racial disparities, and more.Pollingshows that a majority of Americans support the ACA. People like the law’s provision that funds Medicaid expansion and protections for pre-existing conditions, and in red states across the country Medicaid expansion ballot initiatives are winning. Ten years after its passage people have come to not only accept but rely on the fundamental features of the law. And while it remains imperfect, it is a framework that can be built upon.Over the last two years Democrats, including Minnesota’s own Rep. Angie Craig, have introduced multiple pieces of legislation that would do just that. From lowering health insurance premiums and prescription drug costs to shoring up provisions in the law that have been weakened administratively by the Trump administration, Democrats have continued to push for increased health care access and affordability. None of these bills have been taken up by the U.S. Senate.Most people want elected leaders to work on issues that better their lives, not partisan crusades to redeem the lost ideological battles of the past. John McCain, who was no fan of the ACA, understood this better than most, and stood up for his constituents and Americans across the country when he cast his fateful vote protecting the Affordable Care Act. We could use more like him today.Jeremy Drucker is the director of Protect Our Care Minnesota."
suffolknewsherald_2020_216,"Published 6:29 pm Friday, September 25, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Elizabeth TaraskiThe mission of the Nansemond River Preservation Alliance is: Informing citizens about the status of Suffolk’s river and creeks. Educating shoreline property owners about environmental regulations related to their property. Spreading the word about best practices that citizens can do to restore the waterways. Setting an example by applying best practices in the field by establishing oyster reef sanctuaries, rain gardens, living shorelines and creating a native tree and shrub conservation demonstration site — an outdoor classroom for the public.NRPA has also taken an innovative approach to restoring the waterways. In 2012, NRPA developed the Nansemond Watershed Initiative: Connecting the Classroom With Our Environment program. More than 10,000 students have participated in the hands-on, interactive program where they learned about the waterways, marine life and how to be an environmental steward. In 2017, NRPA along with the Virginia Department of Health: Division of Shellfish Safety, Hampton Roads Sanitation District and Suffolk Public Works collaborated on a bacterial tracking project to identify possible aging infrastructure or septic tank issues that could impact the river and creeks. Over a 12-month period, the four organizations collected samples at 74 sites along Suffolk’s waterways. Previously 30 sites were sampled. The project was a success, several problem areas were identified and corrective actions were taken.The next innovative project — NRPA is partnering with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to explore ways to increase the oyster population by using five different substrates. Basically, a substrate is a surface or material on or from which an organism grows, or obtains nourishment. The collaborative research project involves investigating different structures and surfaces for oyster larvae or spat to attach and grow to mature oysters. Oysters are natural filter feeders. One adult oyster filters up to 50 gallons of water per day. This means they feed by pumping water through their gills, trapping nutrients, suspended sediments and chemical contaminants. They then either consume them or shape them in small packets that are deposited on the bottom where they are not harmful. In doing so, oysters help keep the water clean and clear for underwater grasses and other aquatic life. The five substrates include: natural oyster shell, oyster reef balls, oyster castles, reef/tile discs, and oyster catchers. Oyster reefs are typically constructed using old shells collected in mesh bags and deposited along shorelines. Natural shells are not readily available. The oyster reef balls and oyster castles are concrete-based products. The reef tile/discs and oyster catchers are oyster shell substrate products designed and fabricated by two different small businesses.A combination of substrates will be “planted” at three sites along the Nansemond River. The selected sites have different characteristics and locations. We appreciate the NRPA members who have volunteered their property for the project.Over a two-year period, the results will be monitored and evaluated to determine the most effective practices in our region. These steps will lay the foundation for future shoreline oyster restoration work throughout Hampton Roads.This creates an awesome relationship. NRPA provides local expertise, in-depth knowledge of Suffolk’s river and creeks, and network of volunteers. CBF’s decades of oyster restoration experience will help make the Nansemond a model for using natural methods to protect shorelines. Check out the NRPA website for updates.Nansemond River Preservation Alliance has been serving the city of Suffolk since 2010 by educating and encouraging all citizens to be environmental stewards and work to protect the River, creeks and its tributaries.

The bill makes an exception for landowners, residents and lessees in the valley, as well as Native Hawaiians engaging in traditional customary practices.In opposition to the bill, Jackson Bauer of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources testified that it “would severely limit the public’s right to access public lands.” These include the mile-long Waipio shoreline, the Muliwai Trail to Waimanu Valley (where the state operates campgrounds and provides hunting lands , and the King’s Trail.There is no parking in the valley. If hikers cannot walk down, they will be shut out.The bill says its purpose is safety, but the discussion in committee did not refer to any criteria for how many pedestrians might be too many. No one on the council cited any traffic safety study. And there was no analysis of how pedestrians electing to drive the road instead will affect safety.Bill 217 would defeat the purpose of the state law on “Public Access to Coastal and Inland Recreational Areas” (HRS 115-1 , which seeks to “guarantee the right of public access to the sea, shorelines, and inland recreational areas …” and assigns responsibility for developing and maintaining rights-of-way to the counties.The County Code (Section 2-83 also mandates that the county afford “fair and impartial treatment” to “all persons.” If this bill passes, however, some will be able to access public lands while others will not.If you cherish your “fundamental right of free movement in public space” (HRS 115-1 , you should contact your council member and submit testimony to the council without delay.

suffolknewsherald_2020_187,"Published 4:52 pm Friday, October 30, 2020ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:In a recent article from the Suffolk News-Herald, there is a topic regarding students going back to in-class sessions versus online learning. In this article, it specifically states that “Superintendent Dr. John B. Gordon told members not to expect anything about reopening schools again until its January meeting.” This article goes through how some students are staying online, but this isn’t the right decision.I know that schools are trying to be careful because COVID is going around, but I don’t think they should be depriving students of genuine education. Online learning is nowhere near as effective as in-person learning is. Online learning is a set up for many distractions and doesn’t allow the students to get the one-on-one help that they need. In-person learning allows students to be able to easily access the teacher when help is needed. It also gives the students a social life, rather than being cooped up inside of the house all day with no other peers. Yes, students may have siblings, but it’s not the same as having a social life. Personally, I know the effects of this because I am learning virtually. With me being in college, it’s a little bit different, but the effects are the same. While learning virtually, I am taking BIO 142 (Anatomy & Physiology 2 which is a lab-focused class. This class is extremely hard because I feel like I would learn the material better if I was in a class setting doing hands-on.As I said, COVID is going around, but there are things that can be done to allow students to safely go back to school. These things include sanitizing highly touched areas like desks, having the students and teachers wear masks, making sure children and teachers have easy access to hand sanitizer and making sure that the desks are apart. It’s time to gain back genuine education. To do this, we must all come together to understand the effects virtual learning has on students.Katelyn N.

minnpost_2020_107,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Power, hope, and imagination are, now as ever, central to the struggle to create a more just society. People outraged by the police killing of George Floyd are demanding justice, and widespread protests have upended local politics seemingly overnight. Changes recently considered unthinkable, dismissed as too radical or utopian, suddenly feel possible.“Dismantle the police” has emerged as a vital campaign, dramatically joined bya majority of the Minneapolis City Council. A demand to end the status quo, the slogan is also a clarion call to civic imagination. Do we have the courage and creativity to reinvent public safety Can we reimagine whom it is for — and how and by whom it is best achievedMinneapolis has come to exemplify the failures of progressive police reform. For decades, reformers here have tried to make law enforcement less aggressive and alienating and more accountable. The Minneapolis Police Department has embraced some reforms. But the hard work of real change and accountability has been stymied, partly by state laws that enable police violence and partly by staunch resistance from the officers’ Federation, led by a champion of warrior-style policing, Bob Kroll.Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color in Minneapolis point to along historyof police racism and brutality to explain their well-founded distrust of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD . Statistics support them. Roughly 19% of the city’s population is classified as Black, yet 63% of MPD’s use-of-force incidents since 2008have involved Black people.Arrest data confirm huge racial disparities in policing low-level crimes, from loitering to marijuana.Unjust and ineffective policing persists, in part, because of the difficulty of imagining alternatives. Predictably, critics of dismantling have stoked fears of the unknown: Defund the police and you’ll get lawless chaos and violence. It sounds like a risky gamble, especially to people who are not subject to the chaotic and lawless violence of American policing as it stands.In truth, the consequences of dismantling will depend entirely on what we invest in next. To achieve justice, we must get creative and learn from alternative systems past and present. Most of all, we must listen to the communities that have been most subject to militarized control and systemic neglect. Yet ascouncil membersrightly suggest, sound ideas supported by experts and evidence are not in short supply.Funds currently spent on theMPDcan be invested in education, health, housing, and other services that prevent crime and strengthen community capacity to promote safety and wellbeing. Equally important, newly available funds can be directed to community-basedanti-violence programsand emergency-intervention teams, many of which have already proveneffective at reducing violent crime.These are but a few of the alternatives already on the rack.Ultimately, the call to dismantle the police demands we take responsibility for systems that have failed, and embrace the creative work of policy innovation. Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color have long demanded greater public safety and championed alternative approaches to this goal. Over the past several weeks, protesters have moved these visions to centerstage, and people working to protect their neighborhoods have sent a clear message that “the safest system is one grounded in and accountable to an organized community.” Finally, local politicians seem to be listening.Joshua PageandMichelle Phelpsare associate professors of sociology at the University of Minnesota.Joe Sossis Cowles Professor for the Study of Public Service, Hubert H.

minnpost_2020_37,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Congress took historic action in the conservation of America’s natural landscapes by passing the Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA . The bill combines two conservation and park proposals that each have strong, bipartisan support — fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF and making major investments to care for our national parks and other public lands. With thepresident’s signature on Aug. 4, this is the most significant parks and public lands funding enacted in 50 years!As leaders of conservation groups that have long worked in Minnesota, and whose organizations have advocated for or benefited from programs like LWCF, we recognize the need for this funding to be spent in a manner that remedies existing inequities, not exacerbates them. This moment presents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leverage increased support for public lands to create greater equity in the outdoor world.The GAOA amounts to a240 percent increasein LWCF funding for the next 10 years, compared to the last 10 years. That means stable and predictable public funding to support additional strategic conservation projects — and, through the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Program, a significant expansion in federal support to help ensure all Americans are within a 10-minute walk from a vibrant park or natural area.Whether in a small town or a big city, outdoor spaces are often at the center of vibrant communities. Over the last few months, many have found peace in the outdoors. Yet, access to quality outdoor space is not equitable. Past policies have increased disparities and limited access for many communities of color. We have an opportunity to change that.We will work together to ensure this LWCF funding goes first to Black, Indigenous, and other communities of color who have historically lacked easy access to the outdoors because of systemic racial injustices and chronic underinvestment. We must ensure this funding is used to write a new and truly equitable conservation future.With a long road ahead for our nation’s post-COVID recovery, the GAOA comes at a critically important time. We’re grateful to the bipartisan group of Minnesota members of Congress who voted in support of the Great American Outdoors Act: U.S. Reps. Angie Craig, Dean Phillips, Betty McCollum, Ilhan Omar, Collin Peterson and Pete Stauber, as well as U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. We’ll be looking to these same leaders to help ensure vulnerable communities are prioritized as funding decisions are made. At the top of their lists should be Minnesota’s communities of color, who have been hardest hit by COVID-19 and the subsequent economic recession and who for too long have been excluded from outdoor spaces.All told, the Great American Outdoors Act will improve access to the outdoors and nature. But leaders in Minnesota and beyond, including within the conservation community, must work to ensure the implementation of these improved public lands and parks correct past discriminatory policies and ensure previously ignored communities are put first.Paul Austin is the executive director of Conservation Minnesota.

suffolknewsherald_2020_9,"Published 5:34 pm Friday, August 21, 2020ByStaff ReportsAt a time when we’re already dealing with one life-altering disease, let’s not add more to the list.A Suffolk raccoon tested positive for rabies last week after it fought with a pet cat in the area of Old Myrtle Road. It’s a common occurrence every spring and summer for a handful of wild animals in Suffolk to test positive for rabies after coming into contact with humans, domesticated animals or livestock, but that doesn’t make it any less disconcerting for the people who live nearby.Fortunately, rabies is not quite as virulent as COVID-19, which is at the top of everyone’s minds right now. Also fortunately, it has been around a lot longer than COVID-19, and we know more about how to prevent it.However, it is nearly 100% fatal in humans after they begin to show symptoms, and it is also fatal in dogs and cats that have not been vaccinated. It is still a public health threat that should be taken seriously.Exposure of humans to rabies occurs when the saliva of an infected animal enters the body through an open wound or mucous membrane, such as with an animal bite. An animal exposure is a serious medical event, for which prompt evaluation and complete treatment is critical.Rabies is highly preventable if the vaccine is given early and as recommended. Follow these tips to prevent exposure in yourself, your loved ones and your pets:State law requires all dogs and cats over the age of 4 months to be vaccinated against rabies.

That doesn’t mean this public health crisis hasn’t been difficult to contend with — it has been. And although hospitals across Virginia still collectively have thousands of available beds to meet patient treatment needs, everyone has a duty to act responsibly to limit the spread of infection so we don’t overwhelm our health care system. Over the past eight months, we have seen cases spike in late spring and over the summer, and we are now seeing case numbers rise again with the arrival of fall and winter approaching. At varying times, regions of the Commonwealth including Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, Central Virginia, and more recently Southwest Virginia, have seen concerning increases in overall case numbers and hospitalizations.As our hospitals and health care heroes continue to battle this deadly and dangerous virus, we strongly encourage all Virginians to be careful, responsible, and practice safe behaviors to protect themselves and others. Staying committed to social distancing and mask wearing can help us avoid a significant surge in COVID-19 cases that other parts of the nation are experiencing. Hospitals and health systems across Virginia are united in our commitment to safety policies and behaviors that are essential in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. After spending the better part of the year dealing with the pandemic and its public health and economic consequences, and with the holiday season approaching following months of isolation, we recognize there is a temptation to get lax. Please resist that urge, Virginia. It is vital for everyone to continue taking the necessary steps to prevent the spread of this deadly disease.Since the beginning of this pandemic, hospitals have required staff, patients and visitors to follow clearly defined safety protocols including mask-wearing, temperature checks upon facility entry, and modified visitation policies. We implore all Virginians to practice similar precautions in their daily lives: wear a mask, maintain at least six feet of distance from other people, avoid crowds, and wash your hands frequently. These safety guidelines are informed by data, science and public health best practices. Everyone has a role in following these steps, which help keep people and communities safe.When people are in our care, our top priorities are providing high-quality treatment and ensuring that patients and their families have a positive experience of care for themselves or their loved ones when they are hospitalized. While many Virginia hospitals have restored some levels of visitation, we have had to limit visitation capacity and hours as part of our COVID-19 response. We appreciate the public’s cooperation and patience with these limitations and encourage people to call ahead to check your local hospital’s modified visitation guidelines.In recent weeks, we have seen COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations trending upwards in Virginia. If the trend continues, it will place greater strain on hospital team members including doctors and nurses, therapists and custodians, and food service and support staff who have bravely worked to help patients throughout the COVID-19 ordeal. Surges in infections and hospitalizations increases their risk for exposure to illness. For the good of the Commonwealth and all its communities, our goal is to avoid these scenarios.So please, do your part to limit the spread of COVID-19 and flu this winter, and to help prevent more illness and hospitalizations. Join us in supporting our courageous health care team members as they continue the fight against COVID-19 on behalf of patients who have become seriously ill during the pandemic.

In fact, House Republicans joined Democrats in October to sign off unanimously on a bill to expand the state’s rent relief program — but then theirSenate colleagues refused to advance the legislation. They decided that heading into a dark winter during a pandemic, housing was not a priority. Yet, we all know that housing is a fundamental human need, and we know that during this pandemic, some of the richest people have gotten even richer, while many working people are now faced with unstable housing, insufficient food, and not enough money to pay their bills.Rather than focusing on housing, education, food access, and small-business relief bills, some of our colleagues spent months questioning science and trying to cast doubt on an election that took place almost two months ago. This theater of the absurd does not serve the people of Pennsylvania. Working people, poor people, and the middle class are struggling to afford necessities; many people find themselves applying for unemployment for the first time after decades of working hard. For some people, housing instability is a new struggle that’s come with the pandemic. For many of our neighbors, the near-constant search for housing is a traumatic and exhausting way of life that comes with the high price of renting or buying a home, along with staggering amounts of medical debt and college debt.Pennsylvania deserves leaders who will focus on getting them help now. Certainly, when the General Assembly returns to Harrisburg in January, getting relief to those who need it the most — frontline workers, essential workers, independent businesses, seniors, those who have lost employment, and renters and homeowners — should be priority No. 1.Our state needs to step up, now, to get rent and mortgage relief to Pennsylvanians, and to pass the rest of our Safe At Home housing bills. For anyone on the edge of homelessness, this is obvious. Housing is a public health issue and a moral issue, and it must come along with other forms of assistance and support to get us all through this pandemic and beyond.Austin Davis (D., Allegheny and Elizabeth Fiedler (D., Phila. are Pennsylvania state representatives."
suffolknewsherald_2020_113,"Published 6:05 pm Tuesday, December 8, 2020ByStaff ReportsContact tracing is one of the most important ways of fighting outbreaks of contagious diseases like COVID-19. But unfortunately, the outbreak of COVID-19 in Virginia has become so large that the state’s health department has said it can no longer handle contact tracing for each and every case.Virginia State Health Commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver announced on Monday that the Virginia Department of Health will be prioritizing certain types of cases for contact tracing — for example, those in congregate living facilities or part of a known outbreak — and will ask everyone else to notify their contacts themselves.It’s important to understand that contact tracing is not the government’s attempt to police where you’ve been, what you’ve done or who you’ve seen. They simply want to notify people you may have infected so those people can keep away from others and not infect them. We all would do well to see this virus, and the attempts to control it, more about science and solid public health policy and less about politics.Even though this is a new virus, we still know a great deal about how to prevent its spread — and it’s quite simple, on paper. People should stay home whenever possible and avoid gatherings outside one’s home, the state health department implores. When they must go out — say, to shop for groceries and other essentials — they should wear a mask, keep their distance from others and wash their hands on a regular basis.Of course, all that’s easier said than done. It’s hard to deprive ourselves of visits to family and friends, especially during this holiday season, but the best way to stop the spread is simply to stop seeing others in person.It is also recommended that people download COVIDWISE, the state’s exposure notification app, which can tell you if you’ve potentially been exposed to someone else who later tests positive for COVID-19. This is one quite simple way Virginians can improve the contact tracing process. Another one is to actually answer the phone and cooperate if a contact tracer calls you.You can still do your part to help stop the spread.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_193,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After nearly two weeks of (wildly/mildly, I’ll pick wildly conflicting reports about President Trump’s COVID-19 condition and his apparent incredible recovery, I’ve had cause to recall the nearly 13 years I spent as a spokesperson for the University of Minnesota medical center.While the job was probably the most personally rewarding I’ve had, I have had numerous occasions in the years since I left to review much of what I experienced at the university. In particular, Affordable Care Act battles have brought back hard memories of families struggling to find insurance coverage or raise money to pay for expensive procedures, often the organ and bone marrow transplants that did not start to become covered by most insurance plans until the mid-1990s. I’ve also thought about the (not frequent, but not nonexistent instances when I witnessed less than completely honest communication between hospital/medical staff and journalists.And yes, spokespeople such as myself were among those who weren’t always completely forthright. Though in my case (and probably that of many others in similar positions, in all sorts of organizations, all over the world , I have to say that was mostly because people such as myself weren’t always, always given the straight story. Or weren’t permitted to tell the straight story. And the trouble was, being just a spokesperson and not a lawyer or doctor, I didn’t always know enough about what went on behind legal and medical doors to know all of the actual facts. I know I’m not the only one who has wondered if the president’s doctors and staff felt they were in a similarly constrained situation.When I heard the president’s doctors and his chief of staff and press secretary talk the way they did — with obfuscation, evasion and omission attempts that would be challenged by champion high school debaters — I thought about a small minority of the doctors I dealt with, doctors representing different disciplines who either didn’t want to make any comments at all for journalists or were expressing optimism that belonged in the realm of purely wishful thinking. I remember one telling me that if such “slight” positive thinking were not voiced on “rare” occasions, a whole lot of trouble might ensue with a whole lot of interested parties, including grantmakers, hospital administrators and lawyers, insurance companies, and patient families. Another doctor who was not at the university very long once said intense competition from other medical centers required the shiniest, most telegenic spin legally possible.To be fair (and honest , I knew of no patient cases where such media comment, omission, enhancement or bluntness affected the quality of care given the patient or the patient’s eventual medical outcome.As it was, I left the university when troubles hit a number of faculty members in the mid-1990s, troubles that could have jeopardized my ability to avoid legal trouble were I to remain. Much less obtain a job elsewhere. And I wanted to be able to tell the straight story.But neither I nor any of the patients, doctors and lawyers I dealt with was speaking for a president. None was talking about someone whose illness could seriously affect national security and other facets of governance. We were talking about human beings, much loved human beings who often were in very delicate states. But we weren’t talking about someone responsible for a whole nation of much loved human beings.Were I to counsel the president’s doctors and staff, knowing full well that they’d tell me to go to hell, I’d tell them that too much ill-thought spin can discombobulate as well as injure. If one is ever called to deliver legal testimony, lawyers can cost a great deal. And different jobs might be difficult to obtain after participating in such spin cycles.And that plain honesty, even in a reality television world, even in the White House, remains the best policy.Mary Stanik, a writer and public-relations professional, recently moved from St. Paul to Arizona.She is the author of the novel “Life Erupted.”"
philinquirer_2020_23,"Instead of backfilling the budget with federal CARES Act funds, Wolf and lawmakers should have considered business owners and families and students struggling with education costs and online learning.With all the pandemic-related economic disruptions of 2020, many Americans are relying on the federal government — particularly stimulus checks and Small Business Administration loans — to offer financial relief. Unfortunately, state governments have adopted the same approach, relying on federal borrowing — and massively increased deficit spending — to fund their expenditures.This year’s widespread business closures and unemployment have resulted in state tax revenue shortages, despite the CARES Act funding they received. While CARES Act funds were intended to deal with direct COVID-related costs, many states are simply looking for a “free” way to fund their own excessive spending. Some states are evenlobbying for more federal taxpayer aid.» READ MORE:Without advocates in City Hall, Philly’s small businesses are unfairly expected to white-knuckle it | OpinionEarlier this year, in Pennsylvania, lawmakers worked with Gov. Tom Wolf to pass a stopgap budget that made post-COVID state spending adjustments. Then, two weeks after the election, they completed the 2020 budget during the lame-duck session. But with a $3 billion shortage to makeup, lawmakers, unfortunately, made only a halfhearted effort toward financial solvency, opting instead to rely on questionable federal aid, overlook the state’s real needs, and pave the way for crushing tax hikes.Pennsylvanians may appreciate some components of the final budget deal. For instance, lawmakers tapped into excess reserves like the“shadow budget”to cover certain COVID-related gaps, and even made a few spending reductions for expenses that were smaller this year. But these minor attempts at fiscal responsibility fell short of covering the state’s arrears; billions still remain in these offline accounts. Meanwhile, the one-time sources of revenue that made up for the state’s budget shortfalls won’t be around next year — and taxpayers will be asked to make up the difference.Instead ofcautiously reducing spendingas policy experts recommended, lawmakers chose to cover overspending with more than $2.1 billion in federal funds for Medicaid and $1.33 billion in one-time federal CARES Act money. This COVID-designated money, though, was intended for besieged restaurants and other business owners who suffered far more than government bureaucracies. Who needs federal stimulus dollars more: the many state services that barely operated this year, or the restaurants that Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenneyjust placed on restrictions again?» READ MORE:Say goodbye to your favorite restaurants. There s no relief coming. | OpinionInstead of backfilling the budget with federal CARES Act funds, Wolf and lawmakers should have considered business owners, but also families and studentsstruggling with education costsand virtual learning. After all, the pandemic has affected Pennsylvania’s countless communities in unimaginable ways. But lawmakers treated these dollars like a briefcase full of cash that nobody would miss — while passing a 7.5% increase in spending over last year. In 2021, taxpayers should prepare for the likelihood of proposed tax hikes.Clearly, Pennsylvania’s elected officials have misused federal funds — and the U.S. Treasury Department agrees. Indeed, its guidance for CARES Act spending limits possible uses to COVID-related expenses;they have already rejected one of Wolf’s earlier plansto use the money as a replacement for slot machine revenue. The act also prohibits use for Medicaid payments or employee salaries unrelated to COVID work. If the federal government rejects the budget, the state will find itself confronting a significant predicament.Sadly, Wolf and the legislature didn’t consider these eventualities when they completed the budget. Instead, during this bleak holiday season, they set up struggling families for a bigger tax bill next year.Nathan Benefield is vice president and chief operating officer of the Commonwealth Foundation.

It was a very, very dangerous situation inasmuch as many families with kids ignored the ropes and went to view Tutu from the ledges.Many of us asked those folks to kindly step back for their own safety, but we were rudely rebuffed. It was dark, the terrain is uneven, and the ledge unstable. Once the ranger told people to move back, there was compliance.Thursday, I spoke with a volunteer staffing the park information line. I expressed my concern over this urgent safety issue. I wanted him to relay my request to the park superintendent that additional ranger support is needed during peak viewing times, post-sunset and pre-dawn.Now that hordes of onlookers are streaming in, especially during those hours when there is no ranger present, there is, unfortunately, an immediate need for the National Park Service to increase its staffing of the area and regulate stupid behavior.I understand the personnel shortage the park is experiencing. However, this is an extraordinary security and safety situation that needs immediate attention.I have sent an email to the NPS via its general website platform. My fingers are crossed that someone with authority sees it and that appropriate staffing levels are instituted immediately, before it’s too late.Nina EejimaCaptain CookEducation fundingJohn Burnett’s article, “Lawmakers discuss the future of child care, early childhood education” (Tribune-Herald, Dec. 16 was a very good and interesting article to read.I understand that Hawaii is in a very difficult situation right now due to the coronavirus pandemic, but I think that early childhood education is something that we shouldn’t be cutting funds on.Our state’s economy is at an all-time low due to the drop in tourism, but there are other things we can and should be cutting funds for instead of our children’s education.Education is the most important thing for a growing child, and it should be our state’s job to make sure that our kids are getting the proper education even during this pandemic so they stay ahead and on track for their futures.Kids are our futures, and everyone knows that, so cutting early childhood funds could greatly impact that. Kids nowadays are already losing some of their education due to strict online learning, and parents are getting frustrated because they don’t know how to help their kids.There are many ways we can help this situation. The state can cut funding for the Oahu rail project. The rail has drained so much of the states money — $9 billion and counting — and the rail isn’t even done yet.Also, there are efforts like the state senators looking to legalize gambling. Why? We shouldn’t be focusing on legalizing gambling, we should be focusing on our people — helping the people who can’t work because of this pandemic and getting them their unemployment funds so that they can focus on feeding their families.Hawaii must focus on our kids’ education and help them get back into school to learn. There are so many things we can cut funding for and our children’s education shouldn’t be one of them.Dylan Antonio-AguinaldoHiloThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_202,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’m addressing this to members of the Minnesota Legislature.Another special legislative session is on the horizon, and with it comes renewed talk of passing a large-scale capital investment package, commonly referred to as the “bonding bill.” Many of you keep repeating that bonding is a top priority, but here we are, about to start the fifth special legislative session of the year, with no bonding bill in sight.I have grown weary of getting my hopes up, so let me ask you point-blank: What will it take to pass a bonding bill this special sessionIf you truly want to pass a bonding bill, you have the power to make it happen. You have already had several opportunities this year, but I’m willing to set those past failures aside. When Gov. Tim Walzcalls you back into sessionon Monday — in what will likely be your last chance to pass legislation before Election Day — I urge you to finally pass a bonding bill.As our communities continue to grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bonding bill is the foundation for economic recovery and prosperity going forward. By investing in critical infrastructure, the bonding bill will put thousands of Minnesotans to work and allow numerous important construction projects to proceed.Some of you are reluctant to vote for a bonding bill because it will add to the state deficit. While it is true that taking on additional debt will cost money, the real question is whether the state can afford not to do a bonding bill this year:Everything comes with a cost, and the hard truth is that the state’s budget concerns are not going to disappear overnight. As state leaders, you cannot simply ignore ongoing infrastructure and employment needs and expect the state deficit to magically go away. These are exactly the sorts of investments that are needed to inject life back into our economy so that we can chip away at the deficit and get back on the path to prosperity.There is a sense of urgency in passing the bonding bill now. First and foremost, the projects in need of these funds are not going to go away — and they will only become more expensive as time goes on.Further, there are political considerations with the possibility of changing legislative majorities and priorities. The political climate does not appear to be getting any more collaborative; this may be the best chance the Democrats and Republicans will have to put together a bill that satisfies both sides.Let’s face it — 2020 has been rough, and more tough decisions await in the year ahead. As you gear up for the October special session, you have an opportunity to help set Minnesota back on course. It’s time to pass a bonding bill.Greg Zylka is the mayor of Little Falls and president of the Coalition of Greater Minnesota Cities."

After weeks of this “new normal,” we are managing it. I dare say that our discomfort is beneficial.Did you know that uncomfortable and novel experiences actually trigger a unique part of the brain that fuels dopamine? According to an article in WebMD, dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter. Your body makes it, and your nervous system uses it to send messages between nerve cells. That’s why it’s sometimes called a chemical messenger.Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure. It’s a big part of our unique human ability to think and plan. It helps us strive, focus and find things interesting.Whether you love it or not, this unfamiliarity you are experiencing is creating a new you.As I noticed the new activity around me in my neighborhood, on the news reports and in my social media feed, I realized that change is shaping us. There are five ways that I have noticed a leveling up in our development. The acronym S.H.A.P.E. will serve as your reminder.Spiritual: This pandemic has literally brought the world to its knees. We may be uncomfortable, but we are growing spiritually in the midst of this. We are crying out to God of all creation for an answer and for healing. We are repenting for our wrongs. We are witnessing the lost being found. We are seeing when we were once blind. Yes, we are shaping up spiritually. And I’m glad about it.Horticulture: You have to acknowledge the grace of God that this pandemic hit at the time of gardening season. We could have been sitting inside while it was snowing outside. We would be miserable. But no, we are outside pulling weeds and planting new things. My husband just told me that he plans to extend our garden bed to make room for more. Yes, we need to make room for more, because new fruit is coming in the natural, the spiritual and the practical. If you are not cultivating the fallow ground right now, you’re missing a real move.Assimilation: This virus is training us in how to adapt. The more we are exposed to, the more adjustments we continue to make. We are adding new information to our knowledge base. Just think of how much we are learning now about business, health care, wellness, government, tax law, geriatric needs, our economy, food supply, communication, the value of life…the list goes on.Posterity: Our children will never forget this year. Many people have voiced their concerns about the potential negative impacts the coronavirus outbreak will have on the future generations in terms of the lapse in school days and missed milestones. Yet, I believe the longer lasting impact on our children will be how they become change agents and decision-makers simply because they observe the decisions we are making today.Experience: It appears that we are missing out on so much. But if you stop and think about it, what we are missing was old stuff. We are creating new experiences. Experience is a good teacher.As I consider the shaping we are undergoing, I keep picturing building blocks. Building blocks are essential elements that form something larger, something of immense importance. I’m reminded of Romans 5:3-5 that says, “We also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.” I call this the “building blocks of unshakeable faith.”I believe this is the season for building unshakeable faith, and through these elements of S.H.A.P.E., we shall receive it. Like dopamine, faith is a big part of our unique human ability to manage life. Rather than wanting to return to the norm, we should embrace this place of new shaping.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

minnpost_2020_214,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Trump’s attempt to censor histories of race hearkens back to early 20th century attempts by the federal government to stifle public criticism of racist laws and practices.Between 1917 and 1945, federal agencies, most prominently the FBI and Office of War Information, investigated Black newspapers and magazines like the Chicago Defender and The Messenger for sedition. The charge was that editorials they ran in opposition to lynching, poll taxes, and other aspects of Jim Crow reality were unpatriotic, especially in a time of war.The FBI viewed white local officials in the South as “experts” on “their Negroes.” And so, the FBI relied on local sheriffs, postmasters, and others to report on suspicious activity, including reading habits. Several local governments took advantage of the federal government’s assault on the First Amendment during World War I to try to stem the tide of the Great Black Migration. Southern cities were losing Black workers, many of whom read about jobs in the Defender and other northern papers. Some counties passed laws outlawing the sale of Black newspapers; others turned a blind eye to mob violence against Black newspaper sellers and readers.Under the guise of patriotism, Black people were beaten, even shot for daring to read or distribute the news. Through this mix of brutality and warping of the First Amendment, white officials hoped to stop the in-flow of information, the out-flow of cheap labor, and stifle any hint of dissent against racial apartheid.But Jim Crow officials and local thugs didn’t take into account the stealth activism of Pullman porters. Most whites who traveled the rails viewed the Pullman porters as happy and subservient, with no purpose in life other than to serve white travelers. In reality, many porters were college educated; they were forced to take jobs in the service industry only because Jim Crow laws and hiring practices made it impossible for them to get hired in professions reflective of their education and ability.Like many of his other outrageous acts this year, Trump’s call to create a “patriotic” history curriculum that erases critical analysis of the ways racism and slavery shaped this country’s laws, wealth, and cultural practices chillingly echoes early 20th-century racist practices. The OMB directive and Trump’s proclamation that anti-racist curriculum is unpatriotic mirror the charge that anti-Jim Crow editorials were sedition.Past attempts to stifle the Black press and present efforts to block anti-racist curricula is not “cancel culture:” This is the executive branch of the U.S. government using its weight to suppress freedom of speech and freedom of conscience.We must amplify and highlight the work of historians who are willing to unearth and analyze the ugly parts of our past, lest we be doomed to repeat the horrific excesses of violence and oppression. We must never forget how easy it is for one group to control all the levers of government, and use that power to crush dissent, to stymie progress, and to warp core elements of the Constitution until they are unrecognizable. And we must protest as long and loud as we can when we see it happening in our own time.Catherine Squires, Ph.D., is associate dean of theHumphrey School of Public Affairsat the University of Minnesota.

Now I only see these four walls of depression, of the memories and regrets of the thing I wish I could forget. I need to get away from this sadness. Music kinda helps I guess.5/30/20I constantly scare myself into thinking I have the illness, forgetting I’ve always had shortness of breath on the regular, from just walking up the steps. Now I get scared whenever someone sneezes or coughs, even on TV.5/31/20There have been many “rumors,” but no one knows if they’re true or not. But I’ll tell you what I’m going to do. I’m going to stay home, stay claustrophobic, and stay bored, because this will be all over eventually.

Reyes, age 14Our world as we know it will never be the same. The deadly and contagious virus named COVID-19 that originated in Wuhan, China, early this year has arrived in America. The spread occurred quicker than our government anticipated, and we were unprepared for what was to come. I watched the news that came from the White House with disbelief and extreme concern. I held my breath for a second, trying to make sense of what I was hearing.“I miss going out, but, mostly, I miss my grandparents.”Isolation has been difficult and sorrowful. It affected the moments I was able to spend time with friends and more importantly, go and stay with my dear grandparents, which I had always done on weekends. I couldn’t visit them because they were at high risk due to their underlying health issues. People were unable to go to work; some lost jobs. I felt very worried when my parents went to buy things we needed such as milk, bread, and water, and these basic things were scarce.I live with my older brother, younger sister, and my parents. My father and mother are both essential workers that do completely different types of jobs. I can tell it’s stressful on them. They worry about getting the virus and passing it onto us, but they also understand they are essential and have to do what needs to be done. I usually talk to everybody in my house, making sure they are OK and assisting them with anything they need help on. I have fun helping my younger sister create a fort, and making her laugh by telling her jokes or making funny faces whenever she is sad. She is young but quite a social butterfly, and it’s been hard for her not to be with her girl group. My older brother misses playing basketball and football with friends.And it’s hard on me. I miss going out, but, mostly, I miss my grandparents. I call them once or twice every day. We video chat, too, which is funny because they’re not the type to use technology. We get cut off a lot. My parents have taken us to ride by and see them from afar. We’re happy to see them but sad we can’t go hug them, kiss them and do things like before ...I try to ease my mind by indulging in my farming venture. This spring I started planting in my backyard. I have tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, eggplants, carrots, and cucumbers. I am not a professional gardener but I’m experimenting and learning different methods. My goal is to grow our own fresh fruit and vegetables because ... Why not? I’m encouraging others that now is the time to learn about all that. We don’t need to be a food desert if we all do as our ancestors did and tend to the land.My parents still manage to buy, cook, and serve the less fortunate by distributing food, clothes, hygiene care kits, wipes, hand sanitizer, gloves and donated masks to help stop the spread of this awful virus. I help my parents by putting together all that’s needed to distribute platters for the homeless around our city. I like to play their favorite songs that my father introduced me to and I ended up enjoying oldies: songs like “Celebration” by Kool & The Gang, “September” by Earth Wind & Fire, and “Smile” by Kirk Franklin.I’m thankful my family is well because we have had 30 relatives, friends, and community members pass away from this virus. The losses seemed to be back-to-back. I try my best to remain positive that this too shall pass and we can go back to a somewhat normal life, although this has rocked us so hard nothing will truly be normal again. May all this that has occurred, good and bad, change us all for the better.by Ellie Tyler, age 16When corona was first talked about, I’ll admit I thought it was a joke. I thought it would be treated like Ebola. People would make jokes; it’d be talked about, but I’d never have to experience it firsthand. I know that’s ignorant, but I have become so accustomed to seeing chaos on the news that I just became numb to it.“I have become so accustomed to seeing chaos on the news that I just became numb to it.”A little bit into quarantine I started to think a lot. The skeletons in my closet began to overwhelm me. I came clean to my friends and family about a lot of things. I wanted to just be honest and get everything off my chest, but with that came some of the worst pain I’ve ever felt. All I wanted to do was lie around. For a day or two I could barely stomach food. I couldn’t sleep alone for days. I’m pretty sure my little sister slept with me every night for seven or eight days.Even when my friends and family reassured me that they weren’t upset with me, I still felt an immense amount of guilt. At this point I’m doing a lot better. I just want to grow as a person and be the best me I can be. Nothing feels worse than saying you want to die and not knowing if you mean it or not. It was like I was teetering on the edge, between being stable and going insane. So yes, I am very grateful I was able to get everything off my chest, but I hated that feeling. It was a result of being stuck inside and not being able to keep busy.Quarantine just feels like such a hindrance in my life. I understand it isn’t all about me, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t suck. I had an acting class and vocal coaching coming up in April that I was very excited about. I turn 16 in June and don’t even know if I’ll be able to celebrate. I am supposed to go to camp in July and August. I wanted to apply to work at a café when I turned 16. Who knows if I will be able to do any of it.In general, my life has come to a halt. I was pretty isolated this school year. All my plans had kept me going. I have stuff to look forward to now, plans for after quarantine and things I’d like to learn more about in general. I’m just ready for this all to end. I want my life back. I know I’ll appreciate the things I took for granted a bit more.» READ MORE:What scares Pa. teens about climate change and how do they want to fight back, a year after massive global protests? | Opinionby Anthony Wallace, age 12It’s Coming!“The virus is deadly,” my grandma said as she watched the news, “and it is spreading quickly.” Her stern words best described the situation that was about to come. At first, I wasn’t alarmed. I didn’t really believe what she was saying. But after she showed me what was going on across the world ... it was a whole different story. Even before things hit the fan, the coronavirus pandemic was changing me — and I didn’t even realize it. I was scared, and so was my family. That unpleasant feeling was just the beginning.“This quarantine has taught me that we can adapt to trying times quickly.”It’s Here!After the virus came the shutdown, and it soon became clear that the world was being hit with more than just a virus. Hot on the tails of the pandemic came fear and animosity. Before the coronavirus, everyone I knew was happy and stayed close, but after this drastic change, people generally stopped communicating. Fear was here, and you could see it in people as they walked the streets, and with that dread was hostility. It changed my outlook on life, because knowing that there is a pandemic that is very deadly is terrifying. Even worse was the fact that learning from this pandemic can be difficult, especially for someone my age who doesn’t understand it so well. Altogether it left me heartbroken. But still, knowing that things may be like this for a while, I tried to live normally the best I could.So ... What Now?Even though I’m young, I quickly learned how to adapt. Now, the longer quarantine goes on the more I get used to it. While some things had drastically changed, such as school taking precautions to keep everyone safe by putting everything online, things aren’t as dire as I thought they’d be. I can’t do everything I used to do before quarantine, but I still get to have fun regardless, and that’s important in such a trying time. I’m doing great in school, I get to play basketball and eight-ball pool anytime, and I get to spend more time with family. So, while there is a pandemic going on, this quarantine has taught me that we can adapt to trying times quickly, and that people should still be appreciative, taking care of ourselves and others, especially the ones closest to you.» READ MORE:Too essential to isolate: Frontline workers on what scares them about the pandemicby K. Rob, age 16I’d imagine when most people are quarantined, they’d be afraid. What’s going to happen? Am I going to survive? What if I get the rona? Everybody’s panicking and buying up all the food and toilet paper, food they’re not even gonna eat, toilet paper they’re gonna waste on popping pimples and cleaning toilets.And the crazy part is, at some point in time, I imagined myself to be one of those people! But this was before the pandemic. Now, being in the middle of it, with wave two supposedly on the rise, I gotta say ... I thought this would be more ... interesting.“As a teenager who’s turning 16 in less than a month, any kind of rules or restrictions are something I can honestly say I hate.”Like, life hasn’t changed a whole lot, other than stores closing earlier and free bus rides, so I can’t complain, I have food and a roof over my head. Like — the biggest thing I have to worry about is my summer, and there’s almost no chance of that happening anyway. So while I’m not really ... concerned about the virus, I still have a problem with it.Why? Corona is restricting worldwide movement, and as a teenager who’s turning 16 in less than a month, any kind of rules or restrictions are something I can honestly say I hate. I was looking forward to this summer and those “ayy, 16, summer, 2020, now i can actually do stuff type vibes, but all I’m getting is “stay in the house, better yourself, and hope you don’t die.”Corona, to me ... has been a huge, fat, firetruck-red “Get It Together” sign in my face. Like I don’t have 40 other people telling me all the rest of the time. But it’s cool. People are saying we’re entering a new age in time, like we didn’t already create new genders, so now, that we’re really about to evolve ... like, globally? It’s kind of overwhelming. But I’m cool with that.I don’t even know what to think about corona: I just know that the world is confused, and I’m sitting here eating Doritos, like nothing’s gonna happen, and I’m cool with that. It’s a myriad of different feelings in my body, and I’m cool with that, I feel like regardless of the world around me, I’m just cooling.Maybe I don’t even care if I get itMaybe I’m scared of the futureMaybe I’ll go outside one day without my maskMaybe they’ll put 5G towers in the sky and mess up my brainwavesMaybe everything’ll be fineAt least I have more time to do what I wantMaybe I’ll come out of this thing three times better.Maybe I’ll know more. Maybe I’ll get taller. These weights look pretty attractive now that I’ve been bored for three weeks straight. I guess I’ll just listen to what everyone’s saying and wash my hands."
suffolknewsherald_2020_51,"Published 9:09 pm Friday, July 10, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Elizabeth HarrisSummer is a reality check for recent high school graduates. Those college admission letters that created such excitement have been tempered by the new knowledge of exactly how much parents and students will have to pay or borrow to make up the difference between what financial aid and scholarships will provide. This is particularly true in the present pandemic, when some parents have lost their jobs and students are questioning whether they will get the full “college experience” they were expecting.Tuition and room and board are not the only college costs. Textbooks, student fees, meals that are not covered by the college plan, and transportation all add up and, in some cases, provide an unwelcome surprise of the actual cost of a year of college away from home.Most students and parents have at least considered the option of going to community college for a year or two to complete general education requirements. However, not everyone realizes just how much money this option can save. Community colleges across Virginia have instituted a new program called “Guided Pathways.” The goal is to ensure that every course a student at a community college takes will transfer as a degree requirement to the university of the student’s choice or ensure a student has the possibility of earning a career certificate in the most efficient way possible. Tidewater Community College has articulation agreements with almost every Virginia four-year university, and students have guaranteed admission to the college of their choice if they take certain coursework and maintain the required grade point average.Another way students can cut college costs is to complete a career certificate at TCC so that they can get a better-paying job to pay their living expenses while completing a four-year degree. A student might not want that job for a lifetime, but a higher-paying job would certainly enable a student to finish college in a chosen career field with far less student loan debt.A third way to lower college costs significantly is by taking College Level Examination Program tests and earning college credit for what a student has already learned or is willing to study independently. A student can check if the college he or she is planning to attend will take CLEP credits, and in which subjects, by searching the name of the college and CLEP. Although some selective colleges do not accept credit by CLEP examination, most public and private colleges in Virginia do. Successfully passing CLEP tests can earn a student up to a year of college credits at very minimal cost.Excellent resources are available from the State Council on Higher Education in Virginia at schev.edu/123gotoolkits. Resource guides on multiple topics related to college choices are available at www.ecmc.org/students/resource-guides.html.Embarking on higher education is not a social decision — it is a business decision. Maturity means delaying present gratification for future long-term benefits. Now is the time to make wise educational decisions and wise financial choices.Elizabeth Harris is a recently retired high school teacher and long-time adjunct instructor in history and humanities at TCC.

minnpost_2020_185,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .She was there in the hospital waiting room talking about hot dish. She and her family would soon be taking her son, my good friend, off life support and she was recounting casserole ingredients. Young, judgmental me was appalled: How could a mother be so shallow at such a painful timeNearly four years into Trump’s presidency, months under the cloud of a pandemic and since George Floyd, and weeks before a momentous election, I’ve been thinking about that hot dish and wondering whether it was rice, noodle, potato or what. All talk, all thought, these days is big, too big.My people and I have spent four years convulsing about Trump’s latest, walking untold miles and talking all the points and even some of the counters. We scroll and we stroll, expressing outrage and bewilderment, only occasionally extracting higher meaning and hope. Conversations that at first felt like sport became group therapy became just the way it is, the way we are. When 2020 blew in with its watershed of alternative-reality realities, including Minneapolis becoming the poster city for racial injustice, our ability to process it all, let alone deeply, threw us into a changed brain state, literally.Whether we’re tuned in to them or not, we all have neuroreceptors that constantly assess cues of safety and danger and communicate them to our autonomic nervous system, whose purpose is to keep us alive. This is one of the key premises of polyvagal theory, a therapy approach that’s becoming widespread and that Tove Borgendale, a Bloomington somatic bodyworker who specializes in trauma and healing, teaches to mental health professionals worldwide. According to Borgendale, when incoming signals tip from manageable to frantic to overwhelmed, our prefrontal cortex, or thinking brain, begins to shut down and we can numb out or freak out. This renders us useless in making sound decisions and taking constructive action around, oh, reclaiming our democracy and living lives less consumed by the 24-hour news cycle.Talking about hot dish unknowingly helped my dying friend’s mom move her nervous system to an emotionally regulated state from which she could do what she had to do: say goodbye to her boy. Through her despair, she found it within herself to reach out to those of us in the waiting room and talk about something ordinary and soothing. Both helped her stay sane. What sounded trite may well have been her bridge back to functioning.Leave it to cream of mushroom soup and all the memories and comfort it evokes to return us to our more grounded selves. Small talk can do the same. What is the weather if not mindfulness What is baseball if not play What are falling leaves — falling snow! — if not confirmation that nothing lasts forever The big talk is only going to get bigger in the coming weeks. Our nervous system needs the “little” things, too, and so do we.Kitty Shea is a Twin Cities freelance writer and editor."
suffolknewsherald_2020_105,"Published 10:22 pm Tuesday, June 2, 2020ByTracy AgnewBy QuaWanna BannarbieSome years ago, my young sons were preparing to go to church on Sunday morning when my youngest son looked up and asked my husband, “Daddy, can I smell like you?”My husband was sitting on the sofa brushing my son’s hair as Joshua sat between his legs somewhat leaned back against his father’s chest. In that position, I suppose he was able to smell his father’s cologne and decided that he liked it.His dad thought the question was a bit comical and asked Joshua why he wanted to smell like him. Joshua simply replied, “because you smell good.” My older son, Judah, was sitting in the living room nearby and overheard the request of his younger brother. When he heard that his Daddy was willing to oblige his younger brother, he quickly chimed in and requested to have some cologne also. My husband was tickled but delighted to spray a bit of his Cool Water fragrance on the boys. It was a heartwarming moment for me to witness.I can’t tell you the number of times that my children have mistaken that their father was in the house simply because the trace of his scent lingered long after he had left for work. Sometimes, their noses fool them. However, it must be quite comforting to have a scent as a reminder of the presence of a loved one.To me, fragrances are metaphorical.One of my favorite songs by Bill and Gloria Gaither titled “There is something about that name” relates our Savior, Jesus, to a fragrance after the rain. You have not known such beauty as waking up on a Sunday morning after a good night’s rain in the country. The transition from walking inside the house that is smothered with the smell of Grandma’s biscuits to walking outside the house to smell the hint of red Georgia clay is a little piece of heaven. I think fragrances help us to hold on to meaningful things.Recently, I was on the hunt for a special herb to purchase. I love herbs. I have grown herbs in my backyard garden since I first began gardening simply because I absolutely adore their smell. I first became acquainted with lemongrass last Christmas when my Jamaican mother-in-law boiled some to make me a cup of tea. I also love herbal teas. I had forgotten the smell of this moment with my mother-in-law until some research I was doing regarding the care of peach trees revealed that lemongrass is a companion plant of peach trees. I had to have some. I searched our local garden stores until I found lemongrass at Kelly’s Nursery on Godwin Boulevard.When I was preparing to plant the lemongrass in the backyard, I discovered that lemongrass carries much of its fragrance within its roots. It caused me to think how different fragrances represent events, people and pleasantries in our lives that are in many ways rooted within our memory.I did not grow up with my father in my home. But I absolutely love that my children have this memory planted within them of the scent of their father’s presence. It says something to me that they desired to have that same smell with them and that they recognize it even when my husband is not physically within their reach. But his fragrance lingers.As children of God, I believe we also have occasions when we experience the presence of our Heavenly Father surrounding us by the distinct hint of a pleasant odor that fills our places of worship, our prayer closet or just wakes us up in the morning. Right now, we need the hint of His fragrance. For some, it may be found in mint leaves. For others, it may be the smell of burning wood in the embers of a fire pit. At times of crisis like these when peace is being challenged, I think we all wish to be like my son Joshua, pressed against the bosom of our Heavenly Father and smelling His presence and wanting to smell like Him. He smells good because He is good.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

eugeneweekly_2020_7,"We ve got issues. On June 26, after three months away, I returned to the Cascades Raptor Center. I looked forward to resuming volunteer work in the wildlife hospital. I also wondered if, after three months at home, I still knew how to handle a bird. Working with injured wildlife is tricky. None of the animals you meet are there because they thought it was a day spa. Handling a wild raptor to provide medical care, whether it’s a great horned owl or an American kestrel, requires a careful approach and regular practice. It takes confidence and delicacy to keep a bird safely tucked between your arms while ensuring its talons remain clear of your teammates’ hands so they can perform an exam or give medicine. Osprey can be especially difficult; imagine wrangling an unruly umbrella that refuses to stay closed and has eight hook-shaped talons where the handle should be. As I walked into the new expanded wildlife hospital, one thing was clear: I’d need to revive my handling skills quickly, because we were full. Summer is always a busy time for wildlife rehab. At the Raptor Center, we see a lot of young birds that are displaced from their nest or juveniles that left the nest only to be caught by a cat or fly into a window. We saw 78 birds in June, a record month for our hospital. June 2017 had previously set the record with 66 patient intakes. With a record number of birds coming through our hospital this year, the question on everyone’s mind is, “Are we seeing more birds because of the COVID-19 pandemic?” “People are probably doing more in their yards,” says Louise Shimmel, the Cascades Raptor Center executive director, “but there’s also a huge variation year to year.” In short, we can’t know for sure. What we do know is that amid the ongoing crises, the community is still taking the time to help wildlife and has helped us provide care to 297 birds as of Aug. 16. That is the total number of patient intakes the center had in 2019. The entire staff at the Cascades Raptor Center is grateful for everyone’s support. Like most organizations, the Raptor Center took safety precautions to limit the potential exposure of staff to the coronavirus. A great many jobs have adapted to using Zoom and other software to facilitate remote work, but training and feeding an eagle over video chat just isn’t feasible. So the staff decided to reduce the number of people on-site and temporarily furloughed the volunteer crew. Overnight, the center’s animal care team fell from the equivalent of 17 full-time employees to just seven. “We have an amazing group of hardworking staff,” bird curator Kit Lacy says. “From our administrative staff making sure we have funds to continue operating to the people that were here every day, day in and day out, to take care of these animals.” Lacy points out that the Raptor Center is a community-supported organization; we don’t receive government funding. According to Shimmel, education programs, admissions and gift shop sales constitute an average of 40 percent of the center’s total revenues.“That’s a big chunk we’re missing for the busiest part of the year,” she adds. After closing at the end of March, the Raptor Center reopened to the public June 2 with social-distancing measures in place. All visits must be booked online to reduce crowds, and masks are required, following the governor’s order. If you’ve been feeling cooped up at home and are ready to get outdoors, it’s a perfect time to schedule a visit to the Raptor Center. Puck, one of our American kestrel ambassadors who is known for flying to the front of his aviary to see visitors, has been especially excited to see the public return. Our ongoing mission is to foster connections between humans and wildlife through education and rehabilitation. Finding opportunities for connection is important right now. I hadn’t realized how much I missed it until I came back. Wildlife medicine is never easy. There’s a lot of poop, and many birds we see are injured beyond recovery. But every day, it gives me hope. When an owl is hit by a car, or a Cooper’s hawk flies into a window, we simply see a living being that is suffering and deserves care. At a time when the world seems divided on every issue, helping injured wildlife is something people come together to dopurely because it is the right thing. If you find an injured animal, always contact your local wildlife rehabilitator before approaching it. If you find a bird that seems to have fallen out of a nest, look for parents nearby, and do not pick up the animal unless instructed to do so by a wildlife official or licensed rehabilitator. Robin FitzClemen started volunteering at the Cascades Raptor Center in 2017. He studies science storytelling at the University of Oregon’s School of Journalism and Communication and can often be found filming and photographing wildlife at various parks around Eugene. Green herons are his favorite bird."
minnpost_2020_234,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial from theMankato Free Press.Ready, set, vote.Minnesota opens voting on Friday, 47 days before Election Day, which has become effectively the deadline for this most simple and most important of our civil duties. The Gopher State goes for the polls like none other; we regularly lead the nation in voter turnout. This long window of opportunity in which to vote is one of many reasons for that level of participation.And Minnesotans enthusiastically embraced the expansion of absentee voting even before the coronavirus pandemic. Pre-pandemic, no-excuse absentee voting was a time-saving convenience. Today it also serves a public health purpose.Secretary of State Steve Simon told Minnesota Public Radio News this week already more than 80,000 requests for absentee ballots had been received. Simon said he expects absentee voting to account for more than a third of the state’s total. Since absentee votes made up more than half the votes in Minnesota’s lower-turnout primaries in August, that’s certainly plausible.Minnesota is not unique in easing absentee voting, although few states have as lengthy a period for voting. Only six states still require a reason for absentee voting, and several states, mostly in the West, vote entirely by mail. A heavy dose of late-arriving absentee votes may elongate Election Night into the following days. It’s important to remember that a late vote count does not mean an invalid vote count.President Donald Trump and his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, each plan to campaign Friday in Minnesota, underlining not only the opening of voting here but the competitive nature of the state in this election cycle. No Republican has won Minnesota’s electoral votes since Richard Nixon in 1972, but Trump fell some 45,000 votes of carrying Minnesota four years ago and vows to close that gap.There are, of course, more offices at stake in the 2020 election than the presidency. Minnesota has its regularly scheduled Senate election for the seat now held by Tina Smith, who was appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton and won a special election in 2018 to fill out the term. All eight of the state’s House seats are up, as are all of the seats in the Minnesota Legislature and plenty of judicial, county and municipal offices.So yes, there’s some homework to do. But once you know who you’re voting for, there’s this good reason to finish the job early: You can tune out what figures to be a noisy and distasteful gutter fight at the top of the ticket. Get ‘er done.Republished with permission."
philinquirer_2020_42,"Two theologians debate a Catholic Trump voter.When Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last month, abortion became a key issue in the 2020 election. Previously back burnered by both former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump’s campaigns, Ginsburg’s death left a hole in the Supreme Court, allowing Trump, who has been called America’s most pro-life president, to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the bench. Unlike the pro-choice Ginsburg, Barrett has spoken out loudly against abortion, and it’s possible thatRoe v. Wade, the landmark court case that legalized abortion, could be overturned if she is confirmed.Meanwhile, Biden, a Catholic,has pledged to makeRoe v. Wade“the law of the land.”As Catholic voters head to the polls on Election Day (or mail in their ballots early , they must make a decision between two candidates: Biden, himself a Catholic, who is pro-choice, but has promised human rights and social service policies in line with Christian teachings, and Trump, whose pro-life stance is strong, but other policies limit access to health care for many people.We turned to Catholics with opposing views to debate:Can pro-life Catholics vote for Joe Biden?By Thomas Groome and Richard GaillardetzMay pro-life Catholics vote for former Vice President Joe Biden? Our consciences lead us to say an unqualified “yes,” and then some. First, theUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, echoing the teaching of Popes Francis and Benedict, makes clear that Catholics should not be single-issue voters. While we may not vote for candidates because they support abortion, we can do so for the totality of their views. This reflects Pope Francis’ statement that “equally sacred” are the lives of those already born.Further, and recognizing that other Catholics may reach a different prudential judgment, out of the depths of our Catholic faith, we are convinced that not only may we vote for Biden, but even must do so, and for grave moral reasons.As faithful Catholic Christians, we accept the teaching of our church that “every human life, from the moment of conception until death, is sacred.” This being said, we recognize thatmore than 80% of Americans favor allowing abortion, at least in certain circumstances.The greatest Catholic theologian, Thomas Aquinas, taught that laws must reflect “the consensus of the governed” if they are to be effective. So, until the great majority of Americans oppose abortion, Catholics cannot impose our moral norms on the rest of society.“A President Biden will make it more possible for people to avoid unintended pregnancies.”So what are Catholics like us to do with our ethical convictions that cannot — at least at this time — become the law of the land? Again, Aquinas advises that when applying general moral principles, one must take account of the social context and discern how best to apply them. In such circumstances, Aquinas advised that we are to choose the greater good and the lesser evil. The greater good that is achievable now is to significantly reduce the number of abortions with effective social services. Fully confident in the deep commitments of Biden to his Catholic faith, and especially to its social teachings, he — not Donald Trump — is the one who will implement this accommodation.Our best warrant is the record of the Obama-Biden administrations. Over their eight years, and by improved health care and social services, theyreduced the U.S. abortion rate by 27%.A President Biden will make it more possible for people to avoid unintended pregnancies, and that all who desire to bring a pregnancy to term will have the necessary health care and then the resources needed to care for their child after birth.We’re also confident that a Biden-Harris administration will champion an aggressive program to promote adoptions by strengthening the Adoption Assistance Act and streamlining adoption procedures. Further, providing health care that makes available improved means of birth control cangreatly reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. Even for Catholics who accept church teaching forbidding artificial means of birth control, such social services can be seen as choosing the lesser evil — to abortion.Now contrast a Biden-Harris administration to four more years of a Trump-Pence one. Trump has done many things that can be deemed evil. This includes his refusal to address the 400-year pandemic of racism, his approving of Nazi-like groups and their hate-filled rhetoric, his contributing to environmental destruction, his disrespect for immigrants, his dumbfounding denial of the scientific evidence regarding COVID-19, his incessant lying, and the list goes on.It is not for us to dictate the conscience-based decisions of other Catholics. But speaking from the depths of our own souls, not only may we vote for Biden-Harris, but believe we must do so. To do otherwise would be contrary to our consciences — our sin.Thomas Groome is a senior professor of theology and religious education at Boston College. Richard Gaillardetz is the Joseph chair in Catholic systematic theology at Boston College.By Bernadette RepiskyThere was once a time when a politician looking to be the Democratic contender for president of the United States declared abortions should be “legal, safe, and rare.” That was Hillary Clinton during her first failed presidential bid in 2008. Today, the Democratic Party led by Joe Biden would reject her and those words. The former senator from Delawareused to consistently vote to at least limit abortion and the federal funding of it. No more.Biden has devolved on the issue of life. For every positive move Donald Trump has made to defend life, Biden has promised to reverse, repeal, and rescind it. He has declared he will makeRoe v. Wade“the law of the land.” And he said he willend the Mexico City policy that bans federal dollars going to programs overseas that provide abortion. In an affront to religious liberty, Biden also supports policies that would force organizations like theLittle Sisters of the Poor to cover contraception and abortion-causing drugs in their health plans.Biden’s silence as high-ranking members of his party call for looser and looser restrictions on abortion,including allowing abortion through the ninth month of pregnancy, speaks volumes.“For every positive move Trump has made to defend life, Biden has promised to reverse, repeal, and rescind it.”With that in mind, Catholic voters must examine the positions of Republican President Trump and Democratic candidate Biden on this issue.“The threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority because it directly attacks life itself, because it takes place within the sanctuary of the family, and because of the number of lives destroyed,” statedArchbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kan., United States Catholic Conference of Bishops’ chairman, on pro-life activities. “Abortion is an intrinsic evil, meaning that it is never permitted or morally justified, regardless of individual circumstances or intentions.”The Biden-Harris ticket has accepted an endorsement and money from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.“Life is the preeminent issue,”Archbishop Nelson Pérez of Philadelphia saidthis summer. He also commented on the youth who attend the annual pro-life rally in Washington, D.C., attended for the first time by a sitting president in January.“At least 70% are young adults. They clap, they sing, they hold their banners. They’re just on fire.” I can personally attest to this.These young people embrace science and truth. With its own DNA separate from the mother, created male or female, life begins at conception. The 3D ultrasound image is a baby, a human being, not a “choice.” These youth are the future. A Biden presidency, however, would jeopardize our faith and our country. Not only is Biden “unabashedly pro-abortion,” the Democrats are pushing America toward socialism, a “soul-robbing ideology that always and inevitably leads to totalitarianism, where the government presumes to put itself in the place of God, in the lives of its subservient citizens,” saidFather Edward Meeks of Maryland. Socialists view our church as “an enemy to be destroyed, or, at the very least, to be silenced and marginalized.”The Gospel tells us the unborn John the Baptist leaped in the womb at the mere presence of Jesus in Mary’s womb. Is there any doubt that we’re to honor and respect these yet-to-be-born lives?Bernadette Repisky is a college-educated “suburban housewife” enthusiastically supporting President Donald Trump again. A practicing Catholic, she’s happily married and the mother of four adult children.Do we still need presidential debates?Should Supreme Court justices have term limits?Should the U.S. privatize the Postal Service?"
suffolknewsherald_2020_26,"Published 6:23 pm Friday, August 7, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieHate stuns me. How hate mobilizes people to act so violently stuns me. I have been watching several history films lately. I watched the 2014 historical drama film, “Selma,” for the very first time just a few days ago. The movie is the cinematic retelling of the events surrounding the demonstrations that took place at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. I watched “Selma” because I wanted my children to know Congressman John Lewis and the Rev. C.T. Vivian. I wanted them to remember their work.I avoided watching the movie when it originally released, because I have a very hard time watching movies about the harsh treatment of my people. I have yet to watch “Harriet” or “12 Years a Slave.” I can never watch a movie for entertainment alone. Motion pictures set my imaginings in motion. Stories remain with me long after the credits are done. Two women from “Selma” remained on my mind days after I watched it. They share the same first name. Do you know Viola Jackson and Viola Liuzzo?They were two mothers. They both responded to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s call for voting rights marches to achieve the right for black people to vote in Alabama. The two of them each made a great sacrifice in Selma.Sadly, Ms. Viola Jackson is not well remembered. If you enter a Google search for more information about her, little information is there. She is most known for her relationship to Jimmie Lee Jackson. Her son was protecting his mother from the abuse of a state trooper during a voting rights protest when he was shot. He died from the bullet wound from that state trooper’s gun. Mr. Jackson gave his life for the cause of freedom, and I feel Viola’s life ended as well. Perhaps that is the reason we know little of her story. My imagination wanders to how proud she must have been of Jimmie Lee’s service in the U.S. Army and his involvement in the civil rights movement. As a military veteran myself, my heart breaks to know that her son came home from honorable service only to die at the hands of senseless violence. I am grateful for his sacrifice both on the front lines in uniform and the front lines in Selma.I was astonished to realize my ignorance of Viola Liuzzo’s existence. Not only does Viola share her name with Viola Jackson and actress, Viola Davis, she also shares her age of death with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both she and Dr. King died at the age of 39. Although Viola Liuzzo preceded him in death, they were alike in that cause of death. Both killed by hatred. Viola Liuzzo, a mother of five, left her family in Detroit. She drove herself by way of her 1963 Oldsmobile to Selma, Ala., to join what she deemed “everybody’s fight for racial equality.” Hours after the group of demonstrators arrived in Montgomery, Ala., on March 25, 1965, achieving the goal of a march from Selma to Montgomery, the celebration for activist and working mother, Viola Liuzzo ended with two gunshots to her head. She was traveling with a young black man as she was shuttling marchers back to Selma in her own vehicle. A group of Klansmen spotted them and killed her.As I learned of the Violas of Selma I was reminded of the 1998 biography of Congressman John Lewis, “Walking with the Wind: A Memoir of the Movement.” He describes women like these Violas in this way, “wives and mothers in their 40s and 50s, hardworking, humorous, no-nonsense, incredibly resilient women who had carried such an unimaginable weight through their own lives and had been through so much unspeakable hell that there was nothing left on this earth for them to be afraid of — who showed us the way to mobilize in the towns and communities where they lived.” To wives and mothers today and those who love them, remember Viola Liuzzo and Viola Jackson. I pray that we will have as much resilience. Now that we know who they are, never lose sight of the birthing pains they endured to deliver the rebirth of such a stubborn nation where our hatred stuns us.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

According to the National Fire Protection Association, it is actually the biggest day, followed by the day before Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.The reason for this is, by and large, unattended cooking. With typical Thanksgiving celebrations often involving lots of cooking going on and many distractions with family and friends coming and going, that’s hardly a surprise.This year’s Thanksgiving will probably look a lot different for many of us, and that’s due to another safety issue — COVID-19. In order to reduce their exposure to the virus, many people are paring down the number of people invited to their celebrations, or keeping it just to their immediate family.However, many people will likely still be cooking a big meal. With so many delicious uses for Thanksgiving leftovers, there’s no reason to skimp on the quality or quantity of food even if there’s fewer people there.With that in mind, fire safety is still a priority on this holiday.

philinquirer_2020_15,"I’m bombarded with sound and chaos. It’s a visual and auditory assault.I stand in front of the ICU doors and remember what this unit was like before March 2020. It was a spacious and controlled environment. Now it’s Temple University Hospital’s COVID ICU, and the difference between then and the present never ceases to jar me, even now, 10 months into this deadly pandemic. As the doors swing open, I’m bombarded with sound and chaos. It’s a visual and auditory assault. I start my shift wondering the same thing I do every shift: Who will die today?As nurses gather for shift change, the central monitor is beeping at our station. The patient’s oxygen saturation is dropping, and his ventilator is alarming as well. We discuss the need to prone him (position him on his stomach after shift change.Ventilator alarms have a distinct sound, similar to a car horn. In the COVID ICU, where COVID pneumonia requires the highest ventilator support for extended periods of time, they sound all day and all night. The respiratory therapists responsible for ventilated patients and those on high-flow oxygen are the unsung heroes of the pandemic. Several of these Temple therapists have contracted the virus due to their prolonged exposure to the aerosolized particles that carry it. They have all returned to work, dangerous though it may be. We need them.I take report from the night-shift nurse and learn that I have three patients today. I want to complain, but I’m reminded of the nurses throughout the hospital who struggle with six-patient assignments. I think of the overworked patient-care assistants, with 20 or 30 patients. I think of all the X-ray techs, pharmacy techs, and housekeepers, who are burning out, and the lab personnel, who are exhausted. No ancillary staff has been spared the physical, mental, and emotional toll of this pandemic. I accept my assignment without comment. Only the alarms sound.» READ MORE:Inside Philadelphia s busiest COVID-19 hospitalAfter report, we assemble four nurses and a respiratory therapist, put on our personal protective equipment (PPE , and place the alarming patient on his belly. Lying in the prone position typically requires a 1:1 assignment — one nurse to one patient. But no patient gets 1:1 care anymore. There are simply too many very ill patients. Turning sedated adults in a hospital bed without dislodging tubes or lines is a physically demanding and tricky endeavor, but we do it every day now. His oxygen saturation rises immediately.As I take off the PPE, an IV alarm sounds in another patient’s room. It’s not unusual for COVID patients to be receiving six to 10 infusions at a time. Pain medication, sedation, blood thinners, vasoactive drips, paralytics, and antiarrhythmics are all delivered through central IV lines. To an outsider, it looks like a tangled mess of tubing. Even for a skilled ICU nurse, it’s a complicated task to maintain each drip, titrate the medications, and ensure that none of them run out before a new bag is hung.» READ MORE:Plummeting morale, decreasing staff, and shrinking resources leave Pa. nurses in desperate need | Expert OpinionI glance at the patient’s nurse, who has several medications in her hand. She has it. We nod to each other because no words are necessary.The low-pitched honk of a kidney dialysis machine sounds. Maintaining this life-support equipment requires replacing and emptying heavy bags of fluid round the clock to ensure that the circuit doesn’t clot. If that were to happen, the patient would lose considerable blood volume — yet another emergent situation. I put on my N95, face shield, gown, and gloves and change the dialysate bag because the patient’s nurse is busy at another bedside.I still have yet to see my own patients. At this point, I’ve been on duty for an hour.The telephone rings and rings and rings. Concerned family members call all day long for updates. They long to be with their loved ones. Unit secretaries are invaluable, but we don’t always have one. The phone also rings with admissions. The patients never stop rolling through the door.Most of the single ICU rooms have been converted to doubles. The rooms are crammed with twice as much equipment and every electrical socket is utilized. However, only one of the two patients can be hooked up to the monitors at the nurse’s station. For a nurse to hear the portable alarm attached to the other patient through the glass, it must be on the highest audible setting. My patient’s alarm is blaring because his oxygen level is dropping while he drinks some water.In an effort to keep this patient from being intubated, he is receiving 60 liters of oxygen at 100% (people typically receive 2 to 6 liters of oxygen at 28% through a high-flow nasal cannula. He has been in the ICU for two weeks and witnessed many body bags being wheeled out of the unit. His roommate is sedated on the ventilator, and the alarm is making him anxious. From the hallway, I instruct him to supplement his oxygen with the non-rebreather face mask as I put on my PPE. He complies, and his oxygen level rises.» READ MORE:Hospitalized with coronavirus, I fought for my life as I watched the death toll riseI enter the room and the loneliness and fear are palpable.

philinquirer_2020_0,"The GOP s growing lock on the American working class under Trump spread in 2020 to Latine and even Black voters. Are future Democrats doomed?When the first election returns started coming in from Texas’ Zapata County — a hot, dusty corner of the Rio Grande Valley with oil rigs and a large Latine population — some online voting-fraud sleuths thought there’d been a voting machine glitch, or worse. How could a county that had voted nearly 2-1 for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton show President Donald Trumpnarrowly ahead?The reality is that baffled, faraway Twitter posters and their assumptions about Texas’ Hispanic vote hadn’t encountered actual voters like 72-year-old retired social worker and teacher Maria Elia Ramos of Rio Grande City, who shrugged off Trump’s xenophobic and sometimes racist rhetoric as well as hectoring family members on Facebook to vote for the GOP. “We have a right to decide,”she told the Los Angeles Times. “Our family values are more in line with Republicans.”Zapata County’s centrist Democratic longtime congressman, Henry Cuellar,told the Texas Tribunethat the heavily Latine region is “homogenous, deeply religious, pensively patriotic, socially conservative, and it’s hurting economically.” Indeed, for these mostly working-class voters, it was arguably “the economy, stupid.” They feared some of the national Democratic rhetoric on the oil industry and the U.S. Border Patrol — two big sources of jobs — while many took special notice of Trump’s name on this summer’s $1,200 federal stimulus check.Yes, Democrat Joe Biden is America’s president-elect, and for that, we can thank hissurging support in the suburbs, where disgust over Trump’s nonstop lying, his overt racism and misogyny, and his threats to democracy drove higher turnout and flipped some college-educated men who’d voted for the faux billionaire in 2016. But now that it’s nearly two weeks since Election Day, and a blurry, complicated mosaic is slowly coming into focus, it’s clear that the bigger, long-term picture ought to alarm Democrats.It’s not only that Republicansgained House seatsand have a good chance ofclinging to Senate control, or that Trump’s outrageously unfit presidency — which climaxed with his lethal, botched handling of COVID-19 — somehow netted him at least 10 million more votes than his shock election four years earlier. It’s a question of where — and more importantly, who — those additional Trump votes actually came from.The Democratic Party’s long-term hopes for a 21st century majority haslong hung on the notionthat Republicans had become largely the party of white working-class men, and that this group’s slow demographic decline, as America became more and more diverse, would spell doom for the GOP. But what if Republicans becamethe nation’s blue-collar party, period — and broadened its appeal to millions of middle-class Hispanics and Blacks? The 2020 results not only showed the conservative party making inroads toward exactly that, but raised a giant question mark: Would a Trump-y candidate who’d actually delivered tangible things to the working class, and who wasn’t so racially offensive, have won the White House?Exit polls (which are imperfect, but what we have to work with show Biden outperforming Clinton only with white men (which speaks somewhat to the role misogyny played in 2016, whichI wrote about here. Meanwhile, Trump retained his narrow advantage with white women and — significantly — not only gained support with Black, Hispanic, and Asian American voters butperformed better with these groupsthan any Republican has in years.Nationwide, the gains were not enormous, and Biden — as expected — won a majority of all three groups (and did well in states like Arizona andGeorgiathat had seen over-the-top, GOP-led anti-immigrant or voter-suppression policies . But it’s significant that Trump’s national increase in nonwhite support came even as the president’s often racist rhetoric of resentmentsparked long voting linesin the rural counties and small towns of the predominantly white Rust Belt and elsewhere, as his blatant demagoguery reactivated millions of once-discouraged voters who’d turned away from politics after the brutal end of the Industrial Revolution.The long-term importance of the 2020 election was that it slammed an exclamation point on the surprising trend that defines today’s American politics: A nation that is divided somewhat along the lines that the pundits and political scientists are trained to look for — income and race — but is mainly split intothese two hostile tribes: Those who earned a college degree, and those who did not. Thus, our presidential elections swing less on who’s got the best health-care plan (I mean, Trumpdoesn’t even have one, right? , but on our cultural allegiance to ourincreasingly siloed communities— and our growing distrust, even hatred, of the other side.The current zeitgeist was nailed in acover piece for Politico Magazineby Tim Alberta that looked at how the preelection polls failed to capture a deeper working-class resentment toward the Democratic Party, as experienced by a centrist Democrat who barely survived her race, Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin. He wrote: “At the root of our polarization, Slotkin argued, is one half of the country believing it is enlightened and the other half resenting it.” Alberta asked if the Democrats could “embrace a ‘different era,’ one that demands rapid and unremitting evolution on all things cultural, without condescending to those who are slow to come around?”Understanding the 2020 election in those stark, simple terms — the enlightened vs. the resentful — explains a lot of things that experts have been fumbling to understand. That includes not just Trump’s strength in places like the Rio Grande Valley, but also his win in Florida, even as voters there also overwhelminglyapproved a $15 minimum wage, a policy endorsed by Biden — albeit not loudly enough —and scorned by Trump’s GOP.Currently, I’m writing a book (slated for 2022 publication by William Morrow, with the working title ofResent U. about how college/noncollege became the San Andreas Fault of American politics, even though most of us still don’t see it. For example, many commentators were shocked by this spring’s George Floyd protests, not only in their size but diversity, with whites often making up the majority at marches. That’s because the racial reckoning protests were, first and foremost, a revolution of the highly educated. The academic researchersDana Fisher and Michael Heaney foundthat a staggering 82% of white protesters but also — and this may be even more significant — 67% of the Black marchers held college degrees.The 2020 elections consistentlyrevealed a splitbetween young, often better-educated Black voters — who were the front line of Black Lives Matter marches and often backed the populist movement of Sen. Bernie Sanders in early primaries — and older African American voters from a more blue-collar generation who were largely responsible for the elevation and then the election of Biden, who criticized protesters’ call to “defund the police.”So, what if the Democrats were fundamentally wrong in thinking they could plate-spin a coalition of white college grads and almost all Black, brown, and Asian American voters? What if a growing number of the working-class Latine and African American voters begin to feel the way that so many whites in Slotkin’s Michigan district felt, that a Democratic Party based on college diplomas and a dogma of political correctness is looking down on them? Should we be surprised, for example, that so many midlife, highly entrepreneurial and capitalistic straight-outta-Compton-style Black hip-hop stars — fromIce Cube to Lil’ Wayneto most famously and bizarrely Kanye West — openly flirted with Trump and his movement?» READ MORE:America needs to talk about the new book that says lacking a college degree might kill you | Will BunchIs the political conundrum of the moment summed up in one word —Latinx, which was popularized in academic circles and also the LGBTQ community in recent years as a solution to a seeming problem of how to describe the hundreds of millions of people with roots in Central or South America with a word that’s gender-neutral and not colonial-sounding? Today,Latinxis widely used by white progressives, even though it’s an utter bafflement to culturally conservative brown folks in places like Texas or South Florida the term is supposed to describe. Writer Hector Luis Alamo dismissivelytold Mother JonesthatLatinxis “an academic word, and that group always thinks it knows what’s best for the rest of us.“That group” — academics — is the vanguard of the college-educated culture club that also includes Hollywood and “the knowledge economy” of media figures and Silicon Valley, which is, of course, the focus of the resentment that has driven a populist revolution in this country. When Trump was elected 45th president on Nov. 8, 2016, the natural inclination was to see the rise of a dangerous demagogue as a fluke, and that idea earned fresh currency when Biden defeated him this fall. But embracing this idea would be a false and dangerous complacency.Thanks to our arcane andarguably insane Electoral College, Trump and his 72 million-plus supporters would be celebrating his second term if just 67,000 or so votes in Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Omaha, Neb.’s congressional district had flipped. And, even with the pandemic, I believe he could have won those votes and the 2020 election if his narcissism and incompetence hadn’t blocked him from a stirring up resentment of “egghead” elites in ways that were less openly racist, and b governed as a true populist instead ofa garden-variety pro-billionaireRepublican.Remember the Latine voters of South Texas who credited Trump for their $1,200 check? What if the president had been smart enough to engineer a second stimulus, just ahead of the election, or embraced other populist items like a living wage or a massive infrastructure program? And how much better would Trump had done with the Hispanic voters who were receptive to the GOP’s social conservatism and free-market economics if he hadn’t, for example, dismissively tossedpaper towels at Puerto Ricansinstead of offering real relief from Hurricane Maria?Of course, you can also argue that any signs of real empathy for the Black and brown electorate might have dampened enthusiasm for Trump among white working-class voters for whom, as Adam Serwer famously wrote, the cruelty toward other racial groupswas the point of Trumpism. But you can also imagine a future GOP presidential candidate — maybe one with Hispanic roots who’s less politically inept than Sens. Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz — walking this tightrope all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., maybe as early as 2024.If so, history may look back on 2016 not as a fluke, but asa realignment election, in line with the long-term impact of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition in 1932, or the rise of Richard Nixon’s Southern Strategy in 1968. Remember,roughly 36%or so of American adults have a college degree, so a political party that narrows its base to only the highly educated is doomed to minority status, especially in an era when the expansion of higher education has, regrettably, slowed.But this history of 2020 and beyond is not yet written. While Republicans are getting much better at connecting culturally with noncollege voters, and reaping the political benefits, the truth is that neither party has truly succeeded in permanently winning today’s working class, because neither party has provided policies that would materially improve their lives. And the Democrats are much better positioned to do this, if the party can actually walk the walk on some of the ideas it’s been mostly talking about for the last decade.If Biden’s first actions as president were toraise the minimum wageandlower the cost of insulin, that could go a long way toward stopping defections among the Black and brown middle class and even win back some rural whites — not a majority of them, at first, but enough to matter in our current 51-49 election mode. That won’t be easy — and if Republicans win those two contested Senate runoffs in Georgia, it may be impossible — but it’s also arguably the lowest hanging fruit.How many of the college-educated whites who marched this year for racial justice in the name of George Floyd would be willing to support measures that offer economic justice — likehigher-density affordable housing, true equity in school policies now dominated by “nice white parents,” and the end oflocked-in white privilegein college admissions that they voraciously defend so their own kids can get ahead? How many progressives who (rightfully, in my opinion want free public universities and student-debt elimination are also willing to backbroader reformsto bring both knowledge and career pathways to the 64% now locked out, and who are increasingly either resentful ordespondentabout it?How long before someone shows up with Donald Trump’s basic DNA, but more politically savvy and less of a buffoon, who’s more clever about using educational resentments to unite the entire working class — regardless of color — and misuse the power of populism to not only deny the science of climate and pandemics, as Trump has done, but also go farther down the road toward dictatorship? And are we capable of the hard choices that would prevent this?"
minnpost_2020_8,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the University of Minnesota offers some of its courses on-line only, students and their parents wonder anxiously: Given the price of a degree, is this worth itFirst, let me state that the financial responsibilities will be shared. Full-time instructors earning more than $65,000 a year will take a pay cut. Adjuncts hired course by course will lose their merit pay increase, or several hundred dollars per course in my case. This is one way not to increase tuition.When it comes to the quality of instruction, based on two courses taught online and my student performances and evaluations, I am confident that quality can be kept high. The March transition was the easiest because students and instructors already knew one another. Faculty could teach asynchronously by posting lectures and discussion threads on the Canvas Internet platform, or they could teach synchronously, at the usual time on Zoom, which I did. Most faculty in political science will teach synchronously this fall.My summer course, “European Responses to Catastrophes: From War to COVID-19,” was a more of a challenge, as my class and I had never met physically, and I taught without an assistant. There were some technological hiccups, for instance, when unexpected publicity spots interrupted my YouTube news clips, or a student could not access a carefully prepared presentation. This was unnerving, but in all instances we kept calm. Everything we would have done in a physical classroom took place online: lectures, powerpoint presentations, short pauses for written self-reflection, discussion groups, student presentations, peer reviews, and contradictory debates.Thus, we discussed Brexit and the difference between bottom-initiated referendums and top-down initiated referendums. Scholars of direct democracy consider the latter dangerous, because they do not respond to popular demand and have been used historically to confirm despots in their rule (see Napoleon Bonaparte in France and Russia last July . Because this was a course in comparative politics, the class then split in two, and each group wrote a proposal for a bottom-up referendum on police reform in Minnesota. We ended up with two texts and two questions that could be put to the ballot.We also discussed European responses to war. Looking at pictures of 1945 devastated Europe, it was obvious that COVID-19 does not impose war-like conditions in Europe or the USA: Internet works, and most people live in dwellings with running water, electricity, heat and even air conditioning. Yet the pandemic is a catastrophe: “a sudden downturn.” As we pondered various interpretations of catastrophe, it became clear that catastrophes albeit destructive also make room for the new, and sometimes this is good news. Post World War II Franco-German reconciliation was one example; it paved the way for 70 years of non-militarized conflict resolution in Europe. In July, 90 hours of acrimonious haggling ended in the doubling of the European Union budget to respond to COVID across 27 nation states.Prompted by one student, we also studied the legacy of European colonialism, especially in Africa, a topic underexplored in both public and scholarly debates on European politics. We acknowledged that, tragically, an individual or collective actor can act in both constructive and perverse ways: witness U.S. President Jefferson, or the French government negotiating a reconciliatory treaty with five other European nations while waging war in Indochina and Algeria. Acknowledgment of such paradoxes is indispensable to new policies, some of which we examined as they impact responses to the pandemic.Yes, teaching and learning during the academic year 2020-21 will be different and challenging.Students have much to contribute to make their learning experience worthwhile. In synchronous courses, I suggest that they turn their video on in order to heighten attention, create connection with peers, and help the instructor. Indeed, I find it hard to teach little grey squares on my screen, and there are ways to create a background so that the video does not reveal indiscreet details.Regardless, I say to students: Please reach out to your instructors when something does not quite work for you. Most of us are working exceedingly hard to continue teaching you during the pandemic, we love our work, we care about you, and we need your feedback to adjust in a timely way whenever necessary.Catherine Guisan is an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota."
minnpost_2020_95,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .COVID-19’s uneven march across humanity demonstrates that homelessness increases vulnerability to infection. Most discussion around risk associated with COVID-19 centers on comorbidities or minimizing risk by physical distancing and hand washing. As such, risk is tallied by counting up one’s bodily or behavioral flaws, placing the blame largely on infected individuals.As a collective of Twin Cities-based health educators and clinicians actively engaged in theSocial Medicine Consortium’sGlobal Campaign Against Racism, we find such frameworks of risk not only misleading but complicit in maintaining systems of oppression that create the root causes of risk. Years of clinical and educational encounters with patients and communities struggling to maintain access to affordable, safe, and livable housing have taught us that we need to redirect our conceptualizations of risk away from the body and behavior and toward the underlying forces that create risky social conditions.Shifting the inputs entered into our risk calculators requires honest attentiveness to the realities of homelessness in Minnesota. TheWilder Foundation’s Minnesota Homeless Studyidentified an estimated 19,600 people experiencing homelessness on any given night in 2018 with 57% reporting chronic medical conditions. It revealed that African-American and American Indian people are overrepresented in the homeless population.We must look at the root causes of homelessness with a lens that magnifies history. In Minnesota, this lens guides our risk assessment to the early 1900s history of racially restrictive covenants on property deeds, limiting where African-Americans and other non-white minorities were able to buy homes. Today,Mapping Prejudicereveals such homes continue to hold more value than equal counterparts without a racial covenant history. Redlining in home lending practices followed in the 1930s and amplified the gap in wealth accumulation between whites and blacks through home ownership. In the 1950s, the federal government sponsored the “Voluntary Relocation Program” to move Indigenous populations off tribal lands, sell the land, and resettle people in cities with minimal social support. Such foundationally discriminative policies contribute to today’s disproportionately low levels of home ownership and home values for people of color in Minnesota, further tugging people toward the precipice of homelessness.Such interrogation reveals housing histories are rooted in racial capitalism. Cedric Robinson, who took the analytical concept of racial capitalism describing economics during apartheid in South Africa and reframed it to the general history of modern capitalism, explained that “capital can only be capital when it is accumulating, and it can only accumulate by producing and moving through relations of severe inequality among human groups … procedures of racialization and capitalism are ultimately never separable from each other.” What first legitimated the crimes of slavery against Africans and genocide against Indigenous peoples has continued for centuries through racialized policies and practices that normalize and sustain capital accumulation and private ownership for some at the expense of housing security for all.Attuning our lens to perceive the linkages between homelessness and mass incarceration further exposes the machinations of racial capitalism. Well-known racial disparities are documented in who is incarcerated in our for-profit system. Once released, there are tremendous obstacles to obtaining housing with a history of incarceration or even conviction without incarceration.Today, as we consider the risk of COVID-19 for those who are unhoused, redirecting our conceptualizations of risk toward social and structural forces creates a paradigmatic shift in the solutions we pursue. Thus, we support:As COVID-19 infections in Minnesota disproportionately impact communities marginalized by histories of racial capitalism, incorporating these sorts of prescriptions into a broader public health strategy will expand shelter and promote survival for all in our community both during this and future pandemics.Nasreen Quadri, Michael Westerhaus and Amy Finnegan wrote this commentary on behalf of theCampaign Against Racism— Twin Cities Chapter, a group dedicated to dismantling structural racism and its effects on health by supporting local actions to improve the health and lives of those most affected by racism."
suffolknewsherald_2020_71,"Published 8:55 pm Friday, June 26, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieBy definition, the word “elle” is of French origin meaning “she.” It is the ending of the names of Danielle, Gabrielle and Michelle which are female versions of the Hebrew names Daniel, Gabriel and Michael. Besides names, the word “elle” appears in many commonly used terms such as intellect, seller and excellence. But those words do not refer to the feminine application as they do in words like mademoiselle and belle.Have you ever considered the “elle” in loving? Yes, L-O-V-I-N-G.There once was a woman named Mildred. In 1958, she became the wife of her love, Richard Loving. It is said that theirs is one of the greatest American love stories that most Americans know nothing about. They were Virginians, and yet many residents here know little of the landmark Supreme Court case, Loving vs. Virginia, in which Mildred and Richard Loving overturned the national law that prevented them from living their name and loving one another. In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that state laws prohibiting miscegenation were unconstitutional. It is downright preposterous that we actually live in a nation and in a state that once went as far as to think it had the authority to prevent a man from loving his wife. This history reveals to us much of the reason why we are still dealing with fundamental error in our governmental rules and societal norms. Something about man that has the audacity to believe he can control something he did not create himself.We acknowledge the Supreme Court ruling with a day of remembrance called Loving Day on June 12. The day came and went this year, and I probably would not have given it a second thought until I did. Something urged me to consider her. Mildred. Her case was not about race; it was about love. When we speak of loving, we cannot dismiss her.It is not lost on me that she is a woman of color. It is not lost on me that this woman of color was loved by a Virginian man in a state of rich American history that brags of being the birthplace of eight white presidents who were native sons of its soil. Richard was a son of the South, and yet the South did not love how he loved. He loved this woman. Mildred.Mildred represents to me the strength of a woman to give voice to our anguish and pains. Mildred follows in the footsteps of many women like her that have led the charge for what they felt had to change. You know them by names such as Ruby Bridges, Linda Brown, Ida B. Wells, Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman. She desired to see liberation for things that pervert this supposed free nation. It’s been to this nation’s benefit that our women are so sensitive that they have difficulty making themselves numb. In many cases, it has been a woman’s courage and passionate loves that have led us to freedom.I encourage you to consider the “elle” in Loving, because I think it is really something that the love of a woman of color opened our eyes to the kaleidoscope of loving. Loving is a changing and enjoyable display. Hate makes us rigid and hardens our hearts. If we can love no matter the color and see one another as sisters and brothers, our kaleidoscope would create images we are happy that show up in our mirrors.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

Social media is flooded with posts in support of medical workers, people have placed signs on their doors thanking delivery drivers, and grocery store clerks have been featured on the front page of newspapers.These are well-earned accolades, and I am happy that so many people in our country are recognizing those who are working hard during this time of uncertainty. We should be grateful to those who work in the industries that have kept our nation moving during this challenging time, and these posts, notes of thanks, newspaper articles, and signs of respect are a few ways that we show our appreciation.There are some people, though, who do not fit into any category. Saying, “All of us” or “Everyone who helps” is a great way for a newspaper or company to honor those who are helping others during this time, but I think we can do better at recognizing the individuals who have done things to help us face adversity.The first thing to do is to pause to consider who has done something to help you since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. Has a spouse been extra helpful or kind during this time? Maybe a family member is assisting with child care. Did someone give you a face mask, bring you some needed supplies, send you a card in the mail, bring you your favorite lunch, or check in on you through an electronic message or a telephone call?Ask yourself the following questions: Who gave me something to help me through this time? Who provided support to me in a way that allowed me to keep going? Who encouraged me through something they did?Once you have the names of the people who have helped or encouraged you during this time, you can begin to work on some ways to honor them for their support. This does not have to be anything large or over the top.A thank-you card to the person who gave you the face mask is simple, easy, and inexpensive, but it shows your gratitude and appreciation.Sometimes a verbal, “Thank you for all you have done. It’s a big help,” is all that is needed. It’s easy to take those who support us for granted, but we should not fail to verbally express our gratitude or to tell them how their support has helped us.Social media is another way to share our thanks and to honor those who have helped us. A public post can be a sort of “cheers” for that person in this time of physical distancing. A private message expressing gratitude and respect can be a nice surprise for someone when they open their own social media profile.You may also choose to provide a small gift to those who have helped you. Whether it’s a favorite snack, a bunch of flowers, a small gift card to their favorite store, or a handmade item you think they will enjoy, a small gift is another way to honor these everyday heroes.There are a lot of heroes working through this time. Many of them are in groups of people that we should all honor. Other, unspoken heroes, who do not fall neatly into a category often receive little recognition. This will only change when each of us takes the time to recognize and honor the heroes in our lives.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Whether a person is Caucasian or a person of color, it is unequal across the board. There is a double standard, a class system, in the justice system. Those of affluence and notoriety (actors, song artists, politicians, etc. never face the consequences of crimes that middle- to low-income people face.I have witnessed this locally and from TV coverage of those in high places. Our governor took a laid-back view of a politician caught smoking marijuana in a parking lot, saying he would lose a good number of his staff if he fired someone caught with marijuana. A former president spoke publicly of having used cocaine and could do so without consequences.For over a decade, I have worked for expungement for non-repeat, ex-offenders of non-violent, non-sexual crimes in Virginia. Over half of the states in the United States offer this. In Virginia, it doesn’t matter if it is the 18-year-old who gets caught with marijuana and is convicted of a misdemeanor or felony, this is never erased from his/her record.Hiring policy in every professional career prohibits hiring of anyone with a drug conviction. Ex-offenders are denied rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for a lifetime in Virginia. Earning a high degree will not open doors to gainful employment, housing, etc. Is this not “cruel and unusual punishment”? Every bill that I have gotten introduced into the General Assembly is tabled yearly in the Courts of Justice Committee. I want help to get a referendum on our ballot for citizens to get expungement legislation passed in Virginia.Those who represent us fail to exemplify Christ with their “no forgiveness” stance.

minnpost_2020_83,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The late Robert Kennedy once said:Every society gets the kind of criminal it deserves. What is equally true is that every community gets the kind of law enforcement it insists on.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins with the sentence:All human beings are born free and equal in human rights.In the meantime, the Police Department is not going away. Even those who call for dismantling or defunding it now admit there is no roadmap for how we get from here to there. The City Charter Commission appears to be applying the brakes to the City Council proposal to put a resolution on the ballot in November that would establish a new Department of Public Safety, defund the existing Police Department and remove oversight from the mayor and give it to the City Council.The City Council members admit their outline lacks specifics. At the very least we need an interim plan of concrete steps that can be taken. We are presenting one developed by coauthor Frank Fernandez, a longtime police officer, police chief and city manager who has restructured police departments in many places.The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officer are honest, good-hearted people who are dedicated to helping others even if it means putting themselves in harm’s way to do it. Notwithstanding, the time has come to ask some key questions:What’s working, what’s not, what needs to changeWe endorse the following recommendations, based on our combined experiences, one as a retired lawyer and longtime human rights advocate and one as a longtime police officer with over three decades of experience across multiple police agencies. From a specific point of view, which is how departments operate, the points below highlight several concrete steps for bringing about substantial and sustainable reforms:Most police officers are well intentioned, good citizens. They respond the way they are trained. Systemic racism, long embedded in our culture, including our police forces, must be eliminated. Although critical, police reform alone goes only part way toward combating structural racism. There are some critical first steps that can and must be taken at the local level. Other changes currently being debated in St. Paul and Washington can be made at the state and national levels. Collectively we must find a pathway to sustainable police reforms based on need, common sense and good judgment.Frank G.

suffolknewsherald_2020_133,"Published 11:08 pm Friday, May 8, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieOn Mother’s Day, tributes to the women who fulfill the activities of mothering children echo around the nation. These tributes often consist of precious presentations involving flowers and stories of how much she has influenced the lives of those under her care. The title of mother is not reserved only for women who have given birth; many women have been called “Mother” by virtue of their advocating on the behalf of a child that was not their own. We tend to attribute who or what makes us who we are in some ways to the workings of a mother in our lives. But to what can we attribute the makings of a mother?A plethora of books, stories and articles have been written on what makes a mother. I was not surprised to find that many of these commentaries have some list or key qualities that form a sort of checkoff sheet for the greatest mothers, the exemplary mothers and the godly mothers. Yet, I think that there is no single recipe that forms the batter for the best mother. When God made mothers, did He put the same thing in every one of them?Recently, I came across a social media post that was a tribute to a mother in a rather modern way. The social platform, TikTok, is known for its challenges. One of the trends of late involves the hashtag #WhenGodMadeMeChallenge. I found myself smiling at a video of a young black boy in his home kitchen standing in front of a bowl. I watched as he poured water from various containers into the bowl and each time the video tags would list an attribute or characteristic of his mother, who is Atlanta hair blogger Mykal Steen. A sample of the words that flashed across the screen were: pretty, funny, smart, hardworking, successful, angel, cool and crazy. Then he put the bowl away and his mother walked into the kitchen, and they shared a few dance steps together. You can tell that this 14-year-old son and his mother have a very special bond.This trend called #WhenGodMadeMe began with TikTok influencers using different condiments or ingredients poured into some type of reservoir to demonstrate what makes them who they are. This young boy’s Mother’s Day tribute depicts how his mother is perfectly designed for him.We cannot define a good mother by one list, because there is not just one mother in the world.When we look at the first mother, Eve, she was defined as the mother of all creation by her husband, Adam. From her, more mothers came to be. If all creation performed their own TikTok videos of all the mothers of the world, the characteristics would reflect our unique Creator. The Bible says, Through everything God made, they can clearly see His invisible qualities … (Roman 1:19-20 . Every mother demonstrates that we are uniquely formed for unique purposes, because our Creator enjoys diversity. Our uniqueness as mothers supports His status as the only God with unique power.God made moms. He made them to be a reflection of Him, and He made them to be a reflection of their people. When I think of my own making as a mother, I don’t see a list of attributes as much as I see the names of advocates. I became a mother at the birth of my first child. I was made a mother because of the intercession of the Holy Spirit, the presence of a devoted husband, the prayers of my parents and in-laws, the counsel of some experienced sister-friends and the gift of a precious baby girl we named Jenesis, because she is and will always be our first jewel.I pray that each mother and mother-figure in our community knows that you are advocates for the making of beautiful people in the world. Most importantly, the Great One advocates on your behalf.

philinquirer_2020_54,"The new bills passed by City Council are a fair and balanced policy decision.Philadelphia City Council passed important legislation on Dec. 10, including a 1% Development Impact Tax (DIT on residential construction. The DIT proceeds will be used to fund the development of much needed affordable housing in our city, as well as other programs in theNeighborhood Preservation Initiative. Along with this 1% tax, City Council also delayed the implementation of previously passed legislation that cut in half the value of the 10-year tax abatement for residential development and passed additional legislation cutting the value of the 10-year tax abatement on commercial developments by 10%. All three bills take effect on Jan. 1, 2022.The combined approach of giving an extension to residential developers for the time lost during this pandemic before implementing a tax on their projects, while also slightly reducing the property tax benefit for commercial developers, is a fair and balanced policy decision.» READ MORE:City Council approves Philly construction tax and changes to property tax abatement in busy year-end sessionThe Building Industry Association of Philadelphia (BIA — an 80-plus-year-old association of mostly residential developers of which I am president — did not come to support the 1% DIT without careful analysis. Opponents suggest the tax will reduce the amount of new housing built, and therefore increase the cost of housing, which they contend will outweigh its intended benefit to fund the development of more affordable housing. By our math, for a typical residential development project, the 1% DIT will represent closer to a half-percent increase in total project cost, which we believe will be offset by a needed adjustment to the cost of land that the market will provide. Land values have risen in Philadelphia far beyond any economic equilibrium, and a meager 3% reduction would offset the cost of the tax.The 10-year tax abatement, however, remains a critical incentive for residential and commercial real estate developers to shoulder the risks associated with real estate development and to continue to generate city revenue and jobs, as wells as housing — both market-rate and affordable. While many have called for its repeal, no credible analysis can refute the very positive net economic benefit that the tax abatement has brought to Philadelphia over the past 20 years. Even after the abatement is curtailed starting in January 2022, it will provide a meaningful and needed tax incentive benefiting residents citywide.» READ MORE:Philly’s failure to end the 10-year tax abatement is no victory to fight poverty | Solomon JonesAlthough it is generally not viewed as good tax policy to implement a new tax during severe economic downturns such as the one currently upon us, the deficit of quality affordable housing in Philadelphia is extreme. The Philadelphia Housing Authority alone has more than 60,000 people on its waiting list, which is not surprising in a city that suffers from a persistently high poverty rate of around 25%. Other previously proposed policy interventions that are meant to help solve this shortage, such as mandatory inclusionary zoning that would require a percentage of affordable units in every development proposal, would make many projects unfeasible and generate less housing for those in greatest need.We acknowledge it is unusual for developers to step forward and ask to pay more, and we do not do so with enthusiasm. But it is only through thoughtful and balanced policies that the power of the free market can be paired up with government intervention to try and tackle the housing problem in Philadelphia. The BIA is sincere in its desire to be part of the solution. The DIT, along with the continuance of the tax abatement for residential construction, is a better option than other alternatives and will have a huge impact where it is needed the most.Leo Addimando is the president of the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia."

You either support the police or you don’t support the police.We know it is not that simple, but when making arguments everyone runs to one extreme side of the ledger or the other.There is no question, at least the evidence is overwhelming, that the police treat blacks and Latinos differently. And part of that problem is that our police force is not nearly as diverse as it should be.I was never a fan of this “defund the police” movement. Or rather, I should say, I was never a fan of the wording. Transitioning the police into doing the enforcement they are trained for and moving other responsibilities to other organizations more capable of doing them is a good and proper thing to do.The police are asked to do way more than they should be asked to do. Mental health, social work, counseling … it is all in there and is just too complicated to put in the hands of the men and women trained to protect and serve. That burden adds to the stress of a dangerous job. But because of that stress and danger, we have to carefully evaluate regularly whether the men and women of the police force are, individually, up to the job. It is not a weakness to succumb to that enormous stress, but in such a highly visible and necessary job, we have to require a higher degree of fitness for the job.Although the vast majority of police really care about the job they do, and truly do excellent work, there are still too many who take their legally protected use of force to the utmost extreme. There must be an avenue for removal.In the situation of police, unfortunately, we have bent over backwards to protect them from being held accountable. Limited immunity is a mistake. The police internal “code” is a means of limiting legal actions. Police hide behind their own lines and seem to believe that giving up a bad cop will somehow put all of them in jeopardy.That culture has to change. Laws have to change. Police tactics have to change. Police accountability has to change.The interaction between police and the community has become toxic, not everywhere mind you, but in very visible places. The Minneapolis police force has a terrible record in this regard. The police union acts as though anyone outside of its bubble is an enemy. And I fully believe that its president, Bob Kroll, is the toxic example of this and he needs to go.I also believe that reforming police funding is necessary as well. We don’t need to “defund” but we do need to reallocate. Get more of our resources and departments involved.

Jake, my 9-year-old nephew, asked if I’d like to play catch with the football. I followed him outside as we prepared for the game with the football he grasped in his right hand. I strolled to one end of the backyard as he ran to the opposite end. I knew the first few passes that I would throw would cause a noticeable amount of pain in my shoulder. My autoimmune disorder causes inflammation and stiffness in my joints, which takes the process of “warming up” to a new and uncomfortable level.I let out a grunt with my third throw as the breaking of the stiffness caused pain to wrap around my shoulder. I rubbed my shoulder as I thought about how my arm will never be the same as it was before the onset of my disorder.A little later in our game, I noticed one of Jake’s passes falling short of where I was standing. My initial reaction was to run forward and bend down to snatch the ball out of the air before it hit the ground. After all, my nephew was expecting me to catch the pass to win the Super Bowl! I started to move forward when my body reminded me that running is something I can no longer do. I remembered that I also could no longer bend down or slide on the ground to catch the ball. My autoimmune disorder removed those abilities from me.I was sad as the ball landed on the ground in front of me. I wasn’t upset because the “game-winning pass” hit the ground. I was sad because I was reminded of the abilities that my medical condition has taken from me. “A few years ago,” I thought, “I would have had no issue catching that ball.”I picked up the ball, dejected and depressed. A look around revealed something, however. My nephew stood in front of me, waiting for me to throw the ball back to him. Morgan, my 6-year-old niece, was to my right cheering on her uncle and brother. My brother’s house was to my left, where my parents, brother and sister-in-law sat finishing their breakfast. The previous evening, I slept in a warm, comfortable bed, and I woke up in a heated house that removed the chill that was in the air overnight. There was food in the cupboard, coffee in a carafe, and doughnuts on the table.

suffolknewsherald_2020_30,"Published 9:28 pm Friday, July 31, 2020ByStaff ReportsAs awful as 2020 has been, there was little doubt that a tropical system or two would come along to complicate our already chaotic circumstances for a few days.Hurricane Isaias seems prepared to erase any doubt that was left. Confidence is increasing that the storm will have at least some effects on Hampton Roads, although how much remains to be seen.Jeff Orrock, meteorologist in charge at National Weather Service Wakefield, said Friday that this area is likely to see some rain and wind. Regardless of what Isaias does, however, this is still expected to be an active hurricane season. Most of this year’s storms have set records for early formation — surpassing even the infamous 2005 season — so the expectations seem to be becoming reality.Even if Isaias doesn’t amount to much, another one might, so it’s always best to be prepared. Besides, in 2020, there’s no telling what will go wrong next.COVID-19 adds an extra element to the planning this year. Suffolk’s Deputy Emergency Management Coordinator Richard Stephens said earlier this year that more supplies like hand sanitizer and masks have been ordered, and noted that individuals, families and businesses may need to take extra precautions beyond a normal hurricane season, as well. People will want to have extra masks and hand sanitizer on hand. The key, as always, is to prepare well ahead of time.There’s not much time before Isaias comes, but there may be before the next storm, so take note of the following that should be in your emergency kit:One gallon of water per person, per day for at least three daysA three-day supply of food requiring minimal water, no refrigeration, preparation or cooking, such as canned foods, granola bars, trail mix, etc.First aid supplies and medicationsMasks and hand sanitizerExtra eyeglasses, contact lenses and lens solutionFood, medications and other needs for petsManual can openerComplete change of clothingSturdy footwearSleeping bagTools and emergency suppliesImportant family documents and phone numbersCash in small billsCredit cardExtra set of car keys in waterproof containerToilet paperSoapDisinfectantFive-gallon bucket with lidFeminine hygiene supplies and diapersGarbage bagsGames, toys and booksBlanketsJumper cablesCell phone chargerFlashlight and extra batteriesOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

I didn’t realize what it was at first, and I watched it again. The video was muted. I watched in silence. This video was of a man being shot in the back from close range as he attempted to get in his vehicle. You would think that I would be so familiar with these scenes that I recognized immediately what my eyes were viewing. But my peace could not take it. My reality did not want to accept it … again. Another black man and a police officer.It has been hours since I watched that video. Several thoughts have run through my head. As disturbing as it was to watch the video, it was not the actions themselves that shook me to the core. I am still suppressing the scream that came to me when I suddenly became hauntingly aware of his name, Jacob Blake. His initials are J.B. Jacob Blake has the same initials as my sons and my nephew. In fact, my 15-year-old nephew is also named Jacob.The initials ‘J.B.’ hung before my eyes like when your number is up on the public announcement system’s LED prompter at the Social Security Administration office. I couldn’t dim the LED lights in my mind. Then I began to consider well known men with the initials J.B., such as:I read a brief biography of Jacob Blake. I discovered that he is the grandson of a retired AME pastor. His grandfather organized marches in Chicago following the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Jacob Blake comes from a family of activists that influenced the Evanston City Council members in Illinois to ban racial discrimination in housing. I discovered that he actually carries the name that has been passed down for two generations. He is the descendant of men who fight against injustice. None of that was evident or considered when seven bullets were fired into his back while his sons watched in horror. I can’t imagine how much they want to unsee that scene.According to the 2000 U.S. Census, analysts discovered that the combination of the letters ‘JB’ are the most popular initials in our nation. Joseph, Jeb, Jacob and my Judah all have the same initials. Considering this recent shooting, it seems that in the same way that my son’s initials share popularity in the U.S., my sons could just as easily share the fate of black sons lynched, murdered and silenced in the U.S. That takes my breath away.In the wake of George Floyd’s death, I pondered ways that I might keep my boys safe from the violence of our world. I wondered, “how do I make these people know that THESE ARE MY BOYS? Perhaps if they know they are mine, no one will harm them.” These are the thoughts of a black mother of black sons.Weeks before this shooting, I began reading the words of Jasmine L. Holmes to my boys before they fall asleep at night. Her book, “Mother to Son: Letters to a black boy on identity and hope,” is more appropriately comforting to me, but I read it to prepare them for this world. Bedtime stories have become prayers combined with emotionally charged explanations in an effort to equip my children for a future that I hope they get to see. Until these modern-day scenes of lynching disappear completely, I am afraid that it is possible that the next J.B. in dismal headlines could be my boys. That truth is something that my mind cannot unsee.

Members of our union, SEIU Local 26, clean and protect stores and commercial office buildings across the Twin Cities. As our state continues our “reopening” process, we know the risk of COVID-19 will continue to grow for many people. That is why our union has been pushing our employers and elected officials to do everything possible to keep working families safe in Minnesota.Over the last few months we have seen more than 200 members of our union come down with COVID-19. Sadly, we have even seen one member of our union family, Armando Solis, die from this terrible virus.COVID-19 was different for each of us. For two of us it spread to our families and we had to struggle with not only the terrible pain from the coughs and body aches, but we worried about our loved ones who were older or had health issues. Some of our family members ended up having to go to the hospital. For all of us this was something we wouldn’t wish on our worst enemy. It was scary and painful. It meant not only health issues, but dealing with missing work and the bills piling up.This summer we released our demands on what we believe all employers should do for a safe “reopening.” You can see them allhere, but the main points we are pushing for are:As you can see, these demands all seem pretty basic and things you would hope employers are doing already, but we’ve seen too many companies that aren’t stepping up and doing what is right. That is why we are pushing employers at the bargaining table, and also pushing our elected officials to be firm in ensuring that no one has to risk getting sick to go to work.For anyone who doubts it, we can attest that COVID-19 is scary, painful and has long-lasting effects, both in regard to health and to your budget. The stakes are high for us to make sure we are all safe and healthy. We need those in power to listen to those of us directly impacted and do what is right for families across our state by following our demands and making sure those directly impacted have a seat at the table.Willie Jones Jr. is a security officer, Ernesto Garcia is a commercial janitor and Gregoria Estrada is a retail janitor.

eugeneweekly_2020_11,"We ve got issues. White people in America are clearly steeped in a very real moment. We are being urged to listen, reckon, reflect and act. We are being asked, in so many ways, to open our ears, our eyes, our hearts and our brains in ways that many of us have never done before. And in doing so, there will certainly be feelings of guilt, remorse, sadness, outrage, confusion, compassion and a myriad of other emotions and impulses coursing through us. However, if done right, what can come from this breakthrough societal moment cannot be denied. Taking the lead from communities of color, what will emerge is a clarity to drive forward the efforts needed to break the cycles of oppression and racism — to dismantle the systems that validate oppression and racism. Together, we will build a just system that honors and respects all life. This is not only possible, but inevitable. In a recentNew York Timesop-ed drafted by William Barber II, Liz Theoharis, Timothy B. Tyson and Cornel West entitled, “What the Courage to Change History Looks Like”, they said this: “Cries of ‘I can’t breathe’ call out in compelling shorthand, America’s enduring racial chasm in every measure of well-being: health care and infant mortality, wages and wealth, unemployment, education, housing, policing and criminal justice, water quality and environmental safety. The bills that bustle through our legislatures offer narrow reforms of police procedures and bypass the fullness of what the protesters are saying: The children of privilege are protected not by a higher grade of policing, but by deeper layers of resources and that is what ought to protect all of our children.” The collective goes on to sharpen their ridicule of legislative bodies by saying, “You cannot solve what is happening to Black people in this country by ‘mere policy tinkering,’ but that you must dismantle “the interlocking systems created by and for white supremacy and gender-based oppressions.” With dismantling comes the opportunity to rebuild, and how we rebuild will be crucial. Seeing the world as a collection of systems is so critical. It’s why the phrase “interlocking systems” is so powerful — through the truth it speaks. It is also why the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL lays out various demands versus narrowing their focus on just the brutality of policing towards Black people. A critical piece — one that does not receive the attention it deserves to those “interlocking” platforms — is the call for community control: “We demand a world where those most impacted in our communities control the laws, institutions and policies that are meant to serve us — from our schools to our local budgets, economies, police departments, and our land — while recognizing that the rights and histories of our Indigenous family must also be respected.” This is not a new demand, but one that has been part of Black resistance since its inception. The ability to self-determine is a necessary element for balance, equity, survival, evolution and the protection of the sacred. This drive for self-determination — a community self-determination — cannot be stopped or ignored. I include the two following clauses, not as a distraction from the focus on Black lives, but as a sharpening of that lens, by reminding everyone that the drive for community control is universal. It is inherent. It is what we all want and it can be a major aid in universally binding us together: Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development, according to Article 3, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples The people of Lincoln County possess both a collective and individual right of self-government in their local community, a right to a system of government that embodies that right, and the right to a system of government that protects and secures their human, civil, and collective rights, says the law adopted by the people of Lincoln County to ban aerial spray of pesticides The dismantling of “the interlocking systems, created by and for white supremacy and gender-based oppressions,” is a must. But before we even arrive at the moment where those systems come crumbling down, we need to vision what we want to collectively rebuild. Recognizing that so many of us want the same things — that we understand that decentralizing power is vital to achieving our collective needs and desires, will be the very power that sends us on the path forward. Recognizing that whether we call it sovereignty or community control or self-government, we are saying the same thing — that we need to be decision-makers in our communities, thereby creating real, authentic, capital D Democracy. Barber, Theoharis, Tyson and West finish their statement on the state of America and Black lives by saying, from a place of love and vision, that, “All demand that our legacy must include a livable planet. Black and white, immigrant and Indigenous, Asian-American and Latinx, straight and LGBTQ, of every hue and faith…” We are all being called out, called up, called to come together, and called to act.

minnpost_2020_170,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We live in a racially illiterate country. We are taught to see white supremacy only in the actions of overt bigots, right-wing militias, and politicians who support them. White supremacy is not an individual act. It is a system of relations that permeates all institutions, including schools. Curricula is a primary mechanism of white supremacy in schools because it shapes how we think, understand, and act in the world. If our goal is building a just society, any attempt at a true reckoning of our nation’s racist foundation must include re-examining what we choose to teach our children in school.Historian Carter G. Woodson wrote, “If you control a man’s thinking you do not have to worry about his actions.” What we are taught in school maintains the status quo of racial hierarchy in our thoughts and actions. Centering ethnic studies across all curricula in Minnesota would be a crucial first step toward achieving the comprehensive change so many white Minnesotans and institutions have been awakened to since the killing of George Floyd.We have an opportunity now. The Minnesota Department of Education has convened, as it does every decade, agroupof educators, researchers, and stakeholders to revise theSocial Studies Standardsthat drive state curricula, guiding educators in terms of what should be taught and assessed.Ethnic studiesis “a rigorous, interdisciplinary and comparative study of the central role that ethnicity, race, and racism play in the construction of United States history, culture, and society.” It provides us all with the knowledge and skills for racial literacy, emphasizing historical contexts of Minnesota’s social and political issues. Ethnic studies is a critical tool in developing responsive solutions to Minnesota’s struggle for racial equity.COVID-19 has necessitated unparalleled changes in modes of delivery and evaluation, such as aseemingly easy shift away from the previously taken for granted MCAs and ACTs.We need this same urgency about curriculum justice.With some of the U.S.’slargest racialized disparities, Minnesota’s Eurocentric, white-washed curriculum adds to BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color youth feeling disenfranchised and disaffected. Nearly every school district in the state articulates some goal of racial equity, but implementation and outcomes never match the rhetoric. While current Social Studies Standards are not the only cause of racial disparity in Minnesota, they indicate a lack of will to create a curriculum that genuinely reflects the people and history of Minnesota.Some argue that the existing standards are mostly skill-based and that specific content and methods are left to individual teachers. While this is largely true, the standards currently do not reflect the skills and content to engage in an ethnic studies approach to teaching and learning nor provide the necessary time and resources. For instance, ethnic studies skills intentionally equip students to trace oral histories, locate erased perspectives and archives, and develop counternarratives.Calls for ethnic studies curricula in Minnesota schools date back decades. In a 1971 lawsuit, plaintiffs demanded that the Minneapolis School District “draw up a plan that will ‘overcome the effects of past discrimination’” and fully implement its own Human Relations Guidelines adopted by the Minnesota Board of Education in 1970. Those guidelines stated, “A comprehensive K-12 social studies program shall be required of all students, focusing on awareness to the American experience including all ethnic groups.” Yet here we are, nearly 50 years later, seeking the same fundamental change.Adapting Social Studies State Standards is not intended as a one-pronged approach to racial equity. Ethnic studies are, by definition, interdisciplinary. The committee could take a large step by centering ethnic studies and its methodological skill sets in the 2021-2031 standards. This bold move will lead to other necessary structural changes, including re-assessing teacher education, hiring, and licensure, and diversifying teacher demographics to align with our increasingly diverse students.AsThurgood Marshall sarcastically said in 1956,“You can or maybe you can’t override prejudice overnight, but the Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863. … I believe in gradualism, and I also believe that ninety-odd years is pretty gradual.” If there was ever a moment for this state to show it cares about all youth, that moment is now.Brian Lozenski is an associate professor of urban and multicultural education at Macalester College.

It’s hard to say. Prior to the election he suggested a total spending plan of $1.9 trillion — remarkably close to the Democrats’ proposal — but has since backed off. Two weeks ago, he tweeted that a bill should be passed, but said only that it should be “big” and “focused.”It’s time for the real leaders to step forward and work on a compromise package because the alarming rise in coronavirus cases presents another threat to the already skittish economy. If more restrictions and limitations are enacted to slow the spread of the virus — as has already happened in many states — it could mean even more job losses and another rise in the unemployment rate that stood at 6.9% at the end of October.Compromise has taken on a negative connotation in politics over the years as both parties have dug in, often on ideological grounds.But compromise is not only necessary, it has been a mainstay of the American political process since the founding of the republic.Great leaders through the years have long recognized the need to compromise as a way to get things done — and that is what’s needed now.There’s a big gap between the $2.2 trillion Democratic proposal and the $500 million suggested by Republicans. That leaves plenty of room for compromise that would provide much-needed assistance to the nearly 12 million Americans who are out of work and the numerous industries that are teetering on the financial edge.While some may argue that the promising results of COVID-19 vaccines means the end is near and a big relief package is unnecessary, the reality is that most Americans won’t be able to get an approved vaccine for another six months or longer. Assistance is needed now.Both sides have points on which they agree: enhanced unemployment benefits, extending the Paycheck Protection Program and aid for the airline industry.A second stimulus check even has some bipartisan support.It’s time to put aside politics and use the power of compromise to come up with a relief package for Americans in need.— Pittsburgh Post-GazetteThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

suffolknewsherald_2020_148,"Published 9:21 pm Friday, May 1, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieThese are challenging times.My grandmother used to tell me stories of challenging times when she was a young girl. I particularly remember her sharing how she and her siblings would walk to school some days and because they were black, they were not allowed to ride the bus. She shared how the bus would pass right by them, and the kids on the bus would throw things from the windows and spit on them as it rode by. On many occasions, I recall telling my grandmother that God knew better than to have me born during those times, because I don’t think I would have survived. I listened to many of her stories and responded similarly. I held the belief that God ordained certain people to undergo certain seasons, because God knew who could withstand what challenges they faced.I am here because Grandma Fannie continued to stand, although the challenges of her childhood were harsh and unfair. She endured. I believe God knew she would.I am here because my grandmother’s ancestors survived the deplorable conditions of the forced voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to this New World. Many died in the middle passage journey that landed my family in rural Georgia. Although raids, starvation and epidemic-level illness threatened their lives, my people survived.Connected to many challenges of the past, you will find the stories of people that the challenge could not outlast. You will find the record endurance of God’s created ones who knew not to surrender when the challenge was on.So, what does that say about us today?I just happen to believe that this season was meant to reveal to all of us that we were made for such a challenge as this one. If you are here to share the lessons learned of every hardship and back-breaking moment in your past, it speaks to what you never knew of the fighter that lives within you.You and I are in a wrestling match, and the opponent wants to keep you from stretching your hand out to tag in your tag-team partner. Your opponent does not know we need not slap a hand outside the ring. Our partner is with us in the challenge.In the Bible, Hebrews 12:1 reminds us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us.” Mind you, it says the endurance is added with you during the race. This challenge before us means that we are receiving more power to bear and suffer through an unpleasant and difficult process that will have fruit for years to come. Those who have never known suffering can teach nothing of endurance. Our Heavenly Father would not have us to be weak; He strengthens us each day by the Holy Spirit.God knew better than to have me born during the early 1900s. I am living now during these challenging times, because I thankfully have what I need to endure this.

His was a life that, if anything, was larger than its own lore and legend.Chuck Yeager died last week, at 97. It’s amazing that a great movie has never been made of his life. His was a life that, if anything, was larger than its own lore and legend.Maybe no movie, or actor, could do such a life justice.He went from a squirrel-hunting, outdoor-loving, wild West Virginia boy to the greatest test pilot of all time — arguably the greatest aviator of all time. The only two who could contest him for the title are Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.He flew some 150 different military aircraft and logged 10,000 hours in the air. He flew for nearly 60 years, which included his years as a World War II flying ace (he shot down 13 German planes, five in one day , his test pilot years and 127 missions in Vietnam.He started as an enlisted man in the Army Air Corps, and a mechanic. And he said understanding how planes were put together and functioned was the key to his success as a test pilot and why he was chosen to fly the Bell Aircraft X-1, in which he broke the sound barrier in 1947.But Yeager did not retire from the Air Force until the mid-1970s. By then he was a brigadier general. He kept flying, and he kept testing planes, for decades more.He became the commander of the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Pilot School, at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert. There he trained a new generation of test pilots and, of course, the first generation of astronauts. He could not become an astronaut himself because he had no college degree — only the coolest head, best reflexes and deepest curiosity in aviation or aerospace.And that is the great misunderstanding about the general: He was not the “cowboy in the sky,” as some dubbed him. Yes, he had daring and panache, and seemed to be fearless (though he said he was always keenly aware of death and trying to outmaneuver it . But he held that the real key to flying was knowledge — first, knowing your plane and, second, seeking ever-greater understanding of different kinds of planes and flight itself.God knows Yeager had fun. He said he went to flight school because he noticed pilots had clean hands and had pretty girls on their arms. The morning he broke the sound barrier, he had two taped-up broken ribs. He’d been racing his wife, whom he dubbed “Glamorous Glennis” and named his planes after, on horseback the night before and he hit a closed fence in the dark.But the greatest fun, he said, was figuring out problems no one had ever tackled, not to mention solved, before.He was not a cowboy but a master engineer and a scientist (much like Lindbergh and Armstrong .Yeager’s joy in living and insatiable technical and intellectual curiosity were indivisible and of a whole.— Pittsburgh Post-GazetteThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_127,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On May 29 President Trumpproclaimedthat certain Chinese students and researchers seeking to enter the U.S. would be restricted because they would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” He also called on the State Department toconsider revokingvisas of those who are already here. We, Chinese international students, became the casualty in the two countries’ crossfire over the trade war, the pandemic, and Hong Kong.Three decades ago, we were model immigrants. Now we are a detriment to U.S. interests. And the line between the former and the latter is rather thin.While the new restriction specifically targets Chinese nationals who are involved in China’s “military-civil fusion strategy” and will affect a “tiny percentage” of about 360,000 Chinese international students, downplaying its implication is wrongheaded. China’s “military-civil fusion strategy” is a case of what the U.S. has been practicing for decades: the fusion of military, industry, and universities, or the “military-industrial complex” against which President Eisenhower once cautioned. It would be hard for the State Department to pinpoint those who have direct ties with the Chinese military. At its best, some Chinese students would have to wait for a longer time for security clearance, and at its worst, their visa application or entry would be denied. On Chinese social media, I learned that at least one student already felt the sweeping repercussion as he was questioned in a separate room when re-entering the country last week because he had graduated from a Chinese university on the U.S. sanction list.The implication also goes beyond the restriction of entry. The notorious 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act barred the entry of Chinese laborers but exempted students, teachers, merchants, and diplomats. Yet the law established a racial hierarchy with the Chinese as the most excludable kind and initiated a gate-keeping mentality for the nation of immigrants. The 2017 Muslim travel ban, the 2018 Central American migration ban, and the 2020 Chinese student restriction share the same legal base in the section 212 (f of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The statute gives the president the power to suspend the entry of any aliens by deeming them detrimental to U.S. interests. “President Trump has been more single-minded than his predecessors in suggesting that many immigrants pose a national security threat,”a recent report by the Migration Policy Instituteshowed.Increasingly, we have become associated with national security threats. To protect America from Chinese espionage, Sen. Tom Cotton and other lawmakers recently unveiled the“Secure Campus Act”that would bar all Chinese STEM students from receiving visas. But most of the Chinese STEM students that I know would like to stay in the U.S. In fact, due to the immigration system’s preference for skilled workers, some of them chose STEM majors because it would be easier to secure a job, an H-1B visa, and a pathway of immigration. My former roommate with a Ph.D. in electronic engineering works for Google. A friend finishing up the doctoral program of mechanical engineering at the U has received a job offer from 3M. Some Chinese postdocs have gained their lawful permanent residency. Amid the pandemic, whereas some undergrads that I taught this past semester rushed back, none of the Chinese doctoral students in STEM that I know returned home. Their labs were closed, but their research continued.On June 1, as I was immersed in the fury at the anti-black racism and police brutality, President Trump’s suspension of certain Chinese students’ entry became effective. On my I-20 form issued by the Department of Homeland Security to international students, my program at the U is listed as “American Civilization.” But America was never civilized; it was built on the looting of indigenous people, slavery, exploitation of Latinx, and exclusion of Asians. Several friends checked in with me that day. I told them I was in deep fear. I fear that this country in which I have devoted so many years studying may relive some of its most ugly past.Lei Zhang is a doctoral candidate of American studies at the University of Minnesota."
minnpost_2020_218,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .2020 has been a year like no other as we all face the challenges of a global pandemic, social justice crisis and economic instability. These challenges are creating new barriers to voting as we head into the 2020 elections. It’s never been more important for businesses to empower employees to be involved in the election process and have their voices heard through voting.Voter turnout in U.S. national elections is much lower than most established democracies, with about 60 percent of the voting-eligible population turning out in presidential election years. When people are asked about barriers to voting, the overwhelming majority cites work and school schedule conflicts. Business leaders can join together to ensure work schedules are not a voting barrier for employees.The 2018 midterm elections provide an excellent example of the positive impact businesses can have. Voter turnout was the highest of any midterm election in the last century, and the number oforganizations encouraging their employeesto vote is cited as a contributing factor to this increase.The general election is in full swing, and gone are the days of keeping political discussions out of the workplace.Gartner Inc. released survey findingsearlier this year that show 78 percent of employees are discussing politics at work. Forty-seven percent of employees report being distracted because of the presidential election. And those findings came outbeforethe pandemic became a primary concern for people.COVID-19 has changed the way many of us work and is changing the voting process as well. According to thePew Research Center, nearly 50 percent of registered voters expect to have difficulties casting a ballot. Here are some ideas businesses can implement to increase voter turnout and support employees to make their voices heard – whether they are working in the office or remotely.Our country is experiencing considerable social and political change. Employees expect businesses to lead with clarity and ensure company values and culture guide policies, behaviors and decisions. Supporting employees to exercise their right to vote is an ideal focus for companies and leaders.Leaders — please commit to making time for employees to vote. You can register your company atElectionDay.organdMakeTimeToVote.org. Employees — talk to your leaders or HR departments about how they can support your right to vote.

minnpost_2020_131,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .And so the story goes: good cops and bad cops. The good cops kneel and march with protesters, support justice for George Floyd, and condemn the actions of their brethren who killed him. The bad cops are the aberration, the bad apples that spoil the rest of the barrel. This narrative gets us nowhere.Many cops have noble intentions. But when we focus on the behavior of individual officers — and in this country, with its master myth of personal initiative and meritocracy, that is our wont — we miss a more important point. The problem is not bad apples. The problem is the barrel and the systems that produce it. Police culture is fundamentally warped. I won’t say it’s broken, because it works the way it’s designed to work and because to say it’s broken implies it can be fixed. It needs not repair but replacement. If we continue to reproduce the same despoiled barrel, the quality of the apples we put into it won’t matter.The good cop/bad cop language persists because it props up a system of white supremacy. You can see it in the words of the president, for whom good cops are those who squelch dissent and “dominate” protesters, while “dirty cops” or “crooked cops” are those who challenge his authority and investigate his administration. But you can see it equally in thewordsof officers who condemn George Floyd’s killer: “On behalf of every good cop out there … we apologize. If you have ever been mistreated by the police … we are sorry. Please accept this apology and know that those officers do not speak for the majority of us.” As hopeful and well-intentioned as these words are, they serve the status quo because they intimate that if we eliminate the few bad apples we will have solved the problem.A second incident was filmed in the Whittier neighborhood, when police and the national guard flooded what seemed to be a relatively quiet street to enforce curfew. Some residentsfilmedthe advance from their front porch (a legal place to be, under conditions of the curfew and as officers ran by screaming at the residents to get inside, one cop yelled, “light em up!” Several turned and, in a terrifying display, fired paint canisters at the residents. Not one officer urged calm or restraint. It was a display of military power enacted enthusiastically by a force concerned not with the creation of safety, but with the imposition of fear and control.The rarity of one officer taking action against another, the numerous accounts of officers covering up for their colleagues (see Laquan McDonald , and the recognition that if not for bystander videos cops would not face consequences for their actions, all indicate that the problem is not a few bad apples. The problem is the police culture, the barrel that slimes everyone in it. Numerousstudiesdemonstrate the power of systems and situations to influence human action. To put supposed “good cops” into a bad system may yield some positive outcomes, but it’s much more likely that the individuals will be shaped by the system and act according to itsnormsand expectations. ThatBob Krollis in his third term as the elected president of the Minneapolis Police Union is furthertestamentto this cultural influence, as is thereportthat Minneapolis police use force against black people seven times more often than against white people.It’s not a few bad apples. We need to stop talking about good cops and bad cops and how to provide better training and how to reform the current system. We need to start talking about how to dismantle the culture of policing andreplaceit with something other than thewarrior mindsetthat currently prevails.Jeffery L.

Less than 25 statewide remain, with four still living one Big Island. All in their 90s, soon they will be all gone but should be remembered and never forgotten.From 1906 to 1946, approximately 125,000 Filipinos were recruited by the Hawaii Sugar Planters Association to work in the sugarcane and pineapple fields of the Hawaiian Islands. Less than 25 statewide remain, with four still living one Big Island. All in their 90s, soon they will be all gone but should be remembered and never forgotten.They were called Sakadas, a word of Spanish origin, meaning lower-paid workers recruited out of the area. In Hawaii, the word is synonymous with these pioneers who came to seek their fate, or “gasat” in Ilocano, for a better life for themselves and their families.The first 15 arrived Dec. 20, 1906, on the SS Doric and were assigned to Olaa Sugar in Keaau. With gratitude, for the last five years the Filipino community throughout the state celebrated Dec. 20 as Sakada Day, but this year the coronavirus pandemic has put a temporary stop to it.About one half of the Sakadas who came to Hawaii returned to the Philippines or moved to the U.S. mainland, and the other half remained in Hawaii and are the original “ramot,” or roots, of the Filipino community, which is now the second-largest ethnic group in the state.Early on, the Sakadas agitated against poor working conditions that consisted of $1 per 10-hour work day, six days per week. Acting almost single-handedly, they conducted strikes and paid a great price — loss of employment, housing, prosecution and even death, when 16 Filipinos were killed in 1924 in a confrontation with police in Kauai known as the Hanapepe Massacre. It resulted in the jailing and relocation of leader Pablo Manlapit to California and finally deportation to the Philippines in 1933.The Sakadas instigated three major strikes (1920, 1924 and 1937 , all ending in failure, but in 1946 success finally arrived under the leadership of the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union.On Sept. 1, 1946, the ILWU called a strike and approximately 30,000 workers responded, consisting of 60% Filipinos, 30% Japanese, and 10% others.Six thousand of the strikers were recent Sakadas transported on the SS Maunawili in four voyages in January, February, April, and May of 1946, departing from Port Salomague in Cabugao, Ilocos Sur. They were recruited as strike-breakers but instead some signed on as union members while on board the ship by or upon arrival in Hawaii by ILWU organizers.History relates that the strike of 1946 was a seminal event in Hawaii. The ILWU succeeded in forcing the sugar and pineapple industry to bargain collectively for agricultural workers, which was a first in the islands and the nation and catapulted the union not only as a labor force, but as a driver for economic, social and political reforms of the islands.A turning point was the November 1954 election victory of the Democrat Party over the Republican Party and plantation owners whom controlled the levers of power since the early 1900s. With ILWU support, political leaders like Daniel Inouye, John Burns, Patsy Mink, Yoshito Takamine and many others were elected, and shared governance resulted in statehood and the adoption of health care, unemployment and industrial accident measures favoring all of Hawaii’s working class.Although the Sakadas were not in key leadership positions, it was their massive numbers in the workforce that ensured the success of the strike, and without their collective participation, it is doubtful that the strike would have succeeded, and if not, we need to ponder what living in Hawaii would be like today.The Sakadas’ participation in the labor movement in Hawaii, in particular the role they played in the ILWU-led strike of 1946, is their legacy to a grateful Filipino community.To the greater Hawaii community, please join us today in remembering Sakada Day.Agbiag/Mabuhay/long live the Sakadas.Romel Dela Cruz is a resident of Hilo."
philinquirer_2020_39,"Some neighborhoods are hit especially hard. One tool to help: art.The impacts of climate change are felt across the country in various ways, from wildfires to floods, droughts to hurricanes. In Philadelphia it manifests in extreme urban heat, a multi-faceted threat with negative impacts on our physical, mental and social health. Heat waves are the deadliest form of weather, according todata from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Extreme heat creates heightened risks for those with asthma, hypertension, and heart and pulmonary disease.Research also showsthat extreme heat in school settings impacts test performance and a student’s long-term learning.Heat hits some Philadelphia neighborhoods especially hard. One important tool for those residents is having space to express their lived experiences of extreme heat through public art—while developing local solutions.The Heat Response projectconnects local artists and community leaders with residents of three neighborhoods to tackle the problem.While the neighborhoods where the Heat Response Project is focused—Southeast Philadelphia, Grays Ferry, and Fairhill— all have extreme heat in common, the impacts differ. The Heat Response project has built neighborhood teams, each joining a local artist and community members to answer the questions:Why should we care about urban heat and what can we do about it?» READ MORE:Climate change makes some Philadelphia neighborhoods extra steamy. The city has a plan.It starts with understanding how this became a problem. Due to redlining practices and generations of disinvestment, low-income communities and communities of color experience hotter temperatures than surrounding neighborhoods. These hotter temperatures are created by an urban heat island effect, when lack of green space, an abundance of blacktop surfaces that absorb heat, and dense housing combine to elevate temperatures. On a day that is 82 degrees in Love Park, temperatures soar elsewhere — Southeast Philadelphia feels 87.5 degrees, Grays Ferry hits 89.5 degrees, and Fairhill tops the three at 90 degrees.Councilwoman Katherine Gilmore Richardson, who grew up in North Philadelphia, a neighborhood with few to no trees or green space, said it best at akickoff event introducing Heat Response to the citythis fall: “In Philadelphia, your ZIP code determines your life expectancy.”In Southeast, residents participating in community workshops said that even having lived in other places we might imagine as hotter than Philadelphia, such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Philippines, the heat they experience now is different. It feels much hotter living in a neighborhood locked in asphalt. There are fewer opportunities for relief. A community garden that provides shade with a grass patch for laying down a blanket on hot days was cited as a welcome refuge from summer heat. For others, small home gardens with plants and a pergola could make a summer day outdoors “bearable.”Action on the growing climate emergency — and extreme urban heat specifically — must be a local priority, and not limited to summer months. Extreme urban heat is becoming inescapable for so many communities, and its health and economic consequences are harming our most vulnerable neighbors. We have to act now.» READ MORE:Creating a more equal America demands more urban green spaces | OpinionFirst, we must invest time and resources to identify challenges from within communities. We are already hearing a common thread in postcard responses to our project, in poetry and in artwork: Green space is a refuge, but there’s not enough of it where people need it most.Second, we must bring these concerns and challenges to legislators, who have policy and power at their disposal. Urban planning, climate mitigation, housing, and stormwater infrastructure are just some of the sectors that affect the way residents experience and live with the extreme heat impacts of climate change and for which city officials are responsible.Third, we must invest in sustainable solutions. Last summer, extreme heat became even more of a challenge when the public resources that provide heat relief, including pools, community cooling centers, and libraries, shuttered to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The resulting struggles made all the more clear how badly we need more local green space as relief from the heat.Within our cities and communities, what we should do to mitigate extreme heat will vary, but the starting point is the same: listening to residents about local solutions that will work for them. We are excited to continue these artistic expressions and solutions in Philadelphia the coming year.Owen Franklin is the Pennsylvania State Director for The Trust for Public Land.

minnpost_2020_56,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Meredith Wilson put the same theme to song in the quintessentially American “Music Man” (1957 , in which small-town Iowans are similarly fleeced (remembered from Wilson’s youth in Mason City and as a member of John Phillip Sousa’s Band . The locals fall for the fast-talking “Professor” Harold Hill, who purloins their meager savings to create an imaginary “Boys Band.” As he intones: “and this band will be in uniform.”In 2016, America’s own self-styled Music Man came to town, doing exactly to Iowa and a majority of the states in the Electoral College what Harold Hill had done. His devotees fell for a pitch that promised a glorious, white, immigrant-free future — an empty promise and pitchman’s polemic. At least Harold Hill promised youthful musical achievement and the avoidance of trouble, “with a capital “T.”Trump’s message, by contrast, was undergirded by a troika of racism, misogyny and xenophobia. For Trump, the pitch worked, at least for a while. But as the Trump presidency unfolded into a sodden mess of incompetence and corrupt self-dealing, his pitch lost its tune and became less and less convincing except to the unmasked rubes who had already signed on and drunk the rancid Kool-Aid. Many are now dying of COVID-19, an enduring testament to his fakery and falsehoods.Like the Boys Band, there was no infrastructure, or wall to speak of, or prescription drug price reduction, or a pandemic that just went away, or anything else except a huge tax break for the rich. Instead, there was COVID-19 death and economic collapse and agricultural depression and race riots and police militarism and violence. As COVID rages on, its attendant economic impacts destroy small businesses — the core of small-town Republicanism. Farmers are wounded by the loss of agricultural export markets that America used to own, and its hard-won reputation as a reliable export supplier of grain and oilseeds is in shreds, the result of senseless tit-for-tat tariff wars. Pathetically, farmers were compensated for these losses with grotesque and fiscally unsustainable transfers from taxpayers worth more than $30 billion, even as the Trump administration sought cuts to food stamps to the poor, most of whom live in rural America.Columbia University’s late historian Richard Hofstadter, recently rediscovered by the American media, identified two features of American politics that Trump exploited mercilessly and personally shared. The first is anti-intellectualism; the second is what Hofstadter called the “paranoid style” in American politics. Trump revels in being a nonreader and has adopted Q-Anon and other conspiracy-minded groups as kindred spirits. Apart from these serious flaws in intellect, judgment and character (to put it politely , Trump’s entire personal and political identity was summed up but also contradicted by the circus master P.T. Barnum’s oft-quoted observation that “no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people.” It is contradicted in two ways: Trump repeatedly went broke, and is likely to do so again. Second, in the end, his underestimate of the American people’s intelligence (especially the women and people of color he repeatedly disparaged led a majority of these and other voters to defeat him soundly at the polls.While the coda for his spectacularly failed presidency will be written in time, it is clear now that flaws in the U.S. Constitution, despite the slavish veneration of “originalists,” suggest that a parliamentary system might have been a good choice in the first place. For the past 50 years, academics and political analysts have pointed to unrestrained executive power as the “imperial presidency.” While actions such as the War Powers Act have attempted to restrain this presidential overreach, it was never contemplated that a president as venal, corrupted and intellectually inept would rise to the top. The media occasionally and smugly refer to Romans such as Nero and Caligula as caricatures from ancient history, as if no such excesses could conceivably occur again. They did not bargain on a Nero or Caligula for our time, although there is some evidence to suggest that these Romans, whatever their other vices, may have strongly surpassed the Trump family in innate intelligence.There is no clear way out of this. Biden has appropriately identified COVID-19 as his first priority, but our mishandling of COVID-19 is linked to a variety of other American dysfunctions. These include the severe economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, including unemployment hovering around 14 percent — the greatest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Quite amazingly in this land of plenty, chronic hunger among many of the unemployed, elderly and children is correspondingly acute. A Nov. 25 story in the Washington Post reported that Census Bureau survey data collected in October and early November show that one in eight Americans reported that they didn’t have enough to eat in the last week, equal to 26 million American adults. In households with children, the number is one in six.Response to the pandemic has split along the same ideological and educational lines as has politics generally, with predictably fatal results in rural areas, where Trump propaganda encouraged mask-less risk-taking and subsequent surges in cases and fatalities have occurred.Finally, Trump’s abject delusional psychopathology, refusing to acknowledge electoral defeat, has driven an existential Catch-22 deeper into the calculations of Republicans looking for a way to jump off a sinking ship. Should they stay loyal to Trump and his rabid base by pretending to believe the fantasy that he has not lost the presidency, like those loyal Germans and eventual Nazis who bought Hitler’s assertions that the German defeat in World War I was the result of a “stab in the back” by Jews and others Or should they admit reality and confront the fury of this same baseThis is the tableau playing out now in Georgia, where two U.S. Senate races will be decided by special elections that will determine whether Republicans retain a majority in the Senate. Trump loyalists, including the fanatical former member of Rudy Giuliani’s less than ace legal team, Sidney Powell, recently threatened to “blow up” the elections based on assertions of voter fraud, with no factual support whatsoever. She was found so unhinged that even the Giuliana team dumped her, but Trump supporters in Georgia are still mainlining the Kool-Aid and may boycott support for the Republican candidates.The idea that there is an endgame to these machinations is itself a delusion, because Trump is not playing a strategy but simply improvising, like the Music Man, to get through another media cycle and round of federally subsidized golf at his country clubs. He has no future and he knows it, but will play the role of the Duke until he is ridden out of town on a rail. This pretense will have deep and lasting costs for American credibility in the rest of the world and for American democracy at home. It already has.Carlisle Ford Runge is the Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law, University of Minnesota.

My thumbnail polling indicates the president is popular outside the metro and the challenger is supported inside the beltway. Shocking, I know. Between stops signs there is wonderful time for internal debate about whom to support in the coming election.As a country we have devolved into a never-ending election cycle in which each side pines for air time, media buzz and little cartoon hearts to merit their wisdom. Come on. We stood up against the King of England and his impregnable Armada for this Really, this is how we rate ourselves We are all pathetic. Every one of us. Except my Grandma; to her a tweet is a welcome sound in her apple tree. Grandmas just know what they know.There was a time in American discourse when citizens talked about, debated, and fought for well-informed issues. They did so articulately and with great passion. Then, Americans expected the same passion of our leaders. Today we have rejected the debate of ideas for attacks on personalities. The Public House birthed our country and now we are loath to discuss politics in a bar for fear we may be lumped into some distasteful camp which would result in the quick and forceful ouster from our stool.For at least the second consecutive presidential election the middle third is forced to choose between a candidate they can’t support and someone they don’t want to support. As a traveler I have had the opportunity to espouse this theory to all walks of citizenry and found it to be universally accepted. Seriously, take an Uber ride and talk politics with your newly minted American. Dude will ask you what is wrong with us.Still, here we are.

However, America isn’t that simple and neither is your vote. We are indebted to look farther ahead than the next four years. Elections have consequences, many of which will land squarely upon your doormat. We must look deeper. To be a single-issue voter is to dodge your obligation to our future as a country, a republic, and an idea.Today the electorate needs to take the necessary time and expend the necessary effort to study not the candidate’s temperament, but where they propose to take the country. Look past the exquisitely edited campaign commercials, the blathering pundits on what we once called TV news, and the ever-available experts posed in front of their resplendent bookcases.

Dick Cheney, whom Bush selected as his running mate. Wyoming is probably the deepest “red” of all states; this week voters there chose Trump over Biden by a ratio greater than 2.6 to 1. I’ve visited Wyoming many times over the past 30 years to go hiking and backpacking in one or another of that state’s mountain ranges, and I’ve had many interesting and enjoyable contacts with the people there. I have avoided bringing up political matters.In 2012 I had a long conversation with the executive of a large automobile dealership in Casper. He was clearly interested in my perspectives, although he also carefully avoided the political. In 2005 I spent most of a day in the company of a rancher. We were both veterans; when I mentioned not serving in Vietnam he snorted, “Vietnam! If it was up to me, I’d have A-bombed the whole place, paved it and painted white stripes on it.” To change the subject, I asked about the origins of the large geological feature looming before us. He said, “When I was in college my roommates were geologists. They’re nothing but atheists! It was formed 6,000 years ago in the great flood.” I decided to keep silent for a while.I returned to Minneapolis, and a few days later airliners crashed into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center towers in New York. I wondered, what perspective would average Wyoming citizens have on such an event We know that soon the former congressman mistakenly advised the president to invade Iraq, but Cheney was not average. Our well-liked Republican former Gov. Elmer Andersen termed him “an evil man.”The trouble is that when citizens dwell in ignorance, they may support such ill-informed actions.

Then we talked, and listened, and heard.Gatherings like this force uncomfortable conversations. And discomfort is part of the point. In no other way can we get to the heart of the matter and address the gap between the ideals and the reality. We do that by working to discover what we fiercely agree on and what we believe in.We believe that as with any endeavor, some police officers, prosecutors, judges, and corrections officers honor their oaths of office and some do not.We agree with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” and that when injustices hold people back, America is the worse for it. The recent tragedies highlight how, when racism becomes institutionalized, public policiesdisproportionately harm minority communities— with or without anintent to discriminateon the part of those enforcing the law.Eliminating these injustices requires us to fully embrace our country’s foundational ideals of equal justice, inclusion, and empowerment, which have always been central to our progress as a people.These shared beliefs are critical.

minnpost_2020_188,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After four bitterly partisan special sessions, the Minnesota legislators succeeded in passing a public works infrastructure package at the close of their fifth go-around. While our legislators may havesurmountedtheir bonding bill hurdle at last, at the close of the fifth special session, the status of one issue hadn’t changed at all: $10 million in essential matching funds for the Twin Cities-Milwaukee-Chicago (TCMC “second train” project were nowhere to be seen. Rather than using small levels of passenger rail funding as a bargaining chip, the next Legislature must find $10 million in matching funds for the TCMC second train in order to leverage a total of $43 million infederal grants and matching fundsfrom the state of Wisconsin and Amtrak.For the uninitiated, the TCMC project would add a second daily Amtrak train between St. Paul and Chicago following the route of the famed Empire Builder, which travels from Chicago all the way to Seattle or Portland. Although it’s a scenic journey, the eastbound Empire Builder to Chicago isoften delayedwest of the Twin Cities — frequently for many hours — by oil and other freight trains. A second train would not face these daunting delays, and would also provide both Twin Citians (plus residents of Red Wing and Winona another benefit: asecond setof potentially more convenient arrival and departure times that would complement the Empire Builder’s schedule and make business travel easier.On a fundamental level, it is misguided and shortsighted to use passenger rail funding as a political bargaining chip, while ignoring the ability to leverage $43 million in matching dollars that woulddirectly benefitMinnesota workers, along with both freight and passenger rail operations, plus anadditional $12.6 millionpledged by Amtrak to support startup costs. In this case, the issue is that the horse-trading didn’t come out at all in favor of transit or sustainable intra/intercity transportation projects. While the 2020 bonding bill does have what’s been termed a “historic” $55 million for bus rapid transit, it also features an eye-popping $109 million in trunk highway bonds for state road construction and highway project development, $75 million more for local road improvements, and $72 million for local bridges. Combined, thosethree figuresalone represent nearly five times the investment in bus rapid transit; the Star Tribune’s analysis found$700 million totalin the bill for roads and bridges.The only funds remotely related to passenger rail that made it into the $1.9 billion bill was $3 million (out of a $8.75 million request for the Grassy Point Bridge in Duluth-Superior; the exact status and purpose of these dollars remains unclear. If the Legislature funded the proposed Northern Lights Express train from Minneapolis to Duluth, potential repairs to the bridge would play a small role in that project; if it is never funded, the repairs will only benefit private freight rail operators. Beyond that small sum, no other 2020 requests for passenger rail funding for the Northern Lights Express or for the Northstar Commuter Rail Extension to St. Cloud were included in the final bill.It is obvious that passenger rail was cast aside during negotiations for the 2020 bonding bill and road/bridge projects received the lion’s share of overall transportation funding, while shovel-ready projects like the TCMC second train and the Northern Lights have beenlanguishing on the backburnerfor years.It’s high time for the Minnesota Legislature to move state passenger rail funding off of the sidetracks and onto the mainline. In a time ofintensifying climate crisis, with transportation thelargest sourceof greenhouse gas emissions in Minnesota, fundingsustainablepassenger rail may help reduce emissions and vehicle miles traveled. Appropriating $10 million in matching funds for the TCMC second train project can help give Minnesotans an accessible and efficient intercity travel option — but only if the Legislature acts as soon as possible.Gordy H.

suffolknewsherald_2020_108,"Published 9:55 pm Friday, May 29, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Delegate Clinton JenkinsRacial disparity lies deeply rooted in our criminal justice system, afflicting adult and juvenile sentencing. The 2020 legislative session served as a historic opportunity to overturn some of the darkest chapters of our Commonwealth’s history. As a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, I proudly supported House Bill 35, which grants eligibility for parole after 20 years to those who were minors when sentenced to life in prison.The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that sentencing a juvenile to life without parole violated the U.S. Constitution under the Eighth Amendment as it is cruel and unusual punishment. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote, “mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features — among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences.”HB 35 brings a more constitutional and humane approach to juvenile justice, which is necessary to improve the criminal justice system, but we must further address the racial disparities in arrest, prosecution and sentencing in future legislative sessions.Recent news reports criticized some Virginia Parole Board decisions, including parole for certain offenders sentenced to life without parole during their teenage years. This coverage mischaracterizes the parole system and overlooks the injustice of sentencing juveniles to life without parole.As HB 35 does not go into effect until July 1, the only inmates sentenced as juveniles who are currently eligible for parole are those with pre-1995 convictions. This restriction comes from a 1994 law signed by former Gov. George Allen abolishing parole, whichThe Washington Postcalled a “throw-away-the-key proposal.”The Parole Board considers each eligible case in depth, basing its decisions on numerous factors, including: risk to public safety; circumstances of the crime; history and conduct while in prison; input from victims and concerned citizens; and any medical conditions. Parole is granted in only a small percentage of cases, and recidivism among discretionary parolees in Virginia (10% is significantly lower than the overall rate of 23.1 percent for all former offenders in the Commonwealth.Let’s not politicize a parole process that is stringent and fair, which includes input from victims and concerned citizens, contrary to what anti-reform advocates argue. Granting parole involves much more than opening gates and allowing prisoners out without thought or supervision. The review process includes identifying if the person has support outside of prison, aside from the parole officer assigned to them. The Parole Board also evaluates the potential parolee’s plan for a productive reintegration into society, including their opportunities for work. Once approved, the Parole Board develops a tailored parole plan. While the law requires the Parole Board to notify victims and their families of the release, it does not require the notification of Commonwealth’s Attorneys.Instances where Virginia courts callously and needlessly sentenced children to life without parole show the broken nature of our criminal justice system and the urgent need to dismantle this practice. Travion Blount’s case serves as a prime example: a court-imposed six life sentences plus 118 years for a house party robbery when he was 15 years old, despite no shots fired or serious injuries. The two 18-year-old accomplices received significantly lesser sentences of 10 and 13 years, since they pleaded guilty.In this nation, we value forgiveness, rehabilitation and second chances. Our Parole Board offers the Commonwealth a way to demonstrate these values, working diligently to screen and identify incarcerated offenders most likely to live as productive members of society outside of prison. Its decisions come after thorough consideration and planning, reflected in low recidivism rates among parolees. We could all learn from this level of deliberation and recognize that those who have worked to rehabilitate themselves deserve a fair second chance.Delegate Clinton Jenkins represents the 76th District, which includes part of Suffolk, in the Virginia House of Delegates.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_77,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°In ordinary years, I spend Thanksgiving week with my family in Minneapolis quietly judging them for things I don’t like about myself. This year, Dr. Anthony Fauci has urged all of us to skip the travel and in-person holiday altogether to keep it from becoming a super-spreader event. I haven’t revered someone who exclusively delivers bad news this much since my last therapist quit on me.In ordinary years, I spend Thanksgiving week with my family in Minneapolis quietly judging them for things I don’t like about myself. This year, Dr. Anthony Fauci has urged all of us to skip the travel and in-person holiday altogether to keep it from becoming a super-spreader event. I haven’t revered someone who exclusively delivers bad news this much since my last therapist quit on me.Fauci’s message might not be what any of us want to hear, but we can still revel in a subtext: Science is back.Thanks to Zoom, Thanksgiving is back, too. Just when I thought I had the perfect “Get Out of Holiday Free” card, I miscalculated my faux sadness and ended up with a “Virtual T’Gives” evite in my inbox. Previous evites that elicited the same groan were for a dog’s 11th birthday party and a gender-reveal laser light show. But we’re all just trying to make the best of our celebrations. Think of this as your guide to a successful Zoom Thanksgiving.This has the potential to be the weirdest Thanksgiving ever since family of all stripes, random friends and people you met on the Nextdoor app will actually show up, and they’ll all be starved for human interaction. We’d never sit around the holiday table for eight hours straight in real life, so rather than staging one daylong video chat with the whole group, plan breakout rooms — smaller offshoot video chats — so you can have genuine conversations, and everyone gets the chance to tell off that special person in their life whose main news source is a YouTube channel with 117 subscribers.If you’re one of those families that has an annual football game, keep the internecine sports rivalry going by discussing the problematic aspects of American football. Earn extra points for highlighting the parallels between the NFL’s and the Trump administration’s COVID protocols, which seem to value financial profit over people’s lives. There’s absolutely no chance the fight can get physical, so talk your talk!Most Thanksgiving traditions are just distractions that keep us from eating before the already embarrassingly early afternoon dinner. My favorite tradition is watching “Home Alone” and reciting every line while my family pleads with me to be quiet. I feel closest to them when I’m getting under their skin. Adding a “watch party” to your remote Thanksgiving would give you time to discreetly partake in what our state considers recreation and our parents’ state considers “technically illegal but whatever.”There’s still no way to avoid long, drawn-out family chatter, so contain the chaos by preparing conversation starters. Keep things light and positive with family memories or funny “would you rather” style questions, avoid politics and public health issues, and if all else fails, be prepared to discuss “The Bachelor” franchise. Whether you love it or hate it, it will bring your whole group together through schadenfreude.If the conversation gets tense or uncomfortable, you can always “lose the internet” momentarily so you can secretly take another pull on your bottle before “signing” back in. And remember to double- and triple-check to make sure you’re sending a private rather than a public chat message when you’re gossiping about your “interesting cousin” who goes to those goth Disneyland meetups.Even though it will be near impossible for the parental figures in the virtual room to enforce the “no phones at the table” rule, the yearly tradition of getting scolded or scolding someone else for their cellphone addiction will likely survive online. Too much side-texting can cause you to miss juicy hometown gossip, like which of your preschool classmates are now divorced, but it’s always OK to text your brother to tell him to “fix your face” while your mom is talking.Since our Thanksgiving cooks will miss the heaps of praise they’re used to getting in person, remember to share exaggerated compliments and white lies like “Thanks for this holiday meal care package! Cooking it myself will be fun” or “Looks like the Keto diet is working!”Actually eating Thanksgiving dinner while Zooming does not sound that enticing, but if you must, make sure to include a lesson on how to use the mute button after saying grace. Listening to remote chewing may be popular on TikTok, but for those outside the Gen Z crowd, it can create family divisions that no amount of therapy can solve.There’s really no way to get virtual Thanksgiving wrong as long as you feel connected to the people you’re spending it with. Unless those “people” are a row of dolls you set up at the table to argue with. That will be me after my family reads this.Jason Shapiro is a comedy writer and author of the satirical Los Feliz Daycare Twitter feed."

suffolknewsherald_2020_221,"Published 6:22 pm Tuesday, September 22, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceNetflix caused a commotion a few weeks ago when they released a movie called “Cuties.”Netflix touts the film as a coming-of-age drama, but many criticize the movie for sexualizing young girls. The film features 11-year-old girls in a “free-spirited dance crew.” The dances the children learn to perform are highly suggestive and sexual. The film is so raunchy that it caused a viral campaign calling on people to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and several legislators questioning if the film should even be legal.We should be disgusted at this movie, but its release on Netflix should not have come as a surprise. America has been allowing, accepting and promoting the sexualization of children, especially of girls, for quite some time. This movie, like films often tend to do, has simply brought to light a part of our culture.The dances the girls perform in the movie are suggestive at times and blatantly sexual during some routines. It’s sad that we would allow this to stream into our homes, but what’s worse is that many parents allow their children to mimic sexual acts in the name of performance art. Children too young to understand the nature of the movements are called cute, and those who know what they are imitating are said to be “so grown.”The movie places the girls in inappropriate outfits, but it’s not a stretch from what some children wear in real life. Young girls are often allowed to wear suggestive or revealing clothing for a night out with friends, on a date, or for a special event at school. Outfits once donned only by bar-hopping adults or those going to nightclubs are now made in children’s sizes, and this should cause us more concern than a movie.There are many reasons the sexualization of our children, especially our girls, has grown so much in the past decade.For one thing, we have allowed our children to date at an earlier and earlier age. The days of school crushes are almost gone as many parents now allow and encourage their children to enter into a full-fledged relationship before they even reach high school. This leads to children often feeling more mature than they are, and they try to dress and act like the adults they see in relationships. Some children fully understand what they are copying, while others don’t quite understand what they are imitating, and I’m not sure what is worse.Secondly, we inundate our children with sexualized images, movies, TV shows and songs from a very early age. Things that we once hid from children to allow them a childhood are now broadcasted to them on a nearly consistent basis.The release of this film saddens me, but perhaps it will force America to take a long look at what we are doing to the children in our country. The problem isn’t a movie.

minnpost_2020_130,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The scene was intense. Black residents of Minneapolis angered over an incident of police brutalityfought with officers in the streetsand set buildings ablaze. Many were injured; dozens were arrested. Eventually the National Guard, called in to patrol the streets, ordered black citizens back into their homes.This may sound a lot like a scene from a couple of weeks ago, but it’s actually a flashback to 1967, whenAfrican Americans took to the streetsof north Minneapolis after a series of abuses that, like today, culminated in days of unrest.It took place in one of the “long, hot summers” of the 1960s, when black Americans in cities across the country protested and rioted over police abuse and segregation. While our history booksremind us of famous riotsin major cities like Los Angeles, Newark and Detroit, what took place in Minneapolis – where the black population back then wasjust 8%– is often forgotten.I stumbledacross this story while doing research on a book about the Minneapolis music scene andhow it made Prince. With protests and riots taking place across the country to protest the murder ofGeorge Floyd, now’s a good time to revisit what happened in Minneapolis in 1967 – and why it represents a missed opportunity that laid the seeds for today’s unrest.African Americans living in north Minneapolis in the 1960s faced thesame problems of segregation, poverty and disinvestmentthat blacks in other American cities endured.Frustration with the resulting marginalization as well as discriminatory Jim Crow lawsled to a rippling series of urban uprisingsin the U.S. in 1964. The unrest finally reached Minneapolis in 1966, whenlooting and arson took place on Plymouth Avenuein north Minneapolis.One result of the tumult was black cultural centers began to spring up across the country, including in Minneapolis, wherecity officials helped establishThe Way in the north of the city. The center became a space where local African Americans could hold community meetings, play sports and perform. Prince, who grew up in the neighborhood, practiced and performed there – and even played a little ball.But it also became a place where blacks could share their stories of life in the city and organize themselves.The city’s response to unrest one year later was decidedly less accommodating.On July 19, 1967, analtercation broke outbetween two teenage black girls at the city’sAquatennial Torchlight parade. Nearby police trying to break up the scuffle between them threw both girls to the ground. When a young teenage black boy who witnessed the incident complained to the officer about the treatment of the girls, another officer struck him too.News of what had happened spread quickly among black residents, and many gathered at The Way the next day to organize a protest in response. Later that night, black residents marched along Plymouth Avenue and demanded the officers be held accountable.Police arrived.Tensions escalated. An officer struck a pregnant woman in the belly – she subsequently miscarried – and fights between residents and police broke out. Protesters threw rocks and set fires to buildings with Molotov cocktails.City officials, naturally, wanted to get to the bottom of what had happened in hopes of preventing another riot in the future. They did so in two ways.The first was apublic forum, organized by local religious leaders, that focused on listening to the grievances of the protesters and other residents. Protesters who attended made it clear that fatigue with police brutality was the main reason they marched and rioted.“This will show them we are not going to take any more of the cops shoving and pushing us,” said one protester. Another explained the violence of the protesters was a normal response to social conditions. “You back a colored man into a corner and complain when he comes out fighting,” he said.But in the city’s other response, officials came to a very different conclusion for what caused the unrest. The county impaneled an all-white grand jury to identify those who “perpetrated the crimes,” determine if there was a conspiracy and consider any “constructive decisions that would be helpful in the future.”From the start, the prosecutorial nature of the grand jury made it feel like officials were ignoring the community’s call for a different model of policing, one that takes black safety and the value of black life seriously.Moreover, the grand jury’s report, in addressing whether there were any “constructive decisions” that could prevent a recurrence, disregarded the community’s claims of brutality as the impetus for the uprising.“No weapons were fired by authorities,” the report claimed, though a young black manwas rushed to the county hospitalwith a gunshot wound. “And there is no evidence of so-called ‘police brutality.’”The grand jury recommended The Way and its staff be investigated for inciting the disturbance. Finally, the report concluded that more beat police patrolling “certain areas” like north Minneapolis would help to better establish positive connections between police and communities of color.And so, by ignoring the voices of the black community and their calls for change and accountability – and instead doubling down on the kind of policies that caused the problems – the city of Minneapolis squandered an opportunity to improve relations between black citizens and the police. Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25 is a consequence of this public policy failure.As Americans grapple with how to respond to today’s unrest, I hope they don’t make the same mistake they did in 1967.Rashad Shabazzis an associate professor at theSchool of Social Transformation, Arizona State University.This commentaryis republished fromThe Conversation."

That was the day when President Trump had this to say about his rival for the presidency, lifelong Catholic Joe Biden: “He’s against God.”Partisan polarization has been part of American politics for decades, but in 2020 our national fault line expanded into dangerous new territory: demonization and delegitimization.In his reelection campaign, Trump didn’t merely denounce Biden and other Democrats as misguided; he accused them of being enemies of the nation — and being evil.“They’re vicious, horrible people,” he said at one campaign rally.“They hate our country,” he said at another.That isn’t normal political language in the United States, not even in the heat of an election campaign.And when a president abandons all norms of civility, the problem is bigger than a mere lapse in etiquette; his words and actions encourage others to behave badly, too.Democracy rests on a principle of mutual tolerance: We may hate our opponents’ ideas, but we accept their legitimacy and their right to compete just as they accept ours.Think, for example, of what Republican presidential nominee John McCain said of Democratic nominee Barack Obama during their 2008 campaign: “He’s a decent family man and citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.” That’s the norm we once expected our politicians to maintain.Now imagine Trump saying anything close to that.When protests erupted after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, most presidents would have called for calm and national unity; Trump seized the moment to attack Democratic governors and mayors.His norm-busting campaign of division extended even to the COVID-19 pandemic.“If you take the blue states out … we’re really at a very low level,” he claimed in September. (The assertion was not merely false; it was wildly false. Polarizing language has consequences.A Pew Research Center poll in October found that about 9 in 10 voters in both parties said they believed an election victory by the other side would result in “lasting harm” to the country.That’s a dangerous trend. The belief that each party poses an existential threat to the other also makes it more difficult for politicians to negotiate with each other after elections are over — if only because many of their voters loathe the idea of compromising with the other side.In one of his last acts as president, Trump broke one more political norm, perhaps the most basic of all: the principle that a losing candidate accepts the outcome of an election.Even after Republican-controlled state legislatures certified Biden’s victory in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, he refused to concede.The next four years will tell us whether 2020 will be remembered as the modern era’s low point in American civility, or whether we have further to fall.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
minnpost_2020_219,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The death last week of a Minnesota congressional candidate may propel the state into a pivotal role in the election of the president.The decedent is Adam Weeks, the long-shot nominee in the Second Congressional District of the Legalize Marijuana Now Party, which is deemed a “major” party because it accumulated 5% of the ballots in a recent election cycle.Because of his death, under an unusual Minnesota law, the seat, currently held by Democrat Angie Craig, becomes vacant at the end of her term on Jan. 3. It will remain idle until filled by a special election on Feb. 9, three weeks after Inauguration Day.That vacancy could be a major factor in the selection of the person who takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.Many of the unprecedented doomsday forecasts for the presidential election are outside the purview of the Constitution and probably unimaginable to the Founders. But one scenario that has been largely overlooked is prescribed in the Constitution and has been used previously.It’s the possibility that the election could be decided by the House of Representatives in a bizarre way in which the smallest states would outrank the largest ones — and Minnesota may play a key role.That brouhaha could come about if neither of the two major candidates gets a majority, at least 270, of the 538 potential electoral votes. That could occur due to long-drawn-out ballot counting, especially of absentee/mail-in votes, even more prolonged litigation — both distinct possibilities — or a 269-269 Trump-Biden tie vote, which is highly unlikely (but in this year anything seems imaginable .The electoral votes of all states are to be submitted on Dec. 14. Then, they are to be tabulated and announced at a session of the newly sworn-in Congress on Jan. 3. The next (or same president is to be inaugurated at noon on Jan. 20.Sounds pretty simple, a term that applies to very little these days. But it may not be. If a majority of electoral votes is not obtained by those due dates, particularly the latter in early January, there would be no president to be inaugurated.The Constitution provides a solution. Under Article II, section 1, the choice is left to the House of Representatives. It presumably would want to decide before noon on Inauguration Day. If not, then the speaker of the House — presumably Nancy Pelosi, if the Democrats retain control of that chamber, as seems highly likely — would ascend at least temporarily to the Oval Office.In the House, the Constitution provides that “the Votes shall be taken by States … each State having one Vote.” This means that each state casts one vote based on the majority decision of its members and the first candidate to 26 wins, maybe.This procedure actually has been utilized twice before, both involving a member of the founding Adams family. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson was elected this way, ousting incumbent John Adams. The House election went on for 36 ballots. In that brouhaha, Alexander Hamilton managed to sway votes away from his rival, Aaron Burr, who had tied Jefferson for electoral votes, to Jefferson to put him over the top and into the White House.Adams’ son, John Quincy, went through a similar House election 24 years later but came out on top in a battle not without its own controversy. His opponent, Andrew Jackson, received more popular and electoral votes but due to multiple candidates, not a majority, thrusting the decision to the House, again. Adams squeaked into office due to Henry Clay tossing his support to him, which yielded a position of secretary of state for Clay and a slogan of a “corrupt bargain” that motivated Jackson to run again in 1828 — this time defeating Adams decisively in both the popular vote and electoral count.If the election this year is tossed into the House, there are other weird ways the presidency could be decided.It’s unlikely the District of Columbia, which has three presidential electoral votes, would participate because it has no elected membership in Congress. Thus, those voters would be disenfranchised altogether in the process. But more troublesome, the House voters need not follow the popular vote or even the electoral vote in their state; they are free to vote for any candidate they want. Indeed, they are so untethered that it has been suggested that they could vote for anyone at all. But the text of the provision indicates that it must be one who gathers at least a single electoral vote in any state.But the main sticking point of a presidential election in the House of Representatives is the state-unit vote requirement with each state voting the way a majority of its members decide.As currently composed, on a state-by-state basis Republicans hold a slight majority in the House. Although outnumbered in totality, Republicans have a majority of House members in 26 states, including those seven small single-member states, while Democrats are on top in 23 and one, Michigan, is tied 7-7.But that could change, one way or the other, this November.That’s where Minnesota fits in. The congressional delegation is five Democrats, including Craig, and three Republicans. The incumbents seem to be favored to win in nearly all of them, although upsets are possible in a couple of them.If so, and all other incumbents prevail — no sure thing, mind you — the delegation would have a 4-4 partisan split, making an impasse possible, indeed likely, if the House is to choose the president. But without Craig there, the breakdown could be 4-3 for one party or the other. If so, the Seventh District race could be determinative whether the state’s delegation would vote for Trump or Joe Biden.But Minnesota’s contribution to the prospective electoral mess in the House is paled by another consideration. Because each state has one vote, the Congress members from small states and their constituents will have hugely disproportionate impacts on the outcome, even more so than in the grievously distorted Electoral College.In a House election, California would get one vote for some 40 million residents; so would Wyoming with 600,000 people. To make matters worse, the four largest states, California, Texas, New York, and Florida, — comprising blue, red, and swing jurisdictions — contain more than one-third of the nation’s population, but would cast only 4 of 50 votes, 8% of the total. That’s the same proportion of the four smallest states—Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, and North Dakota, which have a total of about 2.2 million people, barely 2% of the four biggest states.And you thought the Electoral College was unfair.But there’s more. Since each state gets a single vote from its congressional delegation, the Republicans have a huge, perhaps insurmountable advantage. Although they now hold a minority position and probably will after the election, a majority of states have more GOP representatives than Democrats, including those with single members. That makes it highly likely that, in the event of a House election, the bulk of states would tilt toward the right, notwithstanding the GOP’s minority status in that body.The Democrats, however, are not bereft of tools and tricks of their own. Under the Constitution, the House election cannot proceed unless there is a quorum consisting of “Members from two-thirds of the states.” A walkout by 13 states could deprive the House of a quorum and paralyze it from proceeding. But that, too, is unlikely because there will not be 13 states composed solely of Democrats. This strategy, thus, would not work unless their walkout were joined by all of their Republican colleagues. However, the prospect of a walkout could give them some leverage to try to negotiate a more favorable outcome or other post-election concessions.But absent that device, tossing the election into the House may virtually assure re-election of President Trump or, perhaps, his replacement by another GOP favorite.Marshall H.

minnpost_2020_16,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .BNSF Railway has ended talks with Met Council over the co-location of freight and light rail transit operations on its little-used Bottineau corridor through the northwest suburbs, claiming it could not “protect the long-term viability of service for current and future Minnesota freight customers.” And yet, the freight rail juggernaut seems willing to work with the same Met Council to add even more Northstar commuter trains to its congested and strategically critical freight main line between Minneapolis and St. Cloud. Go figure. You have one of the worst-patronized commuter rail operations in the U.S. working with a capacity-challenged freight railroad to add even more poorly performing commuter trains to its overloaded freight network. What could possibly go wrong Is there something — anything — that can save these two organizations from themselvesWell, there is. It is something that mercifully separates freight from transit on the Bottineau spur without actually eliminating freight service; something that returns critical Northstar train capacity to BNSF where BNSF appears to need it most; something that puts highway infrastructure money into the Northstar corridor to offset modest service cutbacks — all while extending commuter rail to St. Cloud. In essence, you trade Northstar for the Blue Line Extension in a way that leaves the glass at least half full for all sides rather than mostly empty for beleaguered Bottineau transit stakeholders.For those facing service cutbacks, freed-up Northstar resources would fund express bus service to Minneapolis from outlying locales and an augmented city-fleet bus service for inner-ring Fridley and Coon Rapids riders. MnDOT and the Met Council, as part of the deal, would need to accelerate the long overdue conversion of Highways 10 in Ramsey and 252 in Brooklyn Center to limited access status and stop punishing commuters in that area for the misguided Northstar gambit. These measures will improve transit performance and flexibility on this particular corridor far more than is possible with fixed-route trains.Meanwhile, back at Bottineau, it turns out that remaining freight shippers are all at, or west of, Osseo and, therefore, west of where the transit line would leave the BNSF right-of-way. A rail bridge over the Mississippi at Monticello that extends the freight spur five miles to the BNSF main line would allow trains out of Becker to serve these shippers without venturing onto the Bottineau transit corridor southeast of Osseo. Make that Monti bridge a dual use highway/rail affair, thereby removing the need for the planned Highway 24 Clearwater bridge bypass just upstream, and highway money can help ease the fiscal pain. That makes possible a less costly and truly unimpaired Bottineau Blue Line extension and, with it, the social and economic development goodwill taxpayers there are demanding — goodwill that cannot be matched by Northstar.Making this happen will take more creative, big-picture negotiating chops than Met Council or BNSF operatives have shown to date. But they have bosses with chops. BNSF owner Warren Buffett would clearly grasp that running two 10-car freight trains per week through downtown Robbinsdale is not a higher and better use of pricey suburban real estate. And while Met Council seems to answer to no one hereabouts, it does answer to those who control its federal funds. Donald Trump, no stranger to money-losing ventures, does that. So, put these two to work and let’s make this deal. The northwest metro is watching — and tired of waiting.Jerome Johnson is a retired transportation economist living in St. Paul.

suffolknewsherald_2020_149,"Published 9:20 pm Friday, May 1, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Tonya S. SwindellA significant event occurred in September 1989 when I was 16 years old. It changed my life and how I interact with God and others. As I write about my experience via this article and social media platforms, I challenge others to share their own stories. Many readers may find comfort in what I and others have to share.A boy and girl who barely knew me became my friend more than 30 years ago. The girl, whose name was Laquita, asked me for a ride home from volleyball practice. Her boyfriend, Anthony, often accompanied her during those rides.Laquita and Anthony were very nice to me, and I appreciated that. They were also fun loving, likeable and friendly toward others. People seemed to be drawn to them, especially Laquita, who had a huge smile, boisterous laughter and an excellent sense of humor. She stood out as a talented volleyball and basketball player, too.Anthony had what I considered to be a strange habit for a teenager. He carried a big, black book almost everywhere he went. When I peeked through the rearview mirror of the compact car I was driving, I typically saw him reading or flipping through crisp pages of the book he seemed to treasure so much.I admired Laquita and Anthony, and after several weeks of them riding in my car, I felt like something was missing from my life. Despite many Sundays in which I sat on a pew eating candy and passing notes at the church my father pastored, I felt an emptiness I couldn’t explain. Even though I had access to pretty much anything I may have wanted or needed, I still felt an unexplainable void.I had grown to trust Laquita and Anthony’s judgment, so one day, I asked them how to fill my empty space. After listening to their answer, I dropped them off before going home. Then I closed my bedroom door, got on my knees and began to pray.I asked God to forgive my wrongdoings. I also confessed my belief that Jesus Christ, His Son, had died for my sins and was supernaturally raised to life again. Finally, I asked Jesus to fill the empty space within my heart by becoming the Lord of my life.Since then I have experienced ups, downs, highs and lows. But memories of the ways in which Laquita, Anthony, my parents and others modeled their love has stuck with me. Although I may question certain situations, feel anxious or unsure at times, I am still grateful for having overall peace that surpasses my own understanding.Some people may relate to feeling empty. They may also feel curious to learn how others have dealt with similar feelings. My hope is that individuals will accept my challenge by sharing their own salvation stories within their local newspapers, social media outlets and perhaps during casual conversations. Similar stories may inspire others at a time when it is greatly needed.Tonya Swindell is an occupational therapist.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_36,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Did you know today (Dec. 15 is “Bill of Rights Day”? If the answer is no, you’re not alone. Most Americans are barely aware of it.Did you know today (Dec. 15 is “Bill of Rights Day”? If the answer is no, you’re not alone. Most Americans are barely aware of it.Sadly, that’s not surprising. Most of us would fail the U.S. citizenship exam. Few can name more than one or two First Amendment rights or more than a few rights in the entire first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution. That is a serious problem, especially at a time when lawsuits nationwide ask judges to reform criminal justice or to stop states from discriminating against religious gatherings.It doesn’t have to be this way, though. And fortunately, different kinds of organizations are addressing Americans’ lack of civic knowledge in unique ways.Take Constituting America, founded by actor Janine Turner, and co-led by Cathy Gillespie. Very few organizations engage students to teach one another, but Constituting America is one of them. It encourages multimedia peer education through its We the Future contest. A student may create a TikTok video, a song or a work of art to help other kids understand their American rights and responsibilities.For teachers, the aptly named Bill of Rights Institute, the Ashbrook Center, and a few similar organizations provide teachers with the education that they should have received in education school but never did. These organizations engage teachers in serious discussion of core documents in American history to understand how principles of freedom, legal equality and rights have unfolded throughout our short, fragile, but well-balanced history as a republic.Fundamental American values like these are constantly under debate. The National Christian Forensics and Communications Association is one of just a few organizations — if not the only one — that helps students think deeply enough about different points of view to debate them intelligently, with integrity and with grace toward those who disagree. Fewer organizations exist at the college level, in part because too many people assume that kids have had enough civics by the time they’ve graduated high school. The William S. Knight Center for Patriotic Education at College of the Ozarks is one of the innovative college-level projects under construction.In policy, the Texas Public Policy Foundation and other state-level organizations encourage policymakers to address America’s civic literacy deficits.Of course, all of these organizations, and many more, do much more to improve civic education in America in many ways. Parents, in particular, are a significant part of their work and a large part of the solution. “We are in charge of our children’s futures, and it’s time for a revolution,” Turner wrote upon founding Constituting America a decade ago.On Bill of Rights Day, we can hear about all of these organizations in a special celebration hosted by The Heritage Foundation’s Feulner Institute. We invite everyone to tune in to learn, celebrate and think carefully about our first freedoms.Now that parents in 2020 see what their homebound children are really being exposed to, more and more parents are using resources from these organizations and are calling for curricular transparency and reform.Note also that none of these are government programs. Self-governance requires that we all step up to preserve our best values for the next generation. The question is, are we?"
minnpost_2020_126,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .State Patrol officers had an unusual assignment at the State Capitol grounds in St. Paul on Wednesday as they stood guard when workers cleaned up the just toppled 10-foot statue of Christopher Columbus. It was international news as protesters also damaged or destroyed similar monuments to Columbusin Massachusetts and Virginia.The justification for this, according to Native American activist and protest leader Mike Forcia, was an extension of demonstrations against police brutality and racial inequalities after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25.“It was the right thing to do and it was the right time to do it,” said Forcia.Native American activists have long protested against the honoring of Columbus in any way because his four expeditions to the Americas led to colonization and genocide.The fallen monument had been created by sculptor Carlo Brioschi and dedicated in 1931 as a gift from Italian-Americans in Minnesota. Forcia said he may be arrested as a result of the incident.Alhambra, Spain, visit in 2010My wife and I learned about the mixed legacy of Columbus in Spain 10 years ago when we stayed and explored Alhambra,a well-preserved palace and fortress in Granada dating to AD 889. Ferdinand and Isabella reigned and Columbus lived there in the late 15thcentury.Columbus had asked the reluctant Ferdinand and Isabella multiple times to back his planned voyages. The king and queen finally stabilized their government but were in desperate need of money.Believing foreign commerce, trade, and empire were keys to their future prosperity and deciding that the possible benefits in backing Columbus’ outweighed the overall monetary risk, the king and queen finally agreed to his request. The deal included Columbus being the “admiral, viceroy and governor” of any land he discovered, keeping 10% of the wealth he acquired.Columbus initially believed he was going to a quicker route to Asia, the richest part of the world at that time. Instead, in 1492 he landed in the Americas, bringing ships and crosses with him. Columbus would return three more times over the next 12 years.In the places that Columbus landed, natives were forced into slavery and punished with flogging, loss of limb or death if they did not perform to such expectations as collecting enough gold each day from the mines.Columbus and his fellow travelers also brought with them diseases that ravaged the welcoming natives of the new land, estimated to have eventually killed 90% of them.Columbus proved to be a greedy, cruel invader, a reckless adventurer and a fraud in that he never planted the flag of Spain in North America.Eventually, others brought word back to Europe of Columbus’ horrific treatment of the population amounting to genocide and in 1499 he was arrested, chained up and brought back to Spain and stripped of his royal titles. He died in 1506 at the age of 54.Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples DayOct. 12, 2020, is Columbus Day in America — a national holiday in many other countries as well — officially celebrating the anniversary of Christopher Columbus’ arrival in the Americas on Oct. 12, 1492.There has been significant pushback, however.Context does matterand the context of Columbus Day is horrific.The turning point began in 1990, whenSouth Dakota changed the nameof the holiday to Native American Day as part of a year of reconciliation with its tribes. Berkeley, California, became the first city to officially jettison the Columbus Day name;the new moniker became Indigenous Peoples Dayin 1992.In 2014Minneapolis designated the second Monday of October Indigenous Peoples Day. Several other Minnesota cities followed. In 2016, Gov. Mark Daytonissued a statewide proclamationsaying that Monday, Oct. 10, 2016, was Indigenous Peoples Day. And in 2019, some 10 months after taking office, Gov. Tim Walz likewise issuedan official proclamationthat Columbus Day is now Indigenous Peoples Day.Chuck Slocum, founder and president of The Williston Group, can be reached atChuck@WillistonGroup.Com"
minnpost_2020_41,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Xcel’s current plan isn’t making the grade. So what would an “A” grade resource plan look likeLet’s start with what it wouldn’t include. It would not include Xcel’s proposed massive fossil gas plant that would emit over 3 million metric tons of carbon annually. It also wouldn’t include relicensing the Monticello nuclear plant without detailed plans for safe decommissioning and storage of waste, and protections for customers from a repeat of the utility’s 2014 cost overrun fiasco.An “A” grade plan would also include a lot more solar. Estimates from federal experts suggest that Minnesota could draw nearly 40 percent of its electricity from rooftops alone. A recent study supported by the McKnight Foundation found that 13 gigawatts of solar – more than 10 times the current state capacity – would not only sharply reduce carbon emissions but would result in massive reductions in household electricity costs for everyone.You also wouldn’t know from Xcel’s plan that Minnesota is a national leader in community solar – solar projects that allow multiple residents, renters, and businesses to share the sun-produced electricity. Each megawatt of community solar provides clean energy and electric bill savings for an average of 20 Minnesota customers and, according to an ILSR analysis, saves all customers money by producing energy close to where we use it. More than 100,000 Minnesotans could join the community solar revolution if half the McKnight study’s solar were built in these solar “gardens.” Instead of accelerating solar growth in Minnesota, Xcel has been lobbying state lawmakers to curtail community solar because it competes with profit-making ventures like gas plants.Cities could also partner with Minnesota’s vibrant network of independent solar installers to find job training and opportunities for folks typically left behind in clean energy jobs, including African-Americans and other communities of color. These financial and employment benefits would stack on top of massive health benefits because solar energy reduces demand for fossil gas plants that generate pollution as they burn gas, but also gas is shipped along pipelines or fracked from communities that are disproportionately Black and poor.As the improved plan accelerates clean energy, it should also consider the health and economic needs of the employees and communities left behind as we shutter the power plants of the polluting past. The plan would include support for workers in fossil fuel power plants, but also envision a partnership with state and federal authorities to build resilient economies in power plant host communities, including aid to supplant lost tax revenue.Unfortunately, this visionary plan — one that supports low-income rural and urban communities, expands renewable energy resources, and builds a grid that is ready for the future — is not the plan that Xcel Energy put forward. In this climate crisis; in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the need to end a legacy of racism across the country, we can accept nothing less than a plan that seeks to heal both our planet and our communities.Utilities and climate activists across the country see Xcel Energy as a leader. They may not realize how far we still have to go.John Farrell is the co-director of theInstitute for Local Self-Reliancein Minneapolis.

eugeneweekly_2020_10,"We ve got issues. After more than 10 years of writing columns forThe Register-Guard, it was time for a change. I am pleased to say I will now write forEugene Weekly. One lesson I’ve learned through my work is that self-focused disregard for the impacts of one’s actions on others lies at the heart of most of today’s social, economic, and ecological problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed this dynamic for all to see. Case in point is an experience I recently had with the Eugene Police Department. I was pulled over by the police while driving into town. Neither of the two officers who stopped me was wearing a mask. One leaned down, and from just outside my open car window, no more than three feet away, said they pulled me over because my license plate was out of date. The maskless officer continued to talk to me for about 15 minutes from three feet away, asking for my driver’s license, returning it and inquiring about the registration. About three quarters of the way through the incident it dawned on me that the officer was not wearing a mask. So I ask her to move back and practice social distancing. She did not do so. After more dialogue the officers told me I should get the registration fixed and left without issuing a citation. As they walked back to their vehicle I became concerned about what had just transpired, leaned out my window, and asked why she was not wearing a mask. She responded, “I’m not going to go back and forth with you about that,” and walked away. That’s when it really sank in that my health — and because I am older, in the god-forbid absolute worst case scenario, my life — could now potentially be at risk. Even if the officer feels fine, she could be pre-symptomatic. And, the CDC estimates that up to 25 percent of infected people are asymptomatic, and she could be a “silent spreader,” which a study published by the National Academy of Sciences said could be responsible for about half the cases of COVID-19. The reverse is also true. If I had the virus, the officer might now be infected and give it to other members of the public she interacts with and to her fellow officers and family as well. I was first told that the officer’s action was inappropriate, and they had been directed to wear masks in the future. But later I learned that officers were not required to wear masks because the guidelines issued by Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and the Centers for Disease Control did not necessitate it. Fortunately, I did not get the virus. And, not long after my scary experience, Brown issued an order requiring people to wear masks outdoors when they cannot social distance. The order applies to the police as well, so I hope they will not put the public at risk again during traffic stops again. However, the practice should apply to all police interactions with the public, including protests, where officers have been seen not wearing masks. But this does not change the reality that the officers I interacted with were concerned only about their own protocols and needs and failed to consider how they might harm me. And, because they held a position of authority, they did not feel the need to justify their behavior. And I am white. I wonder if the officers would have responded any differently if a person of color had asked them to back away and social distance, and why they were not wearing masks. My experience highlights, once again, how self-interested indifference to the harmful impacts of one’s actions on others dominates our society. It’s not just the police. This is apparent in the people who proclaim that wearing masks impinges on their freedom and push back against public health, elected officials and businesses that require it. The pattern is also evident in the oil and gas industry that, to protect its investments and profits, puts all of humanity at risk by refusing to slash emissions. The Canadian-based Pembina company, for example, is pushing hard to build a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Coos Bay and construct a 229-mile gas pipeline to transport the fuel there. Not only would the pipeline violate the property rights of the many landowners who oppose it, the project would also become the largest single source of greenhouse gases in Oregon. Reckless self-interest rules supreme in many other sectors of society as well. Many people today seem stuck in the mindset that no matter what the impact, pursuing one’s self-interest is the only way things can be. The fears generated by the Pandemic have strengthened this belief. Ample research and experience, however, have proven this view wrong — and destructive. Mindsets can often change just by being aware of them and their effect on others, experimenting with different responses. Individuals and organizations throughout Eugene might consider taking time now to surface and explore their beliefs about self-interest. We are all likely to end up safer and healthier.

What is clear is that the reaction from adversary and ally alike may make it more difficult for the U.S. to diplomatically reengage with Iran and return to the multinational pact that was negotiated during the Obama administration.President Donald Trump reneged and withdrew America from the deal in 2018 and subsequently leveled severe sanctions on Iran for its malign regional activities. The accord was also opposed by Iran’s Middle East adversaries. That includes Saudi Arabia, which is part of a broader regional split between majority Sunni, Arab nations and Persian, Shiite Iran.Iran accused Israel of being behind the slaying, which seems certain to embolden Iranian hard-liners. They already were deeply skeptical, if not outright opposed, to the deal with the U.S. and other world powers that was intended to curb Iran’s potential nuclear weapons program.By nearly every account, including the Trump administration’s, Iran lived up to the nuclear compliance portion of the deal during the time that the U.S. was still party to it. But now, it is not. And the theocracy has also continued its destabilizing and deadly support of proxies in countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.Iran’s extremists may be emboldened not just by the recent events but by the run-up to the country’s June’s presidential election. “Iranian politics now is completely about the upcoming elections, and no one wants to look weak,” Patrick Clawson, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy, told an editorial writer.The ostensibly more moderate Iranian factions may try to wait until Biden is president in order to press for a U.S. return to the deal. But hard-liners may move sooner in advocating an attack to avenge Fakhrizadeh’s killing. If so, it could create an escalatory spiral just as the U.S. is speeding its withdrawal of forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and as the more rhetorically bellicose Trump administration transitions to an incoming Biden administration that has designs on diplomacy — an already fraught process that will be much more challenging that when the original deal was inked in 2015.“It’s going to be complicated and difficult negotiations; it’s not going to be, ‘We’re back,’” Clawson said.Ultimately, the goal is to stop Iran from having the capacity to develop a nuclear arsenal. And while the assassination of a scientist will have Iranians, in Clawson’s words, “tied up in counterintelligence knots,” it doesn’t totally void Iran’s institutional knowledge of nuclear proliferation processes.Multilateral diplomacy was and remains the best way to stop Iran from developing a weapon and triggering a dangerous regional proliferation race. Biden is right to want to work with world powers to do this. But given Iranian intransigence, as well as the significant shifts in Mideast politics since Biden left office in 2017, it won’t be easy.— Star Tribune (Minneapolis The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

suffolknewsherald_2020_237,"Published 5:04 pm Friday, September 4, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieI learned a new word at midnight. I was watching the most recent live broadcast of the school board meeting of Suffolk Public Schools when my vocabulary was improved.Although many, many, many words were recorded that evening during long presentations and questioning exchanges, my exhausted ears perked up at the mention of this fresh neologism that tickled me at first hearing. It happened when Rev. Henry Diggs stood at the podium and said, “How did Suffolk get this blue-chipper?” He was referring to Suffolk Public Schools Superintendent Dr. John B. Gordon III. Diggs, president of the Suffolk Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance honored Dr. Gordon, our “blue-chipper,” with words of accolades and approval in a public declaration that our public school system is headed by the best of the best in school administration.One reason I favor the elderly is for the charisma and character in their vocabulary. Webster’s Dictionary may teach us the proper pronunciations of the English words in biblical proportion. It is the fountain of phrases from the lips of our senior community that confirm that we have not mastered the art of expression unless we know terms like “blue-chipper” and use them appropriately.If you were ignorant of this term as I was, you immediately grabbed the nearest mobile device to learn whether Rev. Diggs just complimented our superintendent or told him that he had a chip on his shoulder. A quick search confirmed that it was the former. The “blue-chipper” informal name has its origins in relation to the poker game. The blue chip is the highest value when you are gambling. Yet, the term “blue-chipper” is most used in relation to sports recruiting and athletic talent evaluation. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, Rev. Diggs gave a nod to Dr. Gordon’s coaching of championship basketball teams. A blue-chipper athletic coach knows something about cultivating elite prospects.Seeing as the school board meeting was about the pending instructional plan for the fall’s return to school, I find it appropriate that the ‘blue-chipper” statement stood out to me amid all the other discussion. Not to take anything from Dr. Gordon, but the real blue-chip here is the value of our children’s education. We do regard it as “highly valued,” and we can’t afford to gamble with it.I learned a new word at midnight because I intentionally sat until the end of the meeting watching, even after the rest of my family left me on the sofa sitting alone watching the YouTube live stream from our Roku TV. It was important for me to hear the news and understand what decision was being made and why. I believe our schools are chock-full of talents in our teachers, our administrators, our coaching staff, our support staff and especially our students. In athletic recruitment, it takes work to transform talent and produce winning outcomes. It’s going to take that same transformation in this blue-chipper to win in the 2020-2021 school year.

It’s safe to say that 2020 was nothing like anyone expected it would be when they rang in the new year last January.Unfortunately, the pandemic is still with us, and health experts are calling on everybody to stay home and celebrate New Year’s Eve with the people you live with to help avoid the spread of the virus. Indeed, Gov. Ralph Northam’s midnight to 5 a.m. curfew is still in effect, so even those who do go out technically should be home by midnight.Recognizing there may be a few people who flout both the health recommendation and the curfew, however, we feel it important to note that another danger lurks for those who will be on the roads: drunken drivers.It’s no myth — New Year’s Eve and the early-morning hours of New Year’s Day are some of the most dangerous times to be on the roads all year long.

philinquirer_2020_55,"Progressive, grassroots movements, fueled by nothing but the collective faith and desires to restore America’s true promise, sprung up across the nation.Prior to starting residency, I traveled across Germany and Poland with a group of medical students and seminarians as a part of a two-week long fellowship to study the history of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.As we walked the streets of Berlin and alongside the railroad tracks of Auschwitz, a carousel of horrific images became indelibly imprinted in my mind. As civilized people, how could we have allowed such atrocities to have occurred?More than any historical fact, I returned home with a humble lesson— that no individual or society is inherently immune to some of our baser instincts.» READ MORE:Holocaust survivor Anneliese Nossbaum returned to Auschwitz for a final reckoning. It was the last journey of her life.At age ten, I immigrated to the United States from South Korea, a country that held invasions, annexations, civil war, and military coups in recent memory. Without knowing too much about it, I immediately developed a strong faith in the system of American democracy. As a young child who had just left his friends and his home behind, that system provided feelings of safety and stability, filtered through the lens of my untested yet unshakable optimism.Growing up, I quickly realized that my initial faith was more of an inchoate idealism. Like any nation, America’s story was more muddled than what I’d read in textbooks. I witnessed—and to a lesser degree experienced—discrimination and racism. I treated patients whose suffering stemmed more from socioeconomic inequities than from any physical or psychological disease. Upon closer examination, the American reality contained many inconsistencies and hypocrisies when compared to her founding and still often touted ideals. I began to deeply question my faith in the American system. That is, until recently.The last four years have cemented my view of America as an undeniably great nation. America became “great again” in my eyes, and I will tell you why.BeforeAdolf Hitler became chancellorin 1933, his party jumped in less than a decade from winning 3% of the vote to 33%—still no majority. However, beguiled by the promises of a superior nation and enabled by a bystander majority, his supporters quickly cemented the Nazi regime’s fascist dictatorship. Institutions such as the press, as well as the healthcare and judicial systems, were either suppressed or readily acquiesced to the party agenda. Baser instincts prevailed, and the rest is history, as we all know too well.The current right-wing populist movement is a global phenomenon. From Britain and Brazil to Poland and Germany, many countries saw adramatic risein such groups’ influence fed by swelling economic, social, and political grievances, alongside racial and other prejudice. American democracy has been one of the test subjects.For the last four years, I watched aghast as the Trump administration blatantly attacked some of America’s most fundamental, nonpartisan institutions such as intelligence agencies and the media, while giving control of the judiciary as well as other essential pillars of government to his sycophants. He threatened to deploy the military against protestors and undermined the integrity of the election before it even began. At some moments, watching his administration tread theroad to tyrannyconjured images of my time in Germany and Poland, leading me to acknowledge with a sense of defeat: “Ah, this is how it happened.”However, giving up at that point would have been a failure to acknowledge how President Trump has been making America great again.Progressive, grassroots movements, fueled by nothing but the collective faith and desires to restore America’s true promise, sprung up across the nation. Millions have rallied to defend democracy, acrossages,genders,ethnicities, sexual orientations, andsociopolitical leanings. Without President Trump, these movements would not have been as, shall we say,tremendous.“I understand why my parents made so many sacrifices so that my brother and I could pursue our education and one day raise our families here.”Institutions like the courts and press, as well as members of the medical, legal, educational, and scientific professions, checked and balanced the administration’s disregard for many crucial issues such as the Coronavirus pandemic—refusing to heed the president’s claim it was going away—and election procedures, rejecting the administration’s false claims of fraud. Without President Trump, these breakthroughs surely would not have been asradical.With many of our global allies as well as other right-wing populists watching, the American people elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next president and vice-president. Without President Trump, I wonder if we would have seen the winner receive the largest number of votes ever in the history of America. “Sad!” perhaps — but true.A part of me still harbors gnawing anxiety anduncertaintyinthe aftermathof the election, and the damage Trump has wrought. But for the first time since I immigrated to America, I have renewed faith in this democracy and why it is worth fighting for. I understand why my parents made so many sacrifices so that my brother and I could pursue our education and one day raise our families here.» READ MORE:America is over: Let’s just split into different countries | OpinionYes, Trump’s tenure has exposed some of this country’s flaws and vulnerabilities that we must continue to improve. Yet simultaneously, its strength was most evident in being able to withstand the Trump presidency. Timothy Snyder, who studies autocratic regimes at Yale, recently said Trump’s predicament is that he hasn’t been able toruin our system enough. In other nations less deeply rooted in democratic values, he may have managed to.In the end, I have to give the president credit for being right about one thing. He did make America great again, just not in the ways that he envisioned. The country is becoming great, not because of him, but in overcoming him.Jason J.

minnpost_2020_223,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Two months out from the election is an appropriate time to reflect on what Donald Trump has done for American workers. As another American president once asked, “Are you better off today than you were four years ago”Here’s how I would answer that question.Four years ago,89.7% of Americans had health insurance. By 2019, that number haddropped to 86.3%; then 5.4 million more Americanslost their health insurance in the middle of a pandemic. There were also a half million health care workerson layoff at the end of August, and that’s also happening in the middle of a pandemic.Four million hospitality workers haven’t seen a paycheck since March while retail sales jobs arestill down by 600,000.Trump hails his trade war with China and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement as his great successes in defending American manufacturing workers, but what has he actually accomplished On Aug. 31, the last employees of the Melt Shop and Rolling Mill at Gerdau Ameristeel in St. Paul were permanently laid off. I started my career in the United Steelworkers there 45 years ago. Just last year, Vice President Mike Pence bragged at that mill about how the “new NAFTA”“will finally allow American workers to compete and win on a global stage as never before.”Employment in manufacturing at the end of August wasstill down over 700,000 jobs. In fact,there are now 200,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in Americathan when President Barack Obama left office. In his eight years, Obama put more than 12 million Americans back to work, inheriting a labor force of 139 million and leaving with 151 million. At the end of August 2020, Trump shrank the workforce he inherited from Obama by 10 million, to 141 million.Closer to home, the Trump tariff theatrics with China had nothing to do with the resurgence of the U.S. steel and iron ore industries in 2017-18, which wasdirectly linked to the nine product-targeted tariffs levied by the Obama administrationduring the previous five years. These smartly designed but not well-publicized enforcement moves laid the basis for a resurgence in steel prices, particularly for the high-end products that need to be made with iron ore instead of scrap steel.When the industry, federal and state regulators, and the United Autoworkers stood together to announce the first change in fuel efficiency in the industry in over 30 years, capital investments poured in, innovation accelerated, and new technologies like lightweight, high strength steel reinvigorated supply chains and increased demand for Minnesota’s iron ore. Well-run companies succeed when government, labor, and private capital are all aligned.Today, the global steel industry is in crisis because of massive overcapacity. In 2016 world steelmaking capacity was663 million metric tons greater than demandor almost 30%. By comparison, the U.S. only produces 80-85 million metric tons of steel in the U.S. As a result, global prices have collapsed.We went through this same phenomenon in 1998-2000 with over 300 million tons of overcapacity in the world, three times what the U.S. could produce. Forty-eight American steel companies went into bankruptcy — including LTV Steel Mining, which had 2,000 employees and three times that many retirees on the Iron Range. I remember standing in the Hoyt Lakes hockey arena with Sen. Paul Wellstone, meeting with those steelworkers, planning our strategy to protect America’s steel industry and the pensions and health care of its retirees.But that strategy was based on a clear-eyed vision of how America needed to engage with the world and solve the problem of oversupply before it destroyed the industry in multiple countries, including our own. Wellstone fought for that principle under Republican President George Bush and eventually multiple, product-targeted tariffs were implemented by that administration, providing the industry with the breathing space it needed to reorganize. As a result, only two of those companies, with blast furnaces — Acme and Geneva Steel — went out of business.What is worrisome about the Trump administration’s embrace of thoughtless chaos is that no rational, sensible business can plan and execute without a clear sense of the future. Already, we’ve seen U.S. Steel announce the permanent closure of its Great Lakes Division blast furnaces in Detroit. This is extremely dangerous for the Iron Range. Blast furnaces are the only customer for taconite pellets. Each one that closes has a long-lasting ripple effect, not only in its own community but all through the supply chain, ending in communities like Keewatin, Minnesota.So, this September, less than two months from a presidential election, it’s important to take stock of the qualities of leadership that matter. One of Obama’s weaknesses was his failure to articulate, publicly and clearly, his strategy on trade and to take credit for his successes. Trump has no strategy to deal with the global steel oversupply. Since he’s alienated America’s closest allies, no one will work with him on this problem.Workers have never profited in this country by simply being pawns in the game. That’s how you get stiffed. You get yourself organized, you pick leaders who will represent you and will tell the truth. To this date, I’ve never seen workers benefit from someone, like Donald Trump, who doesn’t know how. Just ask the workers at Gerdau Steel in St. Paul.David Foster is a retired United Steelworkers director, District #11, and former Obama administration senior adviser to the secretary of energy."
suffolknewsherald_2020_89,"Published 11:11 pm Friday, June 12, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonI was cutting into a tomato and surprised to find in its “heart” tiny seeds opening up, green tips showing. I lifted them out and planted them. Those eight seeds are already about 6 inches tall. Will they produce fruit, or are they hybrids? Hybrids may not respond in the same way.In Matthew 13, Jesus talked about seed sowing and likened it to seed being sown in the lives and hearts of people. The farmers of Jesus’ day expected fruit. What can we expect when we sow God’s word in our minds and hearts?Some of the last events of Jesus’ life are recorded In Mark 14. It is there I found the little word “abba” in verse 36. Thoughts began germinating in my mind. I had heard the word “abba” many times during the almost 18 years I spent in Pakistan. It is the name a child called his father. This “seed” word had remained dormant, unplanted, until I read again “Abba, Father.” It is possibly Jesus’ last prayer before He suffered the agony of the cross. He did not get the answer for which He hoped. He had to wake his sleeping disciples and leave Gethsemane to keep the Genesis 3:15 appointment made by His Father.Mark, the youngest disciple, was not there when Jesus was praying that night. He was old enough to listen in on the conversations of the other disciples but still young enough to remember this word: abba. It expresses tenderness and ownership. Jesus would have used it when He was a child, but now Abba, Father had new meaning. Mark is the only writer to record these words. He knew about this human moment and thought it important enough for others to overhear Jesus’ plea to His Father. Jesus was hurting physically and emotionally, asking for parental comfort no human could give. Mark was recognizing the special relationship Jesus had with the Father.“Father, Father” was Jesus’ desperate heart cry. I can almost hear His wish, reminiscent of what we hear today — “We will get through this” — but His Father could not grant that assurance. It is a mystery so deep only God can plant this seed of understanding in our hearts. When we allow that, the seed grows into a relationship, a “new birth” with the Eternal God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is then we can address Him as abba, Father. We humans needed what God was allowing, the human form of Jesus as the only treatment to halt the pandemic and curse of sin.Today’s viral pandemic has produced a worldwide condition unlike any other. The Bible reminds us God offers comfort because He wants us to know His love. Psalm 119:50 says God makes us alive with hope; Isaiah 61 is a promise for all that mourn.Read in John’s Gospel God’s plan from the beginning of creation, then read Jesus’ promise for comfort (John 14:16. In 2 Corinthians 1, Paul told the Corinthians to comfort others with the hope they had. Jesus taught His disciples to pray “Our Father Who art in Heaven…” If we are His children, it is our privilege to call Him Abba, Father.Let that seed grow in our hearts like the tomato seeds are growing. It will bring hope in the days ahead.Myrtle V. Thompson, 92, is a retired missionary, writer, educator and Bible teacher.

minnpost_2020_82,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesota has a proud history of holding bad corporate actors accountable — from tobacco companies to opioid manufacturers — when they knowingly conceal damaging information about their products from regulators and the public. This is particularly true when that secrecy results in harm to public health, private property, and public resources.In late June, Attorney General Keith Ellison acted in Minnesota’s tradition of guarding the public interest when he filed a consumer protection lawsuit against three of the nation’s largest fossil fuel entities — ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, and the American Petroleum Institute (API . In the lawsuit, he seeks to recover civil penalties and restitution for the harm to Minnesotans caused by these companies’ decades-long efforts to intentionally mislead the public about the relationship between fossil fuels, the climate crisis, and the resulting harm to public health, agriculture, infrastructure, and the environment.The recent disclosure of thousands of internal corporate documents makes clear that ExxonMobil, Koch, API, and other large oil and gas companies have known for decades that the greenhouse gas emissions from their products would have what one internal Exxon document described as a “potentially catastrophic” impact on the climate. But rather than risk their profits, fossil fuel companies followed the playbook first created by the tobacco industry and intentionally deceived consumers, regulators, media, policymakers, and the general public about climate science.Exxon, the world’s largest oil company, Koch Industries, the largest oil refiner in Minnesota, and API, the largest oil and gas trade association, worked tirelessly to fund and support misleading ads, high-paid lobbyists, think tanks, industry-funded scientists, and more in order to confuse the public and block federal attempts to regulate emissions from the fossil fuels that made their fortune. There is also evidence that these companies even encouraged a public “addiction” to oil and created hostility toward alternative, cleaner fuels, reminiscent of the tobacco companies’ efforts to increase individuals’ nicotine intake despite their ability to lower nicotine content.As Minnesota and the nation work to confront the racism ingrained in our society and public policies, we must also recognize that the impacts of climate change often fall hardest on Black and Indigenous communities.Climate change has also proven very expensive. Minnesotans have already spent hundreds of millions of dollars adapting to the changing climate to make our state more resilient. Many more hundreds of millions of dollars will need to be spent to address the effects of climate change, including hardening our highways, bridges, and other infrastructure; protecting our lakes, rivers, and streams; and ensuring the viability of our state’s agricultural economy.Thankfully, Minnesota has some of the strongest consumer protection laws in the country, and few situations are better suited to them than the actions of Exxon, Koch, and API. For instance, the Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act aims to hold accountable “any fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, misleading statement or deceptive practice, with the intent that others rely thereon in connection with the sale of any merchandise.” These companies’ own internal documents make clear that they made false and misleading statements in connection with the sale of fossil fuels in violation of Minnesota law. Other state consumer protection laws punish similar actions.Minnesota’s historic lawsuit against Philip Morris in the 1990s relied on many of these same consumer protection laws. The case helped expose the tobacco companies’ decades-long conspiracy to mislead the public about the harm their product caused and resulted in a $6.6 billion settlement for the people of Minnesota.If history and the law are any guide, Attorney General Ellison is once again putting Minnesota on the right side of history by standing up on our behalf against powerful corporations whose actions have caused and will continue to cause harm to Minnesota citizens.Alexandra B.

What are the odds that the special recognition weeks for two of our nation’s most dedicated and passionate public servant careers comes in the same week?At any rate, yes, this week was Teacher Appreciation Week. For many of us, our first inspiration besides our parents is a teacher. And although most students can’t see their teachers in person right now, their teachers are so dedicated that they are still teaching remotely, redoing lesson plans to accommodate the virtual schooling, and even making plans for the coming year.

And they’re doing it all with the joy that comes with knowing they are helping children learn even in the midst of extraordinary times.More than a few parents have learned while crisis schooling in the last couple of months just how much teachers are worth, if they didn’t already recognize it.For all the teachers out there — from the ones who teach preschoolers to the ones who teach adult learners, from the ones who teach classrooms and subjects to the ones who teach computers, music, physical education, special education, speech therapy and so many others — thank you for being an inspiration to those in your charge.

minnpost_2020_9,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .One factor that predicts whether a genocide will occur is whether it already happened in a place once, or if the same perpetrators carried out a genocide somewhere else and then used their playbook in a second place.For example, Germany’s Second Reich exterminated the Indigenous Herero and Nama people in 1904 in the African country now known as Namibia. The techniques, the perpetrators, and the motivations were refined, updated, and used a few decades later in the Holocaust. Same perpetrators, different location.The United States carried out a genocide against the American Indians and used many similar techniques of enslavement and brutality against Blacks. Same perpetrators, same location.China is another example: first a genocide against the people of Tibet, then against the Uighurs.Tibet was autonomous until China occupied the region in 1951.Beginning in 1959 and continuing through to today, the Communist Chinese government has perpetrated a genocide against the Buddhist people of Tibet in the Tibetan Autonomous Region north of the Himalaya Mountains in China.The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ , ahuman rightsorganizationcomposed of 60 eminent lawyers and jurists, has investigated the situation in Tibet. ICJ has documented, in great detail, China’s effort to gain total control of Tibet.These practices have included massive use of forced labor resulting in the deaths of thousands of Tibetans; forced sterilization of the women; destruction of agricultural lands and irrigation systems creating widespread famine; destruction of trade and commerce, devastating the livelihoods of thousands of Tibetans; systematic religious persecution; forced indoctrination into Communist ideology; large-scale aerial bombing and massacres; removal and deportation of males between the ages of 15 and 60 to prevent protests; confiscation of property from monasteries, private individuals, and former Tibetan officials; imprisonment, deportation, and murder of thousands of people in the resistance movement; transfer of Han majority people into the region; extrajudicial and arbitrary executions; intensive re-education; and widespread torture.ICJ Secretary General Jean-Flavien Lalive wrote in July 1959, when the genocidal actions began, “The danger in such cases as that of Tibet is of a feeling of impotence and powerlessness overcoming people in the face of afait accompli. What happened in Tibet yesterday may happen in our own countries tomorrow.”What happened in Tibet continues today and, since 2014, it is also happening in Xinjiang Autonomous Region in western China against the Uighurs, a Turkic Muslim minority, in conditions that human rights experts have labeled both physical and cultural genocide.The reasons are the same in both cases: China wants to control the two regions.About 94% of the Chinese population is ethnically Han. Ethnic minorities such as the Tibetans and the Uighurs, although very small in numbers, present a potential threat to the homogeneous Chinese national identity and a perceived danger of provocation and dissension, especially given their respective border locations. The Tibetans and the Uighurs have, indeed, attempted to reclaim their original autonomy from China’s long and heavy arm, and China’s response has been massive, military, and violent.In addition, both the Tibetans and the Uighurs are concentrated in geographical regions that the Chinese government wants.In 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched a global development project known as the “Belt and Road initiative” (BRI . The BRI will expand China’s economic and political influence on a global scale.China is developing pipelines, highways, railways, whole port cities, and faster border crossings in a network of interconnectivity, with China at the hub of six economic corridors. The corridors expand China’s economic and geopolitical influence outward and they increase the flow of raw materials and resources inward, back to China. The BRI reaches throughout Asia to Europe, Australia, to many countries in Africa, with plans to reach the Americas as well.China wants control of Xinjiang for another reason as well.Xinjiang is expected to produce 35 million tons of crude oil by the end of 2020. Xinjiang also has the country’s largest coal reserves — an estimated 40 percent of China’s national total, and the country’s largest natural gas reserves. And the Uighurs are sitting on it.The story in Tibet is a direct parallel to the Uighur story in Xinjiang.The “Himalayan Economic Rim” refers to BRI networks in Tibet that are directed toward the three neighboring countries of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. Further connections will run from Tibet to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor.And the Tibetans are in the way of Chinese development and control in Tibet just like the Uighurs are in the way in Xinjiang. Tibet has natural resources that China needs; over 30 percent of the country’s hydro-electric power comes from Tibet. Additionally, China is the world’s largest producer of copper, and fully a sixth of it is in Tibet.Two genocides, same playbook.China, today’s behemoth on the planet, appears to have near-complete impunity for its egregious human rights violations.An effort in Spain’s national courts to use universal jurisdiction to prosecute China’s leaders for Tibet’s genocide ground to a halt in 2014. Suddenly Spanish law changed, making it impossible for the case to go forward. Did China lean on Spain A 2015 legal analysis suggests that Spain did, indeed, succumb torealpolitik’s pressures exerted by China and withdrew the case.Today, China wields great weight at the United Nations because of its significant economic investment in countries around the world and those countries’ corresponding reluctance to criticize the big benefactor. China’s hegemony successfully keeps UN and other watchdogs from monitoring the genocide of the Uighurs.There is a new effort to address China’s human rights violations in Tibet is through a proposed investigation at the International Criminal Court. Because China is not a party to the court, this would require some jurisdictional maneuvering, and while it is not impossible, it is perhaps unlikely.Genocide.

minnpost_2020_94,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Both of these initiatives represent the very same kind of failed solution for reform that members of the affected communities were saying during the protests have failed to bring about “real change” in the past. Politicians coming in from outside their communities “listening to folks,” making promises to deliver overpowering legislation to fix problemsforthem, from the outside in and the top down, haven’t solved the problems in the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD in the past. So why do we keep doing the same things over and over again that haven’t worked in the past, and still expect that people in the affected communities should have reason to believe that real change will happenProblems in organizations like the MPD unfold from the bottom up and the inside out. Unfortunately, just about every action taken or proposed to fix the MPD has been an effort to monster truck crush the MPD with legislation, without any regard at all for the well-being of the “good cops” who reside there — without any protective and supportive regard at all for the people within the department that everyone in search of real change need to fix the MPD from the bottom up and the inside out.These are the kinds of solutions that everyone should be creating to solve the problems in the MPD, from the bottom up and the inside out:1 Consider if you will, that Bob Kroll doesn’t get to choose the kind or number of officers he represents. He can’t bring “bad officers” on to the force to join a band of bad actors who are already there, because he doesn’t have the power to hire anyone. Nor does he have the power to discipline or fire “bad officers.” Nor does he have the power to reward “bad officers” with promotions and awards. If the perception that the MPD is overloaded with “bad officers” is true, then the responsibility for that condition falls directly on management.Solution:The focus of attention by outside investigative authorities, authorities who have direct knowledge and experience in law enforcement and knowledge about best practices, (not members of the community who have never had to actually do the things that police officers have to do , should focus directly on management.2 It is inconceivable that the political antics of Kroll would ever be tolerated in the federal sector. The Hatch Act strongly limits the political activities of all federal employees, including union representatives. In addition, federal unions are required to separate union business from political advocacy. Even the appearance of wrongdoing in the federal sector isn’t tolerated.Solution:If the feds can enact legislation and establish policy to accomplish these objectives, so can the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, and the Minnesota Legislature.3 If in fact the MPD is overloaded with “bad cops,” then don’t the “good cops” in the MPD have an obligation to report the misconduct of “bad cops” to “good management,” if it exists Don’t they have an obligation to do this, just as the three officers who stood by in the George Floyd incident had a duty to interveneTrue it is that “bad cops” almost universally agree that loyalty to each other is more important than honesty and integrity and doing the right thing. So do criminals in prisons and in gangs on the street, who label whistleblowers as “snitches.”“Good cops” working for good management who have good whistleblower protection systems for reporting waste, fraud, abuse, and poor management, don’t within reason operate as if loyalty is more important than honesty, integrity, and doing the right thing.This isn’t fairytale talk. I am a 70-year-old retired federal law enforcement officer. Yes, federal law enforcement officers do report the serious wrongdoing of coworkers — wrongdoing that results in disciplinary actions including terminations of employment — and they are supported by their coworkers for doing so. Yes, law enforcement cultures like this really do exist.Solution:If a culture of law enforcement as I suggest exists on the federal level and in other police departments, then it can be created at the local level by good managers and good officers who are committed to doing the right thing, in the public interest, for the public good. Create a special division in the Office of the Hennepin County Attorney, where all whistleblower complaints from the City of Minneapolis and Hennepin County would be filed. It should become the duty of the county attorney to investigate all claims, protect whistleblowers from all reprisals, determine if sanctions should be administrative or criminal, and to sanction whistleblowers who knowingly file fraudulent claims. It should be a place where whistleblowers can go to solve problems, without violating any security concerns by going public.4 In a crisis, officers do what they are trained to do. I would be shocked to discover that there is any law enforcement agency in the country that teaches line officers when and how to rightfully usurp authority, to include refusing to follow the orders of management. (Been there! Done that! Too many times! Solution:Create both clear and gray area role-play scenarios that show officers when and how to rightfully refuse orders. Then, put line officers through these role-play scenarios, so that in real life when something like the George Floyd incident occurs, the odds that another officer on the scene will actually intervene will go way up.If the solution above is implemented, it will decrease the odds that a bad manager will give an intentionally bad order to a line officer, for fear of defiance and subsequent reporting. It will create a demand for ranking officers on the scene to be respectfully cognizant of his or her team members’ concerns and ideas, such that when one officer raises a concern (like, maybe we should turn him on his side , everyone will take that concern seriously.If …ifthe MPD is encumbered with “bad officers,” “bad management,” and a bad union president, and, if “we the people” need good officer whistleblowers to come forward to help us deal with bad actors within the MPD, then the worst possible thing that anyone can do is to weaken in any way the worker protections provided by the police union and third-party binding arbitration. (The language of qualified immunity, not binding arbitration, is the problem . I have lived through the absence of binding arbitration in law enforcement, and I am here to tell you that only poor and unethical managers stand to gain from it. One of the finest officers I have ever known died because binding arbitration wasn’t available.Put yourself in the place of a good MPD police officer who feels obligated to blow the whistle. Whom would you trust to have your back “We the people” in the affected communities, given their actions over the past few weeks Fellow officers who believe that loyalty is more important than honesty Not a chance! The mayor and police management who have been extremely short on overt public support for the good officers in the department and quick to throw under the bus the union that protects your due process rights Bob Kroll A citizen review board I guarantee you that across the country right now, good cops are having kitchen table conversations with spouses about alternatives to continued employment as a police officer.Somehow, people seem to think that government managers are the only people who are looking out for the interests of the public, and that members of labor and labor unions are only looking out for their own diametrically opposed self-serving interests. (Teacher unions have historically been thrown under the bus in the same dark light. In real life, nothing could be further from the truth.Better to light just one little candle than it is to curse the darkness. These are the kinds of solutions that everyone should be creating to solve the problems in the MPD, from the bottom up and the inside out. Come on Minneapolis! Show us what you’ve got!John A. Mattsen of New Brighton is a retired federal law enforcement officer who worked in a federal prison for 28 years and was on the riot squad for 20 years. He was a union official in various capacities for 25 years; he served in the Minnesota Air National Guard for six years."

He answered my questions with only a “yes” or a “no,” and those answers resembled sounds more than actual words. His girlfriend sat next to me in the front passenger seat, staring out the window, refusing to even look in my direction. Her arms were crossed so tightly that I wondered how blood continued to circulate in her arms.I had informed the 15-year-old and 13-year-old that they would no longer be allowed to sit next to each other in my car. Their hands had wandered onto each other one too many times, and they refused to stay to themselves despite countless warnings. They were now pouting, and their silence was aimed at letting me know exactly how they felt about my decision.I could not help but think of the past. I remembered Jim yelling, “Hold my hand, hold my hand,” as a crowd entered our walking trail. I recalled the time Abagail wrapped her arms around me when the boom of fireworks scared her, gripping tighter the louder they became.I sighed. The voices that once said, “Hold my hand,” and “Stay close,” now asserted, “We’re not kids anymore” and “You just don’t understand.” At that moment, I really missed the time when they were younger. However, I cannot stop time, and it would be wrong of me to do so, even if I could.Our job as teachers, parents and mentors is to provide them with the best opportunities in life and to help them grow into mature, responsible adults. This involves working with them in all stages of their lives, including the teenage years. It’s OK to reminisce of years gone by and miss the things you enjoyed when they were younger, but we cannot get stuck in a time that is no longer here. We cannot live in the past. They need us in the present.Working with children in each stage of their lives means accepting the challenges that come in each of those stages. The teen years can be rough, but that is no excuse to neglect our job as teachers, mentors and parents. The teen years are also difficult for the kids going through them as hormones rage and their minds and bodies change rapidly. Teens will rarely admit it, they may not know it, and they may not even like it, but they need us in their lives. They may not be little any longer, but they still need teaching, guidance and parenting.Parents, mentors and teachers can be tempted to become nothing more than friends to teenagers. There can be a desire to be the “cool” counselor, teacher or parent, which can cause us to shirk our duties as adults. Our job as teachers, mentors and parents must continue through the teen years, and that means there will be times they do not like our decisions. Teens need responsible adults in their lives who will continue to guide, direct and parent them through these formative years.It won’t always be easy, and it won’t always be fun, but it is always needed.

Seneca BockAs a Black woman, and as part of the African Diaspora, I am firmly standing in solidarity with the call to end the wholesale attempts to exterminate Black people. I exist, live and will die as a Black woman who has endured the repeated assault on my mind, body and spirit.I have been privy to the savage and brutal attacks unleashed on my brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, cousins, friends, church members, children, and otherwise innocent citizens of these here United States. For instance, when I was a young school girl, I experienced devastating trauma when two family friends were beaten, maimed and disabled at the hands of local police. One was a male who suffered severe, life altering injuries from police attack dogs (they literally chewed off his buttocks and upper thigh . The second incident was a female who sustained a life-altering, brutal beating, leaving her with severe brain injury.The last time I had to write such a letter was after the Charlottesville debacle, after which I encountered threatening phone calls that said I need to watch out. On several occasions, I had people following me, and at least twice there were attempts to run me off the road. This is the life of many freedom fighters. We are threatened often. Too often, Black people have had to suffer all sorts of acts of violence, including actual lynching. Historically, we know of the Emmet Till story. A young innocent young Black man was bludgeoned to death because he so-called had the gall to “look at a precious white woman.”Who has the actual moral tenacity to stand up? The young are once again taking up the mantle that older people should have long ago. Well, they are protecting the rights of all of us by protesting under their constitutional rights. The NAACP stands in solidarity with the peaceful protestors. Our patience has been tested repeatedly. City of Suffolk, we are calling for corrective action in the following areas: policing, criminal justice reform, and fair distribution of wealth. We have repeatedly asked the city leaders (with no reasonable course of action on your part : Where is the small-minority owned business commission that we asked for over four years ago? What are we doing to correct and improve the deplorable, inhumane conditions inside that place you refer to as the regional jail? It is not fit for human habitation, let alone a place where real healing can take place. We have plans to put an end to this age-old slaughtering campaign.Again, COVID-19 disproportionately and negatively impacts the Black community. Heartless souls who think it’s OK to incarcerate our brothers and sisters because we can’t figure out to how to help the needy — severely mentally ill, the homeless, the soul-crushed from years of abuse, the retired military and other veterans, the medically disenfranchised, etc.Our branch of NAACP has joined forces with branches all across this country, our state and national leadership team, other civil rights organizations, and the grassroots to develop strategic plans of action, public policy and new laws that aim to protect the vulnerable. Black Lives do Matter, always have, and always will. We will not allow anyone to change the here and now narrative. We fight for all people. But at this critical moment in time, the focus is Black people. How dare anyone try to “flip the script”? Who are we? Bloodthirsty animals?Let us calm ourselves, take a deep breath, and honor one another’s humanity.

philinquirer_2020_14,"Non-medical switching leaves Pa. residents with chronic health conditions at risk.To respond to the coronavirus, our state legislators have made millions of dollars available for relief efforts and issued sweeping mandates to support social distancing, demonstrating their will to take bold action to protect the health of Pennsylvanians.And yet – it remains legal in Pennsylvania for health insurers to alter a patient’s coverage in the middle of the plan year, leaving those who are locked into their policies with nowhere to turn for help during one of the most challenging moments in our nation’s recent history.This dangerous and little-known practice is called non-medical switching, and Pennsylvania lawmakers have not yet acted to address it, despite the fact that it can have serious implications for patients. I know this firsthand, because when my insurer tried to non-medically switch me, I nearly lost access to the only medication that helps me manage my rheumatoid arthritis.» READ MORE:I lost my health insurance when I got laid off during the pandemic. How can I get coverage?That is why I am calling on the state legislature to sendHouse Bill 853, which will end non-medical switching in Pennsylvania and protect patients’ access to their prescriptions, to Governor Wolf’s desk for his signature.More than ten years ago, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA , an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes severe swelling and pain in my joints and also affects my eyes, heart, and lungs. Because of my condition, I had to retire early and give up hobbies I loved, including swimming, biking, and competing in triathlons. Living in constant pain took a toll on my mental and emotional health as well. I have experienced increased anxiety and depression because of what’s happening to my body.It took years of work with my doctor to find a medicine that reduced my pain and allowed me to lead a normal life, and the prescription that my doctor chose is the only thing that limits the pain caused by my RA.My story is not unique. For many patients with a chronic condition, finding a treatment plan that stabilizes their health can require trial and error. RA is the most common form of autoimmune arthritis, affectingmore than 1.3 million Americans, including thousands of our fellow Pennsylvanians.Last year, my insurance company non-medically switched me in a way that blocked access to my prescription. Thankfully, my physician quickly intervened, and I was able to stay on my treatment plan. But others in Pennsylvania with similar chronic health conditions may not be so fortunate.» READ MORE:Q&A: What can I do to limit joint pain from arthritis?Non-medical switching can cause serious health and financial problems. When insurers change their formulary coverage, copay costs can skyrocket without warning, forcing patients to choose between staying on their prescriptions and living within their means. Epilepsy patients who lose access to their medication because of non-medical switching can experience a recurrence of seizures which can threaten their job security and their life. Other patients may have to visit the doctor’s office more frequently, or even the ER.For patients who depend on a medication to keep their health stable, it is frightening to receive a letter that says you have to change your treatment plan or pay more out-of-pocket for your current prescription. It’s even scarier to receive the news that your plan has changed at the pharmacy counter.Like so many Pennsylvanians, I carefully evaluate health plans to pick the one that allows me to afford my treatments. But any insurance company I choose can change its obligation to me on a whim, while I cannot do the same. I live in fear to this day that my benefits could be pulled out from underneath me at any moment, and because of the coronavirus pandemic, I am more afraid than ever of losing coverage for my medication and of unpredictable changes to my budget. It’s upsetting and unethical.House Bill 853 would end this insurance practice once and for all, and it’s time for lawmakers to take it up. This bill is a simple solution to ban non-medical switching that supports Pennsylvanians who rely on certain treatments to manage a chronic health condition – those who are most at risk of the effects of coronavirus.No one should have to worry about their insurance coverage changing at any time – especially people who depend on a prescription to live a normal life, and especially during a global pandemic. If I can’t change my health plan to save money in the middle of the year, insurers shouldn’t be able to either.Tien Sydnor-Campbell is a volunteer patient advocate and member of the Global Healthy Living Foundation’s 50-State Network.

As many as14 officersmoved to leave the Norman, Okla., police force after the City Council voted to defund their department. A majority of officersleft the forcein Knightstown, Ind., includingthe chief, because “there is no support for the department, no town council backbone for us,” one former officer said.These aren’t isolated incidents, but part of a wave that has swept the country following nationwide anti-police protests in recent months. Renewed public hostility to cops appears to have worsened a long decline in their numbers, stretching back to the Great Recession. That’s bad news for both public safety and police-community relations: fewer cops likely means both more crime and more police misconduct.» READ MORE:I was a police chief. Here’s one way I would reform police in Philly and beyond. | OpinionThe attrition is not limited to small towns.A surveyof news stories indicates that across America’s 50 largest cities, at least 23 have seen chiefs or line officers resign, retire, or take disability this year. Nearly 3,700 beat cops have left, a large proportion from the New York Police Department (down7%of its officers but with big drops inChicago,Minneapolis,Milwaukee,Atlanta, and elsewhere, too. The Major Cities Chiefs Associationtoldthe Wall Street Journalthat 18 of its 69 member executives had retired, resigned, or been fired over the past year.Cities are struggling to replace these departing officers. In Colorado Springs, Colo., the department has fallen25% shortof its recruitment goal amid what Chief Vince Niski called “social unrest.” And potential executives are refusing the job, Houston Police Department chief and president of the MCCA Art Acevedo told the Wall Street Journal: “There’s a lot of folks that are hesitant when they see chiefs are getting beat up and getting thrown under the bus by their bosses.”Some of these departures represent normal turnover, like the retirement of Virginia Beach, Va., Chief Jim Cervera,who hitthe city’s mandatory retirement age this year. Others likely represent instances of underperforming chiefs being replaced. But many are clearly casualties of the current moment, like Portland, Ore.’s Jami Resch,forced outbecause her command staff was all white.» READ MORE:Reimagining policing: 14 ways to change a broken system | OpinionIn city after city, departing officers cite a hostile climate, including the rioting that recently left30 officersinjured in Philadelphia. In Seattle, those who left (over 100 this year citedfears for their personal safety and the agenda of the “socialist” City Council as their reason for quitting. In San Francisco,nearly 30 officershave left because of the attitudes of everyone from homeowners to the homeless: “It’s ... nice working at a place where everyone isn’t mad at you,” one former San Francisco Police Department officer, now in Texas, said.It’s plain that the protests, which have seen participants assault officers, set fire to precincts, and abuse cops verbally, have made the job worse. Even if one believes that all these departures are individually good — that the retiring cops were incompetent, say, and the resigning chiefs corrupt — it’s hard to dispute the harmful cumulative effect.The size of a police force and the crime rate are strongly linked. Researchconsistentlyfindsthat increasing the number of officers on the streets cuts crime, withone analysissuggesting that from a cost-benefit perspective, America’s streets are likely underpoliced. When cops get pulled off the beat, crime goes up.One studyof Dallas Police Department data linked a 10% drop in presence to a 7% increase in crime.Fewer cops likely also mean more police misconduct. After all, the remaining officers must work longer and more stressful hours and tend togrow more sympatheticto using force compared with less-stressed colleagues. Research has found that fatigue predicts a rise in public complaints against cops: a 13-hour rather than 10-hour shift significantly boosts their prevalence, while back-to-back shiftsquadruple their odds.These realities are particularly alarming given the current shrinking of police forces, which predates 2020. Data from state and local governments collected by the U.S. Census Bureauindicatefewer police officers per capita in 2019 than at any point since 1994, when the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act surged thousands of officers on to the streets, helping to end the two-decade crime wave.» READ MORE:Reforming police requires action, not commissions | OpinionSince 2008, the number of cops per capita has retreated from the post-crime-wave peak, thanks both to state and local austerity and to growing agitation against policing. That has likely contributed to the “plateauing” of the crime decline, a phenomenon that costs millions of dollars and thousands of lives every year.The mass departures of the past year can only hasten this trend, probably leading to higher crime and greater police misconduct — and, in turn, making police work less appealing to high-quality candidates.Policymakers must take these realities into consideration.

All those words plague my mind as I prepare to teach each day. Educators, you are the true superheroes in the field of education. I want to encourage you today not to lose yourself in the process of this new time of searching and teaching. I know that you are giving your best; I pray that God will begin to open new doors of creativity in connection to your passion. I pray that your houses are covered and protected as you speak into the atmosphere of the houses of the students that you teach. To some, we have become the unseen rainbow, but there are those that see us and acknowledge our colors.Last week, I did not realize that I worked 14 hours preparing lessons, grading assignments, conferencing with students and parents, checking the assignments of my own children, keeping the house in order, finalizing my dissertation; I was at the edge of the mountain not realizing that I was getting ready to fall if I took just one more step. I was so exhausted one night that my husband tried to pick me up to place me in the bed. My body crashed. My mind crashed. My spirit crashed. I felt like an unseen rainbow. I was looking for the same expectations in a new world of change.In the midst of a busy morning, my husband called me to tell me to come outside. When I got outside, he was astounded to tell me about this rainbow that he spotted over our house. However, I was too late; I did not see the rainbow, but I knew that it was there, because I believed him. As he described how this rainbow was perfect, I realized that God protects what we think is unseen or uncovered. I felt a sense of peace that day as I taught my students. Later that day, one of my neighbors sent me a picture of a beautiful rainbow that she captured by our house. She captured what I did not see. It is OK if people do not see your worth. God sees it. I see it. I can feel it.You have not lost the passion that was birthed within you. It may be hard to feel it at times, but it is there just like that rainbow was there that I did not see. I have contemplated a thousand times to just throw in the towel. Then, there’s a message such as, “You make me love English. You teach us more about English. You teach us about life.” I want to encourage you today to go back into your closet and rebuild your creativity. You become that unseen rainbow and create new things: change the game. Encourage the teachers around you by leaving messages in random places. Words can change the atmosphere.I encourage you to eat better, because I forget. Get out there and walk for 10 minutes to clear your mind. Talk to an adult today. Write down a scripture that represents energy and repeat that scripture throughout the day. If you are the only one on that screen, you rock that smile and teach your heart out. As we look at our world and notice the division that is taking place, we must support each other. I had to pour into me. You are more than enough. You will give your enough. You will teach the best lesson. You will tap into new areas of creativity.Spiritually, rainbows symbolize change. After Noah experienced the roughness of the waters of life, he was greeted with a rainbow after leaving the ark. However, it took place after. You will experience the rainbow after. You will experience a new change after. If we only see with our spiritual eyes, then we will never see the bridge that God is creating for us to walk over. We will experience the rainbow.

minnpost_2020_235,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesotans deserve better than the political stare-down that is playing out at the Capitol between Senate Republicans and Governor Tim Walz. They deserve to be informed, trusted and engaged in the discussion over the governor’s use of emergency powers to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and the Republicans’ emphasis on allowing schools and businesses to operate without limits.The importance of all these goals is undeniable. Instead of having a straightforward debate, however, Minnesotans are pushed to the sidelines as spectators while a proxy battle is fought. Instead of engaging in a partisan side-show that threatens the ability of qualified commissioners to serve the public in an unprecedented crisis, the governor and Republicans should engage in a meaningful discussion on when and how the governor’s emergency powers can be terminated.There is much more at stake in this political gamesmanship than just mask-wearing and limits on the size of public gatherings. Many small businesses are on the brink of closing, and some students are losing ground academically and socially. Then there are the health concerns, including the best way to protect the entire community from the virus.And, there are the hidden impacts that get little attention. Not least of these is the housing crisis that has been made worse by the pandemic. A temporary moratorium on evicting vulnerable tenants who have lost their paychecks and can’t make rent payments, one of the executive orders Walz has implemented, is the difference between housing and homelessness for thousands of hard-hit Minnesotans. If the governor’s use of emergency powers is terminated, how are Republicans planning to protect the thousands of Minnesotans who likely would be added to the rolls of the homelessUltimately, these debates are about Minnesotans and the confidence they have that all politicians are working toward common goals – safeguarding the public’s health, restoring the economy and protecting those who are most vulnerable.If policymakers want to build consensus for action, anecdotes need to be replaced by evidence-based measures that every stakeholder can use to track progress against a shared vision of success. The governor, Republican leaders, health experts and economists should seek agreement on measurable, evidence-based criteria to evaluate when the governor’s broad emergency powers can be terminated and day-to-day life – including returning students to classrooms and customers to businesses – can return to normal.First, an effective vaccine is available and affordable and enough Minnesotans are being inoculated to protect the health of the entire state.Second, testing with rapid and accurate results is available and contact tracing — the ability to quickly reach those who may have been in the proximity of an infected person — is implemented.Third, the state shows a consistent downward trend in the infection and hospitalization rates over a period of time epidemiologists determine is meaningful.Fourth, the state’s economy improves, putting people back to work and earning paychecks sufficient to pay rents, mortgages and put food on the table.These criteria need to be refined and tactics created to achieve these goals. They also need to be seen as interdependent. Take the last benchmark, for example. Even while the homeless population has grown during this crisis, there are only around 200 reported cases of COVID-19 statewide among the homeless and, as of this writing, only one death. If the virus spreads among the very highly mobile homeless population it almost certainly will undermine the state’s ability to control its spread in the general population.There are no easy answers to these extraordinary challenges Minnesota and the nation face. Benchmarks that track progress, like the five suggested here, give Minnesotans the confidence that comes from knowing that the sacrifices they are being asked to make are contributing to success. They give elected officials the tools to adjust their policies. They can help determine when schools and businesses can start returning to normal operations or whether more aggressive social distancing is needed. They address when the governor can relax some emergency orders – easing social distancing, for example, as progress is made in controlling the rate of infections – while maintaining other components, including the moratorium on evictions until the economy is generating jobs and income.Time and again, Minnesotans have shown that if actions are evidence-based and transparent, measures are well-defined and there is a shared call to action, they will rise to meet any challenge head on. Policymakers of both parties have the opportunity and the need to ask for the best of Minnesota.Tim Marx is the president and chief executive officerof Catholic Charities of St. Paul and Minneapolis.

philinquirer_2020_43,"The democracy envisioned by our founders—one with universal, tax-supported schooling at its core—hangs in the balance.The future of public education is on the ballot this year.Unfortunately, most voters aren’t aware of this. The pandemic has displaced school funding and teacher pay as critical issues —issues critical enough in 2018 and 2019 to fuel massive protests across the country. Many families are focused solely on the immediate questions of when and how their children will physically return to school. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has drawn schools into his culture war,claiming that young people are being taught to hate America and demanding what he calls “patriotic education.”Behind the crisis and Trump’s distractions, however, is a simple truth: Rather than working to improve public education, his administration has waged a full-frontal assault on it. And four more years will have devastating consequences forthe nearly 90% of American children who attend public schools— children of both Republicans and Democrats.» READ MORE:chool choice and the fight for public education’s soul | EditorialWhen Trump selected Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, many took it as a sign that he wasn’t serious. After all, DeVos seemed to know little about public schools. But that was a product of her extremism. Over the last four years,she has been crystal clear that her primary interest in the public education system lies in dismantling it. For evidence, look no further thanher proposed Education Freedom Scholarships plan, which would redirect $5 billion in taxpayer dollars to private schools.Unmaking public education is a long-standing goal of libertarians and the religious right. Conservative economist Milton Friedman conceived of private school vouchers in 1955, and four decades later was still making the case for “a transition from a government to a market system.As they see it, public education is a tax burden on the wealthy, an obstacle to religious instruction, and a hotbed for unionism. Rather than a public system controlled by democratic values, they’d prefer a private one governed by the free market. If they had their way, schools would operate like a welfare program for the poor while the rich would get the best education money could buy. The result would be entrenched inequality and even more concentrated segregation than now exists.This extreme view has never caught on, largely because public education is a bedrock American institution. Many states created public education systems before the nation even existed. Massachusetts, for instance, was educating children in public schools long before tea was dumped in Boston Harbor. In 1787, the federal government explicitly mandated that the center plot of land in every new town in the territories — land that would become states like Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois — be reserved for schools, and that other plots be used to support those schools. After the Civil War, Congressdoubled down on that commitment, requiring readmitted Confederate states, and all new states, to guarantee access to public education in their constitutions. In each of these foundational periods, leaders positioned public education at the very center of our democratic project.The founders and their successors recognized that public education is essential to citizens ability to govern themselves, not to mention protect themselves from charlatans and demagogues. Public education is the surest guarantee of individual liberty, the founders understood — no less essential than a well-trained army to the survival of the nation. That’s why they recognized that the education of American citizens couldn’t be left to chance.Public education could have evolved in a very different manner, with the wealthy paying to educate their own kids, while the poor relied on charity. Indeed, so-called “pauper schools” existed prior to the advent of universal tax-supported education. But this approach had major flaws — low-quality opportunities, stigma, and financial instability. Horace Mann, the leader of the “common school” movement, understood that public education could only succeed if it was high-quality, if it educated all children together, and if the burden and benefit of taxation were shared by the entire community.» READ MORE:If charter schools help kids of color, why aren’t the Democrats more supportive? | OpinionDemocrats and Republicans have long disagreed about the particulars of education policy. But until the recent past, support for public schools was firmly bipartisan. This was true at the state level, as well as at the federal level. But that has changed in recent years. In states likeArizona,Florida,Indiana, andOhio, Republican lawmakers have embraced controversial school voucher programs over the objection of their own constituents. And at the federal level,Betsy DeVoshas — contrary to what most Republican voters want — advanced a radical effort to dismantle public education.As the election approaches, the Trump campaign is vulnerable on education. While his supporters may agree with some of his positions, they also like their public schools and the role those schools play in their communities —particularly in rural areas. They believe that education should be adequately funded and open to all, and thatteachers should make a decent living. They know that an educated populace has long been the backbone of America’s democracy, as well as its economy. These are American beliefs, red and blue.We are here to sound an alarm to Republicans and Democrats. The future of our nation’s public schools is at stake. And insofar as that is the case, the democracy envisioned by our founders — one with universal, tax-supported schooling at its core — hangs in the balance.Jack Schneider and Jennifer Berkshire are the authors of“A Wolf at the Schoolhouse Door: The Dismantling of Public Education and the Future of School.Derek Black is the author of“Schoolhouse Burning: Public Education and the Assault on American Democracy.”.

philinquirer_2020_34,"Educators have been asked to take on even more roles and responsibilities with little adjustment in support, training, or compensation.The Philadelphia School District announced Tuesday it would halt its plan to start reopening classrooms Nov. 30. The Board of Education approved the plan on July 30, in a vote that had been postponed after an eight-hour board meeting the week before. But tensions between the board and its educators have been building since schools closed suddenly in March. Without better efforts from the board and district, those tensions will continue.Educators have expressed their concerns about reopening school buildings in a plurality-Black school district that has lacked adequate funding for decades. This confluence of race, class, and health exacerbates concerns around who is making decisions about the district’s plan and who will actually suffer the consequences of those decisions. During this pause in reopening, the district must address outstanding safety concerns that have long been ignored by leadership that has notclearly communicatedwith its constituents in the past. It needs to prioritize decision-making informed by the experiences of those who spend the most time in school facilities and classrooms.» READ MORE:Philly schools to remain fully virtual until further noticeThe July 23 meeting, at which more than 150 students, educators, and community members registered to virtually speak, drew a swift and largely unified community response to the reopening plan: The district could not reopen schools safely given theexisting conditions of school facilities(including ventilation systems , thehigh socioeconomic needs of students, and thesignificant personnel needsin hybrid education models, such as more paraprofessional, technical, health, and custodial support to maintain separate cohorts. While no one can deny the limitations of online learning, the district’s (and board’s desire to rush back to classrooms has further eroded the trust of one of its key stakeholders: Philadelphia’s public school educators.At risk here is thelong-term healthof students, educators, caregivers, and their households and communities. Philadelphia’s long legacy of segregation has ensured that the least white, least affluent, and least healthy populations are in close proximity, andthese communities are the majority of the school district’s student population. While children have lower risk of fatal outcomes from COVID-19 complications, more than 75% of allchild deaths have been Black and Latinx.These racially disparate fatalities areconsistent across age groups, suggesting that entire households must grapple with the risks from the decision to send children back into the classroom. For Black and Latinx households, these risks are weighedagainst rising unemployment ratessince the pandemic began.The original — and yet to be adjusted in public — reopening plan was meant to bring students into schools on an alternating schedule, prioritizing elementary students and students with disabilities. One cohort would attend Monday and Wednesday for one week, then Tuesday and Thursday the following week. When not in a school building, they could learn virtually at home, engaging with their in-person and virtual classmates and their educators in the classroom. Classrooms would follow distancing protocols, everyone would wear PPE, and the district would prioritize cleaning and repairing ventilation systems to consistently circulate clean air.» READ MORE:In-person teaching puts my family at risk, but the Philly School District leaves me few options | OpinionAlthough the safety realities of COVID require fewer people in classrooms at once, there was no effort to hire more educators or to restore and remediate unusable classrooms. Somehow, the plan asks educators to teach in multiple classrooms (in-person and virtual , prepare multiple lesson plans, act as a public health monitor, and run interference on any technology issues that could emerge. In essence, the educator was asked to take on even more roles and responsibilities with little adjustment in support, training, or compensation.Philadelphia educators have sacrificed a great deal in the last decade. Between state control, the foreclosure crisis, and the constant disruptions from school closures (both due tofacilityconditions anddistrict decision-making , Philadelphia educators are consistently adjusting to district, state, and federal policies and budget cuts that assume these changes have no impact on the classroom experience. We must bring them into decision-making processes early and often to maximize the limited resources at the district’s disposal, in ways that reflect the realities of our students and communities.Our school leaders must think and act as a community, seeking the greatest long-term outcomes for the largest group — here, our majority nonwhite, non-affluent students, those who educate and support them in facilities, and the households and communities where they live. COVID has also produced an opportunity for new governance structures: bringing together experts in public health, race, education, and transportation to produce policies grounded in local knowledge.

eugeneweekly_2020_6,"We ve got issues. One has to wonder if Americans will care enough about our democracy and freedom to soon rouse themselves with the energy to defend the more than two centuries of heritage that our prior generations have handed over to us. Our future depends on our being up to the task. For almost four years now we have collectively and passively assented to steady and incremental iconoclastic destruction of our democratic principles and institutions by an administration that is openly hostile to our nation’s foundations. From the first day in power, every action taken has had the purpose of subordinating all of the traditional mechanisms of government to the iron fist of authoritarianism under an all-powerful executive branch headed by a de facto dictator. In his first few months, the president vociferously maligned the First Amendment’s freedom of speech protections and explored potential ways to abolish or lessen the Constitutional protections for a free press. He also expressed disdain for the Constitutional framework of co-equal branches of government, declaring the document archaic and obsolete — an obstacle to his agenda. While continuing his campaign against a free press and any Constitutional restraints on his authority, the president next turned his attention to destroying the most basic and cherished civil liberties the people enjoy which are designed to protect them from the excesses of totalitarianism. Thus he embarked on a trend which found him praising a ruthless dictator for employing vigilante death squads to murder suspected drug dealers and users without any process such as hearings or trials, and encouraging our nation’s police officers to use excessive and unlawful force in making arrests of suspects. He attacked members of the judiciary if they ruled against him in litigation. In a wholly unprecedented effort to undermine our jury system, he even placed the foreperson of a jury in peril by criticizing her for presiding over deliberations that culminated in a guilty verdict against one of his friends and political allies. As to the separation of powers doctrine, the president simply ignored it when he transferred funds Congress had appropriated for a specific purpose and allocated those funds to a wholly different project that Congress had refused to fund: the wall. The Senate capitulated, and meekly surrendered one of its foremost responsibilities under the Constitution — funding the government and its programs. While on the subject of appropriations, we must not forget another abdication of the Senate’s checks and balance role. That’s when it acquiesced in Trump’s conditioning of congressionally funded military aid to a foreign government on that government doing him the “personal favor” of announcing a criminal investigation against a domestic political opponent in the forthcoming election. On our southern borders, Trump flouted the Constitution, international law and basic human rights as defined by the Geneva Convention by separating children, toddlers included, from their refugee parents and placing them in crowded cages. This while deporting their parents without them or creating records to facilitate their prospects of ever being reunited. Despite having an attorney general willing to cooperate in such depravity, Trump searched for one who would go even further and dismantle the rule of law which is the bedrock of all democracies. With William Barr’s installation as the head of the Department of Justice, Trump has achieved his goal of a servant to oversee a dictatorial ministry of a facade of justice — one which would protect the president and his allies and punish his opponents. And so the nation has been treated to the debacles of the Michael Flynn and Roger Stone cases, which have heralded the new era of a double standard and transparently corrupt system of justice. Despite almost comical efforts by Barr to deny any improper influence from Trump, several thousand former career DOJ attorneys have strenuously objected to this staggering implosion of a traditional independent institution dedicated to the impartial application of the law equally to everyone. Barr has also proved a willing accomplice of Trump’s in deploying paramilitary forces against the American people to crush protests against the threat of a police state as the substitute for Democracy. The Black Lives Matter movement is directly related to the erosion of the rule of law and the disparate treatment of African Americans in our criminal justice system. The president’s express encouragement of the use of excessive force by police has fallen hardest on the Black population. The George Floyd killing triggered the inevitable backlash, but both Trump and his AG deny there is even a problem, only a “misconception” by the victims. Where do we expect people to go to obtain justice, if not the streets, when we close the courthouse doors to them by pretending there is no systemic problem discrimination? The final and most dramatic blow to democracy is being delivered as we rapidly approach the 2020 elections. We are scourged by a pandemic — a scourge that has been exacerbated by an intentional “it is what it is” do-nothing disappearing act by the administration — and the government is partnering with the COVID outbreak to effectively deny the people their right to vote. Voting is the heart and soul of democracy. Yet, enabled by a Republican majority on the Supreme Court, the Republican Party has been strategically laboring to suppress voting in Democrat geographic areas for years through gerrymandering, closing polling stations, requiring stricter IDs as well as other tactics resurrected. This was after the Supreme Court crippled the Voting Rights Act and declared certain forms of cheating (gerrymandering non-justiciable. We are now at the mother lode of the American political system — the election for the presidency — and find ourselves with an incumbent who doesn’t believe in elections, democracy, the Constitution, the rule of law or a government whose purpose is to serve the people. And so he has crippled the United States Postal Service in an attempt to kill the option of voting by mail and forcibly place voters at risk of COVID by queuing up in long lines at crowded polling stations if they wish to exercise their sacred right of participating in democracy. This is the crossroads at which America has arrived. At this juncture, there can no longer be any doubt. In a little less than four years, Trump has literally attacked every vestige of democracy, freedom, civil rights, rule of law and constitutional prescription for government there is. There is nothing he hasn’t attacked. We are even at the precipice of losing our right to vote. This is surely the ultimate betrayal, the Judas kiss on the cheek by one who is supposedly sworn to defend us from just such a fate. Thomas Coffin is a retired U.S. Magistrate Judge.

No looting happened. And we expected no less from the young people of Suffolk.In a protest in North Suffolk on Monday, a group of mostly young people gathered and held signs and chanted at an intersection leading into a shopping center. They shouted the names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, two people who are black who have been killed by police officers in other states in recent weeks.A protest in downtown Suffolk on Tuesday was organized by young people but saw a turnout that spanned the generations. They marched around the block from the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts twice, made speeches and read the names of people of color killed by police and white vigilantes.In other words, both of the protests were completely peaceful. None of the violence feared in the rumors materialized. Other rumors were about protests that never actually existed at all.In light of the whispers of professional protestors and agent provocateurs in other areas that have seen looting and damage and fires, even as close as Virginia Beach and Richmond, folks in Suffolk may have had reason to expect that similar bad actors would show up here, bringing destruction and then blaming it on the protestors. But it was always virtually assured the protestors themselves would be peaceful as they exercised their First Amendment rights to speak out against the police brutality, vigilante justice, racism, evil and hate that has stolen the lives of too many people of color.Monday’s protest organizers were mostly Nansemond River High School graduates. Tuesday’s protest was organized by a very recent King’s Fork High School graduate. These are OUR young people protesting for the right to live.

minnpost_2020_184,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After nearly six years of lawsuits, regulatory reviews, and strong resistance from environmental groups, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency finally approved Enbridge’s Line 3 permit. This development will allow Enbridge to begin the $2.6 billion Line 3 replacement. Sadly, the approval process has been fraught with peril, and activists persist in trying to stop Line 3’s construction.Line 3 is important to our state because the project will put 4,200 people to work in construction jobs, and promises to deliver Minnesota safe and reliable petroleum infrastructure for the long term. It will also better protect the state’s energy consumers from supply shortages and price shocks by providing them with steady access to energy resources.The 1,097-mile pipeline extending from Edmonton, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin, was installed in the 1960s to bring Canadian crude oil to market. However, the original pipeline has outlived its useful life after more than 50 years of operation. In 2015, Enbridge began planning for a replacement pipeline that uses more modern and robust materials.After years of legal wrangling and three separate failed attempts to stop the pipeline before the Public Utilities Commission (PUC , opponents of the project pivoted their legal opposition to the Minnesota Court of Appeals. In August Gov. Tim Walz, through the state Commerce Department, joined the environmental and tribal groups opposed to the pipeline by asking for yet another review to the project.As a former Public Utilities commissioner, I was disappointed to hear that Walz’s administration is giving in to fringe activists and throwing up roadblocks with regard to this critical piece of energy infrastructure. The PUC is tasked with creating and maintaining a regulatory environment that ensures safe, adequate and efficient utility services. After six years of review, more than 70 public meetings, a 13,500-page environmental statement and three separate votes from the PUC in support of the pipeline, it is clear it is time to move this project forward. I hope that Walz will abstain from stymieing the process any further following the most recent approval.One in four Minnesotans along the Line 3 route are unemployed, and stopping the pipeline will only further disadvantage an area of our state that is already economically distressed. The state’s manufacturing output is also on a significant upward trajectory due to cheap and abundant energy, increasing 45% from 2009-2018. A recent poll, meanwhile, found that 80% of Minnesota voters rely on oil and natural gas for daily necessities and nine in 10 find personal value to them. Making energy resources more difficult to access will only result in higher energy prices for the state’s consumers.Such general antipathy to energy infrastructure will also undermine grid reliability and make the transition to renewable power generation sources more difficult. Natural gas fired “peaking” plants have made it possible to include more wind and solar energy to the grid, as these plants can serve as a quick backstop when the wind doesn’t blow or sun doesn’t shine. In fact, this transition to natural gas has allowed Minnesota to lower its carbon dioxide emissions from power generation by 25% over the last decade, all the while maintaining a steady supply of electricity.This continued opposition to the Line 3 pipeline flies in the face of the Minnesota common sense that has allowed our state to flourish. It will also send the wrong message to the state’s energy industry, which adds over $14 billion to state GDP every year. The time for delays and obstruction is over. We must get Minnesota’s energy future back on track.Betsy Wergin is a former Minnesota Public Utilities commissioner and former state senator."
suffolknewsherald_2020_50,"Published 9:31 pm Friday, July 10, 2020ByStaff ReportsOn today’s front page, you can see the end of our series on Suffolk Public Schools’ teachers of the year for the 2019-2020 school year.The end of this school year was nothing like the beginning, and it was not something any of these teachers could have envisioned when they set up their classrooms in late August and welcomed students for the year on Sept. 3. Of all the things these teachers knew would be asked of them over the course of the year, teaching virtually for three months was surely not on their list of possibilities.But the teachers of Suffolk Public Schools, more than 1,200 of them, rose to the challenge throughout the coronavirus pandemic. After the heartbreak of seeing the in-person school year end so suddenly on March 13, they did what teachers do best — they adapted, got creative and kept on rolling.We think every single one of them deserved an award, but like every year, only four could be named citywide teachers of the year. The division always chooses a citywide rookie teacher of the year, an accomplishment that is sure to start any career off right. The division also chooses the elementary, middle and high school teachers of the year, and the citywide teacher of the year is chosen from among these three winners.The rookie teacher of the year this year was Sahmod Earls. He is the agriculture teacher at Lakeland High School. “I felt like I needed to be a presence for the upcoming generation,” Earls said when we interviewed him for the article. “That came on my heart.”The elementary teacher of the year was Gwendolyn Mann, a second-grade teacher at Pioneer Elementary School. She has a great philosophy on her teaching methods: “It’s not one size fits all,” she told us. “You have to meet them where they’re at.”Sharon Criner, an IB chemistry teacher at King’s Fork High School, is the high school teacher of the year. We love how she says her students helped her shift from a career in a research laboratory to the classroom: “I’ve grown more comfortable with my subject, I’ve grown more comfortable taking risks and reaching out to my students. I like for them to have a good time, so we’ll go outside and we’ll do problems on the sidewalk. Every day is different in my classroom.”The citywide teacher of the year is Emma Neave, an eighth-grade English teacher at John F. Kennedy Middle School. She shared this about her compassion for her students: “These kids, we need to address the social and emotional issues before we can address the academic issues. That’s probably my biggest thing. because a kid can’t learn if they’re hungry or if they didn’t sleep last night. Over the years, I’ve really come to understand that.”We think these quotes perfectly sum up the heart of a teacher and why these four were chosen to honor this year.

minnpost_2020_215,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As a pediatrician, in every well-child visit besides the standard inquiries about illnesses, vaccinations, diet, and behavior, I would always ask the parents of my patients four additional questions: does your child know how to swim, does your child have a library card, have you taken your child to visit the state Capitol, and are you registered to vote Parents intuitively understood that swimming was a life-saving skill and quickly grasped the link between reading and educational success and health. But they were usually perplexed and intrigued by the last two questions. They were surprised to discover that the policy decisions made at all levels of government had a bigger impact on their child’s health than the medical care they received, and that voting was the best way to influence those decisions. I always made information on how to register to vote available to parents as part of the “anticipatory guidance” portion of the clinic visit.As a public health professional, I have continued similar discussions about what determines health. Most people are surprised to learn that medical care accounts for only about 10% of society’s overall health while at least 50% of health is determined by thesocial, economic, and environmental conditionsin the communities where they live – conditions that are influenced by policy decisions at all levels of government. Once people recognize that fact, they better understand why voting is a public health issue.Multiple studies confirm the health consequences of voting. When voting participation is high,a population’s health is better. The 10 least healthy states in America have avoting participation ratenearly 10 percentage points lower than the10 healthiest states.History demonstrates the impact of voting on health – particularly the health of mothers and babies. After women gained the right to vote in1920, maternal and infant mortality rates dropped precipitously. Similarly, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed, infant mortality rates again dropped and theBlack/white disparity in those rates narrowed. In both situations, policymakers began better serving the needs of previously disenfranchised people only after they were able to express their will by voting.The COVID-19 pandemic adds unprecedented health risks to voting. Knowing that large gatherings pose a risk for spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus and that elections are among the largest public events in America, we must work to assure that voting is safe. A public health strategy is to embrace voting by mail, which minimizes contact and reduces viral spread. Additional options including early voting and ballot drop boxes would supplement the mail-in efforts. Voters need to be assured that the U.S. Postal Service will promptly deliver all ballots and that state officials will include all early and mailed ballots for accurate tallies.This election year, our country is in the midst of cascading and interconnected crises: an infectious disease pandemic, nationwide protests against racial injustice, and catastrophic economic strain for millions of people. Each of these crises reveals the deficiencies and inadequacies of our health, social, and economic systems, and the urgent need for significant policy changes to address the flaws. Officials elected in November will be the people with the opportunity to craft policy changes to address these needs. Thus, it is more important than ever that all our citizens have their voices heard – particularly those who have been disenfranchised in the past. The lessons of 1920 and 1965 teach us that universal suffrage is essential not just for the health of our democracy, but for the health of individuals and communities.Raising a healthy child is one of the most important and difficult tasks of being a parent and no parent can do it alone. It is a tired and overused cliché that “it takes a village to raise a child.” But what is not well recognized is that part of that village’s role is to have every adult vote. A village of voters is necessary to create the conditions in which every child has the opportunity to be healthy and thrive.With only a few weeks to go until the November election, now is the time for everyone in every village to step forward and vote in a safe way. It is the most powerful thing we can do for the health and well-being of our children and our community.Edward P.

Each humble cardboard tube serves as a remembrance of our provisions and our gratefulness for them. Yes, we joined the multitudes searching for that one roll of toilet paper hidden in the back of the shelf. Yet, in all of this time, I’ve never lacked one square of this valuable asset! While the bowl won’t be used as a Thanksgiving centerpiece this year, it is a daily reminder of our many blessings during this time of COVID. Maybe this activity is one of those odd behaviors bought on by stress and uncertainty but it has carried me through these strange days with just a touch of humor while reminding me of our vulnerable humanity.— Leslie Wise, ErdenheimThis Thanksgiving I am thankful for Gov. Tom Wolf. I believe his early and forceful response to the pandemic saved the lives of many Pennsylvanians. As the early months of the pandemic unfolded, it became increasingly clear that the decision-making of governors was the single most significant variable impacting the lives and health of Americans. As I compared Governor Wolf with his counterparts around the country, I felt extremely lucky to have him at the helm in this dark and dangerous time. Prior to March 2020, I thought of Gov. Wolf as a “nice guy.” I viewed him as honest and ethical but, in all honesty, didn’t see him as an especially strong leader. Fortunately I was wrong. He rose to the occasion with humanity and intelligence. Among those in political leadership positions at various levels of government, he is my one and only “COVID hero.” I am thankful that he is my Governor.— Andrew Gelber, PhiladelphiaMy family and I are grateful that my husband, suffering from one of the earliest serious cases of Covid this spring, has recovered with only a couple of minor lingering effects. We are humbled and grateful for all the doctors and nurses at Crozer Chester Medical Center, especially in the ICU, who took excellent care of him over 37 days, including 11 days on a ventilator. We also greatly appreciate the staff at Delaware County’s Fair Acres, who provided physical therapy to get him strong enough to return home. Finally, we are beyond grateful to our families, friends, Swarthmore neighbors, local businesses, our work colleagues, and others who swooped in to provide food, flowers, heartfelt notes of encouragement, errand-running, and emotional support from a distance while we struggled with the uncertainty that the sudden illness brought. We feel fortunate for my husband’s recovery and for our support system.— Virginia Thompson, SwarthmoreWhen I wake in the morning and my feet touch the floor, I am thankful that I lived to see another day. When I go for a run, I am grateful for my healthy lungs and strong legs. And, when I sit in the park and read on a crisp Fall afternoon, I am thankful for the warm sunshine on my face and for the adorable squirrels scampering on a carpet of colorful leaves. Life is truly a visual feast every day. All of us need to take a seat at the table and enjoy the simple pleasures.— Carol A. Pasquarello, PhiladelphiaI’m grateful for COVID-19, but let me be clear as to why: I’m not grateful for a single death, let alone a quarter million - better lives be saved than lessons learned. But virtually all of us have learned to live deeper and more joyous lives resisting the death that surrounds us. When skies clear in spring, let’s remember how our new world came to be.— William Crawford Woods, West ChesterSince I’ve managed to stick around for 94 years, I guess the first thing I’m thankful for is I’m still alive. I am also thankful to be living in the first country in 3000 or so years of recorded history that was founded by people who would govern themselves. What a novel idea. OK, so it ain’t perfect but it ain’t bad either and since it has only been in existence about 300 years, it might be considered a teenager among nations and like all teenagers, it takes a little time to mature. I’m even thankful for protests because they prove we’re trying. I’m thankful for our diversity because it’s our strength.— Ralph D. Bloch JenkintownDon’t you hate those millennials who are glued to their phones, walking down the middle of the sidewalk? Yeah, hi! That was me pre-COVID bumbling around to work or a happy hour. Cue the pandemic. With nowhere to be at no particular time, I’ve unplugged more than ever and found myself looking up to realize that our city is absolutely flush with beautiful murals. If you don’t believe me, walk a few blocks and turn 360 degrees at each intersection. Not only did I see murals on routes I regularly took, but I also saw some become obscured by construction (and painted over during the protests … bye, Rizzo and a few new additions, even during these weird times. I became so intrigued by them that I curated a two-mile tour. I’m so grateful to have the privilege to share this life-sized art exhibit with my friends, with masks of course!— Su Fen Lubitz, PhiladelphiaThankful that I, my wife and our family are healthy, that I have a home to live in, a job to support us, and food on our table. Also for a community that cares for and about us and the very good fortune to be able to help others by caring for them. I’m thankful to be able to provide financial assistance to others though our church and various other charities, such as West Kensington Ministries and Crossroads in North Philadelphia. We give every year, but this year more than most, it’s vital all of us give what we can to those who need it. Finally I’m very thankful for the feeling that being able to give provides me with joy, and hope and love.— John Shaffer, JamisonMy sobriety, safety, health, faith, friends, family, and the victory of the Biden-Harris in the presidential election.— Patricia Joseph, ValenciaThis year I’m grateful to still have a job and a way to support myself, as I know many people who have lost work because of the pandemic. I’m also extremely grateful to live with close friends who have made this time less isolating. I adopted a cat from PAWS in April and she’s brought so much comfort and joy into our home. I’m endlessly thankful to all the healthcare workers in Philly for what they do.— Melissa Goyette, PhiladelphiaBeing thankful and being content very much go hand in hand for me. Recently, my memories began drifting back to the big, raucous, happy family holidays that I miss, and I began imagining future gatherings. It ultimately became tough to be genuinely thankful for all I do have, because all I could think about was what was missing. I found that for me to be truly thankful requires a level of contentment with a very different life now. Learning to be thankful has required me to narrow my focus to the here and now, deliberately recognize what I do have, and to not dwell on what I am missing, especially during Thanksgiving, which is my favorite holiday. I am slowly learning to become content, and in doing so, am learning to be ever more thankful.— Maggie Beck, PalmyraThis year has been the roughest decade of my life, a feeling most likely true for all of us. So much is different. I won’t be celebrating Thanksgiving with my family, still, I have so much to be thankful for. I am thankful for my 13-year old Pomeranian and loving companion. He’s made me laugh and helped me relax when I needed it most. I am grateful that my family and friends are safe and my thoughts remain with those affected. Most of all, I am thankful that a family friend, who very recently battled breast cancer, has come through her surgery, is home safe and healing well. She has shown such strength and grace through it all and has inspired me during this difficult time. I’ve come to realize that, although things are bad right now, I am still one of the lucky ones.— Kristina Cohen, Cape MayWhen this city girl moved to rural northern New York 62 years ago as a bride, I decided to make my first Thanksgiving. There was no such thing as “store-bought” desserts, so I learned through trial and many errors to make my own. Now, even though I live in Philly, I still make all of the desserts and they are the high point of dinner. The kids and grandkids come from CA, CO, as well as right down the street. One year I decided to take the easy way out and instead of making all of the desserts, bought Costco’s apple pie, which is really good. I didn’t say a word about substituting their pie for mine. We’re all at the table eating the variety of happy endings when my CA daughter looked up and said, “Mom, I didn’t fly 3,000 miles for Costco’s apple pie.” I am thankful that my children care enough to stay home because I am medically compromised and hopeful that next year we can all be together for my favorite holiday. So this will be the first time in 62 years that I haven’t made Thanksgiving dinner as none of the kids want to put their grandpop or me at risk. We will all Zoom (yes, this octogenarian has learned how and for the first time we will do curbside pick up from Ryan Christopher’s. But oh, how I will miss all the hugs!— Marian Levin, Merion StationFirst and foremost, would be the right of religious freedom this country allows and then would be my husband, Rick and our family. Thankful for doctors, nurses, first responders and all those who work so tirelessly for our community and are dealing with this years challenges. Thankful for pharmaceutical companies getting a vaccine ready to go and trying to save lives. Thankful for those providing food and housing for those without. I am also very thankful for all of my constituents, for they make my job worth doing. May you all stay safe and healthy.— Councilwoman Anita L. Barton, ConshohockenThis year as our family is scattered, I am most grateful for one thing. I am simply and most humbled to have my family alive. From my 95-year old mother to a fairly young great niece in Israel, we are alive. By our faith in God and lots of caution we have survived. And now with modern medicine, perhaps we can get a grip on COVID-19 and perhaps learned some valuable lessons on life. Nothing counts more than family.— Lois Canter, Cherry HillGive thanks to all the men and women in our military, first responders, and medical teams who keep us healthy and safe from harm’s way. Also to all who produce, deliver, and service our daily needs in agriculture, transportation, retail, and other essential needs. A message of gratitude to all our government workers who perform the necessary tasks in education and municipal services. Let us not forget our religious community, entertainment, and sports which gives us a sense of faith and enjoyment with their dedication and talent. Try to remember those less fortunate by contributing your time or resources to assist in their physical, emotional, or medical needs.—Bob Sweeney, Warwick, RI"
suffolknewsherald_2020_153,"Published 9:42 pm Friday, April 24, 2020ByStaff ReportsEven in the midst of a global pandemic, some things remain constant.That’s why we’re so glad the Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office found a way to commemorate the annual observance of National Crime Victims’ Rights Week, even if it wasn’t in the usual way.Typically, there is a formal program held every April for this observance. But this year is different, because of the pandemic. So the office placed a sign on display in the Godwin Courts Building courtyard on North Main Street last week, with numerous blue ribbons representing crime victims in Suffolk.Representatives of the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office, including top prosecutor C. Phillips “Phil” Ferguson and Victim/Witness Services Director Diane Bryant, practiced safe social distancing as they hung the sign last week. They said they didn’t want to let the current situation deter them from the annual recognition for crime victims.“We do feel that we should remember and never forget those who have been victimized by crime,” Ferguson said. “That is what we’re trying to accomplish with the signs and the ribbons.”This annual observance emphasizes that crime victims have rights and deserve to have access to information and resources to help them navigate the challenging situations they have found themselves in through no fault of their own.This year, the pandemic has brought to the top of everyone’s minds victims of two crimes in particular — domestic violence and child abuse. With families distancing from others by staying at home, partners and children who are already not in safe circumstances may be more at risk.“We’re in the office reaching out to children (and working with their families to make sure that they’re safe, especially at this time where there’s a lot of anxiety in society,” Chief Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Marie Walls said last week.We applaud the Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office for its dedication to this annual recognition.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_203,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Speaking at a naturalization ceremony in 2018, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgtold31 new citizens hailing from 26 countries that, “We are a nation made strong by people like you … people who traveled long distances, overcame great obstacles and made tremendous sacrifices, all to provide a better life for themselves and their families.”Sadly, Justice Ginsburg’s vision of America contrasts sharply with the current reality. On Sept. 30, the Trump administration announced that it would cap the number of refugees the United States will admit to thelowest number in 40 years. The hard truth is that this hateful policy makes our nation less safe and less equipped to overcome the vicious effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Our nation is facing its worst crisis in more than 100 years. The coronavirushas killed more than 211,000 Americansand2,100 Minnesotans,and our economy is crippled. We need new Americans — refugees and immigrants — now more than ever to provide essential services, kick-start growth, and keep our country safe.Immigrants and refugees have always helped revitalize declining communities and strengthen the U.S. economy. Minnesota is a prime example. In St. Paul’s Payne-Phalen and Frogtown and Minneapolis’ Seward and Cedar Riverside neighborhoods, we’ve seen the positive impact that immigrant-owned businesses have made on the local economy. New Minnesotans — like the state’s 69,000 Somali-Americans, 66,000 Hmong-Americans, and 23,000 Vietnamese-Americans — take on critical yet hard-to-fill roles, such as caregivers for the elderly and disabled. Minnesotaimmigrants make up 18 percent of these workers.New Americans don’t just fill positions. They also grow jobs by driving innovation and entrepreneurship.While immigrants constitute 15% of the U.S. workforce, they make upover 25% of entrepreneurs. Investing in refugees and immigrants means a stronger economy. For example, from 2004 to 2014, refugees in the United States actuallygenerated $63 billionmore in government revenue than was spent on public services for them.Finally, immigrants have also made our country safer, at home and abroad. Today, 40,000 immigrants serve in the armed forces and an estimated511,000military veterans are foreign-born. For these heroes who put their lives on the line, the U.S. naturalization ceremony takes on a special meaning.Given the crises we face at home and abroad, the time has come for new leadership and direction. As you evaluate your options for president and Congress on Nov. 3, consider officials who will do the following:The world is watching how we treat others and are taking note. New Americans have helped spur America’s economic and military strength, and with a more inclusive and diverse country we can build back better. Justice Ginsburg and new Minnesotans would agree.Jeff Le was deputy cabinet secretary to former California Gov. Jerry Brown from 2015 to 2019; he oversaw economic development, immigration, and homeland security issues. His family came to the United States as refugees from Vietnam. Follow Jeff @JeffreyDLe.Vera Zakem is the founder of Zakem Global Strategies and a senior technology and policy adviser at the Institute for Security and Technology.

suffolknewsherald_2020_11,"Published 5:01 pm Friday, August 21, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieNobody likes the “wilderness.” This COVID era will likely go down in history as a period of wilderness. I bet you just shuddered at the mention of the word. We think we know or understand wilderness. We are familiar with the Bible narrative of the children of Israel wandering in the desert near Mt. Sinai for 40 years. That history may cause you to think that a wilderness is the equivalent of going nowhere. I recently discovered that wilderness destinations are purposeful places to get you to a place that everyone should wish to go.I do declare that we are in a wilderness, but are we getting anywhere?Destinations seem to be the holy grail of our existence. Anyone who wants to be somebody has a place to be. On the contrary, the COVID era has sent us all to our rooms where it appears we have no place to go. Such an existence gives us so much time for other things. Right?I am reading, “Building the Bridge as You Walk on It: A Guide for Leading Change” by author Robert E. Quinn. I did not pick up this book on my own accord. It is the resource that my nonprofit, Leadership LINKS, Inc. is reading this year. We recently finished our discussion of chapters 9-10. In the latter chapter, Quinn discusses wilderness as being a place of retreat to become pure and find our integrity. He suggests that the danger of this idea of wilderness experience is that we may become unengaged or withdrawn in our efforts to keep away from the corruption of community and connecting with others.He writes, “In many spiritual traditions, it is suggested that we find our integrity by withdrawing from the world: retreating to the nunnery or the Buddhist monastery or, like Jesus, to the wilderness” (Quinn, 2004, p. 113 . It is true that Jesus retreated to the wilderness to unengage from society. Luke 5:16 tells us, “So He Himselfoftenwithdrew into the wilderness and prayed” (NKJV . He needed to get alone with His Creator.The COVID era wilderness has caused many (especially the elderly to withdraw from society for safety. A killer disease seeking whom it may infect is a good reason to withdraw. But if we reason that we are in the wilderness for safety, we will be wanderers here for potentially a long time. Our current wilderness invites us to journey in the land of restored virtue.We often relate morals, ethics and good values to sound integrity. Integrity is all of those things. It is also being whole. When I think of people like Congressman John Lewis and my grandfather Alfred “Perry” Harris, I think of firm and solid examples of integrity personified. By firm and solid, I mean that they remained unimpaired although they went through much in their lives. Their resolve to live a strong life was such that their work on this earth spoke to their calling and that calling is their legacy.Life in this fallen world impairs our strength. People influence us to turn from who we really are. Ignorance and deception literally make lost souls of us. God brings us to the wilderness to bring us back to our integrity. Virtue has left us, and we will travel some distance to get it back again. The gulf between where I am and where I am going may resemble a desert. Yet, I am confident that God is leading us to His promise. He is getting me to where I am.It’s interesting that our role in nature is to preserve the wilderness in our wildlands. But God preserves our nature identified in Him by drawing us to and through the wilderness.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

suffolknewsherald_2020_145,"Published 9:23 pm Friday, May 1, 2020ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:I know the COVID-19 pandemic is very serious; however, it appears to me that most other emergency care is being ignored by health facilities.My youngest daughter was admitted to the local urgent care facility with possible stroke conditions after having some dental work performed. First of all, we had to drop her off outside the facility in North Suffolk and because of COVID-19, no family members were allowed to go in with her. My daughter has bad anxiety, and that along with her stroke symptoms left her alone and basically unable to communicate with the medical staff. My wife did her best to communicate with the medical staff by her cell phone.As a result of my daughter’s condition, she was transferred to another local hospital for additional treatment and a stay in the hospital. Communication with the medical staff has been very hard and also through cell phone. It is extremely difficult to get the doctors or nurses to call back. One of them actually lectured us that there is pandemic out there, insinuating that has priority over all other emergent care issues.As we all know, for strokes, it is important that immediate treatment be evaluated and performed as soon as possible after the event. The hospital staff indicated that due to COVID-19, a neurologist was not able to come in until Monday. It took my wife urging the hospital staff for a neurologist to be brought in on Saturday to evaluate and treat my daughter.I think the hospital administration should re-evaluate their direction that only the patient be allowed into the hospital. With proper personal protective equipment, a family member can be allowed in to provide communication with the medical staff and to provide comfort to their family member being treated. Additionally, the hospital administration should stop ignoring other emergent care issues.Leo PietilaSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_22,"Progressive, grassroots movements, fueled by nothing but the collective faith and desires to restore America’s true promise, sprung up across the nation.Prior to starting residency, I traveled across Germany and Poland with a group of medical students and seminarians as a part of a two-week long fellowship to study the history of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.As we walked the streets of Berlin and alongside the railroad tracks of Auschwitz, a carousel of horrific images became indelibly imprinted in my mind. As civilized people, how could we have allowed such atrocities to have occurred?More than any historical fact, I returned home with a humble lesson— that no individual or society is inherently immune to some of our baser instincts.» READ MORE:Holocaust survivor Anneliese Nossbaum returned to Auschwitz for a final reckoning. It was the last journey of her life.At age ten, I immigrated to the United States from South Korea, a country that held invasions, annexations, civil war, and military coups in recent memory. Without knowing too much about it, I immediately developed a strong faith in the system of American democracy. As a young child who had just left his friends and his home behind, that system provided feelings of safety and stability, filtered through the lens of my untested yet unshakable optimism.Growing up, I quickly realized that my initial faith was more of an inchoate idealism. Like any nation, America’s story was more muddled than what I’d read in textbooks. I witnessed—and to a lesser degree experienced—discrimination and racism. I treated patients whose suffering stemmed more from socioeconomic inequities than from any physical or psychological disease. Upon closer examination, the American reality contained many inconsistencies and hypocrisies when compared to her founding and still often touted ideals. I began to deeply question my faith in the American system. That is, until recently.The last four years have cemented my view of America as an undeniably great nation. America became “great again” in my eyes, and I will tell you why.BeforeAdolf Hitler became chancellorin 1933, his party jumped in less than a decade from winning 3% of the vote to 33%—still no majority. However, beguiled by the promises of a superior nation and enabled by a bystander majority, his supporters quickly cemented the Nazi regime’s fascist dictatorship. Institutions such as the press, as well as the healthcare and judicial systems, were either suppressed or readily acquiesced to the party agenda. Baser instincts prevailed, and the rest is history, as we all know too well.The current right-wing populist movement is a global phenomenon. From Britain and Brazil to Poland and Germany, many countries saw adramatic risein such groups’ influence fed by swelling economic, social, and political grievances, alongside racial and other prejudice. American democracy has been one of the test subjects.For the last four years, I watched aghast as the Trump administration blatantly attacked some of America’s most fundamental, nonpartisan institutions such as intelligence agencies and the media, while giving control of the judiciary as well as other essential pillars of government to his sycophants. He threatened to deploy the military against protestors and undermined the integrity of the election before it even began. At some moments, watching his administration tread theroad to tyrannyconjured images of my time in Germany and Poland, leading me to acknowledge with a sense of defeat: “Ah, this is how it happened.”However, giving up at that point would have been a failure to acknowledge how President Trump has been making America great again.Progressive, grassroots movements, fueled by nothing but the collective faith and desires to restore America’s true promise, sprung up across the nation. Millions have rallied to defend democracy, acrossages,genders,ethnicities, sexual orientations, andsociopolitical leanings. Without President Trump, these movements would not have been as, shall we say,tremendous.“I understand why my parents made so many sacrifices so that my brother and I could pursue our education and one day raise our families here.”Institutions like the courts and press, as well as members of the medical, legal, educational, and scientific professions, checked and balanced the administration’s disregard for many crucial issues such as the Coronavirus pandemic—refusing to heed the president’s claim it was going away—and election procedures, rejecting the administration’s false claims of fraud. Without President Trump, these breakthroughs surely would not have been asradical.With many of our global allies as well as other right-wing populists watching, the American people elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next president and vice-president. Without President Trump, I wonder if we would have seen the winner receive the largest number of votes ever in the history of America. “Sad!” perhaps — but true.A part of me still harbors gnawing anxiety anduncertaintyinthe aftermathof the election, and the damage Trump has wrought. But for the first time since I immigrated to America, I have renewed faith in this democracy and why it is worth fighting for. I understand why my parents made so many sacrifices so that my brother and I could pursue our education and one day raise our families here.» READ MORE:America is over: Let’s just split into different countries | OpinionYes, Trump’s tenure has exposed some of this country’s flaws and vulnerabilities that we must continue to improve. Yet simultaneously, its strength was most evident in being able to withstand the Trump presidency. Timothy Snyder, who studies autocratic regimes at Yale, recently said Trump’s predicament is that he hasn’t been able toruin our system enough. In other nations less deeply rooted in democratic values, he may have managed to.In the end, I have to give the president credit for being right about one thing. He did make America great again, just not in the ways that he envisioned. The country is becoming great, not because of him, but in overcoming him.Jason J.

No, he voted for the incumbent. Mr. Bombshell added, “he entertained me.” Ah. So that explains at least some of it.Those tethered to televisions, iPads and iPhones turned them on every morning to catch up with the antics of the day. But I could only take so much of it, and am relieved to be half an ocean away from the crazy continent, where pupule combined with pandemic turned into science fiction.Some people love sci-fi, but I am not among them. During my early years in Hilo, when I had to read fiction such as “Little House on the Prairie” and “Wuthering Heights,” I saw these novels as science fiction because they revealed strange and alien worlds that I didn’t care to inhabit.Even today my reading is confined mostly to nonfiction. But because I taught for decades at a college and dealt with reports, papers and proposals, I needed other ways to engage my stodgy brain. Thankfully, the daily newspaper has always been at my doorstep, offering something to chew on with my morning coffee.For this last column in 2020, I will try to end our sad and scary year with a laugh, and to do this, I pick up our faithful pepa and turn to the classified ads.There was a time when the classifieds ran for pages, rewarding me with endless mirth and merriment. But even though these columns of ads are better than fiction or science fiction, today with online everything, they’re fewer than before. And yet, I still find tidbits to tickle my funny bone and tease my imagination.Here’s one advertising “Pig for adoption. Home raised, very funny, great fertilizing unit.”Whoa! Don’t you just want to bring home that pooping porker? I thought “very funny” sealed the deal, but a no-fun family member talked me out of adopting our irresistible oinker.How about the garage sale in Panaewa that suggests shoppers “bring own vehicle for transport.”Hello? It’s Panaewa. Don’t come on rollerskates.Another ad for a garage sale starting at 6:30 a.m. cautioned, “No early birds.”I guess garage-salers have been known to show up in the dark.What about “Room for rent in downtown Hilo … occasionally share with owner.” Hmmmm. You run with that one.Then there’s “Designer Pup.” Is this a typo? Designer pump, designer cup … after toying with possibilities, I conclude pup must mean dog. Designer dog. Howzat for science fiction? But maybe it’s simply advertising dog as accessory. Not sci-fi, but sci-fashion.In case you’re wondering if I’ve gone bananas, what’s happening is that after nearly a year of isolation and nutso news, my brain feels like mashed potatoes as the outside world spins surreal.What we need in 2021, especially for those devoted to fiction and science fiction, is to give it a rest while we focus on enormous real-life challenges such as getting the virus under control and dealing with what’s often advertised in the classifieds: work needed, tutor wanted, help available.As for funny pig, that’s my kind of world. But designer dog? Not so much.Rochelle delaCruz was born in Hilo, graduated from Hilo High School, then left to go to college.

minnpost_2020_192,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I often think about how I phrase my opinion so as to not put down others. It took me years to learn how to process unique situations and be more mindful with my words. Words matter; they matter a lot.When I was an undocumented student at Arlington High School in St. Paul in the late 2000s, I got involved in trying to pass a law that would allow a kid like me to pay in-state tuition at state colleges and universities because I was treated as an out-of-state student even though I was educated and lived in Minnesota.I got to speak at a hearing on the proposed law. I sat next to a U.S. citizen student who was supporting the law. I can’t remember my exact words, but I remember saying that he could take for granted going to college and I could not. I did not think much of it at the time.But as I moved through life and met many other young people, and yes, many U.S. citizens, I caught myself thinking about my words during that hearing. Going to college is really hard, for just about anyone. And the assumptions one makes about others are often misleading. Sure, for U.S. citizens, it may be easier to get a loan for school or have access to educational opportunities, but the fact remains that access to higher education is difficult for most people. And if I could go back to that hearing, I would have said something else because I now understand the struggles so many face to graduate high school and go to college. And treating those supporting the same cause that we are is just not good politics or humane.This also informed how I talked about higher education in general. I often presented to groups of educators, students and families. And I always talked about the different ways to go to college, for U.S. citizens and noncitizens. I never knew exactly who was in the room so why not cover all my bases and be as encompassing as possible.I sighed in frustration and sadness. Why do we have to put down others, speak in disgust of others, to show the value of the community Why do we have to have a hierarchy in the community Why is a U.S. citizen who does not scrub toilets more valuable in the community than a non-U.S. citizen who cleans for a living It feels so unnecessary. And it’s hurtful.I understand the feeling to create a contrast as to what the white community thinks of the Latine community. We are diverse. Those of us in the community know that. But why go to such lengths so as to put down members of the community to highlight the vote powerAs an undocumented person, I have done so much for the community, and yes, I know I cannot vote, but I am valuable and I bring so much to the community. Yes, voting is really important, but the undocumented community can still engage in getting out the vote and getting family members engaged. I mean, we are doing so already.The law we were trying to pass in 2007 became a law in 2013 as theProsperity Act or MN Dream Act. I never got to benefit from it because I had graduated from Augsburg University already, but it has changed the landscape in access to higher education for so many in the community. And it was undocumented youth and their allies who made this happen.So to those who want to highlight the power of the Latine community, including voting, never underestimate the children of a toilet-scrubbing undocumented Minnesotan or that Minnesotan herself.Juventino Meza is an undocumented student at Mitchell Hamline School of Law."

suffolknewsherald_2020_112,"Published 10:19 pm Wednesday, December 30, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieNow that we are near the end of a very long year, I am sure that many of you have done much reflecting on the events of 2020. We take for granted that looking back is really a gift to us.Most of us look forward to the end of the year because of the celebrations of Christmas and New Year’s Day. We highly anticipate the opportunities that we have to begin again on the first day of January. Looking back allows us moments to take a good account of what our personal history has done for us. Experience is a good teacher.Wouldn’t it be something if we had a line graph to track our responses to life in the same way we track weight loss or product sales or other achievements? Supposedly there is something like that. It is called a life graph. Students of history or English have used a similar concept to illustrate the main events of a character’s life in a story or novel. It is more of a timeline than it is a line graph.We may not have an all-encompassing graph that tells our history in great detail, but I submit that reflecting on how far you have come, acknowledging the ways you have changed and revisiting lessons that you have learned from the things you have gone through help you connect the dots. The main reason that looking back is a gift is because the function of connecting dots is continuous.There are no perfect straight lines in our life graphs.Connecting dots is storytelling. In 2005, Steve Jobs gave a commencement speech before an audience at Stanford University. He said,“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.” I have a saying of my own regarding moments in my life that have significant meaning. When I don’t always understand why something is happening but I trust that there is a reason, I say to my Heavenly Father, “I see the dots. I may not know how they connect, but I want You to know that I know that this is a dot.” Identifying the dots in our lives is as important if not more important than being able to connect them. If there are no dots, there are no lines between them.I love the Advent season, because we have the opportunity to reflect on the fullness of time in which God sent the Savior in fulfillment of prophecy. In the book of Isaiah, long before Christ’s birth, the prophet speaks, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God as well? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him Immanuel. By the time He knows enough to reject evil and choose good, He will be eating curds and honey” (Isaiah 7:13-15 . The people of that time understood that those who believed in Him must be prepared for His coming. They trusted that the present dots would connect to the future dot of the Messiah’s birth.Reflecting on yesterday helps us to prepare for our tomorrows, particularly the tomorrow we wish to see.During a recent session with my Bible study, our facilitator asked us to consider the criteria by which we make decisions. From her lecture, I had to confront the question of whether I make decisions based upon whether they will have an impact on my spiritual life and particularly where I will spend eternity. As I considered that question, I realized that there is a great difference in looking forward to tomorrow and choosing forward.As we look back on this year and consider what is next, it is my prayer that I will not just put my thoughts in the future, hoping for a better tomorrow, but make choices for the future. Ultimately, every decision we make will reflect our eternal destiny. If we trust that these present dots will connect to the future dot of Jesus Christ’s return, then we must prepare and decide well.QuaWanna Bannarbie an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

Even when things look terribly bad.I was watching the weather at 3 a.m. Aug. 4. The weatherman pointed to a small spot on his radar screen when he excitedly said, “This is a tornado on the ground in downtown Suffolk!”My ears perked up immediately, because for 73 years, our family has operated a furniture store in downtown Suffolk. A few minutes later the alarm company called; the sensors had picked up the sound of broken glass. Minutes later, an employee sent us a picture of the front of the store, showing the windows blown out and damage to the slate roof.By 4 a.m., Brandon and I hurriedly arrived, where we found gaping holes in the roof, exposing the heavens. Water was everywhere, and ceiling tiles were collapsing before our eyes. Most of the furniture was soaking wet or covered with shards of glass.The first thing that entered my mind was, “Do we have enough insurance to cover this type of catastrophic damage?”What’s most important finally came to mind: we were closed, and despite all the destruction, nobody in our city was seriously injured or, even worse, killed.This has to be a God thing. And we should all give Him thanks for His protection.People began to reach out, offering their support: friends, customers and churches all offering to help. That’s the kind of people we have in Suffolk!Thankfully, during the six to eight months it will take to refurbish our store, we have a place to continue our business. It’s across the street at our outlet store, 248 W. Washington St.Another blessing: we have more than enough insurance to cover the expenses of building our store back. Everything will be brand-new — the store and all the furniture.Although I am 76, I am very optimistic about our future. My son, Brandon, has worked with me for 25 years, and now his sons are very much involved in the business. This is our fourth generation in the furniture business in downtown Suffolk.Yes, God is good, even when things look hopeless.Romans 8:28: “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”David CarterSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_59,"From the Tuskegee Study to the Mississippi appendectomies, the U.S. medical establishment has a long history of experimenting on people of color without their consent.The reports that Pfizer’s vaccine is95% effective with no serious side effectsand that Moderna’s vaccine candidatehad demonstrated 94.5% effectivenessin trials are the latest beacons of hope in an otherwise bleak public health landscape.While these breakthroughs are a giant step, a vaccine is only as good as its uptake. That means policymakers and public health professionals need to start planning now to make sure the vaccine reaches all Americans — and in particular, that people of color, who have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic, are able and willing to get vaccinated early.Unfortunately, trends show we have a long way to go to make that happen. According to new research published by theCOVID Collaborative, fewer than half of Black adults and just two-thirds of Latinx adults say they would “probably or definitely” get vaccinated if the vaccine were available and free. Although majorities of both groups believe the vaccine would likely be effective, the low rate of intended uptake is driven by skepticism about its safety. Only 14% of Black adults and about one-third of Latinx adults trust the vaccine will be safe, and Black adults are 19% more likely than others to doubt the vaccine will have been tested for safety in their own ethnic group.» READ MORE:Coronavirus vaccines face trust gap in Black and Latino communities, study findsThese findings are alarming, but hardly surprising. From theTuskegee Studyto theMississippi appendectomies,the U.S. medical establishment has a long history of experimenting on people of color without their consent. Cultural barriers have also sowed reluctance amongLatinxresidents to seek health care.For this to change, there are things policymakers and public health professionals must do starting now to build trust among Black and Latinx Americans.First, we must employ trusted health-care messengers to reduce safety concerns. Public health professionals, frontline health-care workers, the media, and government officials should front-load accessible information about how COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, what safety measures are in place, and what thresholds of safety need to be met before vaccines are approved — especially if emergency-use authorization designation is used for licensure. Providing clear, consistent messaging about vaccine safety will be key to increasing trust in the vaccine. And messages on vaccine safety should be led by trusted health-care professionals, with other prominent community voices taking more of a support role.Second, we must build a pro-vaccine social norm in communities of color. Surprisingly only around 30% of each group said they trusted religious leaders and elected officials in their communities in terms of COVID-19 vaccination. This highlights a case where peer influence can be a game-changer — by helping to increase vaccine uptake.In the COVID Collaborative study, nearly nine in 10 Black adults who believe most of their friends and family would want them to get vaccinated reported that they would do so. However, among Black adults who believed few of their close contacts would want them to get vaccinated, only two in 10 said they would do so.This is where community messengers, such as pastors, teachers, community organizers, and local elected officials, can help lead by example by talking about their own plans to get vaccinated early, and by encouraging the people they encounter to do the same through ongoing dialogues.The influence of peer norms also means that social media platforms like Facebook will need to step up and stop vaccine disinformation from spreading on their networks. Such disinformation canmeaningfully impedeefforts to build population immunity through vaccination.» READ MORE:Public health leaders should address African Americans’ coronavirus vaccine concerns now | OpinionFinally, this is our warning to address the impact of systemic racism in health care. To begin to combat these long-germinating seeds of distrust, policymakers should prioritize expanding health-care access, making health care affordable, and investing in education, housing, jobs, family, and quality-of-life improvements in the communities of color that have suffered the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic.The bottom line is clear: A vast majority of Americans will need to get vaccinated to bring an end to this pandemic. Taking these steps now to head-on address sources of mistrust among Black and Latinx residents will increase our chances of making sure that, once a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, vulnerable Americans actually make the critical choice to get inoculated.Valerie Montgomery Rice is president and dean of Morehouse School of Medicine.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_16,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The $900 billion fiscal stimulus approved by congressional leaders late Sunday, and now headed for speedy enactment, is, like the accompanying funding deal to avert a government shutdown, more than a little underwhelming.Not just because it’s a shadow of the multi-trillion-dollar CARES Act approved last spring. Not just because Democrats and President Donald Trump wanted to spend substantially more. Or even that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell counseled against a too-small second stimulus causing a “weak” recovery.But simply because in this almost unparalleled circumstance of a pandemic, “throwing money” at the problem is exactly the right thing to do.And what did these weeks and months of bickering between congressional factions accomplish? If this was supposed to be a Dickensian Christmas drama, it appears Ebenezer Scrooge only learned his lesson partially from the holiday spirits.No turkey for the Cratchits, but maybe a plate of reheated mac and cheese.It is a moment less reminiscent of “A Christmas Carol” and more like “Oliver Twist” — “Please, sir, I want some more.” The only thing missing is the resulting swing of a ladle to the head.Here’s what all that wasted energy wrought: $600 checks for people making up to $75,000 a year, $300 per week in added unemployment benefits through mid-March, more Paycheck Protection Program loans to small businesses (at more than one-third the cost of the package and some direct aid for struggling transportation systems, food stamp benefits, coronavirus vaccines, testing and tracing, rental aid and a one-month extension of the federal eviction ban, education aid, a small pay boost for the military and some other small odds and ends.Senate Republicans held the line on aid to “Democrat-run” states and cities, but not really. Many other forms of direct aid — health care and education costs, for example — will indirectly soften the blow of reduced tax collections on local government budgets.Democrats are vowing that this isn’t the last economic relief package of the pandemic and that things will be different once Joe Biden takes the oath of office. But will they?It seems like Republicans had plenty of incentive to get this done before the Georgia runoff elections. Then what? If Democrats take both those Senate seats in what would surely be the political upset of the year, then yes, a change of heart is possible.But aside from that, why should anyone expect Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to lift a finger to accomplish anything other than block Democratic initiatives? Wasn’t that his stated purpose when Barack Obama was president?These are trying times. Many Americans will soon be celebrating Christmas and New Year’s after that. It’s a time for good will toward all, for charity, for generosity, for inspiration, thankfulness and faith.They might not all be miserly curmudgeons on Capitol Hill, but one overdue relief measure doesn’t mean they are keeping Christmas in their hearts either.— The Baltimore Sun"
minnpost_2020_106,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Unless you have been living off the grid in remote Alaska surviving on salmon and berries, you have heard of COVID-19. The horrible respiratory disease has stretched to almost every tiny corner of the globe and has impacted every aspect of our lives. Whether you are a CDC-compliant citizen using masks, hand sanitizer, and practicing social distancing, or are a conspiracy theorist watching “Plandemic” on repeat, there are certain things we are just unable to do right now. One of things – whether it be tiny kindergarteners learning to read, or seniors in college studying biochemistry – students are unable to attend school in the traditional brick and mortar way.While privileged students may not love e-learning, this past spring, they likely had a fully dedicated device and internet to access their learning. They likely had consistent meals during the day. Their parents’ white-collar jobs allowed at least some professional flexibility so they could assist their children with their schoolwork. While living in a global pandemic and sheltering in place is emotionally straining and stressful for all, in the end, some livelihoods have not been greatly impacted.On the other side of town, other parents left the house every day to work hourly wage jobs, exposing themselves and their families to the deadly disease. While they were gone, children cared for themselves, made themselves food, cared for younger siblings, and maybe logged in to school on a single device shared by all school-age children in the home. In the first two weeks of e-learning in Los Angeles,15,000 high school students did not log into any of their online platforms for school – mostly due to a complete lack of access to the internet.These stark disparities that are a reality in our country become even starker when additional strains are presented to already strained populations. Year over year,Minnesota is ranked among those states having the highest achievement gaps in the country. While there will be no standardized tests to analyze this year, it seems all but certain that COVID-19 will further extend this persistent opportunity gap.The thing that has not been adequately discussed among educational professionals is a fall learning model based in equity. Equity is a buzzword that makes people seem woke. You may have even seen thegraphic of three little boystrying to look over a fence. One is tall, one is medium height, and one is short. If you give every kid a box to stand on in order to see over the fence, that is equality. The tall kid can see over the fence really well now; the medium kid can barely see over; and the short kid still cannot see. Equity means you give the boxes to those who need them – the short kid gets two, the medium kid gets one, and the tall kid gets none. If you are really woke, you have even seenthe third picture, which is liberation– and there isn’t even a fence there! Let’s tear down the fence!While the image makes intuitive and emotional sense, very few people know how that translates to actions in real life. The most common way is to shift fiscal resources at a state or local level. So then, equity sounds great to people in the fence image, but when school districts attempt to shift actual resources from their child to a different one, anger erupts. When funding shifts are attempted, large groups of affluent (read: white parents threaten to pull their child out of the district and into another one or straight into a private school, which pulls much-needed resources from the public school system.But COVID-19 has provided us an opportunity to do things differently. For example, we know how to wash our hands better and we know which meetings could have been an email. We also know that it is hard to be isolated from other humans. Years of educational research shows us that relationships matter for educational outcomes. Students with positive student-teacher relationships, positive peer relationships, positive relationships with out of school providers and coachesincrease student motivation and success in school.In the fall, if only some students can come into each classroom, spaced 6 feet apart, consider who those students could be. Place those students who would most benefit from in-person schooling – those with inconsistent access to meals or technology, those with special education needs who most benefit from special services, those who would benefit from seeing their teacher face-to-face, those who are three grades below reading level.School this fall is not going to look like any fall we have ever seen. And maybe that is a good thing. Let’s finally get the boxes to the right kids.Jennie Akerstrom Zumbusch holds a master’s degree in public policy from the University of Chicago and is the process of completing her Ph.D. in education policy and leadership as part of the Executive Cohort program in Organizational Leadership and Policy Development at the University of Minnesota.

suffolknewsherald_2020_186,"Published 6:15 pm Tuesday, December 29, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceI don’t think there is any doubt that 2020 will go down in history. This year has seen more than its share of turmoil.The coronavirus shot fear into the heart of our nation. People flocked to stores stocking up on essentials, creating a shortage of many products. Empty shelves gave a post-apocalyptic look and an uneasy feeling.The government responded to the virus by shuttering many businesses, leaving people out of work and without an income. People debated the government’s response, and everyone picked a side. The arguments quickly became ugly and mean-spirited.During this time, civil unrest set into our nation. Protests broke out from sea to shining sea.To top it off, a political battle over control of the nation led to an even greater division among Americans. Bitterness and anger swelled to the top on both sides of the aisle.The consequences of this turmoil are easy to see. Mental health workers have seen a considerable increase in those seeking assistance, suicide numbers are up, and drug overdoses have skyrocketed.This has been a chaotic year, but chaos in our world is nothing new. A few thousand years ago, much of the world was ruled by the brutal regime of the Roman Empire. Those who dared cross the empire were met with an iron fist.During this time, the people from the country of Judea were growing restless of Roman rule and longed to restore their nation. Many people claimed to be prophets and teachers, but their speeches often led to confusion and division instead of uniting the conquered country. The people of Judea were a conquered and confused people living under a brutal regime. Talk about chaos!This is the world that Jesus entered. The Son of God was not born in a time when everything was running smoothly. He came to our world when everything had fallen apart. He stepped into a world filled with chaos.Jesus was not afraid of this chaos. In fact, He said it was the reason He came. He would tell all who were with earshot that he came to rescue the lost, confused, hurt and scared. Jesus never ran from chaos. He ran to those trapped in the chaos of the world and enslaved by their own sins.My prayer for this Christmas is that we will ask Jesus to enter the chaos of our world. I hope we stop thinking that Jesus is only interested in “good people who have it all together.” Jesus said His reason for coming was to seek and save the lost, going as far as to say that He did not come to call righteous people.I hope this Christmas teaches us that we do not have to hide the chaos in our world or the chaos in our lives from Jesus. Instead, we should invite Him into our world and into our lives. He didn’t run from chaos 2,000 years ago when He came as a baby, and He’s not scared of the chaos in our world or lives today. The only question for us is if we will allow Him into our chaos.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

A man was talking about all that was happening in our nation and our world. He said, “I don’t know how you all feel, but right at the moment, I feel like I’m living in an uncomfortable situation. I feel like I’m in some type of bubble and I can’t get out, and I don’t know what to do while I’m in this place that I am in.”If the truth be told, there are a lot of people who feel as though they are in a uncomfortable situation. They have not expressed it, but they are.Life can deal you some strange, stressful situations. Life can make you feel very uncomfortable at times. In I Kings 19:9-13, we focus in on God’s servant Elijah. We see him hiding in a cave with a calling on his life from God. He had an issue that was causing him to be under pressure. Life was getting a little difficult. It seemed as though life had put him in an uncomfortable situation. He was suffering from a brief period of depression. He had worked hard for the Lord. He was doing everything he thought he could do to push the work of the Lord forward; however, sometimes the service we give can stress us out. Sometimes being depressed and under extreme stress can make you feel worthless, feelings of being lost of direction, or having a loss of purpose in life. How was it possible for this man of God, this servant of the Lord who had just witnessed the power of God on Mt. Carmel in destroying the false prophets of Baal now to hide himself on Mt. Horeb in a cave? Life for him had gotten so uncomfortable that he now wants to be decommissioned. He wanted to be taken out of service for the Lord. Elijah felt it was too much for him to handle.Has life ever made you want to give up? Has it ever made you feel you couldn’t take it anymore?Living in an uncomfortable situation is doable when you know that you are not alone. You have to remember that you are not alone in whatever situation you are in. The Lord is always there to strengthen us for our journey. Living in an uncomfortable situation can allow us to realize that we could be in that situation for a purpose.Living our lives is not always about us, but in so many cases it includes others. That’s what Elijah has to realize, that he was called out to serve, and sometimes life will in fact be uncomfortable. If I had the chance to call in to the radio station and talk with the man who felt uncomfortable, I would tell him he’s not alone. For if God’s eyes are on a sparrow, then you have to know He’s watching over you.The Rev. Dr. Joseph A. Perry is pastor of St. Mark AME Zion Church.

minnpost_2020_36,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There is another plot twist unraveling in the reopening of public schools this fall, something predictable yet relatively invisible in much current news. Public schools across cities and inner ring suburbs are at risk of losing significant funding through the loss of enrollment. This is especially true for schools that do not offer an in-person model that meets the desires of white parents. Based onsurvey datafrom the Minnesota Department of Education, white families are most likely to send their kids back to school in-person in the fall. This aligns withEmbraceRace’s statistics that three of four parents of color are likely to say they want school to remain closed until the risk of COVID-19 transmission is as low as possible, compared with one of two white parents.In a survey from Robbinsdale Area Schools (a mix of inner and outer-ring suburbs , 29.5% of families desired face-to-face learning, most of whom were from the western suburbs. Historically, districts have increased class sizes and cut programming and equity positions when they lose funds because of lower enrollments.In the Facebook group “Teaching During COVID-19,” more than 200 teachers from rural, suburban, private, and charter schools discussed their fall planning for hybrid models or full in-person instruction. However, large urban districts across the country have committed to start the year with distance learning. In doing so, they are valuing the lives of their children, families, and educators, including many Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC communities with increased health risks connected to COVID-19. Teachers are able to plan lessons without a predictable change in modality, aiming to increase engagement, equity, and learning (in a pandemic . At the same time, based on the decisions that white public school parents may make to abandon these schools by fleeing to charter or private schools, to outer-ring suburban schools, or to private pods (offering potentially empty promises of hybrid or in-person teaching , their school enrollment and the funding of public education is put at serious risk.What does this have to do with anti-racismAfter the viral video of the killing by police of unarmed community member George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, the local youth-driven uprising in the fight for Black lives and against police brutality has been amplified by national and global outrage, despite a pandemic. This sustained uprising has led to broad and vague fiscal commitments by philanthropists, organizations, and companies.Educationhas been at the forefront, as people clamor to learn more aboutanti-racism. White people in particular have asserted a new or deepened commitment to social justice, and they often ask, “But what can I do”In the case of COVID-19 and back-to-school parent choices, we have one specific suggestion: For all public school parents, keep your children enrolled in their current or local public school.Especially for those of us who have greater financial means to make creative choices, we can support our kidswithouthurting our public schools. We canradically reimagine the school year. We can work to createequity in pandemic schooling. And, if we think outside our pods, we can do it through the lens of anti-racism, equity, and mutual support."
suffolknewsherald_2020_169,"Published 6:40 pm Friday, November 20, 2020ByStaff ReportsThe time of year where the Suffolk News-Herald asks for donations for the Cheer Fund has rolled around once again.However, this year is quite different from most.The Cheer Fund was an effort started by the Suffolk News-Herald in the 1930s to collect money. In its early years, the money was distributed to the Salvation Army for food baskets for the poor. Eventually, it switched to providing toys for children in Suffolk.This year, for the first time in its history, the Cheer Fund is asking for money during a worldwide pandemic that has fundamentally changed life in just about every way, both worldwide and for all of us in Suffolk — donors and recipients alike.There have been times of turmoil before, but nothing quite like this. This year has brought economic upheaval, political turmoil and racial unrest all against the backdrop of more than a quarter of a million Americans dying from an unseen enemy. Millions have been left behind to grieve their loss. Millions more have become ill and recovered, but with lasting physical and emotional side effects they will carry with them the rest of their lives.The very real effects of this virus and all it has wrought here in Suffolk mean many people may be in the position of asking for help who have never asked for help before.

When funds were supplied to replace or relocate the Kings Highway Bridge, it was inexplicably used to fund other projects and never replaced. Now we are told by the city that there is no near term plan to reinstitute the bridge project, pretty much eliminating an alternative emergency egress from our cherished communities of Crittenden, Eclipse and Hobson. But, they seem to have funds to work with developers to turn one of the most beautiful, peaceful and family oriented communities into an ugly representation of their and the developer’s vision of progress. The developers have figured out a creative way of using regulations to put the city in their pocket.By effectively using existing criteria, they have been able to bypass the council and the mayor. The city’s responsibility to serve their constituents and their needs has now been deemed irrelevant; there is no longer a need, let alone a path, to allow the affected residents to have a say in their lives and communities.Since so much of the city council’s work has been relegated to the city planner (who, by the way is not accountable to the residents , do we even need a council of representatives? Since so much of the legal issues are being handled by the city manager (who also is non-elected , do we even need a mayor?With this reallocation of responsibilities, they have effectively shut out our ability to be heard. In other words, they have put a deaf ear to our concerns and are making us “tell it to the hand”!We are at a critical time in trying to maintain a good family oriented quality of life. Election time is here and is our next chance to be heard.

eugeneweekly_2020_30,"We ve got issues. We all knew the story of the 2016 and 2020 elections: Donald Trump won in 2016 because Democrats either stayed home or cast protest votes, convinced Hillary Clinton would win easily. So now, after four years of Trump being Trump in plain sight, all we had to do was stay focused and be sure to vote. Right? Blue wave? Democrats would take back the Senate? Joseph Biden would win such a slam dunk that the Republican Party would limp away and disband? Two weeks ago, a lot of people thought so. I lived in Texas for the first quarter century of my life, then eight years in one of the most remote, rural parts of that state. Until I moved here, Louie Gohmert was my representative. I was, and am, a Southern Baptist. If that’s all you know about me, I sound like a Trump voter. I’m not. But I am very bilingual. I’ve also spent a little under half my life teaching communication to college students, including classes about listening, conflict management, argumentation and the lifespan of relationships. Some of those lessons fit this moment. First, we don’t have a content problem: We have a relational problem. I know the same as everybody that Trump lies unashamedly in plain sight. Doesn’t matter. Fact-checking him won’t cost him any supporters. And I’m as horrified as anyone by voter suppression as a strategy. But when a big segment of the population copes with crippling fear by turning to the cohesive group that welcomes them, it’s easy for them to want only their votes to count and nobody else’s. And when unreasoning terror is what underlies a wish, flimsy excuses for its fulfillment become persuasive. You’ve talked yourself into believing things that didn’t stand up to scrutiny because you wanted them to be true. It’s not a Republican thing; it’s a human thing. When anyone thinks their solidarity as a member of a besieged group is all that stands between them and disaster, then loyalty will crush principle without a moment’s discomfort. That’s also a human thing. Second, we are following the same pattern they are, and that makes us part of the problem. Now, it’s not in the same context. I have in mind the Republican position on abortion, which white evangelicals (like me offered as the chief reason they supported Trump. I’ve understood for years the difference between, on the one hand, wanting to reduce the number of abortions that happen, and, on the other, lashing out in fury against abortion. The steps in pursuit of those two goals have virtually no overlap. But all the mocking of Trump voters is the exact same mistake. Every time we parody something Trump or a Trump supporter says, we give voice to our outrage, but we do nothing constructive. It is an utterly losing strategy to attack Trump voters, because Trump’s core strategy is to attack. We get torn between the impulse to rise above it and the opposing temptation to respond with mockery, and the tension pulling us in both directions waters them both down. We cannot win a spiral of attacks with Trump, or with any Trump loyalist. They’re better at it than we are, period. That will not change. And if it did change, it would be the most Pyrrhic victory imaginable. So what must we do? We must listen. I’ve been fascinated lately by the work of two professors from Israel, a country with some experience in trying to unsnarl stubborn knots of hatred. Avraham Kluger, a business professor at Hebrew University, and Guy Itzchakov, a professor of human services at the University of Haifa, have demonstrated in a series of studies that if people speak about their resentments and hostility to a listener who gives them a feeling of safety, they draw on attitude-relevant knowledge to soften and nuance those commitments, and ultimately back away from them. It’s when they feel defensive that they ignore flaws and contradictions in their attitudes, and bear down with all their might. Maybe you’ve seen that exact behavior from a lot of Trump supporters. I certainly have. I can hear people seething at this, saying we shouldn’t have to unilaterally disarm, we shouldn’t have to respond to outrage with patience. And I would refer you to my colleagues in the counseling field who could explain to you that when you get stuck in your proclamations of what should be, you paralyze yourself and stubbornly replay all the broken tactics that keep you mired in your problems. ν Doyle Srader lives in Eugene."
suffolknewsherald_2020_85,"Published 11:14 pm Friday, June 12, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Ariane WilliamsIt is time to confront the past in the present in order to build the whole for the future. Some have become silent, some have become uncomfortable in this new place of voice. When we become uncomfortable, there’s a balance that must take place for us to get into a position of transformation and change. It is time to breathe.As a leader in the educational system, I have always listened to the voices of my students. I allowed them to speak so that I could truly hear who they were in the classroom. After all, I cannot teach them if I do not know them. I cannot teach them, if I fail to acknowledge who they are outside of my classroom. I allowed them to breathe in my classroom no matter the color of their skin. You see, the moments that I understood them were the moments that in silence, they shared their world with me through words, stories, hurt, pain, mistaken identities. It is time to breathe a new thing into the educational system and live in those moments to understand their voices. It is time to breathe.Within the last week, I began to form a new voice. I felt it inside, but I could not articulate it. The other day, I traveled to the grocery store to get some groceries. As I was riding, I started to cry uncontrollably. There was no music. There was no physical person next to me. There was only silence. It was in silence that something became loud to me. It was in silence that the Holy Spirit began to breathe time into me. I felt something deep inside of me that I knew the world could never understand or did not want to understand. The Holy Spirit said, “daughter speak to me.” The pain was like that of contractions trying to birth something new. I saw images of the future in my mind. I felt the pain of the world. Flashes of time with flatlines but then, there was a new beat.Then, there was the question I asked that started it all, “Holy Spirit, how do I get beyond what I have done to get to where I need to be?” He responded with this, “I want you to stand on the voice that I have given to you. I want new voices to be open in the atmosphere, tell my people to go and speak, but be wise.” But where do I go, Holy Spirit? He said, “Your voice will take you to the places where I need you to go.” But will they listen? “Not everyone listened to me, but that did not change my call,” He said to me. He is looking for a unified voice. It is a unified voice that brings change. We must birth new dreams and new visions during this time, and those things set the foundation for change for those that will hear.When I asked Him, “what do I say?” He said, “I have given you a gift that can heal the world, use it, and I will prepare the voice; I will prepare the traveled way.” I have called you during this time. Yes, “you” who are reading these words right now. Now is the time for your call. Now is the time to show examples of change. In my dreams, I saw gardens with words of peace. I saw buildings painted with words of healing. I saw businesses with signs of hope in their windows. I saw little children making bracelets that represented peace. The greatest image that I saw was the one in silence as we all held hands. There were no words spoken, but we understood each other for our differences, but then I woke up and now I’m here in the middle of an empty room ready to breathe. God has already prepared you.

minnpost_2020_151,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“We should be outraged but not surprised.” The death of George Floyd is the latest instantiation of this almost now commonplace expression.Different this time, however, was Tuesday’s early evening protest. I’m referring to the thousands, maybe five, in Minnesota’s largest city who gathered peacefully but determined to vent their anger at the latest outrage on the part of the Minneapolis police force. Though the mainstream media, not surprisingly, focused on the violent acts of anger at the end of the mass mobilization — and since then — the important story is what happened three hours earlier.The mobilization was one of the largest protests against police brutality since the 1992 Rodney King demonstration in the city. For an African-American of my generation, I still marvel at the racially diverse composition of anti-police brutality protests today, virtually absent in the 1960s. Tuesday’s action, like 1992, was in its majority Caucasian.Indisputable is the very different context, one in which state and local authorities feel they have power to command citizens to stay home — the pandemic. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, in fact, said earlier in the day that if masked and “socially distanced” protesters could exercise First Amendment rights — as if we needed his permission.So striking about the protest was how inconspicuous the mayor’s police force was. He clearly had them on a short leash. The masses marshaled themselves — many masks but not a lot of “social distancing.” George Floyd’s death would have made any kind of intervention of the police to enforce the mayor’s latest executive order an even more explosive scenario.What mobilized so many was exactly what happened in 1992: the inhumane behavior of the ruling class’s police — and all captured on camera.All sochillingly on display this timewas Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee wedged in Floyd’s neck. Picture the unforgiving jaws of a cheetah gripping the neck of a just captured gazelle. Treated like an animal by a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force is how George Floyd’s life ended.The almost life-ending treatment of Rodney King provoked mass protests, some of them violent, throughout the country. Some of us knew the same could happen here. We organized to make sure the protest in Minneapolis would be militant but peaceful. Not because we fetishized peace. But because we wanted the largest number of people in the streets — the means by which real change has ever occurred in history.The only immediate solution to such heinous acts by officer Chauvin and his cohorts is to jail police who act like him. As long as municipal authorities are willing to settle such outrages with payments to families of the victims, there is no incentive for the Chauvins and their enablers in district attorney offices and on the police forces to act differently.A week ago, I happily attended, along with 200 other protesters, the Minnesota Nurses Association action outside the Minnesota Capitol to demand more protection for their members. The early evening protest on Tuesday in south Minneapolis was qualitatively different. Thousands who had hunkered down for more than two months came up for air, many disobediently — the biggest progressive action so far anywhere in the United States under the state-sanctioned pandemic lockdown. Having participated in more than four decades of anti-police brutality marches, Tuesday, I argue, was a big deal.Mass protests in the midst of the 1918-1919 influenza scourge, including here in Minnesota, teach that the class struggle doesn’t go away in a pandemic. Minneapolis, May 26, 2020, confirms that truth.August H.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_41,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°As a candidate the previous two years and recently as president-elect, Joe Biden has been unfairly criticized by some in the conservative media as being on the wrong side of the capitalism vs. socialism economic debate.As a candidate the previous two years and recently as president-elect, Joe Biden has been unfairly criticized by some in the conservative media as being on the wrong side of the capitalism vs. socialism economic debate.Unfortunately, these pundits have misunderstood Biden’s message. He does not want to adopt socialist economic policies, but rather is mindful that the private sector will thrive when its underlying political system is based on the rule of law with a functioning democracy.One case in point. “It used to be that corporate America had a sense of responsibility beyond just CEO salaries and shareholders,” Biden told The Wall Street Journal last month. “Corporate America has to change its ways. It’s not going to require legislation. I’m not proposing any.”That statement is very much in line with the view of 181 chief executives of many of America’s largest companies, who in 2018 overturned a 22-year policy statement that held a corporation’s principal purpose was to maximize shareholder returns.Acting on behalf of the Business Roundtable, an association of major corporations, they adopted a new “Statement of Purpose of a Corporation” declaring that companies should not only serve their shareholders but also deliver value to their customers, invest in employees, deal fairly with suppliers and support the communities in which they operate — and our country.While this statement reflects support for a much-needed new approach to defining a corporation’s purpose, it does not go far enough. I believe the president-elect’s message is that there is a role — indeed a responsibility to our country — for the business community to take concrete steps to shore up a democracy that has been under continued assault for the past four years.When too many of our political leaders fail to address the dangers to American democracy, then another group must step forward to safeguard it. The business community is a group with a major stake in having a healthy governing system. And so it should confront the reality that our public sector has become so polarized and dysfunctional that it’s endangered both our democracy and the underpinning of our economy.That’s because, once confidence in our democracy is eroded, there’s a very real possibility of losing our economic and commercial well-being.I believe that if Biden would reach out to these business leaders he would have a welcoming and enthusiastic partner for the repairing of our democracy.Business leaders recognize the loss of trust in America by our allies.They have no doubt had to repeatedly apologize for the embarrassments of the Trump administration and understand our dysfunctional political system is not good for their business.Surely the corporate bosses join top government officials in recognizing that nations with dysfunctional governments and political systems are called banana republics for a reason.They are not democracies. And they are not home to any corporate headquarters.Tom Coleman was a Republican congressman from Missouri from 1976 to 1993.

minnpost_2020_61,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Even with the unprecedented amount of media coverage demanded by these most troubled times, I feel that an injustice done to aspects of the legacy of world-renowned scientist and humanitarian Norman Borlaug merits attention. The offender is a recently produced PBS “American Experience” documentary film (“The Man Who Tried To Feed The World — A Tale of Good Deeds and Unintended Consequences” about the late Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Borlaug, the University of Minnesota’s most highly acclaimed alumnus. Not to be consigned to the dustbin of history any time soon, the film is available online and on DVD.I feel this documentary does portray admirably the “good deeds” of Norman Borlaug the person, agricultural scientist, educator, diplomat/advocate, and incomparable humanitarian. It commendably recounts his unrelenting scientific and political battle against world hunger which, along with substantial contributions by his teams of scientists (the film neglects to say many from the U of M and farmers, is said to have saved a billion lives.In contrast, unfortunately, in my view the film’s characterization of the “unintended consequences” of Borlaug’s legacy of Green Revolution aftereffects is starkly unbalanced. It gives almost exclusive attention to very negative detractors. It is understandable to acknowledge the controversy surrounding Borlaug’s legacy — but one should do so in a fair way, also presenting his advocates’ side in the debate.Right from the get-go in the program’s introduction, very devastating statements are made by the narrator and others — “…unleashed vast, turbulent forces … enormous social upheaval … huge environmental damage.”In the introduction’s most damning statement of all, Professor Raj Patel, a long-time Borlaug critic, tells viewers, “It’s not any credit to the Nobel Prize that Norman Borlaug got it.” These harshly accusatory remarks lingered for this viewer as the film proceeded.As the film does unfold, nowhere do we hear from any of the multitude of eminent scholars and other commentators globally who are Borlaug advocates and have very different, much more positive perspectives than the critics. This is especially true of their view of the environmental and societal impacts of the Green Revolution, the focus for much of the criticism. These supporters include prominent scientists at, of course, the U of M, also Cornell and Harvard universities, the National Academy of Sciences and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to name just a very few. (What are the bona fides of the critics Societal changes brought about by the Green Revolution denounced as “enormous social upheaval” also have advocates who find positives in these changes. Those who argue that greater urbanization is to mankind’s benefit, including environmental benefit, point to the Green Revolution as contributing to this process. Again, nothing about this perspective is in the film.And perhaps most inexplicably, it is omitted that, in the first decade of the 2000s, when in his late 80s and 90s still engaged in life-saving efforts traveling the globe — and having been subjected to the rebukes from some circles for over 35 years — the lifetime achievements of Borlaug’s body of work were recognized with this nation’s highest science and civilian honors: the National Medal of Science, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Public Welfare Medal (the most prestigious award given by the National Academy of Sciences . He is the only person in history to have earned these awards along with the Nobel Peace Prize and Presidential Medal of Freedom. And, over his career he received honorary doctorates from more than 50 universities and colleges around the world.This, then, is the person of unparalleled acclaim whose critics assail his accomplishments as ultimately wreaking havoc on the world. Those most notable entities cited above seemed not to have been persuaded by the naysayers’ arguments. Or perhaps they concluded simply that saving a billion lives outweighed all other considerations. One might have thought that this unprecedented recognition in the twilight of his remarkable career would indicate that Borlaug had prevailed, and the critics would be quieted. But no, almost 11 years after his death we have PBS resurrecting the negative attacks — and doing so essentially without presenting compelling counter-perspectives by any of the scores of eminent Borlaug supporters who could do so, including those noted here. I join several other reviewers in concluding that this is a “glaring failure” of the film, a film that is now online for the ages.Don Henry, Ph.D., is a retired psychologist/administrator/stay-at-home dad, an alumnus of the University of Minnesota, a native of Cresco, Iowa (where Borlaug went to high school , and a resident of St. Paul."
suffolknewsherald_2020_201,"Published 5:33 pm Friday, October 9, 2020ByStaff ReportsThe more than 100,000 residents in the Western Tidewater Health District owe a debt of gratitude to a small, select group of 200 — the volunteers of the Western Tidewater Medical Reserve Corps.These are people who decided they couldn’t just stand by without doing anything to help fight the spread of coronavirus. Knowing they were putting themselves at risk of contracting the virus due to increased contact with others, they signed up to help with things like running drive-through testing sites so that health department employees could return to regular duties or do other behind-the-scenes work, and so that the health department would not have to pay thousands to another group to do the work.Many of them have health care experience, but some do not. They come from all different walks of life, but they clearly have one thing in common: caring for their fellow people.Sandra Ruiz and Robin Jones are two of the 200, and they talked recently about what it was like to make that decision.“I just couldn’t stay home doing nothing,” Ruiz said.Jones said the health care profession never really leaves you: “It’s just having something to do and helping other people. If you’re in health care, you’re there for the people. When you’re retired, you don’t really retire.”The Medical Reserve Corps is not a new invention for the COVID-19 virus. The local MRC was formed in September 2003, only two years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that spurred the development of Medical Reserve Corps units across the country.In certain times past, membership in our local Medical Reserve Corps was slim, and active participation by the membership was slimmer still, a frustration to past coordinators. However, we are happy to see its numbers and participation boosted, if only because of the attention brought upon the need for medical volunteers thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.This excellent group is helping the Western Tidewater Health District weather the storm, and we could not be more grateful.For more information about the Medical Reserve Corps, contact Connor Smith at 757-514-4768 or email westerntidewater@vamrc.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_18,"Everyone now wants to say Black journalists matter. But what does it look like to show that you mean it?Earlier this month, I became theonly Black female writerat a publication I work for. My former editor and another Black female writer recently left because they were unhappy. That brought the total number of Black people in the newsroom from eight to six. This, while people were taking to the streets nationwide to protest for equality for Black lives. The timing couldn’t have been worse — but it was no coincidence.You don’t get down to one Black female writer, nor lack diversity, by accident. It happens from conscious decisions by white executives and editors who exercise the privilege of only hiring and promoting people who look like them. I’ve seen the scenario play out many times.I once interned for a TV station where, despite my solid performance, I was told there was no budget to hire me. I begged to stay as a contractor, figuring I just needed to prove myself to earn a permanent place. I continued earning slightly more than minimum wage for strong work, taking shifts no one else wanted. A month later, my white male editor hired a young white woman in the role he’d claimed he had no budget for. The editor said she reminded him of himself when he was a young reporter, and wanted to groom her. To add insult to injury, while I continued as an underpaid contractor, I had to listen to her complain about my dream job. I was so scarred by the experience I took a corporate job and stopped writing altogether.Only by chance did I find myself back in a newsroom six years later. So many other Black journalists never do. They give up dreams of writing stories that matter because conditions in many newsrooms are too oppressive to overcome. I mourn for Black reporters and editors who’vehad it much worsethan I did.Leaving is no saving grace. Those of us who leave get to look out at a media landscape of publications equally fraught with racism. Where shall we go? To a place wherebuildings matter, too? WhereTom Cotton’s perspective is thought valuable enough to endanger Black lives?Then when we stay, Black reporters often carry survivor’s guilt. We reason that the conditions don’t need to be perfect; at least we have a paycheck, a platform. But that’s no longer enough.Too often, publications that do hire Black journalists only hire a few, who get propped up to signal representation when, in reality, we account for a tiny fraction of the organization. Being among those chosen few is a privilege and a prison. I feel at once honored to have a platform, and guilty I was chosen while so many others were not. I feel annoyed when issues about my community arise and I am not asked to help cover them, yet tokenized if I am singled out for that coverage. This is only true because there aren’t enough Black journalists in the room. If there were, I wouldn’t have to fret over every assignment.“Everybody supports a cause until it’s their turn to step up.”For media outlets with some diverse representation, it probably hurts to know their version of doing good is still not good enough. It probably feels daunting to imagine letting go of some white staff to build more diverse newsrooms. But when you’re privileged, equality feels like oppression.Many white leaders in media have been quick to issue statements of solidarity with the Black journalists speaking out. Everyone now wants to say Black journalists matter. But what does it look like to show that you mean it? Everybody supports a cause until it’s their turn to step up.I ask newsroom leaders: What are you willing to personally sacrifice to diversify? Are you willing to give up your spot to let a Black editor or reporter in? Would you sacrifice a portion of your salary to fund a Black reporter’s job?I, for one, would love to see some well-meaning white executives and editors put their words to action. Systemic racism in America’s newsrooms is not a problem Black people created. It’s not a problem we should have to fix.QueenMuse is a freelance writer with an MA in strategic communication from La Salle University, where she is a visiting assistant professor of communication.thequeenmuse.com"

Women filling government’s top jobs is inching ever closer to becoming simply the norm.What matters about Yellen — born and bred in Bay Ridge, Jewish daughter of a schoolteacher and doctor, valedictorian at Fort Hamilton High — is that she is a brilliant economist and public policy tactician, a believer in aggressive government intervention who knows how to move both fiscal and monetary levers to goose business expansion and job growth.She will have to draw on that expertise immediately to help craft and champion robust stimulus measures that can get an economy walloped by a historically horrible pandemic, in which millions remain unemployed, back on solid footing.“There is a huge amount of suffering out there,” Yellen said in late September. “The economy needs the spending.” Amen; this is no time for handwringing about deficits and debt.Though Yellen hails from the left side of the ledger ideologically, she is more opportunistic than doctrinaire, and more power to her.A few years ago, progressives may have thralled to Elizabeth Warren’s inquisition of Yellen for supposedly having done too little to lay the groundwork for the breakup of big banks.Today, out-of-work Americans don’t have the luxury of resting on easy ideology.They need pragmatic plans to rescue sectors knocked flat on their backs.They need aid rushed to cities and states — like Yellen’s hometown, New York — and help for renters soon to be on the business end of eviction orders.In tapping Yellen, Joe Biden enlists a battle-ready economic general to develop and execute strategies equal to the national crisis.

We believe such reform to be the appropriate reaction, rather than abolishing law enforcement, as more extreme voices are advocating. We have faith that police brutality can be rooted out of a justice system with far more good actors than bad ones.But the bad actors with badges have shown that they can inflict immeasurable damage.When our sisters and brothers flinch and fear for their lives when they see blue lights behind them, change needs to come. When our jails are disproportionately filled with black men and women, change needs to come. When a lack of access to health care means a larger percentage of African Americans die from coronavirus than any other demographic, change needs to come.We’ve been heartened to see law enforcement officials in many communities standing in solidarity with their neighbors.

minnpost_2020_147,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Once again, the FBI has been called on to answer questions surrounding the death of a black man at the hands of police. This time the request comes from Minneapolis, where an officer has been charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd on an early summer evening at the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue South.As theMapping Prejudice Projectshows, Minneapolis has a deep history of structural racism.Structural racism, not the individual actions of “rogue” officers, perpetuates police brutality against unarmed citizens.The Minneapolis Police Department has served as a bulwark of the racism that suffuses the city it is sworn to serve. George Floyd is the latest in a long line of victims.In 1968, police brutality against Native Americans in Minneapolis sparked theAmerican Indian Movement, which launched community patrols to provide protection from local law enforcement officers. African-Americans protected themselves in similar ways,establishing the Soul Force.In the 1980s, police attacks on gay men prompted protests against the department’s vice squad.This resistance grew as violence continued. In 2015, it was invigorated by thepolice shooting of Jamar Clark. In 2017, a diverse coalition of community members came together to issue a150-year “performance review” of the department that called for a “police-free” city.Yet a more diverse rank-and-file has failed to transform the Minneapolis Police Department. New leadership has not been able to dilute the influence of the Police Officers Federation. In 1972, the Federation negotiated its first contract with the city even as its former president served as mayor. Charles Stenvig won election in 1969 after vowing to“take the handcuffs off the police”in the wake of the uprising on Plymouth Avenue. In 1971, voters re-elected Stenvig by an overwhelming margin — rejecting the effort to address the racial divide led by his opponent, African-American civil rights leader W. Harry Davis.Stenvig helped to embed the Federation within the police department and city politics. In the years since, the union won significant victories for its rank-and-file members. But it has done little to help the department shed its reputation for racism. The current union president is part of a motorcycle club whosemembers have been accused of displaying white supremacist symbols. That same officercourted controversy in October 2019when he appeared on stage at the Target Center with President Donald Trump, who condemned immigration policies that brought“large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia.”The speedy termination and investigation represent a long-fought-for victory. This is the outcome desired by at least three generations of community organizers and reformers.What next An intense struggle between the police union, on the one hand, and the mayor and the police chief and community organizers and citizen leaders, on the other.This struggle will stretch well beyond 2021, when the mayor faces re-election. It will define this so-called liberal city’s future and provide the city a reckoning with a profoundly racist past and present. The stakes couldn’t be higher.

minnpost_2020_98,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .While the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the United States (due to the number of cases in the states of Florida, Arizona, Texas, and California once again, the legislators on Capitol Hill are scratching their heads over whether to put forward a second stimulus package. Yes, the U.S. might be in need of a second one.The primary purpose of a stimulus package is to keep the economy afloat. Stimulus operates on both sides of the market — the demand side and the supply side. On the supply side are the businesses. The mechanism of the fiscal stimulus is to provide the businesses with the money, so that they are able to keep their businesses up and running (in turn the workers will be able to keep their jobs . By contrast, you can directly give the money to consumers (or workers and affect the demand side of the market. The U.S. CARES Act has undertaken both supply-side and demand-side stimulus. However, there are critics of both types of policy.The trickle down criticism:If stimulus is provided to the employers (with the idea that if the businesses survive, so will your paycheck , the employees might only get the crumbs of the whole pie (and that only at the discretion of the employers by the time it reaches them. Further, the employers are not bound to keep the workers on their payroll (they can lay off/furlough workers to minimize the loss if they want . In fact American Airlines and Delta Airlines laid off workers after receiving the aid from the governmentThe direct stimulus criticism:If the stimulus is given directly to workers, they might slow down finding new jobs (those who lost jobs or might skip work (those who kept their jobs . They have a higher reservation wage. Reservation wage is a concept used by economists to depict the lowest wage at which an individual is willing to work for pay. There are evidences that unemployment benefits indeed discourage workers to look for work.Both sides of the argument are fair and valuable from the economic perspective. Those, in fact, are the points of argument, for instance, regarding the second stimulus check or any other fiscal stimulus. The Republicans are holding off on a second stimulus package, while the Democrats want to expand the package even more than the first one. Let’s postpone that argument for another day and instead have a look into the numbers.Of the $2.3 trillion package, over half of it was acquired by businesses ($600 billion to the large cap businesses and $600 billion to the small businesses . Only $610 billion was sent to households (a $1,200 check given to American individuals whose yearly income is less than $75,000 (phases out by $99,000 .The concern is that while the owners of businesses (employers are getting a big-money backup even if they fail (over and over , the poorer of the society remain at the back of the line (looking up to the government to get the assistance they require to survive . This has happened before, in the 2007-2008 recession, when Wall Street companies received mostly what they required from the government. The result was widening inequality.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, income inequality in the U.S. has hit its highest point, 48.6%, in 2018. The top 1% of the households in the U.S. earn about 50% of the overall household income. To understand the extent of inequality, the U.S. ranks 4thout of 37Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD nations, led only by Chile, Mexico, and Turkey.The top quintile of U.S. households has consistently taken the larger share of the country’s total income. Income disparities are so heavily tilted that the top decile of the U.S. population now earns nine times as high as the bottom nine deciles. Over the last 50 years, middle-class incomes have grown at a slower rate than upper-tier incomes. The richest 0.1% earn 196 times as much as the bottom 90%, according to Inequality.Org. In fact, among all the G7 nations, income inequality in the U.S. is the highest, according to data from the OECD.Fiscal stimulus works as a positive external shock to the stock of resources a household holds. With the fiscal stimulus being heavily tilted toward the big business owners, during this recession as well as the last one, the resources are not evenly distributed. If each recession causes such a phenomenon, the inequality situation soon might be out of control.I am not arguing that the big businesses should not be receiving any aid at all. They definitely should, as they produce the jobs and keep the economy running. The argument is to find a middle ground where the workers will benefit as well. It is not fair that the big companies will get the government aid only to lay off more workers, but to keep the million-dollar paychecks of the CEOs (and other executives . Nor it is fair that the businesses will use the recessions to only maximize the benefit of their owners. If recessions hurt, everyone should carry the burden together. It should not be at the cost of the workers (and their generations after .Money begets money. In the United States, if your parents are poor, you are most likely to be a poor person, and vice-versa. If you are poor because you were born poor, then it is economically unjust. Society has responsibilities toward each individual, providing an equal opportunity (in terms of acquiring labor market skills . If unable to do so, it is a social (market failure.With the current pandemic scenario and the stimulus package, it is difficult to imagine that the U.S. is going in the right direction in terms of ridding inequality. As a matter of fact, a $1,200 check to the bottom quintile as opposed to multimillion-dollar tax breaks (as well as other government aids to the richer crust of the society will only worsen the situation and divide the country (at least economically further. The result would be a group of individuals who lag much further behind their richer counterparts.Inequality became inevitable long ago; now it might soon become invincible.Yasin Arafat is an assistant professor of economics at College of Saint Benedict | Saint John’s University.

eugeneweekly_2020_26,"We ve got issues. Quietly and with the necessity borne of the pandemic season, 30 unhoused individuals took up residence in tents and tarped structures on the edge of Westmorland Park, just east of the Albertsons at 18th and Chambers. As near-by neighbors, we welcomed this community, helped with food and supplies, and enjoyed spending time with its residents. We were happy to provide them with Sanipac bins and removal services. A handwashing station and portable toilet were placed there by other groups. With access to a grocery store, the West Eugene bike path, and bus lines, it seemed an ideal location for folks experiencing hardship. We hoped the encampment might remain throughout the duration of the COVID-19 threat, when sleep-in-place measures might be safely lifted. Coincidently, most of us recall the chaos and crime which assaulted our city over the weekend of May 29-31. Several businesses in the Jefferson Park area were broken into by vandals and rampant looting of property was the result. Members of the Eugene Police Department worked long hours to curtail, and then prevent further destruction of city and private property. Their work and its leadership were extremely valuable. But there is a sad irony here, which brings us back to the eviction of unhoused people in Eugene and elsewhere in the county. Just as the looting along 7th Avenue was horrifying and heartbreaking to so many, it is no less disturbing to us when temporary sleeping quarters are forcibly closed by civic and police action, with residents scattering to places unknown. It happens whenever law enforcement officers receive a complaint about tents being pitched in their vicinity. When the city acts on these complaints, the unhoused must pack up their belongings and evacuate, leaving behind what cannot be readily carried. These possessions are, like all of ours, things that make daily life a little easier, more comfortable, and more beautiful. Those living next to Albertsons placed potted flowers, welcome mats, colorful fabrics and prayer flags around their habitations. On Wednesday morning, June 10, at the field near Albertsons, Public Works crews and police arrived to carry out eviction orders. Residents gathered up as many of their belongings as they could. Whatever they could not fit into their backpacks or bike trailers was picked up and hauled away to be stored or disposed of. This may not seem like looting to those of us who live safely and securely. But gathering up what poor people are unable to carry is, in fact, seizing their personal property. It is true that Eugene City Ordinance 4.815 makes sleeping outdoors illegal. The ordinance was especially enforced during the 1970s, when outdoor rock concerts attracted large numbers of people, many of whom camped wherever they could. Times have changed. But the ordinance, despite current homelessness and COVID crises, remains in effect. Not only is camping prohibited, but the city neglects to provide toilet facilities, handwashing stations, trash containers and picnic tables in public spaces and along well-traveled corridors. Furthermore, small storage lockers for valuable items and legal papers are unavailable. This discriminating ordinance needs to be changed, amended or legally set aside until local lawmakers are committed to safeguard the well-being, rights and property of people experiencing homelessness. We blame neither the police nor sheriffs for this dilemma. As we have witnessed, officers often, though not always, try to show some compassion and restraint. They do not make the laws. On occasions when they’ve sought to delay or mitigate their actions, they have our respect. The question we all should be asking is: why does the burden of a camping ban live on well past its sunset years? In other words, why does the city continue to enforce the dismantling of property and of lives, especially now? It’s time for the compassion, creativity, skill and will of our policymakers to supersede the current, excessive, and expensive practice of social eviction and endangerment, and the physical and psychological looting of our fellow citizens. We urge both city and county:Pleaseuse your experienced staffing to set up a program that addresses immediate outdoor sheltering needs, not just midterm TAC Report strategies. It will save you tens of thousands of dollars, relating to police, legal, jail, emergency medical, and eviction expenses. Meanwhile the field next to Albertsons has been cleared and mowed, nearly all vestiges of our unhoused neighbors’ presence there removed—except for the ghosts of what was, and still is, possible. That is, if only we muster the leadership, the collective will and capacity for mercy and true justice. As has been said too often, we can and must do better. Other university towns have. In closing we cite this verse from an ancient source: “Will you be aligned with leaders who legitimize harm by statute?” (Psalm 94:20 Wayne Martin and Sara Burant live in the Jefferson West Neighborhood of Eugene."
minnpost_2020_77,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesotans should be proud and heartened by Gov. Tim Walz’s call to action to reform policing in Minnesota. Conversely, we should also be ashamed and angered by some legislators’ refusal to seriously discuss police reforms with the governor.Equally distressing are the responses from the Minneapolis and St. Paul police unions, which try to deflect blame on others rather than acknowledge their part in fanning the flames of community unrest.An overwhelming majority of research has found that both systemic and individual racial biases operate against African-Americans and other people of color in police departments nationwide. In Minnesota, data from the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD , the Minnesota Historical Society, and the University of Minnesota outline racial disparities in policing here. For example, MPD statistics indicate that officers use force against Black people seven times more frequently than against whites, even though Blacks constitute only 20 percent of the city population, and were engaged in behaviors similar to their white counterparts when stopped by police.In addition to the irreparable loss of life and injuries to victims and their families, police misconduct costs Minnesota taxpayers millions of dollars each year. All Minnesotans, no matter their race, ethnicity or other status, pay when police wrongfully injure or kill members of the public. From 2007 to 2017, Minnesota cities and counties paid out $60.8 million for police misconduct claims. Further, $12 million of that $60.8 million came from Greater Minnesota — areas with much smaller populations and far fewer financial resources. About $24 million was paid for 2018 to 2019 (including the $20 million paid to the family of Justine Ruszczyk Damond . Conclusively, it is in everyone’s best interest to reform our police departments.By focusing on the damage caused in the aftermath of demonstrations about George Floyd’s death, rather than the actions of police who fueled the anger and the damage, the Minneapolis and St. Paul police unions appear tone deaf to community concerns about racially biased policing.Despite grudgingly conceding that the lead officer may have been wrong in killing Floyd, the Minneapolis police union absolutely refuses to accept its part in creating and sustaining the police culture that resulted in Floyd’s death, and the subsequent demonstrations and destruction. Instead, the union blames the mayors and the governor. Further, while refusing to address the community’s repeated concerns regarding systemic racial bias, union President Bob Kroll blamed politicians for labeling the union as “racist,” while referring to even the peaceful protests against Floyd’s death as “terrorist movements.”In light of the police unions’ tone-deaf responses, the need for decisive and far-reaching police reform is even more evident.Platitudes and half-step measures have never sufficed to end ongoing, systemic problems and challenges in this country. Indeed, only bold, courageous, and decisive steps — designed to get to the heart of the problem – have resulted in meaningful change. This was true when President Abraham Lincoln signed the 13thAmendment freeing slaves, and when President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented the New Deal during the Great Depression.In this same spirit, it will take significant amendments to the Peace Officer Standards and Training Act, as well as to the Public Employees Labor Relations Act, in order to affect meaningful reform of Minnesota policing. These amendments should include:While I acknowledge that Minnesota police departments must undergo tremendous legislative and cultural reforms to stop their racially disparate practices, I also acknowledge that competent, caring officers provide a valuable, necessary service to the public. Their work is mentally and physically demanding, often frustrating and dangerous; they see the worst of human nature daily. I say this not as any excuse for bad behavior — there is no excuse for the killing of George Floyd, or Philando Castile, or for the injuries and pain of countless other victims of police brutality — but as an observable truth regarding policing work. In light of these considerations, Minnesota must find ways to support the many deserving officers who serve and protect our communities and understand the need for change — perhaps through paid periodic sabbaticals in the communities they serve, and back-up assistance from other professionals when they answer calls for mental health crises and domestic disputes.Minnesota legislators should act immediately to reform policing in our state. Such action would benefit Minnesota’s African-American communities and other communities of color, who have suffered disproportionately due to police misconduct; Minnesota taxpayers, who must pay the hefty bills for police misconduct; and the competent Minnesota police officers who serve us. Those legislators who fail to act should be voted out of office.Constance Tuck Brown is a former chair of the St. Paul Police Civilian Internal Affairs Review Commission (PCIARC ."

minnpost_2020_110,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Heehee, Otis farted,” my son said during a Monday morning online meet with his fifth-grade class. I wondered out loud what Otis’ problem was. “Otis is my teacher’s baby, Mom.” Well, I’m a jerk. I went over to wave at baby Otis, who was blithely sitting on his mom’s lap as he apparently does most school days, and sat nearby listening to his mama lead class through the trials and tribulations of another online school day.Gone are the old days of wondering if our teachers lived in the elementary school and slept in their classrooms. Social media had already torn holes in our facades, but 2020 tore them to the ground along with monuments and statues, baseball team mascots, libraries and police stations.This month I lost a monument of my own – my mentor and teacher, Joseph Epstein – who declined to wait for the rope and took down his own statue by writing a Wall Street Journal op-ed (Dec. 11 in which he referred to Dr. Jill Biden as “kiddo” (she is 69 and suggested she “might drop the ‘Dr.’ ” title. “ ‘Dr. Jill Biden’ sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic,” he wrote, as her doctorate is not in obstetrics but in education.Ostensibly, Epstein is bemoaning the practice of universities awarding doctorates rather too freely in subjects other than medicine, although history tells us this was the norm for centuries; however, his tone implies there is more at issue: “Forget the small thrill of being Dr. Jill, and settle for the larger thrill of living for the next four years in the best public housing in the world as First Lady Jill Biden.”Epstein was my adviser and closest writing mentor at Northwestern University in the late 1990s. When I saw the byline under the Wall Street Journal op-ed, I waited a day before confirming that this Joseph Epstein was, indeed, the teacher I had adored. Since then I’ve struggled to reconcile my memories of him with the misogynist tone of his writing in the WSJ.Epstein was a tough but supportive professor in my small creative writing cohort, and a kind adult presence in my life as I balanced the demands of two degrees. He worked with me during the writing process for my junior year novella and attended my senior recital a year later. He was often in the audience for my concerts at the School of Music. We kept in touch for a while after I graduated and went on for my Master of Music degree and doctorate. But since it’s been a while since we spoke, I thought I might catch him up here.Mr. Epstein, my doctoral degree was pretty rigorous, actually, even without taking into account the outside challenges posed by my gender, with which Dr. Biden is certainly familiar. I defended my dissertation with an infant in a car seat next to me, and walked for my doctorate with a 9-month-old waiting at home. Did I tell you the story of when I flew to an interview for a tenure-track position at 33 weeks pregnant I’ll never forget the look on the committee member’s face when I came down the elevator to meet him in baggage claim. No, you’re right, I didn’t get that job. I have been pretty successful as a musician, though — did I ever write you about the concerts I’ve played with a crying infant in the wings, or the rehearsals with a baby on a knee Oh, and here’s my favorite accomplishment: I delivered my two babies drug-free and stone-cold sober. Not bad for a kiddo like me!2020 left precious few heroes on the pedestal, and life teaches you that it’s unfair to put them up there in the first place. But consider Baby Otis and his Mama, who have no choice but to reveal their humanity to us, baby farts and all. If all monuments must fall, I’m glad they’re still standing.Dr. Rena Kraut is a classical clarinetist and the executive director of theCuban American Youth Orchestra."
minnpost_2020_20,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Today isWomen’s Equality Day, and the 100th anniversary of theformal adoption of the 19th Amendmentinto the U.S. Constitution. As the League of Women Voters of Minneapolis, a direct descendant of the national organization that led the battle for a woman’s right to vote, commemorates this hard-fought achievement, we recognize that racism both permeated and fractured the suffrage movement. As we aspire to better reflect the diversity of our city, we acknowledge there are scars from the past we must continue to heal.In 1866, a powerful group of abolitionists (including founders Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Frederick Douglass formed an alliance shortly after the end of the Civil War. Their goal was universal suffrage and they were committed to securing voting rights for all American citizens irrespective of color, race or sex. Unfortunately, congressional politics resulted in a watered-down version of what would become the 15th Amendment, ensuring the right to vote not be denied “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” The word “sex” was omitted.As a result, one faction of outraged suffragists refused to support the proposal, while another was willing to advance the rights of Black men first, trusting women’s rights would soon follow. This rift was deepened and racism laid bare when Cady Stanton, who opposed the compromise, expressed her indignation this way: “Think of Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not know the difference between a monarchy and a republic, who never read the Declaration of Independence or Webster’s spelling book, making laws for Lydia Maria Childs, Lucretia Mott, or Fanny Kemble.”The schism exposed deep-seated racist and classist attitudes that would persist within the movement long after the founding mothers. Sixty years later, suffragists betrayed their Black sisters in an effort to win support for the 19th Amendment by appealing to the bigotry of lawmakers. They employed a “Southern strategy” that would allow states to implement suffrage according to their own cultural norms; a dog whistle for Black exclusion.From 1920 until passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1964, Blacks were systematically and intentionally disenfranchised. States enacted policies designed to suppress Black voter participation, such as literacy tests and poll taxes. Blatant intimidation in the form of humiliation and violence, including lynching, was used against Blacks who dared try to exercise their right to vote. Not until the Voting Rights Act prohibited some discriminatory practices and scrutinized the behavior of particularly bad actors in the South did Black voter turnout increase. Despite the obstacles that still persist, Blacks vote at a higher rate than any other minority group and, in 2012, surpassed white voter turnout for the first time.This year, the League of Women Voters Minneapolis is ramping up our voter outreach and education, partnering with community organizations and focusing on areas of the city disproportionately impacted by the civic unrest after George Floyd’s death. In response to COVID-19, we’re advocating for simplified, mail-in balloting options for all.The League of Women Voters of Minneapolis is not your grandmother’s League. We are still the nonpartisan education and advocacy group committed to empowering voters, but with a commitment to identifying racism and dismantling policies that suppress non-white votes.Learn more about our workand join us.Anita Newhouse is the president of the League of Women Voters Minneapolis."
minnpost_2020_232,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The Fair Housing Act, primarily written by our own Vice President Walter Mondale, banned overt segregation in the United States in 1968. Personally, without it I would not have been able to grow up in the neighborhood I did as a Mexican American, given that the house I live in had a racial covenant attached to it in south Minneapolis restricting the purchase of the home to only those of the “Caucasian Race” (to learn more see PBS’ “Jim Crow of the North”and theMapping Prejudice project .However, when President Barack Obama took office, America was arguably more segregated than before.A landmark studycompleted by Harvard professors Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren statistically provided evidence that the ZIP code a child grows up in has a significant impact on their earnings in the future. The study confirmed that the results of segregation have detrimental effects on children who grow up in concentrated areas of poverty, giving urgency to affirmatively further fair housing. Thus, the Obama administration took action, and then-Housing Secretary Julian Castro championed the new AFFH rule.The AFFH rule required HUD-funded entities to use federal and local data to provide an extensive, intensely analytical report on barriers to fair housing called the Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH . This new report expanded what President Bill Clinton created in 1994 called the Analysis of Impediments (AI that required HUD-funded jurisdictions to identify the barriers to fair housing choice.AFH was different from AI because it required the use of data and mapping, and modernized the practice of identifying barriers to fair housing. For decades, HUD-Funded entities have conducted AIs and used the recommendations in those reports to justify investing federal funds to combat racist housing practices. Fair Housing paired testing, for instance, is a practice that would send a Black person and a White person to apply to rent the same unit. If the landlord discriminated, it was documented and could lead to legal action. The AI paved the way for local governments to take real action in dismantling segregation. The AFH from the Obama administration was the next step forward. It required local governments to think deeper about what they can do to integrate their communities.The rule would not have been an end-all, nor would it have (despite what Trump has said changed the suburbs overnight. We do not have enough federal housing dollars to make that kind of dent in the housing market. However, AFFH pushed many fair housing practitioners out of their comfort zone into thinking about how to address these issues of housing, segregation, and poverty not in our limited view of just our city, but a more extensive, regional view.Trump’s elimination of AFFH reporting effectively takes local government out of fair housing action. If local governments have no interest in taking action on fair housing issues, they can do virtually nothing with limited recourse from the federal government and leave just community organizations to bear the brunt of the work. Trump’s tweets, although offensive, were only the tip of the iceberg. In a time when we are facing a looming eviction crisis, increasing housing inequality, skyrocketing rents, unprecedented job losses, and growing segregation, we need AFFH more than ever.Tyler Moroles is the co-chair of the Twin Cities Fair Housing Implementation Council, and he manages the Community Development Block Grant Program for Hennepin County and the County’s fair housing portfolio. He has worked in affordable housing for more than five years. The opinions expressed here are his own and are not a representation of the position of the county nor the FHIC."
philinquirer_2020_44,"That is the best way to ensure our schools can continue providing meals to our neediest students, and that no child goes hungry.Amid all the debate around the coronavirus, there has been at least one area that has received fairly widespread and bipartisan support: the need to ensure our nation’s neediest children do not go hungry as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Unfortunately, due tothe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA and Congress not extending needed regulatory relief to schools, we now face the possibility that tens of thousands of American children could start going without meals in a matter of weeks.Since its establishment in 1946, the federal National School Lunch Program (NSLP has been reimbursing schools for providing needy children with free or reduced-price meals. In recent years, the program has supported nearly 100,000 K-12 schools and close to 30 million children. For many of these children, the meals they are provided at school may be the only healthy and regular meals they receive.Under the NSLP, there are strict regulations around dietary guidelines and where and how food is provided. Schools are required to carefully track distribution to ensure only eligible children receive meals. As schools began closing in mid-March due to the pandemic, the USDA, with the support of Congress, moved quickly to issuewaiversto these regulations to allow schools to provide meals through the agency’s more flexible summer programs.» READ MORE:Number of households with hungry children nearing 14 million, study findsThese waivers have been critical to ensuring that schools can continue to get food to our most vulnerable kids. For example, under the summer program rules, schools have been able to provide no-contact, curbside food distribution to any child under the age of 18, without requiring verification that a child attends the school where the food is being distributed. This has enabled parents with limited means of transportation to visit the closest food distribution site to their home and pick up meals for multiple children, instead of visiting sites across town, depending on where their children are enrolled.Despite the resounding success of these waivers, not all of them have been extended for the 2020-21 school year. If that extension doesn’t come through soon, we may see many children go hungry this fall. At a time when we still face record unemployment, schools are anticipating a significant increase in the number of children in need of this food assistance.While some schools will resume in-person learning, where normal food distribution could theoretically take place, many will not. Other schools will start out in person, but change their status at some point in the fall in response to outbreaks or exposures. Among the more than 400 K-12 school districts across the country where food service is provided by Aramark, where I work, 70% are planning to conduct fully — or partially — remote learning for at least the first six to eight weeks of the fall semester.Returning to the strict regulations of the NSLP right now is creating a logistical nightmare for schools, parents, and children. For schools conducting remote learning and needing to continue with curbside food distribution, school staff will need to maintain a roster of eligible children, determine whether each child is eligible for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, and have the curbside capability to take payments from children when required. In addition to the logistical complexity, these transactions significantly increase the risk of COVID exposure for everyone involved.Even for schools that fully reopen, NSLP regulations will make it difficult for meal providers to offer staggered breakfasts and lunches to help maintain social distancing among students. So the rules will actually discourage full reopening and possibly even increase the chance of a virus outbreak that would force the school to shut its doors once again.» READ MORE:Hunger expected to explode here, throughout America, because of COVID-19We are already starting to see the impact of a too-soon return to NSLP regulations. In a school district near Austin, Texas, which Aramark serves, 54% of the population qualifies for free or reduced-price meals. On a typical school day before the pandemic, we were providing 26,000 meals there. Under the flexible summer program rules in effect since the pandemic started, we were feeding about 8,800 children. With NSLP regulations now back in place, we are only providing meals to about 1,100 children each day, representing less than 10% of the students qualified for free or reduced-price meals. With the need for assistance in Texas steady or on the rise, this can only mean that many children are going hungry.» HELP US REPORT:Are you a health-care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker, or other expert? We want to hear from you.There is a simple solution. The USDA, with thebipartisansupportof Congress, should move forward with extending the NSLP waivers that have worked so well over recent months. That is the best way to ensure our schools can continue providing meals to our neediest students, and that no child goes hungry.Barbara Flanagan is the president ofAramark’s K-12 education division."
suffolknewsherald_2020_20,"Published 5:01 pm Tuesday, August 11, 2020ByStaff ReportsThe COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, but unfortunately, many people are acting like it is.The number of those infected in the Western Tidewater Health District has risen sharply over the last few weeks. The rolling seven-day average of new daily cases was 48 on Aug. 8, even though it has since fallen slightly. The district has had a streak of double-digit numbers of new cases reported every single day since July 7. Of the district’s 2,165 cases reported since late March, nearly a quarter of them have become ill just in the last two weeks.The community spread is significant, and Western Tidewater Health District Director Dr. Todd Wagner is sounding the alarm about what he sees as complacency.According to Wagner, contact tracing investigations in the Western Tidewater Health District continue to show gatherings of family and friends as the predominant cause of community spread.“I still believe there is often a bit of complacency in some of these situations where people may believe that since they know all of those invited/attending, they couldn’t be infected, which we certainly know is not the case,” he said recently.Remember that even though the stay-at-home order is long since lifted, you’re still safer at home. The more people you encounter — whether they’re extended family, old friends or complete strangers — then, theoretically, the greater your chance of catching the virus.Wear a mask everywhere you go, even if you know everyone there. When it comes to gatherings like birthday parties and cookouts, maybe you could just send your regrets or attend virtually. No event is worth your life.Download the COVIDWISE app. The app uses Bluetooth technology rather than GPS tracing to determine if you’ve been near anyone who later voluntarily reports a positive test. When they do, you will get a notification. Armed with that knowledge, you can self-quarantine while you may be contagious, and potentially get tested, so that you won’t infect anybody else if you do in fact have the virus.Attend one of the Western Tidewater Health District’s free testing events coming up this month, even if you don’t feel ill. The concept is similar to the app — if you’re tested and it turns out you’re positive, you can self-quarantine, not infect anybody else, and report your positive test on the app to help stop the spread.Here are the upcoming testing events:On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

For many people, the coronavirus has forced changes in their employment. The Department of Labor advises that whether you are a current job seeker or not, you should take this opportunity to update your resume with your teleworking skills. We may not like this situation of forced adjustments in our work nature. The truth of the matter is that skills that you have acquired have added more to your value in the workplace.Recently, I was reviewing information about a writer’s conference. One of the video advertisements mentioned how much traditional publishing has changed for new writers who submit book proposals for potential publishing. Writing coach Angelo Enos stated, “We are not just writers anymore. We are businessmen, videographers and marketing geniuses all at the same time.” The first part of her statement really resonated with me. How many of us can honestly say that we are just (fill in the blank anymore?Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, our professional and personal roles in life were likely more easily defined. There has been so much intersection of roles and responsibilities lately that one singular title is no longer accurate.I hate resumes. Although I am fully capable of writing resumes, it is not the type of writing that I enjoy. Some say that a good resume tells an interesting story. In my opinion, resumes fall short of presenting the actual person named at the top of them. Past accomplishments listed in bullet fashion emphasizing quantitative highlights are not impressive to me.What does a resume header truly convey in the midst of this coronavirus pandemic? Our resumes as they stand today are false now that this pandemic has changed several of the jobs that we once held or are currently serving. If your header only says one word, such as barista, you are lying. If you are still in the ancient days of using objectives to state your desired job title, I am certain that any role anyone is playing right now is not what they envisioned.Before you become my collective Amen Corner, please know that I am not the enemy of the resume. I am drawing your attention to the expansion that has taken place in our professional development. Be honest. How much have you taught yourself over the past few months? Whose role could you step into right now and likely do a better job than they are? How much grace have you been given to be all that you can be in this season where nothing is guaranteed? You have done it by the grace of God and the allowances of this pandemic.Much of what you have done is not in your job description. That fact should not be used as arms against your employers but rather as credit to your adaptable skill. Look at how well you have managed to pivot in this season. To pivot is an act of acceptance and commitment. Pivoting requires willpower and willingness to have the right perspective during change.Perhaps someone will soon retire the resume and develop a more appropriate narrative of our success. Until then, it is best that your resume is up to date.

Global disruption like the world is currently experiencing presents an opportunity for each one of us to stand up and be on the right side of history. We are grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for public health. At the same time, protesters have taken to the streets to speak out against decades of systemic, pervasive racism.These two issues are deeply connected. It has been well understood that advanced age and preexisting conditions increase the chance of becoming very sick with COVID-19. Initiatives such as theCOVID Racial Data Trackeropened a window into the effect of COVID on communities of color. However, it wasn’t until the CDC’s more comprehensive morbidity and mortality data were made public (after a lawsuit that it became frighteningly clear that vulnerable communities were bearing an undue burden.Again.Looking at 640,000 infections detected in almost 1,000 communities, the data showed that Latinos and Black people werethree times as likely to become infectedwith COVID-19 — and nearly twice as likely to die from COVID-19 — as white people.Despite months of learnings to draw from, testing problems in today’s rapidly expanding list of hot spots reflect a spectrum of failures:Residents ofpredominantly Latino south Phoenixwaited for hours in scorching heat totake a COVID-19 testin June. Despite spiking infections,Sacramento Countyannounced they were closing five coronavirus testing sites in underserved communities due to a growing shortage of testing materials. And Pennsylvania, like many states,continues to struggle with testingand has faced a shortage of supplies and delayed lab test results. Resources for Black communities were falling so short in Philadelphia thatAla Stanford filled a van with tests and administered them — for free— to people lacking access to medical care.COVID-19 is yet another systematic disenfranchisement of Americans of color. This is why we must democratize COVID-19 testing and ensure that communities of color have equal access to health care and knowledge about their health status.Fortunately, we are closer than you might think. One strategy is to adopt the same proven model used to tackle the global HIV/AIDS epidemic: self-testing.» READ MORE:Pa. wants to expand coronavirus testing but faces a shortage of supplies and lab result delays, Wolf and Levine sayRapid self-testing can move the needle by providing tests — and results — to anybody, anywhere, anytime. Self-tests give people a result within minutes, with no instrumentation needed to interpret the results, and no need to transport samples to a lab for processing. Home pregnancy tests may be the best-known example, but self-tests are available for HIV, too.In sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion ofpeople with HIV who knew their statushad almost doubled to 81% between 2015 and 2018, according to a report by the STAR Initiative, UNITAID, and the World Health Organization.The reason? A combination of HIV self-tests that could easily be administered in-home, and the concerted efforts of governments and civil society. Outreach workers literally put kits in their backpacks and distributed them door to door.Rapid self-testing like this could help prevent the spread of COVID amongst our most vulnerable communities in the United States and around the world. Imagine the impact of a test that would not require a trip to a testing site or lab.This vision is already on the way to becoming a reality. For example, scientists at my company are racing to bring a rapid self-test that would confirm active infection by detecting viral proteins (antigens to market by year-end. To date, there are no COVID-19 tests for active infection like this one, which would provide a result at the collection point with no need for an instrument to interpret the results.» READ MORE:Schools can’t reopen safely without better COVID testing for kids, say these Philly pediatricians l Expert OpinionCollaboration between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors can help bring tests like these to scale.

suffolknewsherald_2020_98,"Published 10:37 pm Friday, June 5, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RichardsonIn the words of Frederick Douglass, “Truth is proper and beautiful at all times and all places.” That being said, he was never shy about stating the true causes and the responsibilities on both sides needed to solve America’s problems. In this open letter to my fellow Americans, neither will I.The people of America who currently have the means and the wherewithal to boycott the businesses — the unjust system — lack the conviction. They have left the ones who don’t have the means with no choice but to file in like so many sheep to have their pockets fleeced — I mean, looted!Our criticism of the riots and the rebellion we see in the streets of modern America lacks empathy for the cause. Douglass put it this way: “The thing worse than rebellion, is the thing that causes rebellion.” Some might consider the corporate giants the real looters.Imagine no riots, no looting, no shooting! How? Just one massive unified worldwide boycott of these corporate giants could have produced the same economic effects of the pandemic and street protests combined, without the collateral damage. Unfortunately, living green and shopping local are just fashionable trends, not matters of economic and social justice. We are addicted to the fragile wealth and comfort we have built. While it should have made us more empowered to divest from this corrupt system, instead we continue to support it. We defend it! Comfort and convenience have become the top priorities for the majority of Americans. It is a self-serving attitude that speaks louder than all the other hashtags combined.In 1848, after the 21-month sojourn of escaped slave Frederick Douglass through Ireland and England, a group of whites raised the money to help purchase his freedom. They also raised another $2,500 to help him start his newspaper, The North Star. They also offered him a tantalizing proposition — stay in England. They offered to send for his family and help him get settled in a country where slavery had been abolished. In other words, stay in England and be comfortable.History shows Douglass returned to America and became a leader in the abolition of slavery. What Douglass understood then is no less true today. That kind of comfort is short-lived. The horizontal white flight to re-segregate America is short-term. It is not a solution. Vertical black flight, economically divesting from our own communities, is equally divisive and debilitating. Moving to the suburbs does not make us immune from the collapse of the bottom rung, of the lower caste of people who slaughter, pick, clean, assemble, package and deliver everything we eat and wear.In an 1864 speech titled “A Friendly Word to Maryland,” Frederick Douglass spoke directly to the whites and blacks in the audience. “First to my white friends; so much my white fellow citizens you have done and well done. There is one other thing needed to make your work good and complete. One demands the restoration of all rights. There is however, a class of speakers and writers among you, who seem to distrust your ability to cope with the Negro without special protection. I deny the black man’s degradation is essential to the white man’s elevation. I deny the black man should be tied less he outstrip you in the race for improvement. I deny the existence of any such necessity and affirm that those who allege the existence of any such necessity pay a sorry complement to the race of white people.”Then Douglass turns to the colored people in the audience, many of whom had just arrived in large numbers to Baltimore from Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “Now to my colored friends; I would advise you to stay in the lower counties of Maryland. $150 in the country is better than $400 in the city. For those of you crowding the allies and by-streets of Baltimore, woe betide you. Sad indeed will be your fate. You should stick to your agricultural pursuits and endeavor to buy land. You should be saving your funds and building churches, homes and schools. Let the finger of scorn point to any colored man who refuses to send his children to school.”For the past six years, in the character of Fredrick Douglass and as a self-made historian, I have traveled the country trying to tell the complete historical narrative and help Americans avoid a repeat of a tragic past. I am not alone in this effort to warn Americans. Indifference has a way of finding us and pointing out where we left it. Unfortunately, very few seem to be listening. So knock, knock America! A second civil war is potentially at your front door unless you leave your comfort zone and without delay start agitating for the complete enfranchisement of every American citizen.Nathan M.

minnpost_2020_93,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The more things change, the more the GOP insists on a never-ending assault on the Affordable Care Act. As today’s nationwide COVID-19 count careens toward3 millioncases, President Donald Trump’s quest to end the ACAinexplicably chugs forward. But a recent Supreme Court decision blocked GOP lawmakers’ separate attempt to kill the law. When it ruled against the Republicans, that decision ordered the U.S. to put $12 billion back into the insurance market. How regulators and advocates respond will decide whether those billions stay with insurers or get back to the consumers they were supposed to benefit all along.The springtime court opinion was hardly a page turner. It considered the conflict between the 2010 ACA that said that the government “shall pay” a wonky “Risk Corridor” obligation to insurance companies, and the 2014 appropriations bill that said that “None of the funds made available by this Act” could be used for the Risk Corridor payments. In its ruling against the United States, theSupreme Court confirmedthat “shall” is mandatory even after midterms, so the feds must pay up.That’s how the U.S. came to owe a handful of insurance companies $12 billion.But the ACA did not mandate these payments for the sake of the insurance companies. Its goal of making health care affordable for everyday Americans is right there in the title. So, while the ACA promised Risk Corridor payments to insurers, it did soso that those insurers would pass cost savings to consumers. Congress enforced this goal with a metric termedMedical Loss Ratios.Under the ACA, Medical Loss Ratio provisions require that Individual and Small Group insurance carriers spend at least .80 of every dollar on actual medical claims — not on shareholder dividends, CEO pay, and other overhead. This 80/20 rule prevents price gouging. If an insurer collected $100 million in premiums in a year but only spent $79 million on medical claims, the following year, the insurer would have to pay $1 million back to consumers in individual rebates.This year’s $12 billion Supreme Court decision will swing that 80/20 math. When the U.S. pays the judgment, the insurance carriers will suddenly have a whole lot more revenue than claims. The precise result will be different from carrier to carrier. But the influx of revenue is likely to push medical claims way under the 80% MLR that the ACA requires. To rebalance the ratio, carriers should have to pay the judgment over to policyholders, one overage rebate check at a time.Certainly, Republican-led efforts to abolish the ACA without any replacement for the millions of Americans who depend on it could havecatastrophicpublic-health consequences. But years of GOP work to trip the law over inadequate funding has finally met its match at the Supreme Court. Now it is up to Minnesota’s leaders to ensure that this judgment benefits the consumers the ACA intended to protect.Jessica Intermill is a nationally recognized attorney who was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis when she was seven months pregnant.

When the other board members were given their time to speak on the charges, they also used that time to attack her personally and talk about her prior teaching position, neither of which were included in the charges. When citizens addressed board members, they were reminded not to insult members and show respect. Clearly our board members did not follow their own rules they set forth that night. The chair should have taken control of the meeting and not allowed the personal attacks.I also was surprised when a letter from a previous disgruntled student was allowed to be read at the meeting. I thought if you had something to say to the board, you had to attend the meeting. Mrs. Story was an excellent teacher who only wanted the best for her students. When you take AP and IB classes, you should expect to be challenged. That is the nature of those courses. I also was surprised to find out that board members are expected to vote on items when they are not provided with all the information needed to make an informed decision.Mrs. Story is just trying to inform the citizens, and that should not make the other board members uncomfortable.

suffolknewsherald_2020_123,"Published 9:44 pm Tuesday, May 19, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonThe 2020 pandemic crisis left behind a load of problems as it swept across our country. It also left people thinking about their faith. They recognized the need for help outside themselves.“Believe!” “Have faith!” Two mantras we have seen or heard many times, but the words are meaningless unless there is a greater source to help us. In what or whom is our faith anchored?“Keep the faith” sounds good, but keep what kind of faith? And in what or whom? Is it a generic commodity I unsatisfactorily used in a time past only to find I needed a different formula to help in the present moment? What is faith, and what key unlocks the door to understanding?These words about faith were meant to encourage, but in difficult times, if my faith is only generic, it won’t provide the remedy I need.So where, how, and in what way do we find the kind of faith we need? Thankfully, there is One Who can help us, but on His terms, not ours.I started with what the Scriptures have told us about God. Mark 5:34 and 10:51-52 report that Jesus has shown Himself to us by faith in what He has said and done. He also promised none who come to Him will be “cast out” (John 6:37 . I needed to draw my answers from the Bible’s well of authority if I wanted pure faith.The word faith comes from the Latin fide, and its early significance was likely stronger and pregnant with meaning. Faith was “allegiance to duty or a person, fidelity to one’s promises, sincerity of one’s intentions.”I checked the dictionary definition: “belief and trust and loyalty to God” or “belief in something for which there is no proof.” The writer of Hebrews says, “without faith it is impossible to please God.” People want proof. God is the One we find difficult to prove to others. The person who comes to God must believe that He will reward those who put their faith in Him alone, not in some power outside of what He has told us in the Bible.We may pray and not get an answer, or not the answer we wanted, and then turn against God in unbelief. Isn’t that reducing Him to be only a servant? Making God in our image is idolatry. Believing in some kind of magical power we can command by our actions or words is of no value when we are desperate.We exercise generic faith each day when we push a plug into a wall outlet. We expect it to work because of what electric wiring has made possible. We sit in a chair, expecting it to hold us because of its construction. It is “blind belief” based on experience, ours or that of others. We need to “believe” God and wait for His answer. That is authentic faith.“Believe, have faith, and keep the faith” offer a promise to those who trust God for answers. The true God is listening, but sometimes we are not. The writer of Hebrews also tells us in time of need we can “come boldly before the throne of grace and mercy” and find help (Hebrews 4:16 .Long before COVID-19, James in the New Testament told us to cleanse our hands, and not only our hands but also our hearts. Listening, confessing our sins, and obeying are all needed if we want God to cleanse our land and stop this virus.Myrtle V. Thompson, 92, is a retired missionary, writer, educator and Bible teacher.

minnpost_2020_85,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There is a substantial possibility that any criminal trials of the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in connection with the death of George Floyd on Memorial Day evening will be moved out of Hennepin County. That potential was manifested in remarks by the current presiding judge in Hennepin County, Peter Cahill. At a preliminary hearing a couple of weeks ago, the former prosecutor told the lawyers and their clients that he may change venue because of unfavorable pretrial publicity generated by statements made by high-level officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and, more recently, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo,terming the incident a “murder”and proclaiming the guilt of the chief perpetrator, Derek Chauvin.But the potential for tainting the jury pool is not a one-way street. Comments about the evidence in the case made publicly by two of the defense attorneys earlier this week prompted Judge Cahill Thursday to issue a rarity: a gag order barring further extra-judicial remarks by counsel on both sides of the case, coupled with a repeated threat of moving the case elsewhere to facilitate selection of an unbiased jury.The prospect of changing venue has been raised earlier. Whether Chauvin and the other fired officers can get a fair trial before an unbiased jury in Minneapolis was raised in the immediate aftermath of the horrific incident and their arrests six weeks ago. The inculpatory declarations by the authorities turn that surmise into a realistic possibility for any of the ex-officers whose cases actually proceed to trial, although at least two of them are seeking dismissal without trial. It also is uncertain if any of those who are tried will be prosecuted together or in separate proceedings.A change of venue, transferring trial to a different locality, might be a way to alleviate the potential prejudice hanging over the heads of the officers. But moving the case is fraught with frailties that may make a change of venue more facile than feasible.One limitation is that changes of venue are rarely granted in Minnesota — unlike the federal system, where cases can be shifted from one state to the next, although that, too, is extremely rare. In state court proceedings, the case must be heard in the same jurisdiction where the alleged offense occurred.One of the very few instances in recent memory of a change of venue goes back to the late 1970s, when Marjorie Caldwell was tried for the murder of her mother by adoption, Duluth heiress Elizabeth Congdon, and her night nurse, Velma Pietila, ina sensational casethat was highly publicized throughout the state. The judge hearing the case in Duluth agreed with Caldwell’s counsel that pretrial publicity prevented obtaining justice in that community and, therefore, the case was shifted to Hastings, where Caldwell ultimately was tried and acquitted by a jury drawn from Dakota County. Her husband, Roger, also had his trial moved out of the Port City and transferred to Brainerd. But unlike his ex-wife, he was convicted. However, that determination was reversed by the Minnesota Supreme Court, which ordered a new trial. Ultimately he confessed to the murders in a plea deal that meant he’d serve no more prison time.While changes of venue in the Caldwell cases may have minimized difficulties in finding unbiased jurors, the extraordinary breadth of media coverage of the Floyd death may make it difficult to find jurors anywhere in this state whose views on the officers’ culpability have not formed before trial. Accordingly, moving the case to somewhere outside of the Twin Cities, therefore, might not have much effect in leavening out the jury pool.Another concern if the trial is to be moved is that finding a place for it could be problematic. From the defense standpoint, a jury pool made up of few African-American and other minorities would probably be desirable. But many of the communities that might be logical choices to hold the trial, such as Duluth, Rochester, St. Cloud, or cities of that size, also have sizable minority populations, although certainly not as large as Hennepin County’s. Moving the case to a smaller rural community would probably not be feasible for logistical reasons. The place where the trial is held would have to be able to accommodate a large number of participants, spectators and, of course, an international horde of media. Smaller communities may not have the facilities or capability of hosting such a massive gathering.Furthermore, the farther away the case is moved from the Twin Cities in order to attempt to minimize the impact of the prejudicial pretrial publicity the more the cost and inconvenience would increase. The case would presumably still be heard by Judge Cahill and his staff, who would have to travel and possibly be lodged there, creating additional expenses, not to mention inconveniences imposed upon them in moving the case elsewhere.More significantly, family members and supporters of Floyd, as well as those of the men on trial, all of whom are entitled to attend the trial, would find it logistically inconvenient and costly as well to attend a trial in a faraway place.For these reasons, and myriad others, change of venue may be more superficial than a solution to addressing potential problems in pretrial publicity if and when the ex-cops’ cases go to court.Marshall H.

suffolknewsherald_2020_135,"Published 6:01 pm Tuesday, December 8, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Sherri StoryI have listened to the school board policy committee meeting from Monday, Nov. 30, and one of the policies presented to be changed was regarding time slots allotted for public speaking.School Board policy currently states that 30 minutes are to be reserved for public speaking at the beginning of the meetings, giving up to five minutes for each speaker. As the interest in the School Board business has increased, so has the number of speakers desiring to speak been increasing. In trying to continue to limit this time slot to 30 or 45 minutes, the committee seemed to agree that a limit was necessary in order to get this section of the agenda “over with” in order to move on with the business of the board.I would argue that listening to our stakeholders — the parents, staff and members of the community — is one of the most important pieces of monthly board business. I would also argue that other items that typically fill our agenda should take a backseat to it, not the other way around.Consider the mandate written in the Bill of Rights, Article 1 Section 2 of the Virginia Constitution: that all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the people, that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all times amenable to them.First of all, whatever our power or authority, it is derived from the people and therefore we are to be amenable to them. Some synonyms for amenable are: open, persuadable, responsive and agreeable. Elected officials invested with the trust of the people are therefore to be open, responsive, persuadable and agreeable to listen to the public.Limiting people’s free speech by arbitrarily assigning a time slot on the agenda for the sake of “getting on to some other business of the board” is an inversion of the very mandate we have been given — to be amenable to the people.Secondly, three paragraphs of the Virginia Education Code strongly direct all public school boards of Virginia to involve the public — to hear from them their concerns, their opinion, their advice, their knowledge and their experiences. It is the very essence of school board business.Thirdly, an argument was made for limiting citizens time to speak because there may be children waiting to sing or present something to the board. I would suggest that whenever we invite students to participate, let’s assign them a time slot between 4 and 6 p.m. Let’s put them first. An earlier time slot would also allow them to get home at a reasonable hour.Lastly, I believe we should be more mindful of the time and effort that presenters put into preparing for their presentations before the board — the time it took them to write and rewrite their opinions, the time it took to be put on the agenda, the time away from home to come and speak, and finally the time they spend waiting to be called upon in order to speak. All these efforts demonstrate a good faith effort toward communicating with us.Listening to our citizens should be an imperative part of school board business. It shouldn’t be devalued by restrictive time. Suffolk citizens should never have a sense we are just appeasing them to get onto something else more important in the meeting.Based on these reasons, the only policy change that is justifiable to me is to eliminate the 30-minute arbitrary time limit on public speaking altogether and continue to allow citizens to speak for their five minutes. Citizens are worth our time to listen to what they have to say.If the overall length of meetings is a concern, we should look for other things in the agenda to cut or move around. Or, maybe it is time the Suffolk School Board starts meeting twice a month like every other school board in the area.The last thing I believe an elected body should do is limit the public from speaking by manipulating the numbers to fit into a limited time slot.Rather, let us do whatever it takes to be amenable.Sherri Story is the School Board representative for the Chuckatuck Borough.

They are dead wrong and have led to poor health and in some cases, premature death to members of my family.I, personally, have lost 145 pounds by setting aside the U.S. dietary guidelines and eating a low carb diet and excluding all “vegetable” or seed oils from my diet over the last year and a half.My blood sugars were high, I had pain in my joints, had difficulty walking and climbing stairs, and was out of breath whenever I walked.Within weeks of changing my diet, I began to feel considerably healthier. My blood sugar was 5.3, and my cholesterol numbers are all in a healthy range. This with a high animal fat, low seed oil diet. I eat fresh vegetables and fatty meat.My children were all becoming obese on the dietary guidelines. This has to change. Animal fats are necessary for healthy brain function.There are a multitude of studies showing the extensive harm to health caused by seed oils, commonly referred to as vegetable oils. They cause inflammation, heart disease, liver problems and more. The body cannot use these like it can animal fats.Please, for the health of our nation and for future generations, intervene and make sure your own children and grandchildren get the best nutrition possible.I am writing to urge you to call on the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services (USDA-HHS to postpone publication of the report by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, so that the federal agencies in charge can have time to address serious allegations by one or more members of this committee about the process that produces the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. These allegations, which recently come to light in a letter submitted by The Nutrition Coalition, detail serious flaws in the process and imply that the very reliability of our federal nutrition recommendations is in question.With 60 percent of Americans diagnosed with one or more chronic illnesses, conditions which increase the risk for severe outcomes and death from COVID-19, the United States now more than ever needs evidence-based advice on how to maintain and restore our metabolic health. The guidelines to date have self-evidently been unable to flatten the curve on the rates of these diet-related diseases.Please urge USDA-HHS to delay the release of the committee’s expert report to provide time to thoroughly investigate these allegations.Jeanette LohrChesapeakeOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_52,"Maybe you learned growing up that you should avoid writing in the passive voice. But no one told you that doing so can be a matter of life and death.A month after George Floyd was killed, protesters — who sometimes clash violently with police — continue to fill the streets of Philadelphia and cities around the world.Ugh, no. Let’s try that sentence again.A month after police killed George Floyd, the streets of Philadelphia and cities around the world continue to be filled with sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters.Maybe you learned growing up that you should avoid writing in the passive voice. But no one told you that doing so can be a matter of life and death. These two sentences are textbook examples of why: because passive voice eschews responsibility for action. The sentences are factually equal, but their active/passive-voice dance affects how you feel about what occurred.“George Floyd was killed” is in the passive voice, which allows a grammatically correct sentence without assigning any agency — that is, without telling you who killed George Floyd. After the comma, however, the sentence switches to active voice: The protesters are the ones who “clash violently” and “fill the streets.” Protesters are bad, and police are off the hook.Now look at the second sentence. Before the comma is active voice — ”police killed George Floyd” — but then the second half switches to passive voice to favor the actions of the protesters.Every article you’ve read for the last month has subtly shaped your perception of what’s going on by performing this active/passive voice shift.Take, for example, the New York Times. In asingle articlethis week, the Times wrote:“George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died in Minneapolis on Mondayafter being handcuffed and pinned to the groundby Derek Chauvin, a white police officer” — you have to get to the very end of a long sentence to learn that Floyd died under the knee of a police officer.“That night, hundreds of protesters flooded into the Minneapolis streets. Some demonstrators vandalized police vehicles” — assigning responsibility to protesters through active voice.“In Indianapolis, aperson was killedand three others injured after shots were fired at demonstrators” — no agency for who committed the shooting at all.“Protesters clashed with the police” — protesters, as the subject of the sentence, are responsible for “clashing.” Police are the object, and therefore not responsible and not accountable.» READ MORE:Brawl ensues near South Philadelphia Columbus statue after march, protest at Municipal Services BuildingNot to single out the Times. Over the last month readers could find similar examples in coverage fromNPR(“Peaceful Protesters Tear-Gassed to Clear Way for Trump Church Photo-Op” ,CNN(“Kendrick Sampson says he was shot with rubber bullets” ,ABC News(“Journalists have been arrested, tear gassed and more — sometimes live on air” ,The Hill(“Both were shot with rubber bullets and faced the tear gas thrown at protesters near the White House” ,Salon(“The protesters outside of the White House were shot with rubber bullets, choked with tear gas, and beaten by police” ,Fox News(“Authorities deny tear gas used on protesters prior to Trump’s walk to DC church” ,USA Today(“Government agencies andprotesters …are at odds over whether the chemical irritant deployed near the White House was tear gas” ,USA Todayagain (“Journalists blinded, injured, arrested covering George Floyd protests nationwide” , and most every hyperlocal news operation in America, many of them the only source of information in their communities.Each one of these sentences is a micro-influencer on how you interpret what you’re reading. They ignore or bury the fact that it was people who shot those rubber bullets or fired those tear gas canisters. They can shape whether you fault police or protesters for violence, and whether you think cops acted appropriately or too aggressively. Under scrutiny, they reveal the sometimes conscious, sometimes unconscious biases of reporters.Passive voice has its place. But question every verb as if your life depends on it.

(Her only sister died of meningitis when RBG was a toddler and her parents never got over it. I want to think of the great love she and her husband had for each other other — the way she kept up with a toddler and demands of her own second year of law school, at the same time getting him through testicular cancer and his last year of law school — and the enthusiastic way they always embraced people around them, no matter political differences. I want to think of the kick she had appearing in an opera just a few years back. I want to think of her never-flagging work ethic.What I want to think of most of all is how she kept her dignity while living life meaningfully and having a whole lot of fun.Yes, the complete lack of integrity of Republican senators rankles. They, who in 2016 so blithely asserted their objections to election year SCOTUS confirmations, now chortle with glee at doing much worse in 2020, since absentee and early voting have begun. (Note to young people: Don’t vote for lying cheaters. But that’s for another day.I wish RBG could have lived on sharing her wisdom. Of course, I also wish every baby could grow to adulthood, as she did, excitedly open to the world, embracing possibility, accepting hard work, and not getting mired in regret. Heavens, I wish the glorious leaves of the maple wouldn’t blow away in the next wind.Not possible.

For years, she has made it her mission to help people in Suffolk get enough food to eat through the food bank run by the ministry she co-founded, Suffolk Christian Fellowship Ministry and Suffolk Christian Fellowship Center. People line up on weekdays at the location on East Washington Street to get baskets of food they can take home to their families.In March, at the beginning of the pandemic, rather than pull back on the ministry’s activities out of fear, she broadened them. Where many people would have seen a reason to narrow the scope of what they were doing, she saw an even greater reason to do something she had wanted to do all along — mobile food pantries.Knowing that many people in rural areas of the city can’t always make it to downtown, she started scheduling outreaches. Marshaling volunteers and partnering organizations, Slaughter made sure hundreds of people in Whaleyville, Holland, Hobson and other outlying communities within Suffolk were served with groceries and other essentials. Now, she’s even taking the ministry across state lines, with a giveaway planned for Gates County in September.Slaughter recently was nominated for and received the Brawny Giant award, which comes with $2,500 and 900 rolls of its paper towels. One of her volunteers nominated her, and a phone interview with Brawny’s public relations firm sealed the deal.

Roadwork is expensive and with Suffolk being one of the poorest seven cities budget-wise getting to Phase 2 is not as accessible as it should be. There is road work being done now that I don’t see being finished anytime soon. Also, it was stated in the article that over 1,000 jobs were going to be created. What kind of jobs are these? Are they long-term or short-term jobs? Will the community be able to live above the poverty line with these jobs?Lastly, this area has been rezoned so many times to accommodate the higher income communities such as military families. At a point, socioeconomic diversity is not going to exist in our public-school system. King’s Fork High School and Hillpoint Elementary School are overcrowded, because those areas kept getting rezoned to accommodate certain groups while you have schools that are below capacity.

I arrive prepared with my right sleeve rolled up and my hand squeezing an imaginary stress ball. I give my name and date of birth to the phlebotomist and confirm the doctor who placed the order.My blood must be monitored frequently. I take a medication that helps combat my autoimmune disorders, but that medication can have some nasty side effects. The medicine can affect my liver and kidneys, so my doctor insists we check my blood frequently to ensure the drug isn’t doing more harm than good.Nearly all medication has some side effects, but patients are typically told about the side effects and monitor them with their doctors.Our country is facing a virus that has spread from sea to shining sea, and government officials and health care experts have put plans in place to help slow the spread. Perhaps we can compare it to a nationwide medicine. I am glad we are taking it seriously, but I am concerned that we are ignoring the side effects.The closure of our country has caused a spike in those struggling with their mental health. Mental health professionals have seen a massive increase in people reaching out for help. A federal emergency hotline for people facing emotional distress increased 1,000 percent this April compared to the same month of the previous year. While numbers in this area can be difficult to pinpoint, nearly every mental health facility or doctor has seen a significant increase in suicide attempts. Dr. Mike deBoisblanc of John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, Calif., went on record to say the number of suicide attempts in four weeks of quarantine surpassed the numbers for the previous year. He went as far as to state that the number of mental health fatalities in his hospital exceeded the number of deaths from COVID-19. This is a side effect of the treatment for COVID-19, but it’s not a side effect most people want to discuss.Another side effect that we hesitate to discuss is the effect that the closure of in-person schools will have on children who do not have involved parents. Last week, I spoke with numerous kids regarding the virtual end to last year’s school year. None of them completed the online work and were now repeating a grade or taking summer school, and those in summer school were told they would pass “no matter what” they did or did not learn. What will another year of virtual classes bring to kids without involved parents?The worst part of mentioning any side effects of our treatment of COVID-19 is the backlash that is received. Those who mention side effects to our treatment of the virus are often demonized, being told that they are not taking the virus seriously or that they do not care about other people.This virus should be treated seriously, and there are certain steps we should take to combat the spread. However, we should also be aware of the side effects of the treatment we have chosen, monitor them closely, and consider them in our decisions as we determine how to continue to combat this illness.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Reyes, age 14Our world as we know it will never be the same. The deadly and contagious virus named COVID-19 that originated in Wuhan, China, early this year has arrived in America. The spread occurred quicker than our government anticipated, and we were unprepared for what was to come. I watched the news that came from the White House with disbelief and extreme concern. I held my breath for a second, trying to make sense of what I was hearing.“I miss going out, but, mostly, I miss my grandparents.”Isolation has been difficult and sorrowful. It affected the moments I was able to spend time with friends and more importantly, go and stay with my dear grandparents, which I had always done on weekends. I couldn’t visit them because they were at high risk due to their underlying health issues. People were unable to go to work; some lost jobs. I felt very worried when my parents went to buy things we needed such as milk, bread, and water, and these basic things were scarce.I live with my older brother, younger sister, and my parents. My father and mother are both essential workers that do completely different types of jobs. I can tell it’s stressful on them. They worry about getting the virus and passing it onto us, but they also understand they are essential and have to do what needs to be done. I usually talk to everybody in my house, making sure they are OK and assisting them with anything they need help on. I have fun helping my younger sister create a fort, and making her laugh by telling her jokes or making funny faces whenever she is sad. She is young but quite a social butterfly, and it’s been hard for her not to be with her girl group. My older brother misses playing basketball and football with friends.And it’s hard on me. I miss going out, but, mostly, I miss my grandparents. I call them once or twice every day. We video chat, too, which is funny because they’re not the type to use technology. We get cut off a lot. My parents have taken us to ride by and see them from afar. We’re happy to see them but sad we can’t go hug them, kiss them and do things like before ...I try to ease my mind by indulging in my farming venture. This spring I started planting in my backyard. I have tomatoes, peppers, strawberries, eggplants, carrots, and cucumbers. I am not a professional gardener but I’m experimenting and learning different methods. My goal is to grow our own fresh fruit and vegetables because ... Why not? I’m encouraging others that now is the time to learn about all that. We don’t need to be a food desert if we all do as our ancestors did and tend to the land.My parents still manage to buy, cook, and serve the less fortunate by distributing food, clothes, hygiene care kits, wipes, hand sanitizer, gloves and donated masks to help stop the spread of this awful virus. I help my parents by putting together all that’s needed to distribute platters for the homeless around our city. I like to play their favorite songs that my father introduced me to and I ended up enjoying oldies: songs like “Celebration” by Kool & The Gang, “September” by Earth Wind & Fire, and “Smile” by Kirk Franklin.I’m thankful my family is well because we have had 30 relatives, friends, and community members pass away from this virus. The losses seemed to be back-to-back. I try my best to remain positive that this too shall pass and we can go back to a somewhat normal life, although this has rocked us so hard nothing will truly be normal again. May all this that has occurred, good and bad, change us all for the better.by Ellie Tyler, age 16When corona was first talked about, I’ll admit I thought it was a joke. I thought it would be treated like Ebola. People would make jokes; it’d be talked about, but I’d never have to experience it firsthand. I know that’s ignorant, but I have become so accustomed to seeing chaos on the news that I just became numb to it.“I have become so accustomed to seeing chaos on the news that I just became numb to it.”A little bit into quarantine I started to think a lot. The skeletons in my closet began to overwhelm me. I came clean to my friends and family about a lot of things. I wanted to just be honest and get everything off my chest, but with that came some of the worst pain I’ve ever felt. All I wanted to do was lie around. For a day or two I could barely stomach food. I couldn’t sleep alone for days. I’m pretty sure my little sister slept with me every night for seven or eight days.Even when my friends and family reassured me that they weren’t upset with me, I still felt an immense amount of guilt. At this point I’m doing a lot better. I just want to grow as a person and be the best me I can be. Nothing feels worse than saying you want to die and not knowing if you mean it or not. It was like I was teetering on the edge, between being stable and going insane. So yes, I am very grateful I was able to get everything off my chest, but I hated that feeling. It was a result of being stuck inside and not being able to keep busy.Quarantine just feels like such a hindrance in my life. I understand it isn’t all about me, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t suck. I had an acting class and vocal coaching coming up in April that I was very excited about. I turn 16 in June and don’t even know if I’ll be able to celebrate. I am supposed to go to camp in July and August. I wanted to apply to work at a café when I turned 16. Who knows if I will be able to do any of it.In general, my life has come to a halt. I was pretty isolated this school year. All my plans had kept me going. I have stuff to look forward to now, plans for after quarantine and things I’d like to learn more about in general. I’m just ready for this all to end. I want my life back. I know I’ll appreciate the things I took for granted a bit more.» READ MORE:What scares Pa. teens about climate change and how do they want to fight back, a year after massive global protests? | Opinionby Anthony Wallace, age 12It’s Coming!“The virus is deadly,” my grandma said as she watched the news, “and it is spreading quickly.” Her stern words best described the situation that was about to come. At first, I wasn’t alarmed. I didn’t really believe what she was saying. But after she showed me what was going on across the world ... it was a whole different story. Even before things hit the fan, the coronavirus pandemic was changing me — and I didn’t even realize it. I was scared, and so was my family. That unpleasant feeling was just the beginning.“This quarantine has taught me that we can adapt to trying times quickly.”It’s Here!After the virus came the shutdown, and it soon became clear that the world was being hit with more than just a virus. Hot on the tails of the pandemic came fear and animosity. Before the coronavirus, everyone I knew was happy and stayed close, but after this drastic change, people generally stopped communicating. Fear was here, and you could see it in people as they walked the streets, and with that dread was hostility. It changed my outlook on life, because knowing that there is a pandemic that is very deadly is terrifying. Even worse was the fact that learning from this pandemic can be difficult, especially for someone my age who doesn’t understand it so well. Altogether it left me heartbroken. But still, knowing that things may be like this for a while, I tried to live normally the best I could.So ... What Now?Even though I’m young, I quickly learned how to adapt. Now, the longer quarantine goes on the more I get used to it. While some things had drastically changed, such as school taking precautions to keep everyone safe by putting everything online, things aren’t as dire as I thought they’d be. I can’t do everything I used to do before quarantine, but I still get to have fun regardless, and that’s important in such a trying time. I’m doing great in school, I get to play basketball and eight-ball pool anytime, and I get to spend more time with family. So, while there is a pandemic going on, this quarantine has taught me that we can adapt to trying times quickly, and that people should still be appreciative, taking care of ourselves and others, especially the ones closest to you.» READ MORE:Too essential to isolate: Frontline workers on what scares them about the pandemicby K. Rob, age 16I’d imagine when most people are quarantined, they’d be afraid. What’s going to happen? Am I going to survive? What if I get the rona? Everybody’s panicking and buying up all the food and toilet paper, food they’re not even gonna eat, toilet paper they’re gonna waste on popping pimples and cleaning toilets.And the crazy part is, at some point in time, I imagined myself to be one of those people! But this was before the pandemic. Now, being in the middle of it, with wave two supposedly on the rise, I gotta say ... I thought this would be more ... interesting.“As a teenager who’s turning 16 in less than a month, any kind of rules or restrictions are something I can honestly say I hate.”Like, life hasn’t changed a whole lot, other than stores closing earlier and free bus rides, so I can’t complain, I have food and a roof over my head. Like — the biggest thing I have to worry about is my summer, and there’s almost no chance of that happening anyway. So while I’m not really ... concerned about the virus, I still have a problem with it.Why? Corona is restricting worldwide movement, and as a teenager who’s turning 16 in less than a month, any kind of rules or restrictions are something I can honestly say I hate. I was looking forward to this summer and those “ayy, 16, summer, 2020, now i can actually do stuff type vibes, but all I’m getting is “stay in the house, better yourself, and hope you don’t die.”Corona, to me ... has been a huge, fat, firetruck-red “Get It Together” sign in my face. Like I don’t have 40 other people telling me all the rest of the time. But it’s cool. People are saying we’re entering a new age in time, like we didn’t already create new genders, so now, that we’re really about to evolve ... like, globally? It’s kind of overwhelming. But I’m cool with that.I don’t even know what to think about corona: I just know that the world is confused, and I’m sitting here eating Doritos, like nothing’s gonna happen, and I’m cool with that. It’s a myriad of different feelings in my body, and I’m cool with that, I feel like regardless of the world around me, I’m just cooling.Maybe I don’t even care if I get itMaybe I’m scared of the futureMaybe I’ll go outside one day without my maskMaybe they’ll put 5G towers in the sky and mess up my brainwavesMaybe everything’ll be fineAt least I have more time to do what I wantMaybe I’ll come out of this thing three times better.Maybe I’ll know more. Maybe I’ll get taller. These weights look pretty attractive now that I’ve been bored for three weeks straight. I guess I’ll just listen to what everyone’s saying and wash my hands."

suffolknewsherald_2020_230,"Published 4:47 pm Tuesday, December 22, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonIt’s Christmas! My age doesn’t preclude a need for a backward glance at the excitement of childhood Christmases. There were not many toys, but some great memories. I need those and often recall “resurrecting” the joy of them.This year is different. Days and months have been filled with events I want to toss from my memory bank. Before January 2021, I want my Christmas celebration filled with memories of blessings. In spite of the regulations put upon us, the Creator God has remembered us in our need.Just a year ago we were looking ahead, planning for promising experiences, good things. Instead, we got a year incomprehensible to our imagination. Our “normal” was turned upside down, dumped out like trash. “Let it be gone!” has been our hope but “King Covid” is still in power. I want this Christmas to be more special, as I remember again why Jesus was born. It was He Who said “I am come that they (people might have life and have it more abundantly” (John 10:10, Psalm 72 .In spite of rigid regulations, I can’t be the only one refusing to let Covid darken or take away the star of Bethlehem, a picture of Jesus, the light of the world. Neighborhoods and stores are filled with gift items and ablaze with lit-up Christmas trees. Gift cards are in abundance. The Post Office is busy with mail. There is still love and hope for a good Christmas.Jesus hasn’t been in the manger for over two millennia, not since Joseph and Mary left after being registered for the census, their reason for going to Bethlehem. The manger was temporary, likely a bed of straw for added warmth. Luke says the wise men found Jesus in a house. I doubt the innkeeper ever knew his stable had housed the King of Glory who had left Heaven as royalty, coming to earth to identify with sinful man. Even the finest of houses are stables in comparison to those in the realms of Heaven.If you missed that part of the story, read the first and second chapters of Luke and Matthew. Over 700 years earlier, Isaiah had told the people to be on the lookout for a baby, Immanuel, “God with us” who would be “Wonderful, Counselor, mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.” He is the Creator God, His life foretold by the prophets. Mary accepted her assignment, John the Baptist introduced Him and John the Apostle called Him “The Word made flesh.” From the beginning of creation the “babe in the manger” was given to be our Redeemer, Savior and Lord. He fulfilled that responsibility. He is the only One able to identify with every human need. He is going to return to earth. At that time, His government will be established without end.May Jesus, the part of God called the Son Who came in human flesh make real for us the Christ of Christmas and bless us with peace as we remember why He came.Myrtle Thompson, 92, is a retired missionary, educator, Bible teacher and writer.

minnpost_2020_46,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .A good colleague and friend of mine,professor Deborah Levisonat the University of Minnesota, has spent more than 20 years studying child labor around the world. She’s working on a book about her findings, perhaps entitled “Kids Should Work.”Despite many laws formally forbidding child labor, Levison’s research finds that children are working all around the world, including in our own region. In recent years, she’s teamed up with a photographer who captured many of them on film. Levison has curateda virtual exhibit of the photos, “Seeing Child Labor.”I remember visiting Egypt in the 1990s with my 16-year-old son, David. In a rickety railroad car traveling back down the Nile from a boat trip, we watched families walking out into the cane fields with their children. My son asked me, “Why aren’t they in school” It was a perfect opportunity to speak about rural poverty and the nature of agricultural work.We’ve all experienced and observed child labor in our own society. In farm families like my Walli husband’s friend June Collman’s, boys and girls alike milked cows, pastured them, raised chickens, collected and cleaned eggs, and helped with the plowing and haying. In cities, some of us delivered papers. I had a secret garden in a swamp near our Minneapolis home where I raised beans, among other items, coached by my father, and sold them to neighbors for a pittance a bag. I was proud of my beans!In high school, my parents encouraged us to work for spending money. I landed a job at Perkins, then a pancake house in my neighborhood. I worked evenings and most of the day on Sunday, starting early in the morning. I had the lowliest job: placing silverware, napkins and filled water glasses on the tables. On Sunday mornings, our busiest, I had to refill the syrup pitchers, from hefty cans in the kitchen,beforethey went, filled, through the dishwasher. By early afternoon, when the church crowds had happily departed, I would walk home, my hair and fingernails full of creepy blueberry, apricot and maple syrup. On weekends, I babysat for pay.Working as children, even if it’s unpaid chores like dishes, lawn-mowing, and shoveling, creates respect for the challenges and quality of work, and pride in good results. By the time we were teens, our parents paid us something for these – I don’t remember how much.My son, David, was eager to work at age 16. What learning experiences! He first worked for our modestly sized public library, where his after-school job was reshelving books. He came home after the first week and complained, sticking his lower lip out, “I’m working under five layers of women, and they don’t get along with each other!” I replied, “Well, welcome to the sociology of the workplace!” He went on to work at temp jobs like shelving at some version of Office Max and, in a semester off in Washington, D.C., shelving videos for a television station. All of these were minimum-wage jobs. During college for a summer, he worked on the fiber optics assembly line in suburban Minneapolis. All of his co-workers were men of color.Levison’s research and her colleague’s photos provide remarkable windows into children’s work around the world, rural and urban. A picture is, truly, worth a thousand words. I encourage you to view the virtual exhibit. Share it with your kids, your friends. Talk with others about their work experiences, help younger people understand the upsides and downsides of the many occupations possible — and that they can change jobs, whether in the same occupation or leaving one that dissatisfies for another.Above all, these photos help place us alongside, for the viewing moments, the millions of children who are working at young ages, possibly the best way for us to understand their economies, the ubiquity of poverty worldwide, and the awesome spirit of young people working under challenging circumstances.Ann Markusen is a professor emerita, University of Minnesota; principal of Markusen Economic Research; and a resident of Red Clover Township."

suffolknewsherald_2020_119,"Published 10:26 pm Friday, May 22, 2020ByStaff ReportsIt will be a different Memorial Day this week. Across most of America, there will be no gatherings of people at the traditional ceremonies, and fewer people will feel safe venturing out even to informal recognitions of those men and women who gave their lives in service to our country.But even if you’re not up to going out at all on Monday, we encourage you still to give your thoughts to the extraordinary sacrifices so many others have made for our freedoms.At least 1.2 million people have died fighting for America, starting during the American Revolution and all the way up to the present day. Many more didn’t die during battle but died while on active duty in the military.Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, originating in the years following the Civil War and later evolved to commemorate the dead from all of America’s conflicts. It became an official federal holiday in 1971.It is not a day to honor veterans — that day is Veterans Day, Nov. 11. It is not a day to honor those who currently serve on active duty — that’s the third Saturday in May, which we just passed. While veterans and those who still serve certainly deserve to be honored, there are separate days for them. Memorial Day is specifically set aside for those who paid the ultimate price in service to their country.Memorial Day in Suffolk is usually commemorated with gatherings at cemeteries including Albert G. Horton Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery as well as Cedar Hill Cemetery, which also includes a large number of veterans. At these cemeteries, you would see flags, hear speeches and “Taps,” and quite probably leave feeling a tear in your eye and more appreciation for those who have signed up to serve and never came home.Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, none of those ceremonies will happen this year, although you’re free to go out to Horton, to Cedar Hill or to many other local cemeteries if you feel safe to do so and if you maintain six feet of distance from others who are there to pay their respects. Even if you can’t do that, though, we hope you take a minute to reflect on those who gave so much so that we could have so much — so much freedom, so much hope, so much pride.Thank you to all who are honored on this day and their families.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Delivered to your inbox Tuesday afternoons.What do the farmers want The results of the study make that clear. Over a five-year period, the acreage of cover crops in the state increased by 41%. Another practice with similar benefits, decreased tillage, showed a similar increase, with a 34% increase in acreage. Clearly the producer market increasingly believes these practices to be financially beneficial. And yet, only 2.2% of farmland in Minnesota utilized cover crops as of 2017, with total acreage trailing that of literally every other Midwestern state, as well as Nebraska, Texas, and Pennsylvania.The report from the Department of Agriculture lists a few disparate state programs that food producers can utilize to receive some grants, low-interest loans, and other minor forms of assistance, but clearly these programs are insufficient and new programs are needed. Fortunately, a bill creating a better food web economy already sits before the Minnesota House of Representatives in the form of the Headwaters Community Food & Water Bill.This bill (HF 2738 would provide everything that the state’s report has said would be needed to expand these mutually beneficial practices, including increased funding for farmers to cover high upfront costs (equipment, knowledge, training , funding to allow for a period of transition to better practices, new research, and peer-to-peer collaboration. The bill would also assist neighborhoods and other entities throughout the state to create food hubs and to connect more directly with local farmers.This bill, if enacted, would create the locally sourced food economy that the state seems to be encouraging, increase profitability for farmers, and benefit consumers in the form of cleaner water, healthier food, and a decreased carbon footprint. Perhaps most important, it would help insulate our food system from the kind of shock we have seen due to COVID-19. Let’s hope that our governing bodies can find the political strength to choose the farmers and consumers of our state over the big agricultural companies by taking up and passing the Headwaters Community Food & Water Bill.Jeff Diamond is a volunteer with MN350 Policy Action and a member of the MN350 Food Systems Team, living in the Longfellow area of Minneapolis."

Andrew Cuomo in New York’s COVID hot spots must be nullified, for they violate the First Amendment.The unsigned opinion by the nation’s highest court got it wrong, insisting that restrictions placed on religious gatherings imposed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York’s COVID hot spots must be nullified, for they violate the First Amendment.The dissent by the Bronx’s Sonia Sotomayor got it right. The rules, capping gatherings at 10 people or less, are actually more generous for faith-based institutions than for any other type: ” New York treats houses of worship far more favorably than their secular comparators.” How on Earth can that be an offense to the guaranteed freedom to exercise religion? The majority has no answer.Nor do they have a compelling reply to Chief Justice John Roberts’ dissent, which points out that since churches and synagogues filed their challenges to New York’s rules, the ground shifted. “None of the houses of worship identified in the applications is now subject to any fixed numerical restrictions … The Governor might reinstate the restrictions. But he also might not. And it is a significant matter to override determinations made by public health officials concerning what is necessary for public safety in the midst of a deadly pandemic.”In other words, there was no need to tie the hands of officials who are seeking to save lives in the midst of a public health crisis.But what’s done is done. New York is no longer allowed to count to 10 in synagogues and churches. Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas make five, and that’s enough. In these United States, there’s no higher authority on what is legal and constitutional.Going forward, Cuomo must impose restrictions on religious services — and all others — keyed to the size of the given institution, similar to the way indoor dining is regulated.

eugeneweekly_2020_17,"We ve got issues. Seventy years ago, the American poet Langston Hughes wrote about Black lives and Black discontent in Harlem: What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up Like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore — And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over — Like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags Like a heavy load. Or does it explode? In the decades since, we’ve witnessed multiple uprisings within communities of color, not only because of dreams deferred, but also because of continued inequities and violent acts of injustice. Millions of people are now engaging in multi-racial, multi-generational, non-violent protests because they want the dream deferred no longer. Even during this pandemic, the risk assumed by many of those protesting feels less than the risk of maintaining systemic inequities as they now exist, and arguably it’s the one of the most patriotic things we can do to make things better. The coronavirus has killed more than 130,000 Americans in a few short months, yet poverty alone is responsible for over 300,000 deaths annually in this country, a travesty in its own right. At the same time, ironically, we all yearn for normalcy, to get back to work, to get our kids back to school. The mixed messages, lack of a coordinated federal response, much less leadership, on this pandemic has been stultifying. The buck stops at the lowest level of government, exactly the wrong place in a public health crisis. Nonetheless, one month ago Lane County, per the governor’s instructions, began Phase 2 of re-opening. Though we’re lucky to have remained relatively untouched by the virus itself, that may be changing.We remainpainfully aware that testing is insufficient, that the test-based isolate/contact/trace infrastructure is inadequate, and that there is likely no effective vaccine that will be available this calendar year despite political rhetoric to the contrary. But let the protests continue, keep them safe, peaceful and a demonstration in how to self-police. Let us work for real change in our economic system, bringing back the middle class and achieving true full employment. Let’s redefine a good job to include living wages and upward mobility. And let’s change the measures of what a “healthy economy” and “success” look like. Let us eliminate the notion that people exist to serve the economy and awaken to the fact that the economy exists to serve the needs of people — of all people, not just the small percentage the economy has been contrived to work very well for. As we reform policing in this country, let us understand the context of modern law enforcement, which began after the Civil War as a mechanism to serve the power structure and control freed slaves. As we hear our environment cry out its imbalance with ever-increasing extreme weather events and their impacts on life at all levels, let us understand our role and become better stewards of the Earth and its bounty. The coronavirus is not the only out-of-control pandemic at this time. War. Racism. Poverty. Hunger. Deteriorating public infrastructure. Lack of health and mental health care for all. All of these a human service peace economy could help heal. The final chapters of my life are the first chapters of my life as an elected official, a particular sub-species of human for whom I have always had a degree of contempt. We must keep our elected officials accountable to all the people, not just the few who wield money and power. I now see the urgency of this first-hand. I am not a fan of career politicians from either side of the aisle. Some calculate every move and every word with the intent of accruing more popularity to feed an insatiable greed for power and attention. And they often play us against each other for their own purposes at this critical crossroads in history when we need tobuild common ground, not destroy it. A united front is necessary to combat the enemies of democracy: greed, fear, ignorance; distraction, confusion and illusion. We are called upon to no longer be complacent, but to fulfill an American dream that is real, not just for some but for all. Hughes’ foresight accurately predicted what happens when dreams are deferred. People explode. Add a worldwide pandemic to the equation and economies can unravel, democracies can die. We must work harder than ever to make good on the dreams and promises of our institutions and the democratic way of life. We have no time to continue deferring the dream. Here and now we must acknowledge Hughes’ insight, realize Martin Luther King’s dream, demonstrate true patriotism and bring our world into balance. It might just be our best, and our last, chance.

minnpost_2020_208,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Just when it appeared that things could not get worse for people seeking their right to asylum in the United States, allegations of forced sterilization of women and widespread medical neglect at an ICE detention facility emerge. These allegations must be vigorously investigated, and those who are responsible must be held accountable. And, ICE must ensure these abuses stop and start providing urgent medical care to those it detains.A “person who has been forced to … undergo involuntary sterilization … shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.” This excerpt from U.S. immigration law defines a person who has undergone — or fears they will be required to undergo — forced sterilization in their home country as a “refugee.” And yet,recent newsindicates the same Department of Homeland Security charged with granting refugee status is committing this persecution.Today, forced sterilization is outlawed as a crime against humanity, war crime, and crime of genocide in international law. U.N. experts on torture have stated that detained women are particularly vulnerable to these violations. And measures that are intended to prevent births within a group are prohibited as a crime of genocide. The United States has an absolute duty to prevent and punish these human rights violations.International law also protects women’s right to decide freely on the number and spacing of their children and protects against arbitrary interference with one’s privacy and family. These legal standards have been built in response to the lessons learned by witnessing the use of women’s bodies as a tactic of war and oppression.This is precisely the case for women held in ICE custody. The whistleblower complaint comes in the context of other oppressive immigration policies. In 2018, for example, the ACLUsuccessfully suedthe administration for its attempts to force unwanted pregnancies amongst detained immigrant women. The administration has also proposed and implemented policies restricting asylum protections for vulnerable women. It has never ended its shocking family separation scheme. Additionally, the administration continues to detain migrants and conduct apprehension operations despite numerous condemnations about the risks of COVID-19 in facilities. These tactics reflect a general distain for the lives and humanity of people in immigration custody, and migrant women in particular.Without decisive action — including congressional investigations and holding actors to account — we risk not only violating human rights but sliding down the path of ethnic cleansing that we have so urgently condemned. Abuse of human bodies, and particularly of women, is a bellwether for oppressive regimes. The Advocates for Human Rights calls on the administration to immediately stop its abuses and to start meeting its duty to provide appropriate medical care. We also call for investigation of and accountability for these crimes against humanity, and for all of us to demand better.Michele Garnett McKenzieis deputy director ofThe Advocates for Human Rights."
minnpost_2020_11,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In 1970 the median income of a Black family in Minnesota was 70% of its white neighbors’. Today it is only half. An explanation of the causes of this state of affairs would involve a complex web of socioeconomic factors. But we can separate out one strand that is both significant and relatively straightforward. Over the last several decades changes in technology and the globalization of the economy have led to a widening gap between the earnings of college graduates and those without a degree. Today it is difficult for someone without this credential to make it in our society.Contrary to its land grant mission, policies put in place at the University of Minnesota have made it harder for African Americans to enroll at the university, harder for them to graduate, and if they do graduate the university’s policies make it more likely that their future earnings will be lower than their classmates’.African Americans make up about 10% of Minnesota’s high school graduates, but less than 5% of the university’s enrollment.An increasing number of colleges (most recently the University of Chicago and the University of California system have dropped the requirement for SAT/ACT scores because they act as barriers to the admission of qualified Black students. Several years ago the University of Minnesota decided to increase the impact of these tests by raising its average ACT target. From 2010 to 2015, while the new standard was being imposed, the number of students from households in the lowest income quintile enrolled at the university was slashed by 12%.The graduation rate for lower income students (Pell grant recipients on the Twin Cities campus is 13% less than for more affluent students.Studies have shown that one of the most effective ways of improving graduation rates for low income students is by reducing college costs. If students from families with $35,000 in income enroll at the university they have two options: They can graduate in four to five years with unmanageable levels of debt for them and their family ($35,000 to $45,000 , or they can work so many hours that graduation becomes unlikely.The U budgets about $28 million for need based aid. While hardly adequate, not all of this money even goes to low income students. Much of it goes to students whose families earn well above the state’s median income. The university provides so-called need based aid for families with incomes up to $120,000.The earnings of the university’s graduates vary significantly depending on their major. For instance, students at the university with a degree in engineering are earning on average close to $70,000 three years after graduation. Those with a psychology degree are barely making $30,000. Black graduates at the university are disproportionately enrolled in low earning majors and underrepresented in most higher earning fields. Access to these majors is controlled by setting standardized test hurdles that funnel African American students into lower paying majors.I suspect that most, if not all, members of the university’s administration would love to see more Blacks succeeding at this school. But in order for this to happen there would need to be significant changes to the status quo. The university would have to operate with much less income. There could no longer be more than 30 highly paid vice presidents. The ratio of one university employee for every three students would need to be lowered. Faculty would need to spend more of their time teaching. And middle class families would need to forgo subsidies for their children’s education. The entire complexion of the university would need to change. Unless they are forced to, this is something the powers that be will simply not allow. And this is what institutional racism looks like.Though Stokely Carmichael never visited Minnesota, he did say something that is an eerily apt response to the Minnesota Myth; it is also something that many who have joined in protests seeking a more equitable society might echo: “We cannot be expected any longer to march and have our heads broken in order to say to whites: Come on, you’re nice guys. For you are not nice guys. We have found you out.”Robert Katz works in the University of Minnesota Libraries Research and Learning Division."

minnpost_2020_121,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The gruesome death of George Floyd, a black man from Minneapolis, while pleading to be let go as he could not breathe, has made daily headlines ever since. It happened during a pandemic, which has already claimed more than 117,000 American lives and is showing no signs of subsiding. Floyd begged for his life saying he could not breathe, while the police officer’s knee was firmly entrenched on his neck.The Memorial Day tragedy was reminiscent of a similar incident in 2014 when Eric Garner died after a police officer put him in a chokehold for several minutes. Garner repeatedly said, “I can’t breathe,” but to no avail. Are people of color unable to breathe only when strangled Technically, maybe so. It is my belief, however, that this section of society is choking and gasping for air even on a crisp, clean day. Numerous research studies show that there is vast disparity — albeit sometimes subtle — in how they are treated versus the elite strata of society that is white.During coverage of the protests that ensued Floyd’s death, a black Latino reporter was arrested while his white colleague was untouched. The “stop and frisk” policy of several years ago, and which President Donald Trump has often endorsed, disproportionately affects people of color. His admonishing of Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee, while deeming violent white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, Virginia, as fine people, was nothing short of racist. Declaring via a tweet that “when there is looting, there will be shooting” in response to protests in Minneapolis, while turning a blind eye to gun-toting white people at the Michigan state Capitol demanding relaxation of stay-at-home orders, does not endear him to all citizens whom he represents as president. Numerous other instances of sometimes blatant discrimination on the basis of skin color exist.Four hundred years after the first slaves were brought to America, and 150 years after the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was passed by Congress, the belief that blacks are less than human and do not deserve equal rights is ingrained in society. Nothing is more profound than the glaring differences in the socioeconomic status of people of color and their white counterparts. Blacks, for example, predominantly occupy the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, resulting in their inability to afford housing, health care, and sometimes basic necessities like food and good schooling.A recent survey showed that a vast majority of working Americans would rather not go back to work than risk being infected by COVID-19. We fail to understand that many of these have enough resources to combat the COVID storm without having to step out of their homes. Nothing wrong with that. Concurrently, however, many who want to return to work, for lack of choice, are denigrated. For, if they don’t they will starve. The problem lies in the lack of empathy by the well-off for those in dire straits.I am a first-generation immigrant with brown skin. I have personally experienced white hatred when I was told many times to go back to my country, or go back to where I came from, during my ownership of a retail store. My children have been addressed by the derogatory term “brownies” in school. This sometimes makes it difficult for us to breathe, albeit nowhere in comparison to Floyd and Garner’s cases.To imply that people of color suffocate only when physically strangled is an anomaly. Their lives are worsened by the racial hatred drilled into the minds of some of the white population. Set them free from this intangible stranglehold. Let them not drown in unseen waters. They deserve better.My heart bleeds, and my soul weeps when I see the punishment meted out to human beings based on their skin color. Unless one understands that the same red blood flows through the veins, irrespective of skin color, one cannot claim to be colorblind. As a race, we humans can, and should, do better.Milind Sohoni, Ph.D., is a first-generation immigrant from India, having settled in the U.S. for 37 years.

minnpost_2020_137,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Now that he’s gone, it can be revealed that yes, Paul McEnroe did occasionally send flowers to a police records clerk. And, yes, he did seem to come up with police records before anyone else.Whether there is a connection there will forever remain a mystery. The flowers might have been a sympathetic gesture after a loss. After all, plenty of cops slipped records to McEnroe, a long-time investigative reporter for the Star Tribune, often using someone else’s computer to avoid detection. Handoffs were made on a street corner three blocks from the police station. And there was talk of a drop-off spot “at the foot of the Indian,” referring to a Native American statue whose exact location must remain undisclosed.Everybody wanted to help Mac, risk be damned. Once asked how he came up with a particularly sensitive document on a breaking story, he replied matter-of-factly, “I’ve got a cardinal in the Kremlin,” as if everybody did, of course.“I’ve always said there are just a few people born to do this,” said Dick Meryhew, a reporter and editor for all of McEnroe’s 35 years as a Star Tribune reporter. “Paul was one of them. He could work a source and work a source and work a source. … His energy was just incredible.”McEnroe died Wednesday at his Stillwater home after battling cancer for several years. He was 69. He had continued to work up until his death, the past five years as an investigative producer at KSTP-TV.With a bit of a swagger and no apologies, McEnroe cultivated sources across the state and the country, and often in record time. His opening line in many cold calls was “I’m Paul McEnroe, and I’m just looking for an education.” It worked on lawyers and judges, secretaries, and one or two people in those big, corner offices at the state Capitol.From those relationships sprang powerful journalism that informed and changed Minnesota. McEnroe’s stories led to improvements in child protection services and care of disabled adults. They exposed corruption in University of Minnesota athletics, state politics and the Catholic Church. They showed the horror and heroism of war in Bosnia and in both Iraq wars. And they left a lasting impression on journalism students at the University of Minnesota, where, as an adjunct instructor, he challenged them to ask strangers uncomfortable questions and openly wept while reading great journalism.To cover the Iraq war after 9/11, McEnroe and photographer Richard Sennott arranged for smugglers to sneak them across the Iraq-Turkey border by crouching in a hidden compartment beneath a truckload of potatoes. The pair found their way to a Kurdish village, where they befriended and lived with villagers and fighters allied with American troops. Months later, back in Minneapolis, a question arose about his expense account. “They had a big feast one night to feed everybody, and McEnroe paid for it,” remembers Roger Buoen, the Star Tribune’s national editor at the time. “Part of it was for a goat. … I guess they buy goats to eat.”Editors approved the expense and sent it on, but it was flagged by the corporate office at McClatchy Newspapers in California, which owned the paper at the time. Once Buoen explained it, McClatchy began using the story as PR to show what it took to do great journalism. “In the end they thought it was kind of cool that reporters as part of their job had to buy a goat once in a while. … It was sort of a badge of honor for the organization. And only McEnroe would do that.”He could also be tough when he needed to be. Tony Kennedy recalled working with McEnroe on a series of stories about the plane crash that killed Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone. The question of pilot fatigue or error had been a big part of the reporting, and the two had learned that the pilot’s mother might have the pilot’s logbook from that day. It was a long shot to get access to it, but the reporters gave it a go, and headed to her house. As she came to the door, it was clear she wasn’t going to help them, Kennedy said. She started to close the door. “Paul kind of shoved his foot in the door when she tried to slam it,” Kennedy said. “He just wasn’t going to let her go.” He kept talking, and not only did she eventually show them the book, she gave it to them and said they could return it later. “The attorney for the pilot’s family blew his lid when he found out we had it.”While working on a story about the troubles of Timberwolves basketball star Isaiah “J.R.” Rider, who grew up near Oakland, California, McEnroe tracked down a drug dealer there who he thought might figure in the story. Again, a door was slammed in his face. Moments later, the man got in his car and backed down the driveway. To to his surprise, McEnroe’s car was blocking his escape. Mac got his interview.On at least two blockbuster stories, McEnroe convinced assistant hotel managers to dig through receipts to tell him if people had once stayed at the hotels. One helped him find Vikings first-round draft choice Dimitrius Underwood, who had disappeared from Vikings training camp. No one knew where Underwood had gone, but McEnroe found him within a few days – in Philadelphia. Acting on a tip from a family member of the troubled player, he enlisted the help of staff at a downtown Marriott to keep an eye out. When Underwood showed up, a bellhop tipped off McEnroe, adding proudly that he had parked right behind Underwood’s car so he couldn’t leave. Mac not only got the interview, but arranged to fly back to Minnesota with Underwood.Journalism students at the University of Minnesota soaked up his stories and reporting tips.“Mac, as a teacher, was a completely unpredictable force of energy,” said Andy Mannix, now a Minneapolis Star Tribune reporter who was once enrolled in McEnroe’s in-depth reporting class. “The class was at 8 a.m., so you can imagine a bunch of tired students, but Mac is just revved up to 10 immediately. Day one he made us all write down his cellphone number and said if any of us ever needed to get bailed out of jail, he would do so immediately. Which was a very confusing thing to hear before we even read the syllabus.”One assignment, Mannix remembered, was to go to the airport, find the ID number on the tail of an airplane and learn everything about that plane. “This is after 9/11, and a bunch of 21-year-olds are outside the airport with binoculars trying to write down the number from an airplane, thinking we’re going to get shot or something.”But he also remembered McEnroe’s sensitivity, and how he broke down as he tried to read stories from war zones to expose students to the best journalism. “I remember being so impressed that he was willing to be so vulnerable and just cry openly in front of us,” said Mannix. “But it also occurred to me that he saw some stuff in his own war reporting that sort of stuck with him, and it was really off limits for joking. It seemed like he had a lot of reverence for the journalists who had risked their lives and sometimes sacrificed their lives to tell these stories.”That softer side came through in the large flower gardens McEnroe tended at his Stillwater home and his guardianship of his two disabled brothers. He also was an avid marathon runner and whitewater rafter. McEnroe is survived by his children, Tess and Caleb, his stepson, Alessandro Galeone, his wife, Louisa D’Altilia, and two brothers, David and Peter.Family, friends and colleagues wanting to honor Paul may do so by contacting the Memorial Sloan Kettering Development Office at 646-227-3549 to make a donation in memory of Paul McEnroe specifically for the research of Dr. T. Jonathan Yang, radiation oncologist, in his work with leptomeningeal cancer.Chris Ison, a former Star Tribune reporter and editor, worked with McEnroe for several years. He is now an associate professor at the Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota."
hawaiitribune_herald_2020_27,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Tutors proposalTutors proposalSeeing the article from Dec. 7, “Schools nationwide confront ‘off the rails’ numbers of failing grades,” brought up a lot of concerns and worry for me regarding the future of our students and citizens moving forward in this post-pandemic world, though with that concern and worry a solution came to mind that I felt I should share.Teachers need more help than ever now, which is why I propose a college-credit and/or volunteer-based virtual tutoring program.Educators are facing unprecedented challenges in keeping pupils focused and engaged in learning through remote education. Teachers don’t have the resources or time to teach the material while also catering to those who need extra help. At the same time, students feel nervous to express their lack of understanding, and many parents aren’t available to bridge the gap under current circumstances.That’s why I think virtual tutors would be the perfect solution to bridge that gap over the next year or so for us.Here’s what I’m thinking: We create some sort of college credit or credit hours at Hawaii Community College and University of Hawaii for students working toward degrees in the fields of social work, teaching and the like. Each college student gets assigned five to 10 elementary or high school students to tutor, and beyond tutoring them, they can act as advocates — being a more personal connection to their education that can communicate to the pupils’ parents and teachers their specific needs or concerns.The tutor would meet remotely with each student individually a few times a week to provide them with extra help or talk about any struggles they’ve been facing. This would be especially beneficial throughout this upcoming year to help students who have missed out on key concepts due to this unprecedented year in education. It would be a great way for the college students to get hands-on experience, not only with teaching, but also with problem-solving student-based issues.It would also help younger students to catch up on their understanding, all-the-while taking stress off of the teachers giving them more time to allocate to introducing new material.Kelly (Amy BlackKeaauNo to casino planI don’t understand who or why it would be suggested to bring gambling to Hawaii again (Tribune-Herald, Dec. 17 .It just doesn’t make sense to me to add a problem to a problem we already have.Businesses have closed, people lost their jobs, and instead of fixing a problem, we’re making one.We have a virus to battle and to conquer, so let’s all work together and focus on making things better in a positive way.Lynise TarringHilo"
suffolknewsherald_2020_226,"Published 6:08 pm Tuesday, September 15, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Joseph PerryHave you ever wished that you could go back to a certain time in your life? A time when things were better?That’s what a lady told me this past week. She said, “I just wished I could go back to yesterday, when things were different for me, when things were better.” She went on to say, “I’m so exhausted with dealing with all that’s going on right now.”What we need to know about the past is that no matter what has happened, it has all worked together to bring us to this very moment, and this is the moment we can choose to make everything in this moment of life still work right now.In Paul’s letter to the Philippian Church, he wanted to encourage them to keep pressing forward in life. It’s important to encourage people as they go through life, as we are challenged on so many ways that some of us couldn’t ever imagine. It’s important to share with the people whose lives we cross, because so many times they need to be lifted as they are confronted with various troubles. Paul tells the Church, “Brothers and Sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do. Forgetting which is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 3:13 NIV In so many words, Paul is saying, you have to just keep it moving.It is true, as the lady was sharing with me, that there are times when the thought crosses our mind that we desire to go back to an earlier time in our lives when things were better, when life was easier than the way things are now. The truth of the matter is we change every day; we get either better or either worse in some way every day. We are by no means who we were before, we are different.You may not believe it, but none of us stays the same. If we could go back and stand where we stood before, things would not be like they were then. Why? Because we have changed. Our walk through this life is determined not by how much we look back, it’s how much we look forward. Of course, we can learn from the past by looking back, but only if we look back to learn and gain insight. Desiring to go back causes us to stop and focus on that which is behind us and it takes up too much time that the Lord has given us to glorify Him.We tend to forget the darkness of the past, and we have a tendency of remembering only the good, and forgetting the bad and the ugly. Moving forward in life pushes us to new opportunities. If we stayed in the same state in life, we would miss the opportunities that await us.Lastly, we need to know that in this world, we have so many options. You and I have options to choose to live life to the fullest. It does not matter what season you are in; you have an option to live, and to live again. Don’t dwell on the past, but focus on moving forward. When you make up in your mind to keep moving forward regardless of the chaos or the criticism you face, know that one day you will transition from this level of life and move on to a new one.

minnpost_2020_50,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In the Twin Cities, people are using public space differently during the pandemic. It’s encouraging to see the expansion of restaurant patios and street closures for open-air dining in parts of the cities. Yet, this raises concern about the appropriation of public space for private use. Outside of these hotspots, many public spaces feel dormant or abandoned. Mobility tracking data show that during the stay-at-home orders, people visited parks and open spaces in greater numbers than in past years. At the same time, fewer people visited neighborhood main streets and business districts.Work-from-home trends and business closures contribute to this, as do the cancellations of the festivals and fairs that bring us together. But even when the economy began to reopen, overall street life activity was still a fraction of what it was a year ago. In the seven intersections along University Avenue that we studied during June, we also noted that people there primarily moved through public spaces. Most people were physically distanced, and about one in four used a mask. As a result, public space can feel less social and important. Are we witnessing the end of public spaceAgainst these trends of privatization, restriction, and abandonment, acts of popular political expression and solidarity have re-appropriated public spaces and reinvented them in the process. Streets, parking lots, and open fields in many locations have served as sites of mutual aid, where food and vital household supplies are redistributed to people in need. The appearance of murals and protest artwork in response to George Floyd’s death especially speaks to the vital importance of public space. The artwork along the storefronts of University Avenue (and elsewhere serves as a form of civil speech and as a strategy to remember the past in the struggle to create a future that does not allow history to repeat itself. Many of the art pieces incorporate hashtags, including #BlackLivesMatter and #JusticeForFloyd. Although it is impossible to click on a painted hashtag, these references link a particular street corner to an ongoing vibrant movement throughout the world.Will this reinvention outlast the pandemic or be confined to it Regardless, the ongoing use of social media by popular movements is fraught with concern. Are these privately controlled platforms simply another vehicle bringing us to the end of public space Surely, these social media platforms offer little support for civil conversation, yet they are conducive to sharing and consuming information, and that may be enough to frame an issue as a matter of public concern and expose people to different perspectives.In this we see that public space continues in and through the ongoing struggle of popular movements to prod collective action, however and wherever that takes shape. COVID-19 is not prompting the end of public space, but it is spurring its reinvention.Dan Trudeau is a professor of geography at Macalester College. Elliot Wareham is a senior geography student at Macalester College.

Where sports were once a fairly apolitical arena at which Americans could congregate without rancor, they have of late turned into yet another cultural flashpoint.According to a study by the ad agency Oberland and its research wing Suzy, brands are more at risk of public backlash if they remain silent than if they proactively speak against racism. The agency is predicting that many of 2021’s Super Bowl ads will focus on racial justice, pivoting as many teams and players have to publicly support social causes they care about.As far back as 2016, a Rasmussen Report study linked a decline in viewership to racial protests and demonstrations. The NFL rebounded from a 14.9 million average viewership low in 2017 in the following years, but is still well below its 2010 high of nearly 18 million, according to Statista, a data-gathering site.The unrest in 2020, coupled with sharp divides over pandemic policy and a presidential election, have further polarized the country.The Super Bowl was once an opportunity to put aside differences and cheer and jeer together.Now we’re split apart, ideologically as well as socially.Analysts have said the commercials will sell, showing optimism despite initial slowness.

The cutting edge of resistance came from leaders and everyday people in the town of Boston in the 1760s and early 1770s. I have been learning about those people, researching a book I am writing about James Otis and his sister Mercy Otis Warren, as well as their contemporaries, like John Hancock, Samuel Adams and Crispus Attucks. As events unfolded and grand ideas took root in those two decades the men and women of that time grew to see themselves as bringing in a new epoch in history. It was very heady stuff, fraught with danger.We Americans, all 330 million of us, could find ourselves on the edge of another epoch, on the brink of writing another momentous chapter in American history. To assure the best possible transition to the best possible destination we should be guided by the lessons of the past. The men and women who lived 250 years ago can teach us much.Lesson 1.Treat me like an enemy and I will ultimately become your enemy.In the 1760s Bostonians protested various kinds of British acts, be they unwarranted invasions of privacy or unwanted taxes. Finally, in 1768 the British authorities decided to show the Americans who was in charge. They sent 4,000 troops to Boston, a town of 15,000, as a show of force. Benjamin Franklin said with great prescience: “They will not find a rebellion but they may cause one.” And that they did. That British flexing of muscle caused growing resentment, distrust, fear and finally Lexington and Concord.Lesson 2.Ideals and ideas are extremely powerful.Nobody at that time stated those ideals better than James Otis. His argument in 1761 against the Writs of Assistance (which allowed British customs officials to invade homes and businesses arbitrarily galvanized the citizens of Boston to resist. John Adams, who heard Otis argue the case, later wrote of Otis’s performance: “Then and there the child Independence was born.” The grand concepts Otis expressed resonated with Bostonians and their personal experiences. They were not abstractions. Ideas and ideals improve lives and drive history.Lesson 3.Shaping public opinion requires a kind of genius and persistence.The master of shaping public opinion in Boston was Samuel Adams, a failed businessman and a brilliant political tactician. He was incessant in his protest, even when times were very hard for those resisting the Crown. His master stroke was to describe an unplanned, tragic killing of five citizens of Boston by taunted British soldiers as “The Boston Massacre,” a phrase that stuck. To assure that it would continue to incite people, he created annual commemorations of it until the Revolution began.Lesson 4. Elites need a broad swath of public support and key leaders.Every school child has heard of Samuel Adams and John Hancock, two Harvard men, but what about Ebenezer Mackintosh, a humble shoemaker In a town of 15,000 Mackintosh could generate and control a crowd of 2,000-3,000 to protest and raise hell. Without those masses the words of the elite would ring hollow and weak. Crispus Attucks, an escaped slave whose mother was Native and father an enslaved African, was one of the victims of the Boston Massacre. He was carried in the funeral cortege honored by thousands of Bostonians.Lesson 5.Nothing is inevitable.The American Revolution was not inevitable. History can give the impression that acts and forces lead inexorably to the outcomes that occurred, but at the time many possibilities existed.Different British leaders could have made different decisions; their local administrators could have acted differently. Had the British been willing to grant certain rights, the simmering resentments could have subsided and Revolution avoided. American leaders could have been less brave, less bright, and more easily bought off. Our forebears were willing to die for their high ideals and beliefs, and many did. The future always rests with those alive and engaged today.As our nation sits on the edge of a new epoch, with enormous new possibilities and threats, we have the opportunity to re-envision, to strategize, and to catalyze what could be called The Big Shift. Like tectonic plates under the earth, pressure has been building for years for major changes in our common life. Health care. Income inequality. Racial equity. Climate change. What are the goals and how can they be reached What can actually be made to happen that serves our people’s needs and the planet’s preservation How can the lessons from pre-Revolution Boston guide the actions of those leading the changePublic will and public policies are at the heart of the change that needs to occur.The four domains of the Big Shift are: fair access to health care, reduction of income inequality, vastly more racial equity, and serious steps to mitigate climate change. There are specific remedies already formulated and ready to be enacted. There is no excuse for failing to enact major and lasting reforms. The challenge will be to enable fellow Americans to understand and support a coherent campaign to improve their lives as well as the prospects of their children and grand-children.Lesson 1.Treat me like an enemy and I will ultimately become your enemy.Democrats need to view Trump supporters with respect and understanding. Seeking to understand them, and demonstrating some humility, will be good for the liberal soul and can even create new allies. The cause of major change demands open hands, not self-righteously clenched fists. A vast majority of Trump supporters will benefit from the Big Shift. A portion of them should be viewed as needed allies to enable the Big Shift.Lesson 2.Ideals and ideas are extremely powerful.The principles and ideals in our Declaration of Independence are powerful. Leaders of the Big Shift need to keep articulating the proposition that all people are created equal and that each of us is endowed with inalienable rights including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Putting reforms in the context of our country’s promises to ourselves will add moral force to change. Leaders need to show Americans how being true to those ideals will tangibly help them. That is very doable.Lesson 3. Shaping public opinion requires a kind of genius and persistence.This may be the biggest challenge Democrats must confront. Republicans have shown discipline in their communication, including reducing their agenda to simple, clear, messages. Democrats are all over the map, with each of its constituencies sure that their issue is most important. For the Big Shift to occur the various constituencies must adhere to a very few, simple messages that move people. Framing the policy ideas effectively and persistently, and selling them to Americans, will be a key ingredient to lasting success. Remaining on the offensive is imperative.Lesson 4.Elites need a broad swath of public support and key leaders.This lesson is obvious and yet the reasons Democrats lose more elections than they should is because they have allowed economic issues, their natural “home field,” to lose out to issues that revolve around the injured pride and self-worth of citizens who feel ignored or even looked down upon. If they feel respected, citizens will open their arms to the ideas of the Big Shift. Democrats need to be aware of their unconscious arrogance and actually show they care. Organizing and serving diverse groups of people of all stripes between elections is essential.Lesson 5. Nothing is inevitable.The new epoch could continue to see chaos, fear, and greed lead to an American dystopia. Or it could usher in a rededication to the Founders’ principles; healthy and civil political conflict; and an effective set of policy changes that improve health care, reduce income inequality, enhance racial justice, and tackle climate change. All of those things will strengthen the fabric of our society and our economy.Those who hope to lead the Big Shift need to do these five things:In the end the question we Americans need to answer is this: Are we worthy heirs to the legacy of those who founded our country and those who have since fought and died to achieve its principles and goalsTodd Otis is a 75-year old Harvard-educated former Minnesota State Representative and Democratic State Party chair who is working on a book about pre-Revolutionary Boston."
minnpost_2020_117,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Since then, Owen has grown into a strong, confident, athletic teenager. He’s still sensitive and soft-spoken, but he’s also developed empathy, leadership skills, and deep friendships with his teammates. Because we happen to live in a predominantly white community, for a long time our son rarely had occasion to connect with people of color his age. Now he has friends — all of whom he met playing ball — whose skin colors and backgrounds are different from his own and he’s a better human for it. We need these kinds of connections, now more than ever.As much as my husband and I would like to take credit for our son’s transformation from an anxious child to a confident young man, we know full well the real catalyst for his growth: baseball. And our son is no anomaly. I’ve witnessed similar transformations in other children. His cousin, in particular: once a shy, soft-spoken girl, she found her voice and her power on the field.Clearly, baseball is so much more than a sport! It’s a way to fit in, to make friends, and to gain confidence and a sense of fairness that carries over to so many other areas of life. Moreover, baseball (and youth sports in general is such an important opportunity for kids of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds to come together and create lifelong friendships. I don’t think its hyperbole to say that the future of our nation depends on these friendships.My son has come a long way from being the shy, quiet kid on the playground. Nowadays, he can handle almost anything life throws at him. He can handle adversity. He can handle distance learning. He can handle wearing a face mask in public. He can even handle not seeing his friends and grandparents for months on end. What he can’t tolerate — what none of us can tolerate — is the sense that our community is diminishing right before our eyes.I don’t know much about politics or pandemics. What I do know is that when our kids aren’t playing ball, they’re finding other, less-healthier ways to occupy their time. I’ve spoken to parents whose once vibrant, energetic kids have fallen into depression, developed poor eating habits, and turned to video games and junk food to fill the emptiness they feel. Sadly, I also know families who live with domestic abuse exacerbated by the quarantine.While I don’t believe that baseball (or any sport is a magical cure for the pandemic we’re in, I do believe the game has the power to energize and uplift our collective spirit. It’s such a small thing, yet it would have a tremendous impact on the mental and physical health of our communities.With extra safety measures in place — measures that have been carefully developed by the Baseball Alliance of Minnesota, a collaboration of MYAS/Gopher State and Metro Baseball, the two largest statewide, community-based baseball organizations — there is no reason why our boys and girls can’t compete this summer. Our kids — the least at-risk population in this pandemic — shouldn’t have to go an entire season without playing the game they love.We need to get our boys and girls back on the field. Parents can watch from a distance or not at all. Let’s just get our kids off the sofa and back onto the diamond.Tina Mortimer is a freelance writer based in the Twin Cities.

suffolknewsherald_2020_197,"Published 2:05 pm Thursday, December 24, 2020ByStaff ReportsOnce again this year, the burial sites of more than 10,000 of our nation’s heroes are adorned with a beautiful wreath of fresh greenery with a red bow for Christmastime.The Albert G. Horton Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery commands dignity and respect for these heroes all year long, but there are special times — Memorial Day, Veterans Day and the Christmas season — when special recognition is due. On the former two days, each gravesite gets a flag. And at Christmastime, for more than a decade now thanks to the efforts of the Horton Wreath Society, each grave has received a wreath with a red bow.The cemetery fully adorned with these wreaths is truly a sight to behold, and it honors our veterans and their family members who served. Each and every gravesite at this revered place holds the remains of someone who served our country honorably, or one of their family members who also sacrificed much; many of the graves hold the veteran and their spouse.If you’ve not been out to volunteer at this event, we encourage you to put it on your list for 2021. This year was different, with volunteerism limited due to COVID-19; however, it is reasonable to hope that all who want to participate will be able to next year.This annual effort is a massive undertaking, not just logistically and with volunteers but also financially.Horton Wreath Society President Michael Yarbrough recently estimated the society would need to raise about $100,000 between now and next October to fully adorn all of the burial sites that will be there next year. There are currently nearly 11,000 burial sites at the cemetery, and the cemetery averages about 1,000 burials a year, Yarbrough said.To give to the Horton Wreath Society, write a check and drop it in the mail to Horton Wreath Society, P.O.

minnpost_2020_27,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The surpriseouster of the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry Commissioner Nancy Leppinkis more than just “politics as usual” — it points to a troubling trend that threatens to erode the integrity of America’s oversight systems.We all say we value accountability. We know that when we keep our promises to each other, we build trust, and trust allows us to do better work and get better results.We value that trust so much that we have created a system of government watchdogs to protect the integrity of the work we do together. And when it comes to watchdogs, we expect them to be honest, fearless, and fiercely independent.Or do weRecent attacks on watchdogs suggest otherwise.The most recent example was the surprise removal of Leppink on Aug. 12 by the Minnesota Senate. Republicans said that Leppink was removed for being “difficult to work with,” while Democrats maintained she was holding businesses accountable by insisting they treat their workers fairly and follow the law. It was clear that this was an attempt by the Minnesota Senate GOP to pressure Gov. Tim Walz to end our current Peacetime Emergency. This action sends the message that if you have a job that calls on you to protect the public, merely doing your job can cause you to be removed. Fear like that can impact a watchdog’s independence, or at least the public’s perception of their ability to do thorough investigations and enforce the law.Attempts to trade watchdogs for lapdogs are not the only threat to our nation’s oversight system. Elected watchdogs like me cannot be removed in the same manner as appointed officials, but we are not immune to attacks on our ability to protect the public, either. Those who would like to get rid of the watchdogs can’t fire us, but they can shorten our leash.The North Dakota state auditor got to experience this firsthand. In 2018, he exposed their governor’s misuse of state planes and uncovered conflicts of interest of powerful people. How did the North Dakota legislature respond to this betrayal of public trust Instead of holding the wrongdoers accountable, they now require the auditor to get legislative permission before conducting these kinds of investigations.Starving government watchdogs into silence is another tactic to undermine accountability. Across the country, offices like mine are struggling with dwindling resources In Minnesota for example, the size of the Office of the State Auditor has been reduced by 45% since 2005, despite having the duty to oversee almost $40 billion in local government spending. A combination of funding cuts and funding that failed to keep pace with inflation severely restrains our ability to provide an effective level of examination.Each attack on our watchdogs undermines the independence of our oversight system. And without independence, the public quickly loses trust in those providing system oversight, and ultimately in the systems themselves.How do we protect the independence of our oversight professionals Lawmakers need to base confirmation decisions on the merits of the candidate, not politics. Budgets of offices entrusted with protecting the public need to be tied to the magnitude of their oversight responsibility, not left to erode into impotence. Those who oversee government need the freedom to follow an investigation wherever it leads, without needing permission from those they investigate.Minnesotans need to know that there are those in government who will watch over their interests and speak out when their interests are being betrayed. It’s time to give our watchdogs back their bite.Julie Blaha is the state auditor of Minnesota. The Office of the State Auditor is the constitutional office that oversees nearly $40 billion in local government finances for Minnesota taxpayers. The office helps to ensure financial integrity and accountability in local government financial activities."
suffolknewsherald_2020_178,"Published 5:33 pm Tuesday, November 10, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceIt was a beautiful Sunday afternoon with sunny skies and a temperature of a little over 70 degrees. We picked up lunch at a fast-food restaurant and stopped at a small park in Portsmouth to enjoy a picnic before heading to our destination — The South Norfolk Jordan Bridge.The South Norfolk Jordan Bridge rises above the Elizabeth River and connects the cities of Portsmouth and Chesapeake. A pedestrian walkway stretches across the length of the bridge, providing a one-mile walk from one city to the other and beautiful views of the Elizabeth River and the surrounding areas.We parked near the bridge and embarked on our journey over the Elizabeth River. The 13-year-old saw the incline of the bridge, which the city of Chesapeake describes as a “healthy 5% grade,” and let out a scream before asking, “Why are we doing this again?”We walked from one side of the bridge to the other, but there were several times that we needed to stop as the 13-year-old complained of burning thighs, tired legs and an aching back. I didn’t doubt her complaints, because I know that she rarely goes outside and that exercise of any type isn’t a part of her life.I am glad she completed the walk, but I was saddened by the fact that a healthy 13-year-old could not walk that distance without numerous breaks. This healthy 13-year-old should have had no trouble keeping up with her 12-year-old brother and 40-year-old chaperone, but her lack of physical activity made this relatively simple exercise difficult for her to complete.The health benefits of physical activity are undeniable. However, our culture is largely sedentary, and this lifestyle has transitioned to our children. Many children and youth spend large portions of their days indoors sitting in front of the television, holding a phone or pressing buttons on a gaming controller. Indoor activities and games are fine, but we must not forget the need for physical activity.Children who are not drawn to physical activity on their own may need to be forced to get up and get active. Parents can require that children spend a certain period each day or each week doing something of a physical nature. These times can be, and should be, fun and enjoyable for children.Younger children can play outside when weather permits. This allows children to use their imagination and learn about the world around them while physically active. Children of all ages may enjoy a trip to the park, a hike through a nature trail, or a stroll along the beach. Everyone — children and adults — can take walks in the neighborhood or work together on lawn care. There are countless ways to stay active.These times of physical activity also provide an excellent opportunity for them to spend time with family and friends away from electronics. Great conversations can be had when playing catch with a football or walking in the park.It’s important to ensure that children are remaining physically active. The health benefits, both physical and mental, have been proven time and time again.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_48,"Stanford s famed marshmallow experiment has real-world implications for pandemic response.Of all of the uniquely American failures these last four months of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, none were more consequential than reopening too soon. Instead of waiting for the cases to subside sufficiently, we dined, traveled, and shopped prematurely, even onPresident Donald Trump’s own criteria. Reflecting on this specific failure, it is not too early — or too late — to learn lessons that will save lives.The famedStanford Marshmallow Experimenthas a deceptively simple setup and a powerful punchline. Place a marshmallow or other sweet in front of a child. Promise the child that, if they wait to consume the treat, they will receive double the reward. Data reveal that children who withstood the temptation are more likely to succeed later in life. This maxim — that self-discipline is virtuous — feels painfully obvious during this roller-coaster ascent of new infections. Had we held the line during the case plateau, we would be eating the second marshmallow of expanded commerce and ample ICU capacity.But we must also consider the second lesson of the marshmallow experiment, one that has only been learned recently.New researchhas shown there is more to the original findings, which may have been confounded by the sample of children. Subsequent experiments reveal that both the educational and socioeconomic background of the particular child and their family impacts their capacity for self-control and its “value” later in life. Once you account for key factors in a child’s life, the virtue of delaying gratification looks less pronounced and more complex.New theories abound as to why the effect varies across class, but it may reflect anxieties about the unknown. As Jessica Calarcowrote for the Atlantic in 2018, “there might be food in the pantry today, but not tomorrow, so there is a risk that comes with waiting.” For some children, eating the marshmallow immediately may be a prudent strategy — not a lack of self-discipline.Similarly, the cost of the pandemic’s social distancing guidelines — the cost of waiting — has never been felt equally across the country. Millions work in jobs that rely on physical commerce and face-to-face interaction, sectors that have been decimated. If your employment was not impacted directly, perhaps your life was disrupted by round-the-clock child care without the reprieve of school or camp.For many Americans, the choice to wait and reopen was hardly a function of boredom or self-control. It was a tightrope walk of stress, anxiety, and the real possibility of financial ruin or homelessness. Unsurprising, then, that the choice became an avatar for existing political and ideological differences.The new, nuanced conclusions of the marshmallow experiment affirm the value of delayed gratification across class status and underscore the pressures facing the country in its exercise of self-control. It is much easier to endure stringent measures like lockdowns when there is both a collective sense of purpose in doing so and a social safety net that supports people during the necessary months of deprivation.We need leaders to rally the country’s self-discipline and make it laudable. We need additional financial relief to alleviate the fear of eviction and hunger. These actions will make it easier for every American to hold the line in their personal choices on a daily basis. While our coronavirus experience has thus far been a story of chaos and grief, the window of opportunity for minimizing suffering never truly closes.Poll a group of children if they would rather have one marshmallow or two, and the consensus will be clear. The decision to reopen the economy is assuredly more complex. But the choice between the economy and our public healthis ultimately a false one. The only solution to the pandemic and its economic calamity is, quite simply, to try our hardest to contain the pandemic.Appreciating the full arc of the marshmallow experiment means not only choosing to endure a little longer but working to help the Americans for whom the choice to wait is most difficult.Ezekiel J. Emanuel is the vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, where Connor Boyle is a researcher in the department of medical ethics and health policy."
eugeneweekly_2020_21,"We ve got issues. “Safe” at home, I’ve been watching a pandemic, wrapped in a depression, with tales told by an idiot genius, hoping things will return to a new normal. Except the old normal wasn’t or isn’t so great for a lot of people. To be sure, this isn’t the first pandemic to strike this continent. The common cold, flu, syphilis, gonorrhea, smallpox, devastated Indigenous populations. Healthy doses of the memes justifying colonialism, and white supremacist Manifest Destiny, accompanied the germs, and helped establishing endemic underlying conditions of a new normal. Intersectional discrimination became the new normal. Primary symptom of this infection is an inability to remember what came before, especially that which you are doomed to repeat. Recalling the ’92 Rebellion in Los Angeles (riots are spontaneous, rebellions are planned , two-thirds of the arrestees were not Black. Meaning, more people are suffering American inequities than Black people, though we are a sort of very visible indicator species. What was once done to us because of race is now being done to others for the money. Dogs and firehoses in the ’50s turn to peppergas, bean bag rounds and drone surveillance in the 21st century. Even in Eugene, where the white anarchists, white supremacists, white vandals outnumber the BIPOC peaceful protesters, that seems to reflect a national trend. What happened to Rodney King was a well known, commonplace experience in communities of color. So, nobody believes us, until a white man video tapes the beating? Still the cops are acquitted, because “Strange Fruit” is always in season, not just in the South. Training officer Derek Chauvin, even while being videotaped using a known kill move on a suspected fake $20 bill passer, didn’t feel there were going to be any negative consequences for his actions, even lying on his report of the incident. He was setting an example for the cops of color, witnessing George Floyd’s death: This is the expected behavior because the only color you need to see is blue. While I am heartened by the condemnation by the law enforcement and legal community, I am sobered by my long career as a mandatory reporter. How do you abolish the police, and still provide protection for kids facing sex slavery, child abuse and other common horrors? I’m not aware of any civilization reaching our level of urban complexity that hasn’t had somebody enforcing the behavioral norms of society, especially when those norms were unjust. When it was the law that it was illegal for people of color to be on Eugene streets after dark, because it was also illegal for them to live within the city limits, I’m sure the cops, sheriffs, banks, chamber of commerce and many citizens enforced those behavioral and legal norms. The resulting low ethnic minorities in the city, state and county was an intentional feature of the permanence of racism. So breaking the windows of businesses does nothing to dissolve the bedrock of systemic discrimination. Renaming Deady Hall, by itself, does nothing to the curriculum taught inside those walls nor racist attitudes of math teachers. No more than tearing down the Pioneer statuary changes neither the urbane, nor the bucolic expressions and manifestations of institutional racism within the university, or the city, county and state within which it resides. It’s progress to switch the name of a dorm, from Eugene Klan #3 Exalted Cyclops Frederick Dunn, to Black Architect DeNorval Unthank, and I supported that. But Dee’s future wife had a cross burned in front of her sorority and was ejected from that sorority because she was dating a Black man. Her ejection was supported by a woman whose family name graces another prominent building at the University of Oregon. I wish the Math Department in Deady Hall could find a way to mathematically measure, therefore predict, the degree of racist meme infection, a sort of memetic viral load, to assess the degree of feverish delusional supremacy someone labors under. Apply quarantine, isolation, social distancing, before they infect others with their deadly strain. Perhaps they could partner with the Psychology Department, which could be part of the movement within that field to declare how racism might affect and infect people emotionally and psychologically: ethnic identity dysphoria. Devise at least a talking cure. The utility of such mathematical precision and psychological healing could be useful to prevent needless injury and death. What strain of racist meme infected Dylan Roof to commit racist mass murder in a church, and then have the arresting officers take him to Burger King on the way to jail? What strain prevented officers from simply taking a drunk Black man home, to sleep it off, rather than illegally shooting him in the back when he ran away, still drunk, in fear, apparently justifiably so? What anti-racist vaccine can increase our common humanity, and compassion, and help reduce the impact of the disasters we find ourselves in. I think I remember the cure.

minnpost_2020_2,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .For a court known for using a lot of words in its opinions, the Supreme Court’s decision inTexas v Pennsylvaniawas brief:The State of Texas’s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.Lawyers understood what the Supreme Court decided, but what about everyone else The explanation invites the conclusion that President Donald Trump lost on a technicality called “standing.” Standing is based upon Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which limits federal courts to hearing only cases and controversies in which a person has suffered actual harm. If those bringing the suit can’t prove that they have been harmed, federal courts lack authority to rule on the case.Texas argued that “the Defendant States have not only tainted the integrity of their own citizens vote but have also debased the votes in Plaintiff State and other States that remained loyal to the Constitution.” A remarkable number of Republican elected leaders endorsed this argument, including Reps. Pete Stauber, Jim Hagedorn and Tom Emmer of Minnesota. Emmer argued that our nation cannot tolerate “a kaleidoscope of different rules.”“Debasement” sounds serious, but our nation has a tradition of profoundly different approaches to who can vote and how they can do so. Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Washington and California granted women the right to vote long before the Constitution required it. Does anyone think Texas had the right to stop those women from voting Those women were surely debasing the men’s-only voting club in Texas.Several years ago, PETA brought a suit to challenge the conditions in which the Washington, D.C., Zoo kept its elephants and brought an identical suit in Canada. The U.S. courts summarily dismissed the Washington suit, holding that PETA lacked standing to sue. PETA was not an elephant, so it suffered no harm. Two Canadian justices applied similar logic on the PETA Canadian suit. But Chief Justice Catherine Fraser wrote: “Lucy’s case raises serious issues not only about how society treats sentient animals … but also about the right of the people in a democracy to ensure that the government itself is not above the law.”Did the Supreme Court decision deprive the people of the forum to ensure that the government (in this case the four states Texas sued was not above the law The simple answer is no.When Al Gore lost the presidential election as a result of the 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court he said, “I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College,” he said. “And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”President Trump in response to his 9-0 loss in the Supreme Court called the decision “a disgraceful miscarriage of justice.” He unleashed a barrage of tweets, among them: “I WON THE ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE, but remember, I only think in terms of legal votes, not all of the fake voters and fraud that miraculously floated in from everywhere! What a disgrace!”Trump vows to fight on, and he has allies. Texas Republican Chairman Allen West wrote: “The Supreme Court in tossing the Texas lawsuit that was joined by 17 states and 106 U.S. Congressman, has decreed that a state cannot take unconstitutional actions and violate its own election law. Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the Constitution.”When Richard Nixon was on the precipice of impeachment and tearing our country apart a group of Republican leaders went to the White House and told him in unmistakable terms something he did not want to hear: Your presidency is over and you must accept that. The times have changed.By joining Texas, state attorneys general and members of Congress inflamed the divisions our nation is experiencing.No one likes to lose an election, particularly if it is close. But the drumbeat of false allegations about what actually happened in this election has undermined the legitimacy not just of the presidency of Joe Biden but of our democracy. This calculated drumbeat has resulted in Republicans overwhelmingly viewing the election as fatally flawed. A Quinnipiac University poll found that only 23 percent of registered Republican voters and slightly less than half of all white men who are registered to vote said that Biden’s victory was legitimate.Not every elected Republican bought into the Texas lawsuit or the amicus briefs filed by Republican leaders. Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon put it succinctly,” The relief that Texas seeks would undermine a foundational premise of our federalist system: the idea that states are sovereigns, free to govern themselves. The courts have no more business ordering the People’s representatives how to choose their electors than they do ordering the People how to choose their dinners.”We are in a far different place from in 1974 when Republican leaders finally concluded that Richard Nixon committed impeachable offenses Accepting that Nixon committed impeachable offense was not easy for those Republicans. They exhibited courage. It surely is harder to determine what the facts were to find an impeachable offense than to throw millions of votes in the trash can and falsely claim that Trump got more votes than Biden. Disenfranchising roughly 10 million people in the four defendant states is, to put it mildly, a very undemocratic act.All of this seems destined to further divide us. There are recriminations flying all over. There are calls to disbar Trump’s lawyers. There are accusations of sedition against the congressional leaders who signed on to the amicus brief for Texas — and even calls not to seat them in the next Congress.Trump lost more than 50 cases contesting some aspect of the election. At least 86 judges — ranging from state courts, federal courts to the United States Supreme Court — rejected at least one post-election lawsuit filed by Trump or his supporters. Rarely were the cases dismissed because of standing. They were dismissed because there is no credible evidence the election was unfair or rigged. None of this is healthy for our democracy. And regrettably there seems to be no end in sight.Kevin S. Burke recently retired as a trial judge on theHennepin County District Court.He is a past president of theAmerican Judges Association."

The restoration of trusted FAA oversight is a necessary step to set Boeing back on course as aviation’s longtime leader.At last, Congress has undone disastrous Federal Aviation Administration policy that abetted Boeing’s lapses in pushing the unsafe 737 MAX to market. The restoration of trusted FAA oversight is a necessary step to set Boeing back on course as aviation’s longtime leader.Legislation that passed Congress Dec. 21, championed by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., rolls back Boeing’s ability to control much of the certification process for its aircraft. Misguided attempts to streamline federal policy and help Boeing throughout the years improperly ceded too much of the FAA’s responsibilities to the manufacturer.As a Senate Commerce Committee report this month showed, Boeing abused this free hand, limiting the FAA’s ability to spot flaws in the 737 MAX that would have been expensive to fix. The federal agency compliantly went along, setting off a chain of systematic failures. FAA test pilots were “inappropriately coached” about cockpit logistics, that report found. Flight control systems that should have been reviewed holistically were presented in fragmentary fashion. Whistleblowers rightly alarmed about this way of doing business faced unethical retaliations. It took two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people to force Boeing to ground its global 737 MAX fleet.The reform legislation correctly restores the paramount role airplane safety must play in FAA’s oversight of all manufacturers, including Boeing. The upside-down thinking that implemented paid incentives for federal inspectors to meet manufacturers’ certification deadlines has correctly been stopped. The FAA now directly oversees engineers responsible for safety work, and has a mandate to review systems design changes in their full cockpit context. These and other fixes arrived too late to prevent the 737 MAX disaster, but they can help Boeing restore its reputation — and market leadership — by enforcing rigorous safety requirements.The downturn throughout the aerospace industry created by the COVID-19 pandemic gives Boeing and the FAA a bit of breathing room to recreate a functional relationship. Boeing’s next aircraft, the 777X, won’t be delivered until 2022. For Boeing’s sake, and other manufacturers’, the FAA must work intensively to show international regulators its certification can be trusted, as aviation analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham News and Analysis told this editorial board. If unable to trust FAA assessment, other nations’ regulators conduct their own certifications, slowing the aircraft market for all.“Boeing and the FAA have a lot of credibility to restore,” he said, “and I think it’s going to take a long time to do that.”The reforms negotiated by Cantwell and her Commerce counterpart, committee chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., help reassert the primacy of safety in the FAA’s certification process. The regulatory agency’s responsibility to the flying public must not again become captive to Boeing’s conflicting motive to turn a profit.— The Seattle TimesThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_140,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minneapolis-St. Paul is burning with rage while demonstrations continue around the nation. Politicians and television commentators pontificate about what should be done as people of all races, genders and faiths in the Twin Cities, Washington, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallas, New York, LA and other cities take to the streets to express their outrage.“As of mid-May, 22% of the Minnesota Department of Health’s interviews with people who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases required an interpreter — more than five times the proportion of the state’s population lacking fluency in English,”the Star Tribune reported. This also underscores the large newer immigrants of color settled in the state of Minnesota, many of whom live in the areas most damaged by the riots. This convergence lays bare the intersectional racial, immigration status, and health inequities plaguing the United States.African-Americans and other minorities understand well the much older, more insidious and harder to control disease plaguing this nation. Racism and congruent violence against black bodies defines American history. Alas, unlike COVID-19, this older disease cannot and will not be eradicated with stay-at-home orders and the wearing of masks. A vaccine to inoculate us against this illness remains elusive.These already vulnerable communities are now in a worse position than a week ago and their access to affordable goods is further reduced and even eliminated. The few destroyed and damaged big chain stores — including Target, Walgreens and Kmart — might take years to rebuild if they return at all. Those losing jobs in these areas are mostly people of color, whose job security was already devastated by COVID 19,The violence of the past week has worsened the emotional and physical racial wounds defining the nation. It is certainly painful to watch the burned infrastructure. These shocking images, however, might finally draw our attention to the burning and violence that is a daily reality in the neighborhoods many of our citizens live in and where policing and brutality are synonymous, where racial profiling and segregation persist. While an African-American might lead the Minneapolis Police Department, the deeply entrenched law enforcement culture that criminalizes black men since the era of slavery remains. Changing one individual at the top is not going to change the culture and structures of violence against communities of color. It might only serve as tokenism for those most resistant to reforms.A key takeaway from the tragic events in Minnesota over the last week might be that young people of all races, genders and creed are in desperate search for credible leadership and trust in their police force. They are revolting to get attention and they are using the tools our law enforcement has given them. They are coming of age with institutions using violence against them, and we cannot and should not be surprised that some respond with violence, as abhorrent as violence is.If we want young people to act differently, our society, our leaders and most importantly our institutions must act differently. If we don’t urgently transform these institutions to more just and more accountable bodies, America’s youth will continue their rage and revolt against injustices for decades to come.Cawo M.

suffolknewsherald_2020_94,"Published 10:07 pm Tuesday, June 9, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Kenya SmithMatthew 5:1-12 is a remarkably familiar passage of scripture that many know as the Beatitudes or the Sermon on the Mount. In this passage, Jesus gives a sermon about the kind of qualities that God will bless. One verse that caught my attention was verse 9, where Jesus says, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.” Peace means “freedom from disturbance” or “a state in which there is no war or fighting.” Let’s look at what it means to be a peacemaker.Many people mistake peacemaking with peacekeeping, but these two words have entirely different meanings. Peacemaking is simply “the process of bringing about peace, especially by reconciling adversaries.” With peacemaking, there is a desire to seek long-term sustainable solutions. Peacemaking does not mean having polite agreements or fragile truces to difficult issues. It also does not mean to avoid conflict or to hold back honest emotions, thoughts and opinions, especially when it comes to injustices. When we avoid conflict and tough conversations, we are practicing peacekeeping. For true peace to be kept, it must first be made. How can you keep something that has not yet existed? That is why you hear protesters cry out the usual phrase, “No justice, no peace!”A good example of peacemaking is the Civil Rights Movement. In a time where it was made clear on signs, windows and in law that African Americans were not welcomed in American society, activists decided to step up and speak out against racial discrimination in various areas of life such as education, public transportation, housing, voting and employment. While activists like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. engaged in nonviolent demonstrations, a lot of people still saw the activists and their demonstrations as a threat to their comfortable ways of living. Does this remind you of today? Even eight Alabama clergymen wrote an op-ed that criticized Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement. They considered the demonstrations as “unwise” and “untimely” and insisted that they be delayed. This is an example of peacekeeping.America faces some challenging days ahead due to the trend of calling 911 on black individuals such as Christian Cooper and the senseless murders of black individuals by law enforcement and strangers such as George Floyd, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. We are seeing a surge of demonstrations demanding that society would dismantle the centuries-long practice of systemic racism in various arenas of life, especially in the arena of law and order. Due to 400 years of slavery, Jim Crow and subtle, systemic racism, our black communities are saying that enough is enough. We can no longer tolerate racial injustices in 2020 and from here on. Now is the time to make true peace instead of keeping fake peace. Please keep this ball for justice and equality rolling. Continue to speak out against various forms of racism. Continue to march and protest, because when Black lives matter, then all lives will matter. #BlackLivesMatterKenya Smith is a Suffolk native.

minnpost_2020_70,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We are not happy. Arecent Gallup pollrecorded the lowest levels of national pride in two decades. The same survey also recorded that only 20 percent of those polled were satisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. at this time, a four-year low. The New York Times recently asked reporters in key battleground states to take the pulse of voters on the extraordinary events of the past few months and found one unifying trend: Voters on all sides of the political spectrum seem to think “it’s all screwed up.” In recent years writers on both therightandlefthave declared the American experiment to be in serious trouble. In a moment dominated by pandemic, recession, and social strife it is hard not to feel like we are careening toward some type of apocalypse, if we aren’t there already. And it is not hard to see why many of us feel pessimistic. But amidst the chaos, confusion, and uncertainty one thing has been made undeniably clear: The founding ideals of this country are valid and true.When the founders stated that we were all created equal they no more discovered the truth of human equality than Columbus discovered America. But they did clearly, forcibly, and legally, state it and make it a central tenet of our national structure. It is an idea so revolutionary and threatening to historical power structures that those in power have since spent nearly 250 years trying every conceivable device to qualify that statement, walk it back, and dilute the power of its underlying truth. But the force of this truth has not been weakened, even as its implementation in public policy has been stilted, backward, and often purposefully counterproductive.It may be a little too optimistic to say that arc of history inevitably bends toward justice but the undeniable and immovable truth is that the idea of equality has power precisely because it is a self-evident truth. I would argue that the American “experiment” is not in peril; it is over. The results are in and they are clear: Human equality — the fact that we are all equally valuable members of a human community and all equally worthy of life, liberty, and love – is not only a viable foundation for government, it is the only enduring principle of human community that matters. We are in this together. We are here for each other. We can no longer afford to be merely experimenting with these ideas.Of course, demographics are not necessarily destiny; while the diversification of the American population has been on asteady upward trend since 1940, the progress toward equality for minority groups has been halting at best. And while some might dismiss the idea that future generations of Americans will be more open minded as a longstanding excuse for inaction in the present, recent years have seen real and concrete shifts in the American psyche. Long-held social norms on topics such as LGBTQI rights, sexual harassment, and racial equality are rapidly shifting or undergoing renewed and intensified scrutiny. Much of this is being driven by millennials and the new generation z, who, along with gen xers, arenow outvoting baby boomersand all other older generations. We are changing. The future is fast approaching and what happens next is anyone’s guess.That kind of uncertainty is ample reason to be anxious. But there is also ample reason to be optimistic about the next chapter of American history because the people now assembling in the streets are not demanding that we overthrow our original ideas; they are demanding that we live up to them. This is not a counter-revolution, this is the original American revolution, carried forth through the decades in an ongoing struggle to fulfill the ambition of our founding creed.To do so we will have to change. We need to make voting easier, not harder. We should get rid of the caucusing system. We need to de-politicize our judiciary and take a serious look at Supreme Court reform. We need to get rid of the Electoral College. We need a truly progressive tax system, real action on climate change, honest engagement on gun safety, and to completely reimagine policing and community well-being. And we can’t just change our laws and policies, we have to change our minds. We will have to change how we see each other and see ourselves. We have to look hard at and reckon with the sins of our past.This is long and difficult work. Some who have grown accustomed to privilege and comfort will have to relinquish advantages and experience discomforts. But adversity and struggle are the stuff of greatness, privilege and comfort the stuff of mediocrity. And make no mistake, we are a great nation founded on great ideas. America is not Mom and Apple Pie. America is the assertion that every single human being — regardless of sex, gender identity, ethnicity, race, religion, non-religion, net worth, place of birth — has value and deserves the chance to be happy.Nearly 160 years ago, President Abraham Lincoln addressed a warring nation and called for a new birth of freedom. On that November day in 1863 the very existence of our nation was in the balance and the true meaning of our creed at the center of the crisis. From that precipice, a young nation barely holding off a surging rebellion, we went on to become one of history’s most prosperous and influential nation states. We not only survived, we improved; we made ourselves be better. We’ve done it before, we can do it again. This is perhaps our greatest superpower as a nation: the ability to reimagine ourselves in closer and closer approximations of our best ideals.A more perfect union is by no means inevitable, but it is absolutely possible, maybe now more than ever.JohnPattersonis a professional humanitarian, Navy veteran, and Minnesota native."
suffolknewsherald_2020_206,"Published 5:13 pm Tuesday, October 6, 2020ByStaff ReportsA month ago, the Suffolk community first learned of the Suffolk School Board’s intention to level another restriction against free speech and transparency by regulating who can speak at its meetings.The proposed change to policy said that only members of the “Suffolk community” could speak at meetings. After realizing that was too vague, the board at least had the good sense to define what that means in its revised proposed policy.However, we remain against the policy change, because it leaves too many people out and because we believe it is unnecessary.In the revision, members of the Suffolk community were defined as such: any resident of Suffolk; any parent or legal guardian of a child enrolled in SPS; any business owner licensed to conduct business in the city; any person who owns property in Suffolk; any employee of SPS; and any student enrolled in SPS.They surely hit all of the main categories that are needed, but this proposed policy still leaves people out — some very important people.It leaves out Grandma and Grandpa who live in Chesapeake or Carrollton or Gates County and really enjoy driving to Suffolk to volunteer at their grandchild’s school. They have some excellent input about their volunteerism that they would like the entire board to hear, but SPS volunteers aren’t listed in this policy, nor are grandparents unless they are also the child’s guardian.It leaves out leaders in major regional industries and economic drivers like the shipyards, the port, the military, colleges and universities and others. They want to talk about how SPS prepares its students for the real world, but they can’t, unless that particular person also happens to live in or own property in Suffolk.It leaves out experts in their field and movers and shakers in the nonprofit world who might have valuable input on the topic of the day — again, unless that particular person also happens to live in or own property in Suffolk.It leaves out former employees, unless they happen to live in Suffolk, who may want to advocate on behalf of their colleagues still in the system who may not feel they are able to speak out.It leaves out alumni of Suffolk Public Schools who want to discuss their insights as a graduate now trying to navigate the world — once again, unless they happen to live in or own property in Suffolk.The number of people who could have valuable input but wouldn’t be permitted to speak under this new policy is incalculable. One wonders if exceptions will be granted. If exceptions will be granted to virtually everyone, this policy will become meaningless. If exceptions will be granted only to a select few, what will be the basis for determining to whom to grant exceptions?We again question whether this policy is even necessary. We’re not seeing a line of non-Suffolkians around the block on Market Street waiting to waste the board’s time talking about nonsense.We’re again encouraging the board to give up its relentless push to make SPS less transparent and accessible and focus on the business at hand — providing 14,000 Suffolk youngsters a rigorous, well-rounded education as safely and efficiently as possible.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_156,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’m a member of the Minneapolis University Rotary Club, one of 34,000 member clubs in this worldwide service organization. Our club is a small one, about 25 members, and we’re a diverse group: people from eight different countries; many faiths; and a range of ages, occupations, and lifestyles.A few years ago, Erica Fields was president of the club. Erica owns and runs a successful grain marketing business and she is involved in many local activities. Erica has an unusual story.From the time she was very young, she knew she was a girl – but she was assigned male at birth and was raised as a boy. She grew up in the Twin Cities, became involved in business and community issues, married, and had children. She followed this expected path because of the social and personal perils of acknowledging her identity, which she hid until she was in her 50s. Her subsequent courage and honesty with friends, family, and business associates helped smooth her journey, and today she is a leading advocate for LGBTQ rights.Our Rotary club features a speaker at every weekly meeting, an expert in politics, sports, business, public affairs, etc. One week, Erica invited Leslie Lagerstrom to speak.Leslie talked about her child Samantha, who at age 4 announced that she wasn’t a girl; she was a boy. Samantha’s assertions continued as the years went on. Leslie and her husband listened – and took their child to the University of Minnesota, where Samantha’s eventual transition to Sam was guided by world-renowned specialists. Today Sam is a successful Minnesota business professional, leading the life he was meant to have.Leslie founded the organization Transparenthood. She speaks to educators, parents, and medical professionals about challenges facing young people and their families during gender transition and how to support individuals, families, and communities.There is no good time and no smooth path. For many transgender people, life is extraordinarily difficult.A pending case against the Anoka-Hennepin School District and School Board illustrates the bullying, isolation, alienation, and marginalization that many transgender youth and adults experience regularly.N.H. is a transgender man who came out shortly before he began his freshman year at Minnesota’s Coon Rapids High School in 2015. Before N.H. started school, the principal and other staff assured N.H.’s mother that he would be safe and the school community would be respectful of his transgender status. N.H. joined the boys swim team and used the boys’ locker room with his teammates without any problems.In February 2016 the School Board held a closed meeting and decided to prohibit N.H. from using the boys’ locker room that he had used for months.His mother repeatedly asked the School Board to follow gender-inclusion policies like those of the Minneapolis and St. Paul Public Schools districts but the board refused, insisting that N.H. would be disciplined if he used the boys’ locker room. The School Board forced him to use a changing facility that no other student had to use.This segregated N.H. from his classmates. He had been doing well academically and socially until the intervention from the Anoka-Hennepin School Board, which triggered bullying and threats from classmates.This harassment led N.H. to multiple hospitalizations for trauma, and he eventually switched schools, which Sam had also done. National data show that 78% of youth who express a transgender or gender non-conforming identity while in grades K-12 experience harassment, and that harassment is so severe that almost one-sixth had to leave school. Fully a third of the youth report physical assault.The American Civil Liberties Union-MN and Gender Justice are suing the Anoka-Hennepin School District and its School Board for discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act and violating N.H.’s rights to equal protection and due process under the Minnesota Constitution.The Anoka-Hennepin School Board’s policy regarding N.H. is much more than a local locker room issue, and it is not unique. The district was previously under a five-year consent decree to deal with allegations of anti-LGBTQ harassment following a different lawsuit after at least eight students committed suicide in two years.Approximately 40% of transgender adults and youth will attempt suicide in their lifetimes. Experiences that amplify the risk of suicide for transgender people include alienation and marginalization, the lack of systems of support, and a lack of acceptance at school, in outside activities, and at work.FBI hate crimes data for 2018 showed a 34% increase in violent hate-based attacks on transgender people over the previous year. Yet, as of fall 2019, Minnesota is one of only 20 states and Washington, D.C., with laws that address hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Stand up for and with LGBTQ people in your neighborhood, your workplace, your school, and your faith community.

suffolknewsherald_2020_82,"Published 9:21 pm Tuesday, June 16, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Phil FergusonThe death of George Floyd was tragic, senseless and wrong. Nobody condones what happened to Mr. Floyd, and it should not happen again.At the same time, in some cities, there has been violence, looting and serious property damage. Police officers in some cities have been injured and murdered. Likewise, these actions are tragic, senseless and wrong and should not happen again.In contrast, in Suffolk, protests and marches have been peaceful, with no violence or destruction of property. This is the way protests should occur. Those that have chosen to protest have done so lawfully and should be commended.In Suffolk, a real effort has been made for some time for law enforcement to work with the community. Capt. Lance Callis recently stated he works “for the finest police department in Virginia and that in Suffolk, we have an incredible relationship with our citizens and we demand professionalism, compassion and fairness from our officers.” As commonwealth’s attorney for the city of Suffolk, my experience with the Suffolk Police Department is that they do exactly that.The Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office does the same. Our philosophy is that first and foremost, our goal is to educate the public and prevent crimes from occurring. By taking this approach, we try to reduce the number of people who are victimized and the number of people who are charged with crimes. If that doesn’t work, then we prosecute cases to ensure that justice is served, which is what the law requires. Among commonwealth’ s attorneys’ offices, the Suffolk Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office has one of the most, if not the most, extensive community outreach programs in Virginia. This past year, we attended 142 community outreach events and made more than 20,000 citizen contacts, of which 8,662 were young people under the age of 18, and distributed more than 4,875 brochures and 1,885 crime prevention awareness items.Each year, we go into the Suffolk Public Schools to educate the youth on a variety of topics including gangs, the importance of avoiding them, and the consequences of becoming involved in one. These efforts are designed to keep young people from becoming involved as defendants in the criminal justice system, so instead, they can become well educated and productive citizens.Currently, we have had eight Citizens Academies for adults 18 or older, in which we explain everything we do in the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office. As a part of the Academy, the other four constitutional officers, likewise explain what services their offices provide to the Community. In addition, we have had eight CSI Forensics Camps for youth 12-15 years of age. Each of these events are free and are done with existing staff.Through our community outreach program, we have 15 PowerPoint presentations, one annual Citizens Academy, one annual CSI Forensics Camp, two interactive mock trials, scheduled court tours, and 26 public awareness brochures on various topics.Through our outreach program, we have helped to protect the elderly population by implementing educational and crime prevention programs, which help keep senior citizens from becoming victims of abuse, fraud, scams and other types of crimes.Annually, we participate in Suffolk’s award-winning National Night Out crime prevention event with the entire Suffolk community and our public safety partners, including the Police Department, Sheriff’s Office, and Suffolk Fire & Rescue, all of whom are heavily involved in community outreach.As a result of all of the education and prevention efforts we undertake, Suffolk is a low crime city and a city where people want to live. My philosophy is simple: every person should feel safe in the community in which they live. This can occur only when public safety agencies are working together with the people living within those communities. This type of cooperative relationship between public safety agencies and the community is essential for a city to be safe and great. Suffolk is such a city and is a model for others.Should any church, civic group or other organization wish for the Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office to make a presentation or participate in any other community outreach endeavor, please contact Joan Turner, community outreach coordinator, at 514-4379 or jrtumer@suffolkva.us.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_46,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Elections can be stolen. But as repeated recounts and rebuked lawsuits prove, that didn’t happen in the U.S. this year.Elections can be stolen. But as repeated recounts and rebuked lawsuits prove, that didn’t happen in the U.S. this year.Belarus is another matter. It’s highly likely that an election was stolen in August by Alexander Lukashenko, who has cruelly ruled Belarus as president for 26 years. The widespread perception of theft in that vote should have galvanized the West. But the righteous protests in Belarus have been mostly drowned out by President Donald Trump’s phony claims in America.The situation is even more dire now that it’s known that the thuggish government in Minsk is torturing detainees, a crime attested to by Belarusian exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya. “Such crimes have only strengthened the conviction of the Belarusian people that Lukashenko has to go,” Tikhanovskaya wrote in The Washington Post. Tragically, many have paid heavy prices for their convictions. Several have died at the hands of security services, who according to reporting from the Economist are color-coding detained protesters to signal the severity of torture they face.These atrocities alone should inspire global support for the Belarusian people in their quest to jettison a despot, who’s been supported by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sees the former Soviet republic as Russia’s sphere of influence.Yet the West need not wade into this kind of geopolitical construct to be constructive, Olga Oliker, program director for Europe and Central Asia at the International Crisis Group, told an editorial writer. Oliker said via e-mail that “overall, the protesters … have, up to now, avoided framing their protests as a geostrategic contest. They are looking to get rid of Lukashenko, not to pick a side in someone else’s fight.”The U.S. can heed this objective while still rallying allies to speak up about Lukashenko’s abuse of power. To be sure, the West, including the U.S., has taken some steps, including expanded sanctions on some Belarusian officials. But Tikhanovskaya urges “more help from the United States, even in this complex transitional period.” She specifically calls for Congress to pass the Belarus Democracy, Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020, designed to widen the sanctions net and support media options to evade state censorship. “Access to information is the strongest weapon in our possession,” Tikhanovskaya wrote.Information has been key to previous success in the region, Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, told an editorial writer. “We won the Cold War not just because we beat them economically and militarily, but because our ideas were better and they believed in our political system,” Bremmer said. And yet, those ideas and the perception of our political system are now compromised from inside.“How can the United States,” Bremmer rhetorically asked, “possibly criticize other countries for their election practices when our own president is saying our election has been rigged and nothing is being done about it?”This is why Trump should speak out about Belarus’ election, not obsess over America’s, which he lost. The man who won, President-elect Joe Biden, is sending his own strong signal by inviting Tikhanovskaya to meet with him at his inauguration in an unmistakable message that America intends to reprise its role in protecting and projecting democracy and human rights.— Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minn."
minnpost_2020_89,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .President-elect Joe Biden is living up to his campaign promise to assemble a diverse group of Cabinet officers and top-level advisers.They bring a breadth of differences on gender, race, religion, and ethnicity. As Biden pledged, they do “look like America.”But there is one important category of diversity that has been overlooked: youth.The president-elect owes youthful voters, those between 18-29, who turned out in historically large numbers. More than 60 percent voted for him, helping carry him to victory, especially in some of the battleground states.But they are, as usual, being overlooked now. Their absence highlights a gap in diversity and inclusiveness, which ought to extend to age, too. That initiative is accentuated by former President Barack Obama’s exhortation the other day for the Democratic Party to pay more heed to the views of youthful voters. One way to do so is by placing them in positions of influence and power within the new administration.The president and his advisors can look to Minnesota for examples of how to extend opportunities to the young.Choosing youths for key decision-making roles may, some would say, be unrealistic because they have not attained experience in top-level jobs and maturity that would warrant their placement in important positions. But that’s a sorry shibboleth since many youths have the insight, judgment and other traits that contribute to good leadership, maybe even more so than their elders.How else can they acquire experience in top-flight spots without being given the opportunity to perform jobs of significanceThey certainly couldn’t be any worse than an octogenarian like Trump’s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose main notoriety has been falling asleep at meetings and impairing the Census by undercounting minorities. Or, Rudy Giuliani, the 76-year-old head of Trump’s post-election legal team, whose childish antics have been as off-putting as the regenerative hair dye trickling down his face.Minnesota provides a model to lead the way.Since 1976, the state has had a student holding an official position on the University Board of Regents, along with eight non-voting student representatives. All of them have served with distinction and perspicacity.Six years earlier, Minnesota was ahead of the curve when voters amended the state constitution to lower the long-standing voting age from 21 to 19, along with allowing anyone to qualify for public office at 21. About eight months later, in mid-1971, the 26th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, lowering the voting age to 18 across the board. But the provision allowing office holding at 21, lower than most other jurisdictions, including federal law, remains in effect here.Bills have been periodically introduced in the state Legislature, spearheaded by ex-legislator Phyllis Kahn of Minneapolis, to further lower the voting age to 16, although none has advanced to the floor in either house.But there’s more. Minnesota is one of about half a dozen jurisdictions whose employment laws bar discrimination against individuals of any age, whether old or young. It’s much broader than the parallel federal age discrimination law, which is restricted to employees or job applicants of age 40 or older.These measures provide the Biden team with ample possibilities.The incoming administration, from the 78-year-old president-elect on down, skews toward older individuals. But they constitute a shrinking percentage of the citizenry. Their over-representation in the Cabinet-to-be is a distortion of how America really “looks.” Placing some youthful men and women in key positions would create the kind of balance that Biden professes to seek. The incoming president should select some disabled people to fill the vacuum in that often-overlooked group, too.Appointing youthful officials also would be good politics. It would appeal to the nearly 54 million members of the electorate, one-sixth of the public, who are 18-29 years old; it would reward those who campaigned and voted for him; and it would be a way of reaching out to even the majority of white males in that age bracket who voted against him, fulfilling his pledge to be mindful of the interests of “those who did not vote for me.”It also would be fitting because Biden himself in 1972 was at 29 years old the youngest person ever elected to the Senate, and he barely reached the Constitutional minimum of age 30 when he was sworn in two months later.Now, nearly 50 years later, it’s time once again for youth to be served — and to serve.The writer is a Twin Cities constitutional and employment law attorney."
minnpost_2020_66,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“This is my megaphone … This is who I am. This is how I communicate. It’s the reason I got elected. It’s the reason that I’m successful.”So said President Donald Trump regarding his Twitter account, as revealed in Bob Woodward’s book“Fear: Trump In The White House.”You may not agree with the 45th president on a number of issues, but if Trump has been right about anything, it’s that he’s savvy about media, including social media. If you want to be “successful” on these platforms (get likes, shares, comments, followers, etc. , the more outrageous your performance, the better. In other words, spreading online outrage is a recipe for success on social media, especially political success.It’s no surprise, then, that online outragehas explodedon platforms like Twitter and Facebook, where there’s no shortage of partisan smearing. So has disinformation about social and political issues, such as the epidemic offalsehoods and conspiracy theories concerning the COVID pandemic. Evidently, this scourge of outrage and disinformation on social mediahas fueled extremist movements, including those thathijacked peaceful protests and incited violence in the Twin Cities, throwing extra discord into social unrest.Why do social media unleash so much online outrage and disinformation, especially about politics There are probably a couple of reasons.First, it’s inconvenient to communicate outrage face to face. When we have disagreements in person, we tend to keep it civil, because it’s draining to get into a shouting match. In contrast, communicating outrage is convenient online. It’s easier to trash others from behind a screen, where you don’t have to look at them directly and perceive their reactions. Indeed,studies showthat outrage is more common online than in person.Granted, many recognize online outrage and disinformation as problems. Unfortunately, as pandemics and unrest oblige us to stay home,social media use is increasing, which meansonline outrage and disinformation about social and political issues will increasetoo. That increase will likely make the pandemic and unrest even worse. True, Twitter discontinued political advertising and is trying to fact check posts, yet people will flame over politics regardless. Clearly, citizens bear some responsibility for restoring civility online, but we also must call on lawmakers and technologists to reform these platforms.So, in the spirit of civility and reform, here are a couple recommendations.Citizens: Be careful with outrage online, particularly when it comes to political discourse. Partisan proclamations on social media can come across as virtue signaling to one’s political tribe (and, by implication, shaming others , which rarely changes hearts and minds.Instead, let’s demand reform of social media. Of course, if you want to go a step further, leave social media altogether … at least until lawmakers and technologists fix these platforms. Which brings us to the second point.Lawmakers and technologists: It’s time to rethink, redesign, and regulate social media in a socially conscious way. On the policy end, we need privacy rights and data protection laws to set reasonable limits on how big tech can collect and sell our personal information. Some places have already enacted such legislation, including the California, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar has introducedsimilar legislationon the national level.On the professional end, we need to rethink the design of social media. Theoretically, social media could provide useful tools for havingconversations with diverse viewpoints, as opposed to spreading outrage-inducing disinformation within echo chambers. Reforming social media to bring out the better angels of our nature is worth considering in this time of divisiveness over pandemics and unrest, not just to help fix our politics, but also for the sake of our social and psychological well-being.Christopher Cocchiarella is a training and development specialist with a background in technical communication and user experience.

(We recently brought it back but had to temporarily cease during the current pandemic. When we started that feature the first time around, I was an impossibly young reporter who had been working here at the paper for less than a year. I was 23 years old, at an age and point in my career that now seems a lifetime ago.One of the first people I interviewed for that weekly feature was a gentleman named Otha Rountree.Otha volunteered at the front desk of Sentara Obici Hospital, and had done so for quite some time already when I interviewed him. He answered the hospital’s main line and transferred calls, and gave information and directions to people who walked in the hospital’s front door.He wasn’t the only volunteer who did this job, but his collection of funny hats certainly made him stand out.A search of our online archives has failed to turn up my original story, but I do believe Otha was wearing a hat that looked like a burger when I interviewed him. I distinctly recall leaning against the front desk of Obici Hospital doing the interview and being amused by his hat and his sense of humor. I recollect that I felt honored to be in his presence. And I remember he and his coworkers describing to me the way the hats oftentimes put people at ease when they visited the hospital.It was something I understood only in theory then, but I’m now at a point in my life where I’ve had a number of occasions to walk into hospitals feeling apprehensive, stressed, or devastated about my own health or that of a family member or friend. Most of them weren’t Obici, and I feel certain a genuinely caring person wearing a funny hat would have lightened my load on most of those occasions.I likewise feel certain that Otha’s sense of humor, compassion and, yes, his hats did that for so many people who passed through Obici’s doors throughout the years. A News-Herald story I found from 2013 said Rountree had, at that point, contributed 11,500 volunteer hours, and that wasn’t even the end of his volunteerism. He continued for several years beyond that until his health began to fail him. Even a conservative estimate of the number of people he served over that period of time runs well into the hundreds of thousands.The front desk at Obici will never be the same, and Otha has now exchanged all his funny hats for a crown.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Some of the local politicos did not want it, because it was too close to their residence and the noise could possibly disturb their sleep. Secondarily, the proposed design height of 35 feet would limit the development of their constituents’ properties due to the height requirements of the mast of pleasure sailing crafts.Out of the blue came a proposal that the bridge be relocated and connected to Godwin Boulevard, State Route 10, between the village of Chuckatuck and the Reid’s Ferry Area, as a large tract of land could be developed. The Virginia Department of Transportation then apparently shelved the project on the local disagreement.It is my humble opinion the Kings Highway Bridge should be constructed near its former location. If the city approves the new location on Godwin Boulevard, the city of Suffolk should be prepared to go to the expense to widen Godwin Boulevard to a four-lane roadway, since it is presently at maximum capacity of vehicles per day. Godwin Boulevard at Kings Fork Road carries approximately 23,000 vehicles per day and in the village of Chuckatuck, the Route 10 and Route 125 intersection carries approximately 13,000 vehicles per day.I’m confident the city has already told the consulting firm of their expectations.G.

Moms and dads in 2020, worldwide, have had a very rough year, too.Whatever you believe about Christmas, consider Mary and Joseph: they take on life-and-death situations and, together, raise an extraordinary son. Moms and dads in 2020, worldwide, have had a very rough year, too.This season, let’s rebuild relationships and work to preserve our heritage of a free society where we voluntarily help one another’s families.Extended family and civil society—generations working hand-in-hand—can get us through.Unfortunately, two-parent families in America are in trouble, and kids suffer the results. More than one in three kids are raised without both parents in the home. For Black, non-Hispanic kids, that number is two in three.“This form of family inequality leaves many working-class and poor children ‘doubly disadvantaged,’” University of Virginia sociologist Brad Wilcox says. They have “less money and an absent parent.”Meanwhile, the U.S. fertility rate has been declining. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reports another 1% decline in 2019. That’s a total fertility rate of 1.7 births per mother, “another record low for the nation.”Having kids tends to track economic stability. Young people after the Great Recession of 2008 often struggled to afford the lifestyles they thought they needed for children. The extreme conditions of 2020 are likely to see a lot more decisions to put kids on hold.And 2020 had lockdowns. Interaction with extended family and the rest of civil society went way down. But one of the best defenses against loneliness, mental illness, and financial instability is the resilience we build when surrounded by loving family members and neighbors.If quarantines have taught us anything, it’s to cherish what a healthy family can share. A family is often its own safety net.In 2021, we have new opportunities to support families in our everyday lives and in local, state, and federal policy.Organizations like Communio help churches develop marriage ministries tailored to their congregations and communities. In partnership with more than 50 churches and organizations in Jacksonville, Florida, Communio reduced the divorce rate by 24 percent over three years.Policies that subsidize contraception and abortion give incentives to keep kids away. In contrast, accommodating women and men who become parents gives incentives for healthy families. Flex time and paid leave can be good choices for companies to retain their employees.At the federal level, the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program helps colleges offer vouchers to college student-parents so that they can afford child care and stay in school. This does not have to be just a federal program — or a government program at all. A small amount of philanthropy here can go a long way.The conversation about student loan reform also should include early-career parents. Should pregnant women and their husbands be allowed to defer their student loans until they have no children under the age of kindergarten? That breathing room could enable many more graduates to pay their debts as they build their families.Parents and grandparents could be given larger contribution limits on flexible spending accounts for child care. The same limits could be created for health savings accounts.Wilcox identifies additional ways to support strong families. Ending the “marriage penalty” in programs for the poor could save couples up to 32% of their annual income when they get married.Anything that strengthens the employee side of the job market will tend to strengthen families — so rebalancing away from four-year liberal arts degrees into career and technical education makes sense. Most adults do not get a college degree, and we should not discount the dignity of any meaningful labor that supports a family.Wilcox also recommends a civil society campaign to strengthen marriage. People who follow the “success sequence” have much better lives. About 97% of people who follow the order of education, work, marriage then parenthood are not going poor. Their kids, one day, will thank them for it.When communities support the success sequence, teach it, preach it, and provide incentives for strong families with a strong job market, that is what we’ll get.

The first, although not the focus of the article, I related to personally. Every person should be able to wear their hair or “crown” how they like it. It’s how we can express ourselves as individuals. While I don’t have an afro, I do color my hair often and tend to keep more obscure hairstyles. I get looks, and the people that will occasionally ask, “Why do you do that to your hair?” But the point is that it shouldn’t matter to other people what you choose to do to your hair.Now if you go through such lengths to protect your hair, why wouldn’t you protect your life? As we have all become much more used to wearing masks in our everyday lives, it seems people are also starting to feel it’s not necessary anymore. “The wearing of PPE during this pandemic suggests that we love our neighbor as we love ourselves,” mentions the author. Even though it’s not always enforced as heavily as it was when Covid-19 was still new to us, I still choose to wear a mask out of respect for my neighbors.

minnpost_2020_101,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Public comments by New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees have reignited the controversy over NFL players and others kneeling while the national anthem is played as a means of protesting racial injustice. In fact, the issue probably never went away, and important questions remain, including whether kneeling is disrespectful and should be forbidden or whether trying to forbid it disrespects and infringes on free speech rights.Reasonable minds might differ as to the answers. While once seeming to support players’ right to express their views, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell later stated publicly that “Everyone should stand for the national anthem.” Perhaps his reversal was related to President Donald Trump’s Twitter tirades that seemed to threaten the many tax breaks that the NFL and its owners receive. Perhaps not.More recently, in the wake of George Floyd’s killing, Goodell has stated that the NFL condemns racism and the systematic oppression of Black people, was wrong in not listening to NFL players earlier, and encourages all to speak out and peacefully protest. It remains unclear whether that encouragement extends to kneeling for the anthem, and Goodell’s statement was widely criticized for its failure to mention, let alone apologize to, Colin Kaepernick. Regardless of the NFL response, though, I would argue that there is an overlooked element involved in the whole controversy – that we have, in fact, cheapened the national anthem’s significance by playing it in places and at times that are quite unnecessary.But many, including now Brees, who admittedly later apologized, have criticized NFL players and others who have used the anthem as a protest vehicle, claiming that their actions disrespect the anthem and all that it embodies. I have no doubt that the anthem deserves respect and that it reflects the values that we, as Americans, hold dear, even if those values often remain aspirational. I would argue, however, that if we want the anthem to resonate with those values, we should ensure that we do not cheapen it by playing it at every conceivable opportunity. For instance, why is it necessary to play the anthem before every regular season game of every professional sport Indeed, why is it necessary to play the anthem before every minor league gameIn this respect, we differ from all countries with which we compare ourselves where the anthem is reserved for the most significant of occasions. In Australian football, with which I am most familiar, the national anthem is played before two major games: the Grand Final (the equivalent of the Superbowl and on Anzac Day (Australia’s most sacred national day and not before every regular season game. This is by no means unusual. Other countries reserve their national anthems for undeniably special occasions.Of course, some will argue that it is playing our anthem at so many gatherings that differentiates America from the rest of the world and that it is another example of American exceptionalism. America fought the revolutionary war and fought Britain again in 1812, and I believe the flag – but not the anthem – profoundly symbolizes the rights and freedoms that were hard won but often taken for granted, including the right to be united and the right to dissent. However, if we want to treat the anthem with the same deep respect that we show the flag, then we should not play it on every conceivable occasion. By doing so, we actually cheapen and hollow the message that the lyrics are meant to convey.Playing the anthem less does not convey any diminished patriotism and respect. Rather, it elevates the anthem to the special place it deserves in the hearts of every American.Stephen Arnott is an associate professor of legal studies at Hamline University.

But it also led to uncomfortable conversations with my four children (all under 10 years old — conversations for which I had neither planned nor prepared.Many hours behind the wheel in the middle of the country leads a driver to disregard the seemingly endless display of billboards — especially because most address only two themes: eternal punishment for not believing in Jesus, and abortion is murder. I respect others’ points of view — even when I disagree with them or their sensational use of outdoor media. Frankly, I have rarely regarded these signs — at best scoffing as I dismiss them as a nuisance or just background “chatter.”But I’ve also always been baffled by what I presume must be an expensive endeavor with little bang for a lot of buck. I’ve often wondered: to what endJust like the ploy of the candy in the retail checkout aisle, I realized this summer, might this be a similar approach That is, the billboards aren’t placed for the driver; they are there for the passengers. And really, tragically, the billboards are placed for the ones staring out the window, playing the license plate game, taking in the country, counting the cows and reading the signs — pouring over every letter, and picture, and word.If my children begging and pleading me to take them to Wall Drug after the fortieth “you’re almost there” sign wasn’t proof enough … indeed, children are impressionable.The Book of Proverbs charges us to “train up a child in the way s/he should go; and when s/he is old, s/he will not depart from it.” Millennia later, the Alter Rebbe taught that “when a child begins to speak, the parent should begin teaching the child verses of Torah.”I do believe they are akin to sponges. In fact, the most central prayer to Jewish liturgy – the Shema – emphasizes the parent’s responsibility explicitly. Parents need realize that one of the most basic tenets of parenting is educating our children, but that also means creating a safe space for discussion, providing deeper context, and reframed perspective.Road trips may provide us seemingly (and positively endless family time, but they are also force-feeding a baseline education that lacks nuance, condition, or discourse — all in the form of a plenitude of billboards. Which means: Before you take that road trip, realize that making sure you packed your bags may not be the only way you need to prepare.Rabbi Avi S.

As Abraham is on his way to do so, God asks him, “Where are you”Abraham replies, “Here I am,” and he begins to bind Isaac to the sacrificial altar. A messenger from God intervenes and a ram is given up instead.I’ve thought about Abraham’s answer, “Here I am,” which in Hebrew ishineni(hee-nay-nee .Modern scholars suggest that the question and the answer are not literal ones about Abraham’s physical presence; they are, instead, profound and searching words asking us to consider the implication of our actions.I am a sociologist and a professor. I had been teaching about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda for several years. In summer 2005 I went to Rwanda to meet with survivors and to learn about the almost insurmountable obstacles that exist in a post-conflict setting.When I returned to the university the following fall, I continued to teach about the crisis in Rwanda but with the deeply disturbing information from my travels.One day Ina Ziegler, a student in the class, came up to me after a discussion about the genocide. She said, “What are we going todoabout this”Ina essentially asked me, “Where are you” and I wasn’t able to answer ‘hineni,’ here I am. Ina thought everyone was asking that question – but she was the only one.Her question haunted me.Four months later I started the organization that today is World Without Genocide. Our mission is to educate and advocate: to educate people about genocides and mass atrocities in the past and those happening today and to advocate for laws and policies to protect innocent people, prevent violence and discrimination, support the prosecution of perpetrators, and remember those whose lives have been affected by violence.The crises in Rwanda also forced the international community to reflect on the question “Where are you” And, like me, the world could not respond with “Hineni, here I am.”On Dec. 9, 1948, the United Nations ratified the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The very next day, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was ratified. But we know that since the Holocaust, despite these important steps and the promise of ‘never again,’ there have been horrific mass tragedies in many places, including Rwanda.In 2001, a group of members from the United Nations General Assembly met in Canada. This International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS was to answer the question posed byKofi Annan, then UN secretary-general: “If humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica — to gross and systematic violations of human rights that affect every precept of our common humanity”This commission essentially asked global leaders, “Where are you” And they responded, “Hineni.” ICISS popularized the concept ofhumanitarian interventionunder the name of “Responsibility to Protect.”The work of ICISS was followed up at the United Nations 2005 World Summit with a document titled The Responsibility to Protect (R2P or RtoP that was endorsed by all member states of the United Nations. R2P is a political commitment with four key concerns: to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.The U.N. created an infrastructure to support these efforts. The Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect includes two Special Advisers who report directly to the U.N. secretary-general. TheSpecial Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, a position that began in 2004, raises awareness of the causes, dynamics, and current risks of genocide and advocates and mobilizes for action. TheSpecial Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, in place since 2008, leads the conceptual, political, institutional, and operational development of the Responsibility to Protect.This global commitment encourages international interventions when a state is unable or unwilling to protect the people within its borders. Then why are innocent people still targeted and persecuted in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, China, Artsakh, Ethiopia, and other places around the worldNot enough people are saying “Hineni, here I am.” But wearehere. We must raise our collective voices. We have the global tools. We need the political will.Leonard Cohen, on his last album before his death, sings “Hineni, hineni; I’m ready, my lord.” We are approaching days of increasing daylight, a new year, and a fresh start.

The genesis of the virus, how easily it spreads, whether it causes an illness worse than seasonal influenza, how many people it has really sickened and killed, the best ways to treat it and prevent its spread, the leadership (or lack thereof of elected and appointed officials at every level and the media’s coverage of all of these things have become flashpoints for disagreement, attacks and hate.If you needed any further evidence that America is polarized, look no further than the fact it’s usually pretty easy to tell the political leanings of a person simply by their thoughts on any of the above topics.That continued on Tuesday when Gov. Ralph Northam ordered all Virginians over the age of 10 to wear a mask indoors in public places.Now, Northam was already a polarizing figure before the pandemic started, having endured two contemporaneous scandals last year that centered on two of the most polarizing topics in the United States — race and abortion.But you would think that the importance of a simple measure that protects others from catching a serious illness and potentially dying is something on which everyone could agree. If you forgot for a second that we live in a divided nation, the reaction to Tuesday’s order surely reminded you.Opponents of Northam have already raised good questions about the mask order, including whether the governor has the constitutional or moral authority to issue such an order and whether it’s fair to expect business owners to police their own customers when professional law enforcement has been asked not to make arrests for violation of this order.It’s also reasonable to be concerned about government overreach in these times, but many of the same people fretting about it now were not concerned about pre-pandemic overreach that simply didn’t affect them.None of the concerns about the mask order itself should stop you from wearing a mask when indoors in a public place. Evidence shows it can help prevent the spread of the virus, and taking simple measures that could protect your family and neighbors should be of the utmost concern.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_41,"Published 9:34 pm Tuesday, July 21, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Tonya S. SwindellLearning and leading go hand in hand. We begin to value others when we seek to understand. Others’ views and opinions may not be our own. But they give us greater insight into another person’s road.When we learn and lead, it begins to make more sense how our words and actions could easily cause offense. When we choose to operate in a spirit of forgiveness, our attitudes change and impact our decisions. When we pause and listen, we begin to comprehend how kindness and compassion can cause a heart to mend.When we learn and lead, we engage in conversations that strengthen our resolve and improve our relations. When we listen to people’s stories and hear about their pain, we notice similarities and how we’re really quite the same. As we grow in empathy, we begin to see the need to respect one another’s boundaries and be accountable for our deeds.When we learn and lead we research our own history, then the source of our pain no longer remains a mystery. When we become bold enough to tell our own story, introspection and reflection become mandatory. Others may follow suit and do as we do while bridging a gap to this common truth: that we all have a life that has caused us heartaches and we desire to avoid unnecessary mistakes.Learning helps us lead with greater transparency, an open heart, an open mind and awareness of our inadequacy. When we get to know others and they get to know us, we learn to get along, not discriminate or show bias. When we share our hearts while revealing our deepest need, we quickly recognize our shared tendency to bleed.Learning about others is definitely not easy. It requires patience, sincerity and vulnerability. If we’re intentional about learning and do so willingly, the process can bring about a great amount of healing.When we learn and lead, we create a more perfect union of people with differences that are dedicated to the common good. Learning gives us grace to love instead of hate, while leading gives us the power to change and advocate. When our learning and leading is all said and done, our hope is that individuals come together as one.Learning about others doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It occurs over time as our relationships tend to bloom. Our efforts to know others can extend beyond our comfort zone to unfamiliar people that were previously considered unknown.Conversations that take place can broaden our perspective, cause listeners to hear and become more reflective. People can talk about the depth of their experience. They can bring greater clarity to events that once caused fear.As we learn and lead we make a very strong statement, that we value relationships more than one’s political affiliations. By being more invested in conversations that heal us, we build stronger bonds that deepen our levels of trust. As we learn to see life from another person’s side, may we lead by example and give peace a try.Tonya Swindell is an occupational therapist.

minnpost_2020_195,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“Why have we never learned about this before” This question is repeatedly asked by the high school juniors and seniors in my comparative genocide studies elective course, often with a tone of disbelief and urgency. While all have studied the Holocaust, only a few have learned about the genocides in Armenia and Rwanda, and rarely are students aware of the genocides that took place in German Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia , Cambodia, Darfur, or the many other so-called“hidden” genocidesthat we study. However, they are shocked and often angry when we examine the genocide perpetrated against Indigenous peoples in North America, especially the Dakota and Ojibwe nations in the state of Minnesota; “we should have learned about this before,” students say. As their teacher, I couldn’t agree more.Recognizing what many Dakota scholars, such asChris Mato NunpaandWaziyatawin, have been saying for years, the city councils of Minneapolis and St. Paul passedresolutionson the sesquicentennial of the U.S.-Dakota War acknowledging the genocide of the Dakota. The Minnesota Historical Society has alsobegun to use the term genocidein relation to the state’s history. Through my research and professional development work with educators, I have found that, in recent years, a small but growing number of social studies teachers have taken up settler colonialism and genocide frameworks in their classrooms. It is long overdue that the social studies standards reflect these shifts and promote a more truthful telling of Minnesota’s history.While I welcome these changes to the standards, unfortunately, the three references to the Holocaust and genocide that appeared in the 2011 social studies standards have been dropped from the initial draft of the proposed 2021 standards. I urge the committee to reinstate references to the Holocaust and other 20th- and 21st-first century genocides in the 2021 standards. Minnesota students must have opportunities to learn about the histories and legacies of genocide in both Minnesota and around the world.Genocide education has the potential to be transformative for individual students and whole communities and societies. Such education highlights the harmful effects of prejudice, racism, and discrimination while engendering attitudes of tolerance and underscoring the importance of standing up to and speaking out against acts of intolerance. Genocide education develops awareness of national and international institutions, laws, and norms, especially human rights, and raises awareness of pluralism and the value of diversity within a democracy. Genocide education also underscores how communities and societies that have been affected by genocide and mass violence — including many communities in Minnesota, such as theArmenian,Cambodian,Jewish, andUkrainiancommunities — have engaged in healing, seeking justice, education, and preserving culture and memory through recognition, commemoration, and memorialization efforts.In addition, the inclusion of language around Indigenous genocide and settler colonialism in the 2021 draft standards serves as a call for truth-telling in social studies classrooms regarding the histories and legacies of colonialism, genocide, and the continued violence against Indigenous people and communities. Such truth-telling can serve as a step toward justice, reparation, and healing within society. Indeed, to our north, Canada and the Province of Manitoba, which have more widelyacknowledgedtheir national and local histories of colonialism and genocide, have madechanges to social studies educationthat might serve as a model for Minnesota.However, it is also important to recognize the limits of the proposed changes to the standards. While the changes to the language in the standards are essential, much work still needs to be done to create and update curricula, equip practicing teachers, and educate aspiring teachers to bring genocide education, especially the difficult histories and legacies of genocide in Minnesota, into the state’s social studies classrooms.The public can comment on the first draft of the proposed social studies standards between now and Jan. 4 through anonline surveyandseries of virtual town hallsorganized by the Minnesota Department of Education.George D. Dalbo is a high school social studies teacher and Ph.D. candidate in social studies education in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University of Minnesota.

philinquirer_2020_25,"Our state needs to step up, now, to get rent and mortgage relief to Pennsylvanians.After months of unemployment and underemployment,more people than ever are on the verge of losing the place they call home. The coronavirus pandemic has taken our friends, our mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, sons, and daughters. The coronavirus has taken the lives of our communities’ bus drivers, nurses, sanitation workers, grocery cashiers, teachers, and many, many more. The pandemic has taken so much from our commonwealth. But it doesn’t have to take our homes.During the 2019-2020 legislative session, along with State Rep. Morgan Cephas (D., Phila. , weintroduced key legislationto improve the state’s rent and mortgage relief program. The $175 million program was created by the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency to help residents suffering from financial hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Funds were there, but changes needed to be made to ensure the dollars got into the hands of people in need.» READ MORE:Eviction is the New Year’s gift that no one deserves but millions could get | EditorialOur legislation, HB 2837, would have done that by fixing administrative and programmatic issues. For example, it would have based maximum rental assistance on 130% of a community’s HUD Fair Market Rent, rather than a flat $750 cap; allowed the program to function independently of verification through the Department of Labor’s already overtaxed unemployment compensation system; and reserved funds to go to small “mom-and-pop” landlords who, like many small-business owners, were also impacted by this economic upheaval. We were focused on eliminating red tape and getting help to Pennsylvanians.Our legislation would have fixed this program and released funding to help thousands of struggling Pennsylvanians pay their rent or mortgage. Instead, they find themselves confronted with the threat of homelessness for the holidays. To call this a moral failure of government is an understatement.Instead of fixing this program and helping thousands of Pennsylvanians, our Republican colleagues redirected federal relief funds tobackfill the state corrections budget. Money that was intended for homeowners, renters, and small-business owners in your neighborhood never got to them.Our bill was just one important part of a largerSafe At Home housing packagewe introduced last session to prevent some of the devastation that’s now unfolding across our state. The bills we introduced along with our colleagues would ensure people have access to qualified legal representation as they fight to keep their homes (former HB 2841 , create a framework for payment plans to help renters address housing debt without losing everything (former HB 2838 , and stop unfair eviction records from following families so they can find future housing (former HB 2382 . The package also includes a vital state eviction and foreclosure moratorium bill, which one of us (Fiedler is reintroducing with State Reps. Sara Innamorato (D., Allegheny and Summer Lee (D., Allegheny .» READ MORE:One-size-fits-all approach to rent relief leaves tenants and landlords without assistanceThis should not be a partisan issue. Republicans are the majority party in both the state House and Senate. They decide which bills are brought to a vote. In fact, House Republicans joined Democrats in October to sign off unanimously on a bill to expand the state’s rent relief program — but then theirSenate colleagues refused to advance the legislation. They decided that heading into a dark winter during a pandemic, housing was not a priority. Yet, we all know that housing is a fundamental human need, and we know that during this pandemic, some of the richest people have gotten even richer, while many working people are now faced with unstable housing, insufficient food, and not enough money to pay their bills.Rather than focusing on housing, education, food access, and small-business relief bills, some of our colleagues spent months questioning science and trying to cast doubt on an election that took place almost two months ago. This theater of the absurd does not serve the people of Pennsylvania. Working people, poor people, and the middle class are struggling to afford necessities; many people find themselves applying for unemployment for the first time after decades of working hard. For some people, housing instability is a new struggle that’s come with the pandemic. For many of our neighbors, the near-constant search for housing is a traumatic and exhausting way of life that comes with the high price of renting or buying a home, along with staggering amounts of medical debt and college debt.Pennsylvania deserves leaders who will focus on getting them help now. Certainly, when the General Assembly returns to Harrisburg in January, getting relief to those who need it the most — frontline workers, essential workers, independent businesses, seniors, those who have lost employment, and renters and homeowners — should be priority No. 1.Our state needs to step up, now, to get rent and mortgage relief to Pennsylvanians, and to pass the rest of our Safe At Home housing bills. For anyone on the edge of homelessness, this is obvious. Housing is a public health issue and a moral issue, and it must come along with other forms of assistance and support to get us all through this pandemic and beyond.Austin Davis (D., Allegheny and Elizabeth Fiedler (D., Phila. are Pennsylvania state representatives."

Much of Chicago buzzed with excitement and satisfaction. The site, nestled in a corner of the park near the Museum of Science and Industry, stoked visions of “Museum Campus South.”Rewind to July 2016, when word leaked that Barack and Michelle Obama had chosen Jackson Park on Chicago’s South Side as the venue for the Obama Presidential Center. Much of Chicago buzzed with excitement and satisfaction. The site, nestled in a corner of the park near the Museum of Science and Industry, stoked visions of “Museum Campus South.”Still president at the time, Obama promised more than an homage to his legacy in choosing Chicago over other possible sites, including New York City. He talked of creating an engine for youth engagement and South Side revitalization.What’s happened since then? A lot. Controversy over a private entity, the center, occupying public park space. Concerns of gentrification. Demands from the surrounding community for inclusion. A pandemic-related slowdown in fundraising toward the $500 million project. Nationally, Donald Trump’s improbable ascent to the White House and a global health crisis that continues to grip the city, nation and world. Then in November, the election of Obama’s VP, Joe Biden, as president.That patch of land in Jackson Park earmarked for the Obama Presidential Center campus? Not a spade of dirt has turned.THE CENTER’S ROADBLOCKSThe Obamas and their presidential center team must feel like they’re Sisyphus, only with a boulder the size of Saturn to heave uphill. After four years and five months, they’re still squinting at the horizon for a glimpse of the finish line. It’s time for this project to break the tape.Roadblocks along the way have come in bunches, though some of them helped fine-tune the effort. The obelisk-shaped museum serving as the campus’s focal point has been redesigned a few times. At the community’s behest, the Obama Foundation scratched plans for an above-ground parking garage on Midway Plaisance and decided to build the garage underground and within the presidential center campus footprint.A federal lawsuit filed in the summer of 2018 by an environmental group, Protect Our Parks, further slowed movement on the project. The suit claimed that the bid for the presidential center should be scrapped because it was being built by a private entity, the Obama Foundation, on public parkland, which would violate Chicago Park District code and state law. U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey did not agree and dismissed the lawsuit in the summer of 2019, declaring, “There should be no delay in construction.” In August, the 7th Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals effectively affirmed Blakey’s ruling.THE GENTRIFICATION FACTORResidents of Woodlawn near the site wanted assurances that any gentrification resulting from the center wouldn’t price them out of their homes and rental units. After months of negotiations between Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration and South Side housing advocates, the City Council passed an affordable housing ordinance in September that will help Woodlawn tenants collaborate to purchase multiunit buildings in the neighborhood and set aside money for residents to fix up their homes.One of the center’s last hurdles recently got cleared. Before the Obama center is built, the federal government had to sign off on it. That’s because Jackson Park, designed by famed landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, is on the National Register of Historic Places, and because the plan involves major roadway changes.That federal review began in December 2017. It was supposed to wrap up in 2018, but it wasn’t until Dec. 17 that the most critical step in that federal review concluded. We know federal bureaucracy tends to move with the zip of a tortoise, but three years?A FINISH LINE IN SIGHTA groundbreaking is now tentatively set for sometime in 2021. Chicago awaits what is sure to be a major tourism draw, and the South Side awaits the benefits that the Obama Foundation has promised the center would generate — more than $3 billion in economic development for surrounding communities in the first 10 years.The fundraising effort is still only about halfway to the $500 million mark and the center, and its campus are expected to take roughly four years to build out. During a Nov. 15 interview on “60 Minutes” to promote his new book, Obama discussed the center and its mission, which includes engaging the surrounding community with activities, new gardens and walking trails and of course, exhibits that will include Michelle Obama’s famous dresses.But the benefits of the center won’t come to fruition while the Obama Presidential Center remains merely a scale model on a conference room table. It’s time to get this project built.— Chicago TribuneWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

This left some of our guests unprepared, as many of them had been working and saving to go into permanent housing. For many, the shelter is not just a place out of the weather, but a place to be fed. With most fast-food restaurants and church food pantries closed, this was an increased hardship for the homeless. Thankfully, our CAPS Emergency Assistance Program allowed some of them to go into temporary housing, providing them extra time to prepare for permanent housing.During our seventh season of Night Stay, we provided shelter to 114 different individuals and had a total of 2,483 overnight stays. Approximately 7,450 meals were provided, with more than 9,500 volunteer hours logged! That is amazing! We don’t like to think homelessness is affecting our community, but it is growing here just like in the rest of our country. During our shelter season, we had 45 men, 46 women, and 15 families with a total of 23 children. This is a 375-percent increase since our first season.The Suffolk Police Department were among those who dedicated their time to our program. Their nightly checks and quick responses when called were very much appreciated. Shared Hospital Services picked up our blankets weekly and cleaned them for us. The city of Suffolk helped us fund transportation to our host churches, which was a huge help. Many local restaurants donated meals, businesses donated needed toiletries and supplies; and, we had several organizations come to the shelter and provide medical care, offer services and educate our guests on local programs that were available. Thanks to benefits that our guests were not aware of, some of them were even able to secure housing, including one of our veterans! Last but not least, I’d like to extend a special thank you to Mayor Linda T. Johnson for visiting our shelter to learn how we operate and meet some of our guests.Over 100 churches and organizations participated this year! While it’s impossible to list every church, organization and person individually, please know that we are incredibly grateful for you. Your efforts are making an impact on how this area responds to homelessness and without you, change cannot be accomplished.Planning for next year’s season has already begun! If you are interested in getting your church or organization involved, please contact the Night Stay Administrator, Cheryl Griffin, at 757-286-9126 or email nightstay@capsuffolk.org. We are always looking for more host or co-host churches, churches to provide volunteers and meals, and churches with buses to help provide transportation to and from the host church.

Customers were already lined up outside my office, waiting for the doors to open. I laid my head back and took a moment to enjoy the end of the song that was playing on the radio. When the song ended, I put on my mask and headed inside to begin the workday.I am sure it looked like a regular workday to anyone watching, but the truth was that I was tired.My office had been running with a minimal amount of staff for the past four weeks, so the amount of work I was expected to complete had doubled. I was behind on numerous projects, but the line of people waiting to enter the office made me realize I would only leave the day further behind than I began.My mind wandered to the beach, where I had hoped to spend some days relaxing and playing in the sun. This week was my fourth attempt to take a vacation before the summer ended, but the shortage of staff caused every vacation I planned to be canceled.I am grateful for my job. I know that I am blessed to be working, and I know many people would love to change places with me. My heart goes out to those who lost their jobs or who are still laid off due to COVID-19. That being said, may I speak for essential workers in the customer service field for a moment?The last few months have left many essential workers in the customer service field exhausted. We have had to deal with everchanging conditions, wearing a mask eight hours or more a day, taking on additional duties, customers who feel stores are the best location for the debate over masks, and staff shortages. It has not been easy, and, like everyone else, we have to process and deal with the effects that COVID has brought to our country in our personal lives.Essential workers in the customer service field have been adapting to changing conditions daily. Many workers are unsure of exactly what will be required of them from one moment to the next, and we are finding ourselves taking on duties that we did not expect. In many cases, we are learning as we go.We also have to deal with customers who want to turn each visit to a store into a statement on the requirement to wear a mask or to give their thoughts on a national coin shortage. We understand everyone has an opinion on these issues, but our jobs are not to facilitate a political debate or to break up arguments between consumers. The cashier didn’t create the mask rule, and it’s not his or her fault there is no coin in the drawer.I share this with you to ask two things.First, be patient with associates when you visit. We know it is frustrating to wait longer than usual, but we are doing the best we can. We are trying to learn new structures and additional duties while following strict cleaning guidelines, and we are often working with fewer people than are needed.Next, be kind to those who are helping you. The environment in which we work all day can be stressful, and we still have to deal with issues when we leave work, such as finding childcare and preparing for virtual school. The pandemic has created a stressful time for everyone, but we are on the front lines.

minnpost_2020_204,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Apparently, my family on my Dad’s side is known for the ability to cry tears of joy. But this year — this year, the year of the pandemic, the year of a person being squished like a bug, the year when so many Americans have died in the last seven months we have lost the ability to comprehend it, the year when work has become something you lose — I discovered another ability. I can cry in my sleep.It didn’t happen all at once; at first in February I was just plain scared and confused, wondering exactly how much Spam, Velveeta, rice and beans I needed to procure to survive a pandemic. Then a sense of surreality set in. Not a word, I know, but surreal like Canticle for Leibowitz or other sci fi works I have read. Surreal as in, we live in the wealthiest country in the world and we don’t have a solution for this We harbor some of the greatest institutions of learning and science … and some ridicule and seek to dismantle years in labs and in the field to scare, confuse and bewilder people even more, so that then they can bend the people to their willThat was when it happened — the day would go fine, but I would wake up at that most revolting time of night, 2 a.m., with tears flowing out of my eyes onto my pillow. They weren’t the result of a dream; it was more like in my sleep, the dam of self control opened its gates. My deep feelings for the professionals working in hospitals, being put at risk of disease and death, my deep appreciation for those who are doing the work that makes a hospital run … the people who support our aging population in care centers, now on the front lines of a battle where the weapons to fight it are now an embarrassing, ridiculous political toy. My ache for the world wisdom lost, all at once, by the death of so many.So I have one more ability to add to my family’s talents, night tears, that only show up in a pandemic. I hope they help; I hope that by engaging with the agony of this time, they are washing away the mistakes that are enabling this virus to rule. In the summer, I sat on a dock, not far from our beautiful damaged city. Before dawn, the celestial visitor came, like a fairy dancing with hope just above the treeline I know so well, and have known for 50 years. So old, so new, so wise, from so far away, and then the tears of joy, my inheritance, came.Kris Potter lives and writes in south Minneapolis."

It’s been a wild ride these past few years. The Suffolk News-Herald was my first, serious job in journalism and I’ve learned so much with the help of this dedicated office, but also through the many stories I’ve written about this hard-working community.I was by no means “prepared” for what this job had in store for me during my first year in Suffolk. There were lessons I learned in real time, and progress felt slow, at first. But this community welcomed me with open arms and helped me grow as a professional.I don’t think there are enough column inches to name each person that I’ve worked with as a Suffolk news reporter, and who I’ve come to know and respect deeply. Allow me instead to say “thank you” to the many incredible people who have helped me tell stories that matter to the Suffolk community.I will miss you all, and I will also miss the exciting events that I’ve had the good fortune to cover for the News-Herald. Suffolk Peanut Fest, Hampton Roads Tour De Cure and the Suffolk Public Library’s fan-tastic IconiCon, just to name a few.Oh, and of course the Suffolk Humane Society’s annual “Mutt Strutt” festival, because as some of you know, I love dogs — almost as much as I have enjoyed bugging my coworkers with my constant dog photos.Above all else I will miss the Suffolk newsroom. Tracy Agnew, Jen Jaqua, Jimmy Laroue and former editor Res Spears, the man who hired me three years ago. They were tremendous to work with and have helped me become an infinitely better reporter than the rookie I was at the beginning.I have the utmost confidence that they will continue to serve Suffolk readers as we all navigate these uncertain times, along with everything else that the future holds for us. I’m confident in that because Tracy Agnew is an outstanding editor, and the best mentor for whoever becomes the next Suffolk News-Herald reporter. Whoever they may be, they’re in good hands.Thank you to all of the readers who have supported the Suffolk News-Herald during my time here. Please continue to do so in the years to come.

minnpost_2020_212,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The 2012 U.S. House of Representative elections raised eyebrows. Despite Democrats winning 1.4 million more votes, it was Republicans who controlled the chamber. How was this possibleA partisan gerrymander is a legislative map designed to maximize seats for one party. Every 10 years, after the census, states are required to redraw their congressional and legislative districts to reflect the changes of the past decade. In most states that power is vested in the state Legislature, subject to a governor’s veto. But in 2011, state politicians, particularly Republicans, abused that power to unseen levels. Statistical tests prove that“Great Gerrymander”explains the 2012 Republican victory.The effects have persisted throughout the decade. In2018, Democrats won a majority of votes for state assembly in Wisconsin but only won 36% of the seats. That sameyear, Democrats won nearly 49% of the vote for U.S. House seats in Ohio, but only won four of the 16 districts. In Michigan, a similar pattern unfolded.Unlike its Midwestern peers, this decade, Minnesota has not suffered from a wide gap between the will of voters and the legislators who represent them. This is because in 2010, Minnesotans elected a divided government. Republicans controlled the Minnesota Legislature, but Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton wielded veto power. This ensured that the new maps were designed with bipartisan input and, on the whole, did not unfairly benefit one party or the other. In fact, the maps in Minnesota worked so well that theyresultedin some of the most competitive elections in the nation.While the divided government spared Minnesota from gerrymandering, it has also subjected the state to unnecessary gridlock. In2011, the lack of an agreement between Republicans and Dayton caused a shutdown of the state government. Thisnearlyoccurred again last year, during Gov. Tim Walz’s first year in office. Even as the state faces a potential $4.7 billiondeficit, and in the midst of a pandemic, the Senate Republicans have participated in absurd heights of obstruction, ousting agency head after agency head. Minnesotans have not looked fondly on this behavior.The Princeton Election Consortiumestimatesthat Democrats currently have a 57% chance of winning the Minnesota Senate. (Other prognosticators are evenmoreconfident. If they do win, it will be the first time the DFL will have had a “trifecta” (control of the governorship and both chambers of the legislature in half a decade. And while unified control will likely make for smoother governance, it could open the door to DFL gerrymandering next year.This shouldn’t just concern Republicans; it’s bad for all Minnesotans. Gerrymanders subvert democracy and enable legislators to pick their voters, rather than the other way around. In the long run, it could hurt Democrats, as well. Gerrymanders canbackfire, andexacerbatepartisanship.In 2019 the Minnesota House passed abill, H.F. 1605, which would have created a nonpartisan advisory redistricting commission, but it stalled in the Senate. It is too late to establish any sort of redistricting reform before the election. But in the remaining days before the election, DFL leaders — like House Speaker Melissa Hortman, Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent and the governor — should pledge to not abuse the trust that Minnesotans will place in them, if they win a trifecta.Next year, even though the DFL might have the power to draw the new maps alone, it could establish an advisory bipartisan commission, or agree to submit its maps to an independent nonpartisan organization to ensure their fairness. Ultimately, the Legislature should move to pass a constitutional amendment that would establish an independent redistricting commission, along the lines of many other states.In her opinion defending Arizona’s independent redistricting commission, the late, great Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg referred to our framers inwritingthat fair redistricting ensures that legislators would have “an habitual recollection of their dependence on the people.” DFLers should heed her advice and honor her legacy by promising Minnesotans fair district maps next year.Zachariah Sippy is an analyst at the Princeton Election Consortium.

It’s been more than two weeks since the media and all other reputable observers called the 2020 election asa resounding winfor Joe Biden, and yet President Donald Trump and his minions continue to press a case for overturning the result that’s melted faster than the stuff running out of Rudy Giuliani’s hair or his wherever.Yes, it’s so easy to laugh at the ridiculousness ofTrump’s scheme— which he telegraphed for months before Election Day — to somehow get judges, or state legislatures, or the Electoral College to anoint him the victor of an election he couldn’t win by getting the most votes, even in the battleground states that handed him the White House in 2016.The latest proof of the pathetic nature of the president’s plot to allege widespread voter fraud, with zero actual evidence, came Saturday when a Republican, straight-outta-the-Federalist-Society jurist here in Pennsylvania — U.S. District Judge Matthew W. Brann — dismissed his campaign’s latest election challenge with prejudice,”using words likea “Frankenstein’s monster” and “unhinged” to describe the case argued by Giuliani last week. Yet as that was happening, the Trump campaign was demanding a reality-defyingthird recountthat will surely ratify his loss in Georgia, much like the quadruple-amputated knight inMonty Python and the Holy Grailcontinuing to insist that “it’sonly a flesh wound.”But it’s time now for all the laughter to die in outrage. Because we need to state in the clearest and most unambiguous terms what is happening in America in November 2020: The president of the United States is using the power of his office totry to overturn, by any means necessary, the fair and democratic election that will remove him from office. In a nation that stakes its claim to “exceptionalism” on 44 peaceful transfers of power (despiteone that wasn’t over 231 years, its current leader is attempting a coup.It’s not a joke. It’s a crime. And there ought to be consequences — for Trump and his enablers, and to ensure this never happens again.The president, the Republican Party, and some of its key elected officials crossed a line last week when they went from frivolous courtroom challenges and insistent recount demands — annoying and antidemocratic, but legal — to demanding thatelection canvassersandstate legislaturesignore legal vote counts, untainted by any evidence of fraud, and simply award unearned electors to Trump. What Team Trump and the Republican National Committee are demanding in Lansing, Harrisburg and other state capitals is the moral equivalent of sending tanks into America’s streets and seizing the studios of CNN and MSNBC.You are living in a state of mimosa-fueled back-to-brunch denial if you don’t think that stuff got real the moment that the obscure Republican apparatchiks in Wayne County, Mich., attempted not once but twice — with direct encouragement from the president of the United States — to simply cast aside thousands of votescast in the majority-Black Cityof Detroit.Or when the Twitter account of the Republican National Committee — one of the two foundational structures of our supposedly exceptional democracy —endorsed the delusional claimby attorney Sidney Powell that “Trump won by a landslide” and that “we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.”Or when a just-reelected U.S. congressman from Pennsylvania,Rep. Mike Kelly, joined Saturday with other state elected officials with a galling lawsuit that — while almost surely doomed to fail — seeks to throw away my vote and millions of others that were cast here by mail, under a recently enacted law that was passed with overwhelming Republican support.So I wouldn’t be high-fiving whena Sen. Pat Toomey— who’s retiring from politics in two years — admits that Biden won the election, not when the vast majority of his colleagues remain complicit in this coup attempt through their silence. Trump’s courtroom losses and hasty retreats — the outrageous stand by the Wayne County canvassers collapsed in about three hours — shouldn’t allow us to obscure that we are not only witnessing a crime in progress, but one that’s more insidious and damaging than Watergate, let alone the Ukraine matter.The antics of Trump and his thoroughly corrupted Republican Party probably (and it’s alarming enough that I have to say “probably” won’t undo the result of our fair, democratic election, but they are already having dire consequences in the real world. A recent poll found that a staggering70% of Republicansdon’t believe Biden’s election victory was “free and fair,” despite the mountain of real-world evidence to the contrary. The entrenched denial of Biden’s legitimacy by millions of Americans will make it all but impossible for the 46th president to govern as he deals with a deadly pandemic and a crippled economy. Even worse, it’s all but certain to inspireacts of violenceby the deluded “people who vote for freedom.”This weekend, I reada remarkable essayby writer Indi Samarajiva, who lives in Sri Lanka and headlined his piece, “I Lived Through a Stupid Coup. America Is Having One Now.” In it, Samarajiva writes about living through a ridiculous failed coup in his homeland two years ago and how the people’s seeming victory was followed by legitimate but weakened and inept government and then deadly violence on an Easter Sunday that killed 269 people. He sees Trump’s America as already way too far down this track.“There’s a ticking bomb at the heart of your democracy now,”Samarajiva writes. “Your government,the very idea of governanceis fatally wounded. Chaos has been planted at its heart. I don’t know what this chaos will grow into, but I can promise you this. It won’t be good.”In our gerrymandered, truth-denying world, I think we’re long past the point of thinking there’ll be any political consequences for the Rep. Mike Kellys, the GOP chair Ronna Romney McDaniels, the cowardly state lawmakers who play footsie with a real-life coup, and all the Republican quislings too willing to go too far with what’s no longer a game. Instead, subverting elections is a crime — and it ought to be treated as such.» READ MORE:So is President Trump staging a coup, or what? | Will Bunch NewsletterIf a powerful United States senatorlike South Carolina’s Lindsey Grahamis phoning Georgia’s secretary of state and asking him to toss out legal ballots, or when Trump himself flies Michigan’s top lawmakers to Washington and ... someone is buying them$500 bottles of Dom Pérignonin the name of appointing Trump electors in a state Biden won by 150,000 votes, how is this not election tampering at the felony level?Indeed, it’s heartening to read that Michigan’s attorney general, Democrat Dana Nessel, is openly considering whether state and local officials who bend to Trump’s wishes and fail to certify or attempt to override the legitimate vote countare committing criminal offensessuch as bribery, conspiracy, or perjury (by filing false affidavits . Nessel’s approach is the right one, but it’s also just a start. If 2020 has taught us anything, it’s that we need both stronger laws and a renewal of democratic ethics to ensure that every legal vote counts.How do we make sure this never happens again?Put civil servants instead of political hacks in charge of counting the votes and certifying the results.America is fairly unique among nations both in the highly decentralized way our presidents are elected but also in the outsize influence of extreme partisans in counting the votes. “The U.S. is an extreme outlier in the way it administers elections,” Eric Bjornlund of Democracy Internationaltold Time magazine, “both because of how much that administration of elections is decentralized and also because the administration of the election is done by a partisan official who … can run as candidates or endorse candidates in elections they oversee.”Perhaps 2020 will inspire a campaign — which would have to be state and local as well as national — to make vote counting and certification less prone to political tampering. An independent and — to the extent possible — nonpartisan federal election panel could not only set standards for running elections but also ascertain a winner and begin a transition, something that Trump’s blatantly partisan General Services Administration head Emily Murphyhas refused to do.Strengthen state and federal election laws or amend the Constitution so there’s no possibility that a state legislature could override the vote count and appoint electors to the Electoral College.Right now, Trump and his goofy team of lawyers have seized on ambiguous language in our 1787 Constitution to assert that lawmakers in state capitals havethe power to name electors, regardless of the results. Clearly, there’s no scenario where this would amount to anything less than a legislative coup; this loophole should be closed, pronto.Get rid of the outdated and increasinglyabsurd Electoral College altogether. If fewer than 50,000 votes had shifted in three key states in the 2020 voting, Trump would have been legally reelected despite Biden receiving 6 million more overall votes — and it would have been the third time this happened in our young century. What’s more, Trump’s coup plotting simply wouldn’t be viable under a “one person, one vote” scenario where — as in every other developed democracy — the candidate with the most votes wins. Despite almostinsurmountable obstacles, it’s past time for a serious constitutional push for electoral sanity.If what Trump, Graham and other top Republicans are doing isn’t felony election tampering, then rewrite the criminal code to make it so. Look, it’s a felony to walk into a bar and tell someone whom you think is a hit man but is really an undercover cop that you want to murder someone, so it ought to be a crime to fete elected government officials in your hotel bar and tell them that you want to murder American democracy and the cornerstone of our way of life. Period.Trump is clearly abusing his power as president. Impeach him. Again.OK,that’s a radical step, and probably not something I would do today, but I would encourage it strongly if the president’s coup gains even the slightest toehold anytime in the next two weeks. It sounds crazy with just 60 days in his term, but consider this: An impeachment resolution could include a political “death penalty” barring Trump from taking office again, not just ending the coup but also his rumored 2024 campaign before it can start. If enough senators like Toomey or Mitt Romney can be signed up to remove Trump now, Congress would even send a message to any future presidents that plotting coups will land you in the trash heap of history.Here’s the big picture: 2020 has exposed that America’s democracy isn’t exceptional, or even particularly well thought out. To the contrary, it’s incredibly fragile — chock full of loopholes and exploitable flaws that were just waiting for a power-mad, narcissistic demagogue to exploit them, which is now happening before our disbelieving eyes. We can either try to fix this — incredibly hard as that may be in this already poisoned atmosphere — or we can watch as the American Experiment is slow-walked to the slaughterhouse."

minnpost_2020_183,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Anyone who’s tuned in to the news this fall could be excused for thinking that college students are poised to destroy the health of our nation. Cynics have argued that the only reason for colleges to stay open is money. Of course, some especially vulnerable schools truly are facing an existential crisis. That this potential fails to engender much sympathy may reflect a more general lack of regard for education in the current moment and the growing sense that the higher ed sector needs to rein in the cost of a degree.The biggest issue at stake here is not the fate of a relatively few campuses; it is our nation’s future. As young people enter what likely will be one of the worst job markets in decades, a college degree will be more important than ever. A quality education transforms a student’s opportunity to better their life, and this fundamental truth has mostly been ignored in the public debate about whether college campuses should reopen.Students and their families understand this. Many have told us they want to be on campus, and the fact that they’re here, knowing the risks, shows they are willing to make the necessary adjustments because a college degree is just too important. What we are finding is that many young people prefer the benefits of joining a living-learning community on campus — even with masks and social distancing — to learning remotely from their homes. So, we must try.It’s also high time to emphasize the benefits, indeed the moral obligations, of colleges and universities to educate students during this pandemic. We all have seen that COVID-19’s effects have been unequal. Communities of color, poorer communities, and people without access to quality health care are disproportionately suffering cruel losses of lives and livelihoods due to the socially unequal distribution of harms by this disease. Any declines in fragile enrollment gains for low-income, first-generation and BIPOC students will be exacerbated by campuses closing or failing to meet the challenges of operating with a full range of supportive services during this difficult time.Despite systemic inequality in this country, higher education remains a ladder of opportunity. Closing campuses would, in effect, remove the rungs from that ladder for legions of students — large numbers of whom would be the first in their families to obtain a degree. As a former free lunch and Pell Grant recipient, I feel keenly every day the value of my education and I know a college campus would have been the best place for me during a pandemic. While taking a year off of college is a luxury enjoyed by some more privileged students, needier students would be disproportionately harmed by time away from campus.If we do not try to work together to keep colleges and universities open now, we will miss crucial opportunities to train the students who will solve the thorniest problems and wrestle with the biggest questions of our time.We have difficult challenges ahead, without a doubt. But the colleges and universities that can adapt to pandemic conditions and stay open should do so. At Macalester, we are learning lessons from this fall, and we must operate in ways that are prudent and reduce risks as much as possible. We will continue to follow the science and public health guidelines, and make adjustments based on data, prioritizing the health and safety of our communities. These past months have shown that it’s possible to educate our students while reducing risks, and that work must continue. Our students need us to meet the challenge so that we can fulfill our missions and prepare the next generation of leaders who will shape the future for us all.Suzanne Rivera, Ph.D., is the president of Macalester College."
suffolknewsherald_2020_103,"Published 9:58 pm Thursday, June 4, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieSome years ago, I learned the story behind the hymn “It is Well With My Soul.” According to an article published online by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the meaning behind the song has to do with learned lessons experienced in the life of Horatio Spafford who was a successful attorney and real estate investor who lost a fortune in the great Chicago fire of 1871. Around the same time, his beloved 4-year-old son died of scarlet fever. During a vacation to England, the ship carrying his wife and four daughters wrecked at sea. Only his wife survived. As he voyaged to meet his wife, he wrote this beloved hymn while his ship passed over the very area where his daughters drowned. I believe Horatio Spafford experienced a washing of his soul when God gave him those words to write.The first line of the song states: “When peace like a river attendeth my way.” I have asked several people to explain the words “attendeth my way” as they see it. Perhaps my favorite explanation has been that despite what is going on around you, peace “washes over you” in abundance like a mighty rushing river. Right now, I favor this meaning of those words because it provides a deeply moving word picture. Sentimental pictures sometimes help us manage emotions and challenges. This visual of purifying rivers washing over a human body is helpful considering all the pain and rage that is heavily weighing on our country and all around us. It reminds me of my own experience of soul washing.When I first received the baptism of the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues, I was in a courtyard garden outside a chapel in Yokosuka, Japan. I was praying in the garden with friends. I vividly remember feeling as if water was doused on my head and pouring over me as I spoke to God in an unrecognizable language. It was as if I was standing under a waterfall. I felt so much peace. I forgot that there were other people with me in the garden. I wasn’t being baptized by water that evening, but I know that my spirit thirst for God so much that God washed me.You may be asking, what does water have to do with peace? Water has so many meanings. In these song lyrics, Horatio wrote that the rivers “attendeth my way.”When we bathe, it is a way of attending to ourselves. But the washing that we do only touches our skin. Our skin is the largest organ of the human body. Try as we might, we cannot do anything to change the skin that we are in. We cannot wash it off. For some of us, the truth of that statement robs us of our peace.Lord, I just want us to experience that same peace that washed over me the night in that Yokosuka garden. Do it today. Do it for them. Do it for me. Do it for every nation. I am praying for real purification and not a simple pacifying. I wish I could give every one of my sisters and brothers that same experience right now. I feel they need it. These outcries all over the world are the result of stolen peace. Peace is not experienced by the skin. Peace is felt in our souls.My prayer is for God to send the flowing rivers of peace to attend our way. The souls of the members of the black and brown community are thirsty. Wash us over and over again. Baptize us afresh … all of us. May the waters not only touch our melanated skin but immerse our very souls.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

philinquirer_2020_33,"From New York City to Norman, Okla., lawmakers who move to “defund” the police, or “reform” them by slashing payrolls, are playing a destructive game.Colwyn isdownto just one police officer per shift. Its acting police chief says that the borough council seems to want his department gone. As many as14 officersmoved to leave the Norman, Okla., police force after the City Council voted to defund their department. A majority of officersleft the forcein Knightstown, Ind., includingthe chief, because “there is no support for the department, no town council backbone for us,” one former officer said.These aren’t isolated incidents, but part of a wave that has swept the country following nationwide anti-police protests in recent months. Renewed public hostility to cops appears to have worsened a long decline in their numbers, stretching back to the Great Recession. That’s bad news for both public safety and police-community relations: fewer cops likely means both more crime and more police misconduct.» READ MORE:I was a police chief. Here’s one way I would reform police in Philly and beyond. | OpinionThe attrition is not limited to small towns.A surveyof news stories indicates that across America’s 50 largest cities, at least 23 have seen chiefs or line officers resign, retire, or take disability this year. Nearly 3,700 beat cops have left, a large proportion from the New York Police Department (down7%of its officers but with big drops inChicago,Minneapolis,Milwaukee,Atlanta, and elsewhere, too. The Major Cities Chiefs Associationtoldthe Wall Street Journalthat 18 of its 69 member executives had retired, resigned, or been fired over the past year.Cities are struggling to replace these departing officers. In Colorado Springs, Colo., the department has fallen25% shortof its recruitment goal amid what Chief Vince Niski called “social unrest.” And potential executives are refusing the job, Houston Police Department chief and president of the MCCA Art Acevedo told the Wall Street Journal: “There’s a lot of folks that are hesitant when they see chiefs are getting beat up and getting thrown under the bus by their bosses.”Some of these departures represent normal turnover, like the retirement of Virginia Beach, Va., Chief Jim Cervera,who hitthe city’s mandatory retirement age this year. Others likely represent instances of underperforming chiefs being replaced. But many are clearly casualties of the current moment, like Portland, Ore.’s Jami Resch,forced outbecause her command staff was all white.» READ MORE:Reimagining policing: 14 ways to change a broken system | OpinionIn city after city, departing officers cite a hostile climate, including the rioting that recently left30 officersinjured in Philadelphia. In Seattle, those who left (over 100 this year citedfears for their personal safety and the agenda of the “socialist” City Council as their reason for quitting. In San Francisco,nearly 30 officershave left because of the attitudes of everyone from homeowners to the homeless: “It’s ... nice working at a place where everyone isn’t mad at you,” one former San Francisco Police Department officer, now in Texas, said.It’s plain that the protests, which have seen participants assault officers, set fire to precincts, and abuse cops verbally, have made the job worse. Even if one believes that all these departures are individually good — that the retiring cops were incompetent, say, and the resigning chiefs corrupt — it’s hard to dispute the harmful cumulative effect.The size of a police force and the crime rate are strongly linked. Researchconsistentlyfindsthat increasing the number of officers on the streets cuts crime, withone analysissuggesting that from a cost-benefit perspective, America’s streets are likely underpoliced. When cops get pulled off the beat, crime goes up.One studyof Dallas Police Department data linked a 10% drop in presence to a 7% increase in crime.Fewer cops likely also mean more police misconduct. After all, the remaining officers must work longer and more stressful hours and tend togrow more sympatheticto using force compared with less-stressed colleagues. Research has found that fatigue predicts a rise in public complaints against cops: a 13-hour rather than 10-hour shift significantly boosts their prevalence, while back-to-back shiftsquadruple their odds.These realities are particularly alarming given the current shrinking of police forces, which predates 2020. Data from state and local governments collected by the U.S. Census Bureauindicatefewer police officers per capita in 2019 than at any point since 1994, when the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act surged thousands of officers on to the streets, helping to end the two-decade crime wave.» READ MORE:Reforming police requires action, not commissions | OpinionSince 2008, the number of cops per capita has retreated from the post-crime-wave peak, thanks both to state and local austerity and to growing agitation against policing. That has likely contributed to the “plateauing” of the crime decline, a phenomenon that costs millions of dollars and thousands of lives every year.The mass departures of the past year can only hasten this trend, probably leading to higher crime and greater police misconduct — and, in turn, making police work less appealing to high-quality candidates.Policymakers must take these realities into consideration.

eugeneweekly_2020_1,"We ve got issues. The distribution of votes in this neverending election is screaming something else other than a democracy in crisis. Most people who voted saw this election as a battle of morality, of values, of life or death. A battle of racist or not racist, sexist or not sexist, for homophobia or against it, transphobia or not transphobic. A chance at a regular ole everyday, you’re not that type of Black person, racism or surviving the escalation of violent deaths for being Black. This split has conveniently lined up to Democrat or Republican. We can add the indifference of the Independent, because let’s face it: This election we needed to make a clear choice for people, not the political party system. This whole concept is problematic in itself, but that’s not what I’m going to talk about right now. I want to talk about HOW we narrowly escaped a green light to a second Civil War. If you don’t know your history, the bottom line of the Civil War was whether the South could continue to torture enslaved people for profit. The Union narrowly slipped by with a victory, largely due to the fact it enlisted enslaved people to fight for them, guaranteeing their freedom, win or lose. We can discuss how those enslaved people were treated after the Civil War, with the same civil disregard until this present day. The public humilation the troops endured due to their ethnicity, due to their skin color, society talks about that shame continuously. However, we don’t talk about the audacity of white society at large to distance themselves from their desperate need for BIPOC’s blood sweat and brilliance to push their American dream forward. Without the acknowledgement that dream would be impossible without the deep sacrifice of the BIPOC communities. The percentages of white people who voted for hate, for misogyny and for violence is a clear indication of the truth of how white people have seen themselves in the decisions of equity this country has pushed forward with. It is an empty rhetoric. If the people of this country are basically split 50-50, it is indicative of a group of people who feel their wellness is somehow threatened by the equity of others. There was no resolve, no reckoning by enslaved people and their owners. There was no “setting the story straight.” Instead, racism was hidden in lies in our history books, in our statues, flags, names of prominent museums and structures of our society, as if nothing was ever really wrong. When did BIPOC people get permission to be great? We haven’t. We have saved ourselves, and this democracy. Martin Luther King Jr was Black. He and others convinced our counterparts of their moral duty. There was never a landslide of people who agreed. The acknowledgement was begrudging at best. Those people? They are your mother and father or, at the very most, your grandmother and father. This past is not so far behind. These sentiments are very much real. These delusions that surround the white community are now revealed for everyone to discuss. Once again, in 2020 the highest number of voters were Black people identified as women, followed closely by Latinx people identified as women. Fighting for our safety. Where were the allies? We cannot expect to continue in the delusion of white supremacy. It is harmful to themselves and to others. The concept in itself mimics an unchecked mental health disorder, that we are all trapped in the house trying to avoid. BIPOC people are tired and unamused. White folks are hurting and confused.

philinquirer_2020_32,"The GOP s growing lock on the American working class under Trump spread in 2020 to Latine and even Black voters. Are future Democrats doomed?When the first election returns started coming in from Texas’ Zapata County — a hot, dusty corner of the Rio Grande Valley with oil rigs and a large Latine population — some online voting-fraud sleuths thought there’d been a voting machine glitch, or worse. How could a county that had voted nearly 2-1 for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton show President Donald Trumpnarrowly ahead?The reality is that baffled, faraway Twitter posters and their assumptions about Texas’ Hispanic vote hadn’t encountered actual voters like 72-year-old retired social worker and teacher Maria Elia Ramos of Rio Grande City, who shrugged off Trump’s xenophobic and sometimes racist rhetoric as well as hectoring family members on Facebook to vote for the GOP. “We have a right to decide,”she told the Los Angeles Times. “Our family values are more in line with Republicans.”Zapata County’s centrist Democratic longtime congressman, Henry Cuellar,told the Texas Tribunethat the heavily Latine region is “homogenous, deeply religious, pensively patriotic, socially conservative, and it’s hurting economically.” Indeed, for these mostly working-class voters, it was arguably “the economy, stupid.” They feared some of the national Democratic rhetoric on the oil industry and the U.S. Border Patrol — two big sources of jobs — while many took special notice of Trump’s name on this summer’s $1,200 federal stimulus check.Yes, Democrat Joe Biden is America’s president-elect, and for that, we can thank hissurging support in the suburbs, where disgust over Trump’s nonstop lying, his overt racism and misogyny, and his threats to democracy drove higher turnout and flipped some college-educated men who’d voted for the faux billionaire in 2016. But now that it’s nearly two weeks since Election Day, and a blurry, complicated mosaic is slowly coming into focus, it’s clear that the bigger, long-term picture ought to alarm Democrats.It’s not only that Republicansgained House seatsand have a good chance ofclinging to Senate control, or that Trump’s outrageously unfit presidency — which climaxed with his lethal, botched handling of COVID-19 — somehow netted him at least 10 million more votes than his shock election four years earlier. It’s a question of where — and more importantly, who — those additional Trump votes actually came from.The Democratic Party’s long-term hopes for a 21st century majority haslong hung on the notionthat Republicans had become largely the party of white working-class men, and that this group’s slow demographic decline, as America became more and more diverse, would spell doom for the GOP. But what if Republicans becamethe nation’s blue-collar party, period — and broadened its appeal to millions of middle-class Hispanics and Blacks? The 2020 results not only showed the conservative party making inroads toward exactly that, but raised a giant question mark: Would a Trump-y candidate who’d actually delivered tangible things to the working class, and who wasn’t so racially offensive, have won the White House?Exit polls (which are imperfect, but what we have to work with show Biden outperforming Clinton only with white men (which speaks somewhat to the role misogyny played in 2016, whichI wrote about here. Meanwhile, Trump retained his narrow advantage with white women and — significantly — not only gained support with Black, Hispanic, and Asian American voters butperformed better with these groupsthan any Republican has in years.Nationwide, the gains were not enormous, and Biden — as expected — won a majority of all three groups (and did well in states like Arizona andGeorgiathat had seen over-the-top, GOP-led anti-immigrant or voter-suppression policies . But it’s significant that Trump’s national increase in nonwhite support came even as the president’s often racist rhetoric of resentmentsparked long voting linesin the rural counties and small towns of the predominantly white Rust Belt and elsewhere, as his blatant demagoguery reactivated millions of once-discouraged voters who’d turned away from politics after the brutal end of the Industrial Revolution.The long-term importance of the 2020 election was that it slammed an exclamation point on the surprising trend that defines today’s American politics: A nation that is divided somewhat along the lines that the pundits and political scientists are trained to look for — income and race — but is mainly split intothese two hostile tribes: Those who earned a college degree, and those who did not. Thus, our presidential elections swing less on who’s got the best health-care plan (I mean, Trumpdoesn’t even have one, right? , but on our cultural allegiance to ourincreasingly siloed communities— and our growing distrust, even hatred, of the other side.The current zeitgeist was nailed in acover piece for Politico Magazineby Tim Alberta that looked at how the preelection polls failed to capture a deeper working-class resentment toward the Democratic Party, as experienced by a centrist Democrat who barely survived her race, Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin. He wrote: “At the root of our polarization, Slotkin argued, is one half of the country believing it is enlightened and the other half resenting it.” Alberta asked if the Democrats could “embrace a ‘different era,’ one that demands rapid and unremitting evolution on all things cultural, without condescending to those who are slow to come around?”Understanding the 2020 election in those stark, simple terms — the enlightened vs. the resentful — explains a lot of things that experts have been fumbling to understand. That includes not just Trump’s strength in places like the Rio Grande Valley, but also his win in Florida, even as voters there also overwhelminglyapproved a $15 minimum wage, a policy endorsed by Biden — albeit not loudly enough —and scorned by Trump’s GOP.Currently, I’m writing a book (slated for 2022 publication by William Morrow, with the working title ofResent U. about how college/noncollege became the San Andreas Fault of American politics, even though most of us still don’t see it. For example, many commentators were shocked by this spring’s George Floyd protests, not only in their size but diversity, with whites often making up the majority at marches. That’s because the racial reckoning protests were, first and foremost, a revolution of the highly educated. The academic researchersDana Fisher and Michael Heaney foundthat a staggering 82% of white protesters but also — and this may be even more significant — 67% of the Black marchers held college degrees.The 2020 elections consistentlyrevealed a splitbetween young, often better-educated Black voters — who were the front line of Black Lives Matter marches and often backed the populist movement of Sen. Bernie Sanders in early primaries — and older African American voters from a more blue-collar generation who were largely responsible for the elevation and then the election of Biden, who criticized protesters’ call to “defund the police.”So, what if the Democrats were fundamentally wrong in thinking they could plate-spin a coalition of white college grads and almost all Black, brown, and Asian American voters? What if a growing number of the working-class Latine and African American voters begin to feel the way that so many whites in Slotkin’s Michigan district felt, that a Democratic Party based on college diplomas and a dogma of political correctness is looking down on them? Should we be surprised, for example, that so many midlife, highly entrepreneurial and capitalistic straight-outta-Compton-style Black hip-hop stars — fromIce Cube to Lil’ Wayneto most famously and bizarrely Kanye West — openly flirted with Trump and his movement?» READ MORE:America needs to talk about the new book that says lacking a college degree might kill you | Will BunchIs the political conundrum of the moment summed up in one word —Latinx, which was popularized in academic circles and also the LGBTQ community in recent years as a solution to a seeming problem of how to describe the hundreds of millions of people with roots in Central or South America with a word that’s gender-neutral and not colonial-sounding? Today,Latinxis widely used by white progressives, even though it’s an utter bafflement to culturally conservative brown folks in places like Texas or South Florida the term is supposed to describe. Writer Hector Luis Alamo dismissivelytold Mother JonesthatLatinxis “an academic word, and that group always thinks it knows what’s best for the rest of us.“That group” — academics — is the vanguard of the college-educated culture club that also includes Hollywood and “the knowledge economy” of media figures and Silicon Valley, which is, of course, the focus of the resentment that has driven a populist revolution in this country. When Trump was elected 45th president on Nov. 8, 2016, the natural inclination was to see the rise of a dangerous demagogue as a fluke, and that idea earned fresh currency when Biden defeated him this fall. But embracing this idea would be a false and dangerous complacency.Thanks to our arcane andarguably insane Electoral College, Trump and his 72 million-plus supporters would be celebrating his second term if just 67,000 or so votes in Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, and Omaha, Neb.’s congressional district had flipped. And, even with the pandemic, I believe he could have won those votes and the 2020 election if his narcissism and incompetence hadn’t blocked him from a stirring up resentment of “egghead” elites in ways that were less openly racist, and b governed as a true populist instead ofa garden-variety pro-billionaireRepublican.Remember the Latine voters of South Texas who credited Trump for their $1,200 check? What if the president had been smart enough to engineer a second stimulus, just ahead of the election, or embraced other populist items like a living wage or a massive infrastructure program? And how much better would Trump had done with the Hispanic voters who were receptive to the GOP’s social conservatism and free-market economics if he hadn’t, for example, dismissively tossedpaper towels at Puerto Ricansinstead of offering real relief from Hurricane Maria?Of course, you can also argue that any signs of real empathy for the Black and brown electorate might have dampened enthusiasm for Trump among white working-class voters for whom, as Adam Serwer famously wrote, the cruelty toward other racial groupswas the point of Trumpism. But you can also imagine a future GOP presidential candidate — maybe one with Hispanic roots who’s less politically inept than Sens. Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz — walking this tightrope all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., maybe as early as 2024.If so, history may look back on 2016 not as a fluke, but asa realignment election, in line with the long-term impact of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal coalition in 1932, or the rise of Richard Nixon’s Southern Strategy in 1968. Remember,roughly 36%or so of American adults have a college degree, so a political party that narrows its base to only the highly educated is doomed to minority status, especially in an era when the expansion of higher education has, regrettably, slowed.But this history of 2020 and beyond is not yet written. While Republicans are getting much better at connecting culturally with noncollege voters, and reaping the political benefits, the truth is that neither party has truly succeeded in permanently winning today’s working class, because neither party has provided policies that would materially improve their lives. And the Democrats are much better positioned to do this, if the party can actually walk the walk on some of the ideas it’s been mostly talking about for the last decade.If Biden’s first actions as president were toraise the minimum wageandlower the cost of insulin, that could go a long way toward stopping defections among the Black and brown middle class and even win back some rural whites — not a majority of them, at first, but enough to matter in our current 51-49 election mode. That won’t be easy — and if Republicans win those two contested Senate runoffs in Georgia, it may be impossible — but it’s also arguably the lowest hanging fruit.How many of the college-educated whites who marched this year for racial justice in the name of George Floyd would be willing to support measures that offer economic justice — likehigher-density affordable housing, true equity in school policies now dominated by “nice white parents,” and the end oflocked-in white privilegein college admissions that they voraciously defend so their own kids can get ahead? How many progressives who (rightfully, in my opinion want free public universities and student-debt elimination are also willing to backbroader reformsto bring both knowledge and career pathways to the 64% now locked out, and who are increasingly either resentful ordespondentabout it?How long before someone shows up with Donald Trump’s basic DNA, but more politically savvy and less of a buffoon, who’s more clever about using educational resentments to unite the entire working class — regardless of color — and misuse the power of populism to not only deny the science of climate and pandemics, as Trump has done, but also go farther down the road toward dictatorship? And are we capable of the hard choices that would prevent this?"
eugeneweekly_2020_0,"We ve got issues. Two weeks ago, city of Eugene workers and the Eugene Police Department evicted more than 100 unsheltered residents at their campsite near Washington/Jefferson Bridge. Since July, we have been providing services and supplies and getting to know the people at this camp through our weekly outreach services. It was heart-wrenching to witness people pack up what they could and watch as their belongings (that were promised to be stored for later pickup were thrown into dumpsters, their shelters ripped apart, and no clear idea where they would go next. As outreach workers in Eugene, we deplore the city’s continued sweeps on our most vulnerable community members. People experiencing homelessness in Eugene have been left largely without aid for years, and even more so this year despite being one of the most at-risk demographics to contract COVID-19.When respite shelters closed with Phase 2 of the statewide reopening in June, people were offered nowhere to go and set up anywhere they could to “shelter in place.” With the re-opening, the city took away handwashing stations and porta-potties that had been initially installed in March, and swept camps multiple times through the summer, effectively throwing all concerns for public health in the dumpster with people’s belongings. Again and again, the Eugene police and city workers have followed wherever the camps set up, bulldozers and dumpsters in tow. They have instilled a traumatic and harmful cycle with each sweep, continually destroying the very supplies they have some outreach workers hand out, and scattering people (many with health concerns who our team, along with other outreach workers, then have to locate again to re-establish care and replace basic survival supplies. In this way, the city exacerbates both the houseless crisis and spread of COVID-19 without offering any real solutions to either. The city continually offers empty referrals to social service agencies as a means of deflection and shirking responsibility while they continue to disregard and violate basic human rights to safety, hygiene and shelter in the midst of this pandemic. At the latest sweep, the city passed out a document to refer the displaced community members to several supposedly available local shelter options. None of the information was represented accurately in regards to the available number of beds or proper referral protocol for placement at these sites. This document was a gross misrepresentation of several agencies, and it proved generally useless in providing assistance to those evicted. The only real assistance provided at the sweep came from volunteers from grassroots groups, our outreach team and concerned citizens. The city needs to be exposed for its shortcomings and general disregard for the citizens whose needs they continue to ignore and whose numbers are only going to increase. In the coming months, the number of unhoused people in our community is projected to grow. There are empty parking lots (such as at the fairgrounds where people could set up their tents or sleep safely in their vehicles. There are vacant dorms, hotels, gymnasiums and churches that could be utilized. There are innovative shelter options such as disaster relief tents and Pallet Shelters that could offer congregate shelter. There are options, and they need to be pursued. People need a place to reside as safely as they can without risk of bulldozers and police. The sweeps against unsheltered people is unethical, against Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and furthering harm and health risk in our community. Health care and housing are human rights. The displacement, criminalization and traumatization of our most vulnerable community members is a violation of these rights. We call on the city of Eugene and Eugene Police Department to stop the sweeps and find ways to support rather than destroy lives. Bridgette Butler and Mackenzie Ni Flann are local outreach workers."

Why nobody stopped this travesty should haunt all of us, but we seem helpless to stop violent acts.Jeremiah, an Old Testament prophet cried out, “The heart of man is deceitful and desperately wicked” (Jeremiah 17:9 . Our whole nation should be dropping to our knees in personal confession and repentance. It was the need in Jeremiah’s day. It is our need today.I also weep today because our country is under attack. Peaceful demonstrators have been invaded by violent people who had no concern for Mr. Floyd, only what they could gain by looting and destroying. His memory was soon lost in greed by those destroyers of the life and livelihood of decent people. Where is that justice? How and why did peaceful demonstrators get mixed up with those accusing America of being a worthless country? I have lived in three Third World countries where I saw real poverty. People from other countries want a better life and come in hopes of finding it here. Will we be reduced to poverty?June is time for the young to be enjoying summer fun. That does not now seem likely, certainly not like in the past. The names of peaceful demonstrators may not be remembered, but history will record the destruction looters and rioters have done and the voices of those saying America is worthless, right and wrong tossed aside for dollars they are paid to say it.Shortly after returning from Pakistan, my white family was a victim of racial violence the last Saturday in September 1968. We had known nothing about impending racial riots. Our two law-abiding sons were brutally attacked as they rode their bicycles on the only street to our home. Our oldest son lost his left eye when he was lassoed and then hit across his face with a bicycle chain.Cars passed by, paying no attention, until three sailors stopped and got this son to the hospital while my younger son went across the street to a small store and called the police and me. The owner had witnessed what happened.A newspaper reporter got to the hospital shortly after I did. He asked for an interview. I told him what the doctor had said, “I doubt your son will ever see again.” It was Saturday afternoon. The bold headlines in the Sunday morning paper were my words. “We can forgive these boys, because God has forgiven us.” The words were so unbelievable some people thought I was in shock.That one remark spoke volumes to bring on support from whites, which one would expect, but also from prominent black leaders, black pastors, church people, even the school staff and lunch room ladies. We came together as friends. They offered help and prayed with us. Forgiveness became an intercessor.If “racial healing” is a need today, so is acceptance, which starts with humility. God did not make one person better than the other. He designed each of us in His image, giving us talents sufficient for our needs.

minnpost_2020_182,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Thousands of acres of precious urban space remain unused or misused, when they could be enlisted in the struggle for climate health and biodiversity. It took a pandemic, but many Americans planting their first garden this year discovered a valuable resource sitting in their backyards: unused land. But old-fashioned lawns are not the only thing preventing productive land use. Look at satellite imagery of your city and you might see buildings with concrete roofs, parking lots, shingled houses, and wide roads covering most of the land. This land was once covered by trees, prairies, and wetlands. The displacement of nature without efficiently using the land has resulted in an unnecessaryloss of habitat, more severeflooding,polluted waters, and theUrban Heat Island Effect. We can do better.By replacing naturally draining land with concrete and buildings, we also limit the space available for plants and animals to live and find food. This includes humans. Despite the rich land available for growing food on the average single-family lot in the Twin Cities, we burn fuel by trucking most of our food in from outside the city, the state, or the country. We halt natural growth with chemicals and instead grow grass, which we keep short, polluting the air with petroleum-fueled mowers. The short, monoculture grass gives little food or shelter to animals and the whole systeminhibits biodiversity.As we leave fertile soil on valuable land unused, we also end up taking more land to house people. In turn, this leads to urban sprawl. Our rooftops collect sun and heat, but that sunlight goes unused for energy or plant life. Instead we place solar power installations on rural and undeveloped land that could be (un used for other purposes.Fortunately, just a few changes to our modern habits can help address all these problems simultaneously. Among them are green rooftops, green paving, rain gardens, fruit and vegetable gardens, and solar roofing. It is time for the bare roof and the well-manicured lawn of the 20th century to give way to a nature-friendly garden of the 21st century.Green rooftopscan be employed on sloped or flat roofs. As you may have seen on old Norwegian cottages, a sloped roof can support grass and other groundcover. This groundcover provides habitat and food sources for wildlife – such as birds and bees, who have seen rapid population drops. The plants absorb heat and cool the building better than shingle roofing, meaning better energy efficiency and cooler cities. Green roofs also filter and slow the flow of water, making floods less likely after a heavy rain. One more bonus: the plants on your roof convert CO2to oxygen.On flat roofed buildings, there is also an opportunity for gardening, groundcover, or recreational areas such as theR.C. Knox Memorial Gardenon the St. Paul Fire Department Headquarters. Flat roofs provide more opportunity for urban agriculture than the sloped roof of a house. As much as green roofs benefit flora and fauna, they can be good for humans too – evenfinancially. Green roofs tend to cost more upfront than standard roofing, but they pay off long-term,extendingthe life of roofs and HVAC systems by insulating buildings from temperature changes. The space to grow flowers and foods right next to the people who would purchase them also makes it prime real estate forurban farmers.A little more down to earth, drainage can be improved by installingrain gardensand replacing your driveway or patio with permeable pavers, green pavers (or grass pavers , or a ribbon driveway. These options can look more attractive than a traditional slab driveway, patio, or parking lot.Individuals and property owners can choose to adopt these solutions, but cities shouldencouragegood stewardship of the land by incentivizing them. Metropolitan Council recently launched theSurface with a Purposeproject, similar to Google’sProject Sunroof, to demonstrate the resources over our heads. Still, upfront costs of green upgrades can be daunting for homeowners lacking resources to remodel. If your city does not incentivize green roofs, green pavement, or front-yard gardening and stormwater management, advocate for change. Ask your landlord about starting green projects at your building. Plant a rain garden. Make smart decisions about how we use this dear land. Threats to climate and biodiversity do not rest while we sit on these solutions.Jack Stinogel is a dual-degree law and planning student (JD/MURP at the University of Minnesota Law School and Humphrey School of Public Affairs.

Donald McEachinIt’s July — almost midsummer — and, here in Virginia, we are slowly returning to the new normal. As we look around us at states to our south and west, we can’t help but exercise caution as we see their COVID-19 cases rise. Yet, with social distancing and mask-wearing, we can begin to regrow our economy and enjoy a more typical life. Fortunately, summer in Virginia means lots of outside activities, which are certainly safer.My office, continuing to follow the guidance of both the Centers for Disease Control and Gov. Ralph Northam’s phased return to normal, is still teleworking. However, while the offices are closed, the staff is busy, responding to constituents, working on legislation and creating opportunities for me to interact with constituents, albeit mostly virtually. If you have an issue with a federal agency, whether it is collecting benefits owed you, obtaining a visa or a passport or any number of concerns, please go to my website, mceachin.house.gov, fill out the form, and we will be in touch quickly.My staff and I have been reaching out to locality leadership and administrators to assess their needs and see how we can assist. Those calls are informative and helpful in determining the needs in the district.Last month, I did another tele-town hall to discuss COVID and to provide updates from well-known experts. I wanted to focus on the impacts of COVID here in Virginia, so I was joined by a member of the governor’s team, Dr. Janice Underwood, director of diversity, equity and inclusion, who has been working closely with him during this pandemic. I was also joined by State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi and Delegate Lashrecse Aird.Two issues that I hear about frequently are those who have been notified their Economic Impact Payment was sent, but they have not yet received it, and those who are struggling to get unemployment payments. Although unemployment is a state issue, my staff is happy to connect you with the Virginia Employment Commission, or in the case of missing Economic Impact Statements, to try and track it down. Just call my district office number at 804-486-1840 or visit my website at mceachin.house.gov.We have seen some very significant legislation. The bill that has probably garnered the most publicity and discussion was the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Most of us have seen the horrific video of the police officer with his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes as Mr. Floyd repeatedly says he cannot breathe, calls for his mother, and then is completely non-responsive. This extremely disturbing video has prompted ongoing protests around the nation and a re-evaluation and re-thinking about systemic racism in this country, and particularly about Black Americans’ encounters with police. This legislation is a start to reform police departments and police encounters. It changes training, prohibits chokeholds and increases transparency and accountability. It passed the House with bipartisan votes, and I certainly hope the Senate will consider it.During this pandemic, the need for affordable, quality health care has become even more apparent. We voted for legislation this month that provides relief to working families by expanding tax credits and increasing subsidies so health care and needed prescriptions are more affordable.My district and the entire state are crisscrossed by thousands of bridges and tunnels. I am strongly supportive of the INVEST in America Act that will bring much needed resources to improve roads, bridges, transit, schools, broadband, postal service and clean energy sectors.

minnpost_2020_213,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As a health organization, Blue Cross sees civic engagement as integral to our mission of improving community health across the state. We’ve been championing civic engagement for nearly 20 years through our CitizenBlue program, and we believe community health is shaped by the strength of the democratic process.In a participatory democracy, high civic engagement ensures that everyone’s voice is heard and that their basic needs are represented. In fact, research suggests that people who live in communities with strong civic involvement actually have better overall health.To take it a step further, research also shows that social and environmental conditions can affect up to 60% of our individual health outcomes. That makes politics personal. Our elected officials drive public policy – which has a direct effect on our individual experience of health and well-being.When more people in a community make their voices heard on Election Day, more of their personal health needs will be served by policies and programs. Policies that provide for accessible, equitable, high-quality health care. Access to healthy foods. Clean air and water. And safe neighborhood spaces for socializing, exercise and recreation.In spite of the privilege and benefits of voting, only 55% of eligible Americans participated in the 2016 presidential election. By contrast, Minnesota had the highest voter turnout in the nation, with about 75% of eligible voters participating.We know how to get out the vote at Blue Cross, and we do it in a nonpartisan way. So do other companies. Along with Target, Spotify, Endeavor, Gap and others, Blue Cross was nationally recognized in a Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center case study for successfully encouraging employee participation in the democratic process.What makes us proud is that our CitizenBlue program is run by a grassroots team of associates from across the company – and it has been called one of the most robust corporate civic engagement programs in the country.Most important, we want to sustain our state’s tradition of strong voter engagement. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it’s critical that our voting processes keep Minnesotans healthy and safe. That’s why we are looking to our state’s leaders for vigilance now, and for their assurance that all eligible voters will have the means and tools to safely exercise their fundamental democratic right.Minnesota’s leaders will need to ensure that those who don’t feel safe voting in-person can easily access mail-in ballots – and assure them that their ballots will be protected and secure. In keeping with our record participation rates, Minnesota’s election officials have already reported the largest expansion of mail-in voting in state history. Let’s keep it going.And for those who prefer to vote in-person, our neighborhood polling places will need all the support they can get. At Blue Cross, we’re encouraging associates who are interested and able to volunteer as election judges. From a health safety perspective, careful configuration to ensure proper distancing is a must. We know that poll workers and election judges will be equipped with masks and sanitizers. We encourage all voters to wear masks as well.Additional safety measures – such as face shields for workers and plexiglass partitions – would help minimize the spread of the Coronavirus on Election Day. And with more options to safely vote, the higher the voter turnout, the stronger our democracy and the healthier our community.We’re confident that most Blue Cross employees will cast their votes in the upcoming election. We hope that every eligible voter who wishes to participate in their democracy is able to do so, too – safely and confidently. No one should have to choose between their health and their right to vote.Craig Samitt, M.D., is the president and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota."
suffolknewsherald_2020_155,"Published 9:41 pm Friday, April 24, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Joseph Perry1 Samuel 17; 18:3Do you have a good friend?How much does that friend mean to you?A man laid in a hospital bed, looking at me straight in my eyes and said, “Perry, we are friends for life. Don’t ever forget that.” What he said touched me to the core of my heart. I found out that the Lord will place friends in your life to help you in different stages of your life.Friendship is so important, because it has the ability to impact the life of each person forever. In order to be a friend, one must show themselves friendly. It’s a mutual relationship between a person or people, a bond unbreakable.Sometimes we don’t realize how much a friend really means. Some people say they don’t need a friend. They say, “I can make it all by myself.” Sometimes people close themselves up, because they have been hurt, and can’t trust any longer. Too often many of us have allowed our friendship to extend only to a certain point. We draw an imaginary line in our minds and in our hearts, never allowing anyone to cross over. Friends should be able to be trustworthy, open, caring and sharing at any point and any place in life. We all need a friend. Friendship is so important. Friendship shares and loves, even cries together. We should ask the Lord to give us at least one good friend, especially in these critical times we live in.The story of David and Jonathan was so unique and heartfelt. They were men who were close. They became close after David was placed in the palace by Jonathan’s father, King Saul. Sometimes the Lord will put us in places, and get us around people to bless us for a lifetime. They were unselfish in their sharing, and they both modeled true friendship.There are a few observations on modeling friendship. I believe friends should be able to work through problems. Regardless of what has happened on either side, good friends will not allow issues to break up their friendship. Sometimes it takes moments of space to adjust thoughts and oftentimes healing, but true bonds will help mend together. Look at Jonathan and David. Saul can’t stand David; he’s jealous over David; but Jonathan doesn’t allow that to get in their way.Don’t ever get jealous over your friends accomplishments, always support them. There is also a willingness to protect each other. Modeling friendship means we look out for each other. Friends are honest with each other. Friends show up, they don’t hide. Jonathan protected David, and David looked out for Jonathan by not hurting his father and eventually looking out for his brother. Friendship connects farther than one will ever know in the lives of people.Lastly, when modeling friendship, you should never put each other down. Find ways of lifting each other up, not just in their presence, but even when they’re not around you. Jesus modeled true friendship when He went to the cross. He did it for you and I, as He calls us His friends. He calls us friends even when we fail to hold up our end of the friendship at times.A beautiful, heartfelt hymn that has touched so many lives goes, “What a friend we have in Jesus, all our griefs for Him to bear, and what a privilege it is to carry, everything to God in prayer.”Whatever Is on your mind, you can take it to Him. The Lord is a friend indeed. He stands closer than a brother, one who we can lean and depend on. Today, and going forward in life, select, then model true friendship to people who will receive you, and you will find that you’ll never go without. Lord, help us to be a better friend, especially in times like these.The Rev. Dr. Joseph A. Perry is pastor of St. Mark AME Zion Church.

minnpost_2020_205,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The clock is running out on many Minnesota families. In this moment there is a mounting urgency to ensure our fellow Minnesotans, hit hardest by the converging crises of COVID-19 and persistent, historic racial injustice, are spared from rising housing instability and homelessness.An increasing number of families are experiencing job and income loss and face imminent risks of eviction and foreclosures — all at a time when a home is unquestionably tied to health and well-being. Homelessness is on a sharp incline, as evidenced by the last Wilder Homelessness Survey. This fact, coupled with the focus on social distancing and impending harsh winter weather, underscore the imperative to create more places to call home, as well as preserve the severely limited supply of housing affordable to Minnesotans of lesser means.It is past time for Minnesota, and our nation, to prioritize homes as a cornerstone for a strong future.For perspective, Minnesota’s housing challenges were steep ahead of the health crisis we now face, as evidenced by the Governor’s Task Force on Housing Report, “More Places to Call Home: Investing in Minnesota’s Future,” released in 2018. Our state’s housing system never fully recovered from the Great Recession over a decade ago. According to the report, Minnesota needs to preserve existing affordable housing and build 300,000 more homes over the next decade to meet current and projected needs.The result of this housing shortage is thousands of Minnesotans are locked out of opportunity and stability across our state. This challenge is especially pronounced in parts of Greater Minnesota, where low housing stock means delayed economic growth as hundreds of jobs go unfilled and in more urban centers where existing patterns of housing discrimination and evictions are exacerbated by tremendous demand for homes affordable to even moderate wages.Our state’s eye-popping unemployment rates provide insight into what is to come. In May, seven in 10 Minnesota households reported having enough savings to last four months. One in three families could only last one month. Based on these numbers it is unsurprising that mortgage delinquency rates doubled in April.Additionally, Forbes covered ananalysisfrom global advisory firm Stout Risius Ross on July 28 which estimates that more than 40% of renter households in the U.S. are going to experience a rental shortfall during the COVID-19 crisis with just under 12 million facing eviction over the next four months alone. Minnesota’s estimates are among the highest at 50% or greater.Recent events have placed systemic racism in Minnesota in full view for the country. We now find ourselves with the opportunity to address head on what represents the perfect storm for Minnesota’s Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC families/households who are disproportionately represented among those impacted by COVID-19, housing discrimination, and unemployment.The problems we face are complex and entrenched, but they are also solvable. It is past time for Minnesota legislators to recognize a place to call home as the cornerstone for a strong future and prioritize the well-being of our friends and neighbors over partisan brinksmanship.Housing is an asset that builds in resiliency ahead of unanticipated crises to help protect our families and workforce against future economic shocks. It is also critically important to center housing in our recovery plans as we build a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable future for all Minnesotans. Housing must be viewed as essential infrastructure, a cornerstone of our state’s economic competitiveness.The Minnesota Legislature has yet to pass a bonding bill during its regular legislative session and four special sessions this summer.

There have been studies about how too much exposure to the 24-hour news cycle and the overuse of social media can lead to poor mental health outcomes. A new term has been coined for the overuse of social media and the negative exposure that results, just in recent months: “doomscrolling.”Many people these days are seeking the balance between, on the one hand, being informed and speaking up for causes they believe in and, on the other hand, making sure they focus on their mental health so they can be there for themselves and their families.TheSuffolk News-Heraldhas always strived to bring balance to our readers.

Without being able to gather and hold events as usual, many organizations turned to digital events to celebrate the Earth. However, pointing out all the environmental changes occurring during quarantine is a good way to reflect on Earth Day and give us some positive notes during this difficult time.Changes are occurring around the world in many different ways. Many news sites are reporting on how clear the Venice canals have become during this time. People can now see fish, dolphins and even jellyfish swimming in the canals. In many large cities, air pollution has dramatically decreased. Beautiful images of these cities without smog have been captured recently.While these small changes are not enough to end climate change in the short term, seeing the changes can give hope that we can still slow climate change with our actions.

philinquirer_2020_24,"If you bring an Elf on the Shelf into my home, it’s going into the trash with the rest of 2020.My sister and I joke, “Nothing can feel good in 2020.” The trials of this year have taken from us weddings, vacations, and in the worst case, loved ones. Now, 2020 has come for our holiday traditions. As we scrap beloved pastimes in order to keep everyone safe, I have a proposal for parents: Punt the traditions you can’t stand into the trash next to the bridesmaid dress you couldn’t wear. Let’s start with the Elf on the Shelf.For those unfamiliar, the Elf on the Shelf is a scout, sent by Santa, to report children’s behavior every night to the big man in red. Families give the Elf a spritely name and it returns every year. Its overnight activities have become a thing of elaborate, competitive Pinterest-worthy social media fodder. Before we go any further, I must admit, we don’t own an Elf. I’m a first-time parent, and my toddler is too young to make the request. But I break into a cold sweat anticipating the day that a well-meaning family member gifts us one. Hopefully by my putting this diatribe into the world, they will take the hint.» READ MORE:Where to cut your own Christmas tree at farms near PhiladelphiaAs a matter of principle, the Elf grates against my parenting instincts. In the Elf’s accompanying story, there’s a heavy emphasis on reporting bad behavior. Santa isn’t transactional in my house. We listen and act with kindness because we are part of a community, not because Santa won’t bring gifts if we have a bad day. Telling my kid that there’s a pixie nanny cam that transmits directly to the North Pole feels too 1984. I prefer to wait a few more years and then explain that it’s actually Google that monitors all of our behavior.The Elf’s snitching would be an easy enough narrative to remove from the tradition. But what I really can’t stand is that the Elf on the Shelf has come to represent all the fuss, muss, and imposition we have placed on ourselves at the holidays. Xmas and excess have become synonymous. There has become this obsession with filling every moment from Black Friday to Christmas Eve with mandatory holiday magic.Growing up, we visited Santa one time to take an embarrassing, plaid- and bow-adorned portrait. We went tothe Wanamaker light showand watched Christmas movies on VHS when my dad wasn’t watching the news. I have very fond memories. Now, one simply cannot miss a Christmas parade, a light show, or a fifth visit with Santa. It’s easy to see how the Elf has evolved into a mischievous imp that must appear each morning in a blue-ribbon-winning third-grade winter diorama as parents blink over their coffee, fatigued from setting the scene the night before. Or worse, forgetting about the Elf’s overnight activities and waking up early as not to disrupt the expectation they themselves have set. The horror.» READ MORE:Safer at Home vs. Christmas Village: A tale of two City Halls | OpinionI have never heard parent friends say they enjoy the Elf. They quietly curse Crackle, Sprinkle, or Chumpy when they come out of storage and the nuisance of the magic they must manifest nightly for the month of December. They do it for their kids, which is admirable. But this year, when we must forgoour treasured Wanamaker light showand visit with St. Nick to stay well, let go of the traditions you have come to resent. You will create many other memories you all enjoy. You deserve a break in this dumpster fire of a year. Dump that Elf for yourself.If you have a Sparkle, Jingle, or Snowball, I sincerely hope it brings you joy. If it doesn’t, consider ditching it to preserve your peace of mind. As for me, if you bring an Elf on the Shelf into my home, it’s going into the trash with the rest of 2020.Courtney is an aspiring author, mother, and ... she’s tired.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_5,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Many nursing home residents were alone without family on Christmas, just as they were on Thanksgiving. (Dreamstime/TNS For much of the fall, I’ve had nightly dreams about rescuing my father.For much of the fall, I’ve had nightly dreams about rescuing my father.Here’s why: COVID-19 had spread like wildfire through his nursing home in Wisconsin. A dozen patients died from it; he contracted it too. He was locked in his tiny room, alone except when nurses delivered meals and fed him. A television kept him company, tuned to CNN until his blood pressure spiked during the election and the nurses switched it to the Hallmark Channel.His room’s only window looks out on a courtyard set in the middle of the large care facility. “Why did we go with a courtyard view?” I asked my mother over the phone.“Because we thought it was better for your dad than looking out on a parking lot,” she said.She couldn’t have known it would come to this, that her only chance of seeing him would be through windows from the parking lot.Nearly 1,700 miles away in Los Angeles, I would wake up in the night with wild ideas about rescue plots and couldn’t fall asleep until I’d written them down. In the daytime, I would plan.I devised three schemes to swoop into the courtyard and climb through his window, even just sit beside it, to let him know he’s not alone. The missions required a helicopter, parachutes and a two-story ladder. They involved knowing how to jump out of a helicopter, land with a parachute without breaking any limbs and how to traverse a shingled rooftop two flights up. I channeled my desperation into planning a rescue, Googling “best shoes to wear when running on a shingled roof,” the iPhone equivalent of pacing for hours, wringing my hands.I drew out the plans and sent them to my siblings, disclaiming “Blueprints not to scale.” And they didn’t judge me for my magical thinking because they were doing it too. “What about a crane to lower us in?” my brother wrote back. “We really should think about a crane.” More than twice, my mother floated the idea about trying to sneak into the building in a full hazmat suit.“He shouldn’t be alone,” she said. “He must be wondering where I am.”And yet, he has been alone. He will be alone, without family, on Christmas just as he was on Thanksgiving.Before he was who he is now, before the Parkinson’s and dementia overtook him, our father was a “what can I do, how can I help” sort of man. How many times did he save us when we were growing up? Sometimes catching us even before we fell, it seemed. Our pain hurt him worse. He was always there for us, missed nothing, came to all of our recitals and plays, even when it meant taking flights to our colleges to see them.We need to show up for him now.We’ve lost him bit by bit over the last three years; he’s gone but not gone. But we don’t want to lose him like this. He could die of this virus or loneliness, or both. He has lost his ability to speak. It’s impossible to know what he knows about the virus, or what he could be thinking. Does he even know we’re not allowed to visit?One morning I asked myself: What would my dad want me to be doing right now with my energy and time? The answer came to me surprisingly fast — he would want me to help others. I believe that’s what he would be doing if he were able. I started Googling things I could do, ways I could help, without helicopters and parachutes.So I sign up to write 250 postcards to Georgian voters for their upcoming special election. I reach out to two local shelters and contributed to their holiday toy drives. My husband, daughters and I fill a needy family’s Christmas wish list. My days quickly become a different type of frenzied, full of action and doing. This sense of purpose amid a pandemic of helplessness helps me feel less helpless. What can I do, how can I help? I stop waking in the middle of the night.Still, I can’t stop thinking about my father, wondering, worrying, wishing. Does he know what’s happening outside his tiny, locked room? Does he know that his three children, who are deathly afraid of heights, would jump out of a plane or helicopter, parachute off a roof, solely to keep him company, even if it meant just sitting outside his window?He does not. We cannot save our father. And of course, the rescue we really want to pull off is not just to keep him company, but to take him out of that place, to steal him back, restore him to his healthy self, reclaim him as the man who helped raise us. We want to carry him away, back to before.Carrie Friedman is a writer in Los Angeles.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_194,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .At a time when the presidential election dominates the media, West Coast forest fires and Gulf Coast hurricanes are just the latest reminders that man made climate change is real and cannot be ignored. Yet electric utilities here in Minnesota continue to plunge forward with plans for new fossil gas plants even as falling costs and technological advances for clean sources of energy — like wind and solar — give ratepayers the potential to benefit from lower electric bills while moving the state toward its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change.At this time Xcel Energy is planning an 800 megawatt fossil gas plant in Becker, Minnesota, which will cost over $1 billion and add about 3 million metric tons of carbon to our atmosphere each year. Minnesota Power has a proposal to partner with Dairyland Power to construct the 525 MW Nemadji Trail Energy Center (NTEC fracked gas plant in Superior, Wisconsin. If built, NTEC would cost ratepayers over $700 million to construct and emit over 1 million tons of carbon each year. Building clean energy, like wind and solar, instead of NTEC and the gas plant in Becker is expected to save Minnesota and Wisconsin customers approximately $600 million. Meanwhile, the Rochester Public Utilities Commission is considering the construction of a new fossil gas plant despite the city’s 2015 resolution to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2031.These three plans for new fossil gas plants are based on a series of myths about gas versus clean energy as a source of electricity:Myth:Gas is a clean fuelFact:Gas pollutes our air, water and climateWhile CO2and methane are the pollutants that do the most harm to our climate, other pollutants that are harmful to human health are released through the mining of sand used in fracking. Mining of silica, a fine sand that is mined in Minnesota for fracking, releases fine particulates that can damage lungs leading to increased risk of lung cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Fine particulates are also a leading cause of asthma. One recent study found that individuals exposed for long periods of time to even low levels of fine particulates are much more likely to die from COVID-19.Myth:Gas Power Plants are needed because the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow.Fact:Minnesota can reliably meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals without building new gas plants.This argument against wind and solar power may have worked a few years back, but rapid developments in battery technology have made it obsolete, as demonstrated by arecent study from the University of California that shows America could safely achieve 90% carbon-free energy as early as 2035 without building any new gas plants.Right here in Minnesota, Great River Energy plans to operate a battery at a power plant in Cambridge that will provide 150 hours of continuous energy capability, compared with the four hours common from traditional lithium-ion batteries. The combination of new battery technology and continued falling costs from solar and wind energy will make new fossil gas plants uncompetitive to run long before the end of their intended 30-plus year life spans.Myth:Gas delivers cheap electricity.Fact:Renewable energy delivers cheaper electricity.With improved technology and economies of scale, the cost of renewable energy generation is plunging rapidly. Bloomberg New Energy Finance reports that the lifetime cost of solar generation fell by 87% and onshore wind by 56% during the 2010s, making solar today the cheapest source of energy over the lifetime of a new facility once construction and fuel costs (zero for solar or wind are factored in. This means that gas plants being built today are likely to be forced into early retirement by economic forces, leaving rate payers on the hook for paying off their costs.Myth:Moving away from fossil fuels will cost jobs.Fact:Moving toward 100% renewable generation could triple the number of energy sector jobs in Minnesota.A 2018 study commissioned by the McKnight Foundation, “Minnesota’s Smarter Grid Study,” found that state policies leading toward renewable energy would more than triple the number of clean energy jobs, creating 14,000 jobs in wind and 36,000 in solar by 2050. Overall, the average scenario leading to decarbonization of electricity generation would produce approximately 20,000 more full-time jobs than the baseline scenario as new generation infrastructure is built out to meet the needs of electrification of other sectors.Allan Campbell, of Minneapolis, is a retired financial analyst."

It was the deadliest year on record in two decades, over which time more than 800 children died from “vehicular heatstroke,” according to the National Safety Council.Again in 2019, 53 children died in hot cars, according to KidsandCars.org. Most of the cases involved children 4 and younger, who likely were in car seats or did not know how to escape the hot vehicle.Already this year, eight children have died as a result of injuries caused by being left in a hot car, and most of those cases occurred in June, with two already in July.On average, 39 children die in hot cars each year, equating to about one every nine days.And just like children, many animals die each year because their owners left them in a hot vehicle, usually intentionally.The inside of a vehicle heats up incredibly quickly, reaching 125 degrees in just minutes.KidsandCars.org, a group that advocates for vehicle safety measures to protect children, reports that 80% of the increase in temperature happens in the first 10 minutes, which means the heat in a vehicle becomes dangerously high almost immediately.Children have died from heatstroke in cars in temperatures as low as 60 degrees, according to the organization.Making matters worse, a child’s body overheats three to five times faster than an adult’s body.Likewise, animals don’t cool themselves the same ways humans do. According to the Animal Legal Defense Fund, “While humans cool themselves by relying on an extensive system of sweat glands and evaporation, dogs and other animals have a harder time staying cool, leaving them extremely vulnerable to heatstroke.”Here are some tips to prevent injury or death:For more information and other safety tips, visit kidsandcars.org or humanesociety.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_114,"Published 9:52 pm Friday, May 29, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieChildren of the 1980s know one common fear: scary movies that starred the characters of Freddy Krueger from the horror franchise titled “A Nightmare on Elm Street” and his fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees of the “Friday the 13th” movie franchise. I am a child of the ’80s. It took me watching one movie starring Freddy Krueger for me to know that I did not like horror. Part of the reason I dislike this genre of entertainment is because I think the creators of these types of characters are sick people. I wonder why someone would actually enjoy creating such evil storylines.Although I detest his fictional persona, Freddy Krueger taught me something very important. His evil was not real, and it could be defeated by someone who knows their real power. I noticed a common thread in most horror movies. Even if the villain returns for a sequel, good always has the victory in the end. There is always a stronger hero or heroine than the villain. Sometimes there is a group of heroes that bond together to defeat the evil, one such as what happened to Marvel’s Thanos.Movies, television shows, plays and even some books that these storylines are adapted from afford us a comfort in knowing that these monsters are fictional. Even when I do watch thrillers such as Stephen King’s movie version of his book, “The Dark Tower,” I can rest assured that this villain will fall. I am uncomfortable continuing to watch the gunslinger get a beating, but I do watch until the end, because I know good will triumph. There are not any nightmares when good triumphs.The reality is quite different.When I am watching the news of beautiful lives taking a beating, screaming out in vain as their breath is seeping from them, I cannot continue to watch. I cannot watch the news when the evil one is wearing a uniform that should represent good, but the world is watching evil in uniform. I wonder why someone in uniform would provoke such an evil news headline.It is jarring to my soul that I can trust movies, even the horrid ones, more than I can trust my reality. Villains die in horror movies. In their movies, the sick imaginations of Wes Craven and Stephen King still know that good must win over the gross murderers and killers that do not have a fondness or respect for human life. Yet, that is not our reality. This reality causes nightmares far worse than those on Elm Street.Nevertheless, although I fail to understand how fiction gets it right when reality gets it wrong. I know a hero that I must put my trust in. While I cannot continue to watch the news coverage because it can be worse than horror movies, I will continue to watch for my hero. The word of God reminds me that while evil is present within human beings (Romans 7 , victory belongs to Jesus.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of Nonprofit Leadership and Management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

minnpost_2020_229,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .This should not come as a surprise. When he first ran for president, in 2000, he said he wanted to privatize Social Security, calling it a “Ponzi scheme.” He wanted to eliminate guaranteed benefits, and have people gamble on the stock market instead. He also promoted raising the age of full benefits up to 70.After starting to serve as president in 2017, his budget proposals each year have sought large cuts in funding for Social Security disability. His latest one, for fiscal year 2021, seeks $75 billion in cuts for recipients of Social Security Disability (over half of whom are age 55 + , over 10 years. This includes $10 billion in benefit cuts, plus plans to reduce the number of people enrolled by about 5 percent. That would be accomplished with harsher work rules that determine who can qualify. Another cut is to lower the initial retroactive benefit that people get when they first go on Social Security Disability. It currently is 12 months retroactive, but Trump wants to reduce it to six months.His budgets have also included cuts for Social Security’s administrative expenses. That translates into fewer offices, shorter hours, fewer staff, and longer times to process applications to get on Social Security, or even to get answers to simple questions.Don’t be fooled by Trump’s focus on Social Security just for the disabled. People on regular retirement Social Security had better worry, too. His 2021 budget proposal talks about a need to “reduce the rate of increase” in Social Security payments. That sounds like code words to reduce the annual Cost Of Living Adjustment; increase the age to start getting benefits; reduce the initial benefit formula – or maybe all of the above.When you think about the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effect on families and workers, the importance of Social Security becomes all the more apparent. The recession that accompanies our pandemic in the U.S., (worsened by Trump’s botched response will be depressing future Social Security benefits for an estimated 4 million Americans who become eligible in 2022, because of the severe drop in average wages nationally. According to a study by the Center for American Progress, their benefits will be about $1,428 per year lower than if the pandemic never happened.Trump has done something with Social Security in light of the pandemic: He is allowing businesses to forgo collecting Social Security payroll taxes for their employees, for September through December. After that, those missing taxes would have to be collected and paid. Not surprisingly, few businesses are choosing to follow this option. To get a four-month vacation from the payroll taxes, only to have to then pay them back, doesn’t make any sense.Trump has said something else, which is extremely alarming: If re-elected, he will consider doing away with the payroll tax altogether. If that were to occur, and no other revenue source found to replace it, then we already know the result. Social Security’s chief actuary has testified that if this were to happen, all Social Security Disability benefits would cease in mid 2021, and all Social Security Retirement benefits would cease in mid 2023.What was he thinking Despite his coyness, we can see what Trump really wants: his long-held dream of destroying the current Social Security system, and turning it into a privatized gamble. Andrew Biggs, who helped write President George W. Bush’s ill-fated privatization proposal, explained recently that Trump’s ideas can lead to changing Social Security into two parts: a small, income-tax funded benefit for only the poorest, and private investment accounts for everyone else.So, Trump really looks at the pandemic as a way to further his goal of wrecking and privatizing Social Security. We all need to be seriously concerned.Buddy Robinson is a former staff director of MN Citizens Federation NE, who has worked for several years with MN AFL-CIO retirees."

Urging people to wear masks is entirely reasonable. It’s exactly what people should do to minimize coronavirus infections as vaccination proceeds. Yet after almost a year with no such commonsense guidance from the White House, Biden’s modest request seems almost shocking — a sad commentary on the lack of leadership to this point.President-elect Joe Biden says he’s going to ask Americans to cover their faces in public for the first 100 days of his presidency. Urging people to wear masks is entirely reasonable. It’s exactly what people should do to minimize coronavirus infections as vaccination proceeds. Yet after almost a year with no such commonsense guidance from the White House, Biden’s modest request seems almost shocking — a sad commentary on the lack of leadership to this point.Guiding America toward prudence in coping with COVID-19 is going to be no less important as vaccines become more widely available.People need clear information and guidance about the vaccines’ safety and potential side effects, so that most people are willing to get the shots. If fewer than four out of five are vaccinated, it may not be enough to stem the coronavirus’ spread. Encouragingly, resistance to COVID-19 vaccines has been waning since news of their extraordinary effectiveness first broke. The share of Americans who say they would accept a vaccine that was free and certified as safe has risen to 71%, from 63% in September, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.As inoculations are carried out, there’ll be reports of side effects. This is inevitable. People often feel pain and swelling in their arms after getting the shot. Fever, chills, headache and fatigue are common. And a handful of people in the U.K. and in Alaska have suffered allergic reactions. (Health officials recommend that people be monitored for allergy symptoms for 15 minutes after getting their shots. The clinical trials suggest that nearly one in six people may not feel up to working on the days they get their shots. The public needs to be told what to expect — and to understand these reactions aren’t dangerous and go away quickly.Biden’s administration should therefore move promptly to restore the Centers for Disease Control’s leadership in pandemic response. Regular public briefings on all the pandemic trends — the number of people infected and hospitalized, the number of deaths, the number of people vaccinated, the percentage experiencing side effects, any new side effects that might arise, and whether mutations in the virus like the one now reported in the U.K. are making it more or less transmissible or dangerous — can provide a clear account of progress against COVID-19. CDC experts can answer the public’s questions and address anxieties.This won’t persuade all Americans to mask up, keep their distance and so on. These behaviors have become absurdly politicized. This month, as just one illustration, the mayor of Dodge City, Kansas, was driven from office by death threats after America learned about the city commission’s vote to require mask-wearing indoors.The backlash against simple and effective public-health measures has been perhaps the biggest and most glaring weakness in the U.S. COVID-19 response. American scientists have helped create near-miraculous vaccines in record time. American doctors have helped hone the medical response to COVID-19, keeping more and more patients alive. But the U.S. does poorly when it comes to guiding behavior. Divided by politics, too many Americans see their freedom to ignore simple public-health advice not just as a right but almost as an obligation.The faster such intransigence fades in the months ahead, the faster the country can use vaccinations to achieve herd immunity. Once Biden takes office, the White House will at least be trying to unite and not divide the country. It’s about time — and with luck this will make a big difference in stamping out the pandemic.— Bloomberg Opinion"
minnpost_2020_100,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Piecemeal approaches like defunding/demilitarizing, dismantling or divesting from the police will not completely remedy issues of magnitude like systemic racism. These types of changes require processes to be in place that shape good outcomes.Transitional justicehas a track record for this type of change through truth-telling, investigating through statement taking, repairing harm or memorializing victims – after which requires initiating important conversations that empower survivors and enlisting community members to get involved and recommend what reforms are needed, and why.America can do this.Transitional justice is a process utilized in many countries around the world. It offers a systematic range of approaches available to societies attempting to deal with difficult, painful pasts. Many countries have used transitional justice to address their own ugly legacies and to build fair and just futures – deciding together, as a society, how to move forward.The U.S. government, through its State Department and Agency for International Development (USAID , spends billions of dollars annually to help other societies clean up their democratic credentials. It helps other societies deal with similar issues abroad, but is reluctant to employ the same at home. This must change.For example, in Chile after the brutal rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet, the new Chilean president, Patricio Aylwin, established a National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation. Chile had to dig deep. The Chilean people could not afford a cosmetic reform of the police, which had enforced disappearances of political enemies of the past regime. The United States cannot afford to continue to make the same mistakes of cosmetic reform. Timing is everything.Similarly, in South Africa, President Nelson Mandela knew he could not keep the same police force. The South African police had enforced the apartheid regime’s racially biased policies, tortured and murdered so-called African National Congress (ANC dissidents – Black South Africans who were designated for targeting. Fellow citizens. South Africa could not merely defund, divest from, demilitarize or dismantle the police. The police were only agents of a long-held racially biased and polarized society. For reform, South Africa had to go back in history and look at the root causes of racial chasms mired in inequalities. As painful and as polarizing as it was, it was essential to move the country forward.The United States supported South Africa’s national renewal. We should do the same for ourselves. I have heard the refrain in recent days that this process is not familiar to the United States. I disagree.Transitional justice is a widely known process utilized in many countries around the world. Transitional justice measures are anchored in the four pillars of accountability, truth-telling, reparations and guarantees of non-repetition of wrongdoings. More than 40 countries have used transitional justice mechanisms in one form or another.Following a mega-transitional-justice implementation, the ensuing work can be crystallized in micro-community initiatives. Restorative practices help address lingering harms. This type of work is being carried out daily in small measures by community mediation programs around the country. For example, at my home-based, Community Mediation and Restorative Services, Inc. (CMRS, Inc. in New Hope, we work to address housing, school and health disparities in myriad forms.The work at CMRS proves that it can be done when the right infrastructure is put into place.To tear down the various forms of abuse, structural inequalities, neglect and endemic racism, the past must be unearthed and confronted – however painful. The past must be raised to the consciousness of the nation, and communities must commit to the day-to-day work this requires.The United States must acknowledge its legacy of genocide, slavery, systemicde jureexclusions, injustice, human rights abuse and persistent systemic racism.From genocide against original inhabitants of this land to antebellum 18th century race-based massacres, from mob violence to riots, desegregation violence to 21st-century police killings and systemic racism, the United States ought to comprehensively confront its difficult past in order to make progress.Understanding history helps the healing process. Now it is the time to seize the moment. Post George Floyd is an inflection point for this nation. There is no turning back.Understanding history means knowing who the victims are, who is (or was responsible, and who should be held accountable for historic or ongoing wrongdoings. The U.S. spends billions (some estimates put it at anywhere from $8 to $10 billion of dollars annually on strengthening accountability and democratic institutions abroad. Why not at home, tooFollowing the George Floyd killing in the horrific and inhumane manner we saw, public outcry reverberated across the nation and the world. This type of killing is not new. What is new is the level of disenchantment with the status quo. This time around a coalition for justice is formed forever – white, black, brown, yellow, all united in one accord. They want peace. They want justice. They want a process that will unite the country and establish equal justice for all, moving forward. A piecemeal approach cannot meet this demand. What is needed is a full-range framework that spans across a broken system.Activists, civil rights leaders, local officials and national political leaders must take bold steps towards addressing the United States’ past. It will be a missed opportunity for every police department or city council to simply engage in a piecemeal approach to think policing is the only problem. That would be a cosmetic dressing of the symptoms, and does not address the problem itself. Local police reform alone, or a presidential executive order on policing, will not work for the long haul, or result in just and equitable reform.For sustainable reform to happen, I recommend the following:1 Establish a Federal Truth and Racial Justice/Fairness Commission to systemically investigate how slavery happened in the United States, its enduring impacts on families and communities of color. Such a commission could have a temporal or subject matter mandate.2 Resulting from the work of the truth commission, establish a reparations fund for economic and social justice – issuing compensations to individual descendants, communities and for collective community development initiatives.3 Institute a massive criminal justice reform (including but not limited to police and prison reforms by increasing transparency and accountability – disqualifying abusive individuals along the way.4 Establish memorials honoring memories of victims of massacres and memorials at race violence sites, and address legacies relating to monuments and memorials that trigger racial hurts.Transitional justice can provide both accountability and healing.Unless systematic and sustained efforts are expended toward addressing hurts, structural inequalities and violent past human rights abuses in the U.S., dismantling or defunding the police alone will not work. Addressing the dilemma of needing public safety and deforming the police is a false equivalency – again, this is only addressing the symptoms. It will not work.

minnpost_2020_30,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Are there larger forces at work producing the political, social and economic unrest in 2020 Peter Turchin, a quantitative historian at the University of Connecticut, thinks so. Turchin first predicted 2020’s widespread unrest way back in 2010 in an article in Nature magazine. His 2016 book, “Ages of Discord: A Structural-Demographic Analysis of American History,” placed our present discord in the broader context of two principal historical cycles.The less familiar second cycle is that of “elite overproduction.” Greater inequality also produces large numbers of wealthy families who pursue higher education and access to circles of influence. This leads to an oversupply of professions and sharp arguments among elites about the distribution of power and authority in society.Turchin explains it this way in his 2016 book: “Elite overproduction generally leads to more intra-elite competition that gradually undermines the spirit of cooperation, which is followed by ideological polarization and fragmentation of the political class. This happens because the more contenders there are, the more of them end up on the losing side. A large class of disgruntled elite-wannabes, often well-educated and highly capable, has been denied access to elite positions.”The “good old days” occurred when the nation did not have a large group of quarreling elites and enjoyed high levels of popular well-being. Turchin identifies two eras when this occurred: the “era of good feeling” in the 1820s when party conflict abated and the “postwar boom” period from 1950-1965 when rising living standards and the politics of compromise ruled in Washington.In contrast, mounting inequality in the slaveholding South and industrializing North before the Civil War led to an increase in educated, elite families jousting for control of national politics and institutions. That notorious contest led to hundreds of thousands of deaths on America’s battlefields from 1861 to 1865.Turchin argues we are in a similar situation today. The three traits that mark a combustible situation are 1 elite overproduction, 2 stagnating and declining living standards and 3 the increasing indebtedness of the state.This describes 2020 America pretty well. College graduates are a higher proportion of the American population than ever before – in 2018, totaling 34 percent, according to the U.S. Census. Turchin notes a big increase in the number of lawyers and in the number of applicants for medical professions in recent decades.A more highly educated public, he argues, produces more unstable and truculent politics. Intra-elite competition has become more intense, evident in large recent increases in the cost of political campaigns and the number of candidates running for office. The cost of a U.S. House campaign doubled between the 1980s and 2012. In the first decade of the 21st century, the number of U.S. House contenders grew 54 percent and U.S. Senate contenders grew 61 percent.The 21st century has witnessed stagnant real wages, increasing economic inequality and frequent periods of high unemployment, according to U.S. Census data. Real wages only grew in 10 of the previous 40 years. High wage earners have experienced the largest percentage wage growth since 2000, triple the percentage increase of the lower-wage half of the workforce. The 2008-2011 recession and current virus-induced downturn witnessed double-digit unemployment. The unemployment rate has been in double digits since April 2020 and stood at 10.2 percent in July.Gulp. Add this all together and you have the powder keg that has erupted this year – popular hardship and elites behaving badly. Turchin does not see another Civil War as inevitable. But he does see a period of political, social and economic conflict of the sort we are now experiencing as lasting several years.Turchin concludes his February 2010 article in Nature magazine with some possible reforms to help the nation get through our time of turbulence:Records show that societies can avert disaster. We need to find ways to ameliorate the negative effects of globalization on people’s well-being. Economic inequality, accompanied by burgeoning public debt, can be addressed by making tax rates more progressive. And we should not expand our system of higher education beyond the ability of the economy to absorb university graduates. An excess of young people with advanced degrees has been one of the chief causes of instability in the past.Steven Schier is the emeritus Congdon Professor of Political Science at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota."
suffolknewsherald_2020_211,"Published 5:27 pm Friday, October 2, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieSome of the most vivid memories in my life are connected to the military traditions and ceremonies that I have witnessed or had the honor of being a participant. I love any occasion for “showing the flag” when it comes to military pride and honor for those who serve(d .Military parades are filled with good, old fashioned nostalgia. The military may not be a subject that excites happy feelings for everyone. In times of war, the military can rouse pain, controversy, protest and fear in the hearts of many. Yet, I have come to recognize that some of these vivid images of my military service have become fond snapshots in my mind, because they connect to more than just the military. God has a way of using some of these images as reminders of His word and promises to me. Interestingly enough, I think were it not for my military service, I may not have experienced God in so many of His attributes or known Him by His names.Years ago, I was a young sojourner in the land of Yokosuka, Japan. I was a military officer on my first duty assignment. My soul became anchored in the Lord while kneeling many nights to pray on bamboo flooring. Far from home and still recovering from a heartbreak that was taking way too long to mend, I found a church. They called it Agape Outreach International Ministries. I looked forward to Wednesday night Bible study. In one of those studies, I learned the names of God. I never memorized them all, but there was one that stood out to me…Jehovah Nissi. Perhaps it was because of its similar sound to my nickname, “Nikki,” or because the story behind the name follows one of my favorites in the Exodus narrative. As Joshua fought all night against the Amalekites, Aaron and Hur supported the hands of Moses to keep them up. When he let down his hands, Amalek prevailed. While Moses’ hands were raised, Israel prevailed. When the battle was over, Moses dedicated an altar and named it “The Lord is My Banner” which has been translated, Jehovah-Nissi (reference Exodus 17:8-16 .This imagery of war stood out to me in scripture as evidence that we do not go into battle alone. In biblical times, those in battle lifted flags above their heads to indicate their readiness for battle and to signify on whose side they fought. I like watching colors and flags on a military guidon waving over the head of its flag bearer. The larger the flag, the more difficult it is for the flag bearer to manage, maneuver with and hold its position. It may seem like an easy task to hold a flag in a military parade; I assure you it is not. It’s an honor to carry the flag. I have never served on a military color guard. I can tell you what I experienced watching one. I cannot take my eyes off that banner freely swaying to and fro above the head of its presenter. That is the image I have of the declaration that Moses made after that historic battle in the Bible. That is the image that I cling to in my own personal battles.Make no mistake, this pandemic is a battle for peace of mind every single day. I am sure I am not alone in wanting this battle and this pandemic to come to an end. I continue to ask, “How long Lord?” I have pushed back tears and fears many days. Recently, I was praying and the Lord reminded me that the banner over me is love (Song of Solomon 2:4 . Again, God gave me an image to match His promise. I see a brilliant crimson cloth flowing over the head and between the raised hands of its carrier, and the words inscribed on it are Jehovah-Nissi.Let us remember that the raised banner of God over us is a testimony of our faith and trust that God’s love covers us. When we say the banner over us is love, we are also saying that the banner over us is God. God is love.

suffolknewsherald_2020_83,"Published 9:21 pm Tuesday, June 16, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieOver the past couple of weeks, I have found that I am visiting my garden earlier and earlier in the morning hours. Prior to June, my routine included visiting my garden well after my morning activities of devotion time and working out. I intentionally waited to visit the garden after our morning walk so that it added to our steps on the pedometer and because it gave me something to look forward to while I am cooling down from our brisk stride around the neighborhood. I love seeing what the new day brings each morning when I walk through the garden.Since June arrived, the temperatures have increased. When I decide to work in the garden during the early mornings, I am not met with sweat dripping from my nose while I am pulling weeds. It seems logical that I would change my routine a bit because the cooler temperatures are in the early morning. Changes to hotter temperatures should draw you to the garden.When the heat is on, more things are changing in the garden. Gardens need the sun and the water from our rains. In the early morning, it is as if the plants are welcoming the morning as new blooms peek open and plant stems stand taller.I write about the garden so much because the garden environment teaches me so much. It is said that a garden is one of the most popular metaphors for life. I understand why. Gardens are places of development, change, newness, freshness, opportunity, discovery and peace. Gardens are also places of birthing pains, heartbreak, pestilence, struggle, adversity, challenge, frustration, perplexing unearthing and hard work.While I was watching the sun come up in the garden, I thought, “Oh, I better hurry up because it is about to get hot.” But then a revelation came to mind. When things get hot, we should run to the garden even the more. Yes, the hotter things get, the more we will begin to see the fruit we are expecting in the garden. That is a natural observation.The hotter things get in our environments should make us run to Gethsemane. I have written about this in the past. Our Gethsemane is a place of personal surrender. Gethsemane is not just any garden. It is an inferno because it is intense. Can you picture a fiery garden? If not, you have not read about Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26 .It is said that wood ash provides special nutrients that fertilize the plants in your garden. Just as it does in humans, potassium regulates plants’ water balance and has a part in transporting food within the plant and creating sugars and starches. Without enough potassium, vegetables are more vulnerable to drought, frost, pests and diseases.When there is a fire going on in your life, you need evidence of ash in your Gethsemane. When there is a fire in your life, your prayer life needs to be fervent. The intensity of your circumstances is reason to be in the garden because the things that burn away in the inferno will create ash for your garden that will ensure that fruit in your garden will not be met by pestilence and destruction.Now more than ever, we need people praying to intercede in the nation’s Gethsemane. Our nation is in need of regulation and the ash that needs to fall to the ground will help to ensure the ripe and successful production for future generations to come. Join me in the garden before sunrise, because our social environment is getting hotter. The hotter it gets, the more we need to be on our knees in the garden. Every gardener knows that the real work happens when you’re on your knees.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of Nonprofit Leadership and Management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

minnpost_2020_157,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As we mark the 57th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy this Sunday, we might want to note the closing sentence in the speech he was scheduled to make at the Trade Mart in Dallas that fateful day. It was this quote from scripture: “Except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen waketh but in vain.”The speech JFK never got to deliver was about national security during the Cold War, but his concluding citation seems as relevant today as it was then. What he was calling for in that speech was faith — not religious faith, but faith in ourselves, our country and our democracy.Of course, we do not have — and do not want — a state religion in this country. In fact, our Constitution explicitly bans the establishment of one. But we do have a secular faith in democracy, freedom, and the form of government that is embodied in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence – and 244 years of experience.In 1963, President Kennedy was concerned about external threats in places like Laos, West Berlin, Cuba and a distant land called Vietnam. There are different foreign trouble spots today, and there will be new ones tomorrow. But arguably the biggest danger we face is internal: the loss of trust in our democracy and the institutions that sustain it.Sadly, we have become our own worst enemies, undermining checks and balances such as a free press. For four years, the head of our government has labeled reporting he doesn’t like as fake news and the media as “the enemy of the people.” The rule of law has also been under fire from a president who believes he’s above all that, and who vilifies judges who don’t hew to his wishes.Other abuses – against the non-partisan civil service, for example – have been well documented. But we’ve reached a new low with the ongoing campaign to deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. When the incumbent claims without offering credible evidence that the election is rigged against him and his followers wildly cheer him on, the bedrock of our democracy is shaken. If we decline to accept legitimate election results, the faith and trust needed to hold our democracy together will fray. And soon enough, break.We are accustomed to telling others around the world that the peaceful and orderly transition of power is the surest test of democracy. Now, we ourselves could earn a failing grade. We may scrape through this time, but with weakened institutions and diminished trust in them.That is how democracies die. And if we’re not democratic, what is the American story Are we just another big kid who throws his weight around until others gang up on him Was Lincoln wrong in saying ours was a government of the people, by the people and for the people Did Black Americans and women battle so valiantly for so long to gain the vote only to see it devalued – selectively – when one part doesn’t like the outcomeWinston Churchill said democracy was the worst form of government – except for all the others. Certainly, democracy can be frustrating and confounding. The best persondoesn’t always win, and that can be hard to swallow; after one election, Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago observed that, “the people have spoken – the bastards!” Democrats felt that way about the 2016 presidential election, but they accepted the result. That’s what we do. That’s democracy. Regroup and win the next one.In that same undelivered speech, JFK was to say that “We, in this country, in this generation, are – by destiny rather than by choice – the watchmen on the walls of freedom.” That may no longer apply in the Cold War sense of our being the world’s policeman, but we are still the world’s leading champion for democracy. For now. If we want to keep that title, we need to keep the faith, remembering that in a democracy, with their votes, the people rule.Dick Virden retired from the Senior Foreign Service of the Department of State in 2004.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_47,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°President Donald Trump’s continuing attempts to overturn an election he lost decisively more than a month ago is, like so much of what he’s done in office, shocking but not surprising. Who imagined that he would go quietly?President Donald Trump’s continuing attempts to overturn an election he lost decisively more than a month ago is, like so much of what he’s done in office, shocking but not surprising. Who imagined that he would go quietly?What some people may not have been fully prepared for is the way Trump’s party as a whole has backed his dangerous delusions. According to a survey by The Washington Post, only 27 Republican members of Congress are willing to say that Joe Biden won. Despite the complete lack of evidence of significant fraud, two-thirds of self-identified Republicans said in a Reuters/Ipsos poll that the election was rigged.But you really shouldn’t be surprised by this willingness to indulge malicious, democracy-endangering lies. After all, when was the last time Republicans accepted a politically inconvenient fact? It has been clear for years that the modern GOP is a party that can’t handle the truth.Most obviously, Republican refusal to accept the election results follows months of refusal to acknowledge the dangers of the coronavirus, even as COVID-19 has become the nation’s leading cause of death, and even as a startling number of people in Trump’s orbit have been infected.Sure enough, virus denial and vote denial converged almost perfectly Saturday, when Trump addressed a large, mostly unmasked crowd in Georgia — creating a potential superspreader event — and demanded that the governor overturn the state’s election results. The next day Rudy Giuliani, who has been directing Trump’s efforts to cling to office, was hospitalized with the virus.The thing is, Republican rejection of reality didn’t start in 2020, or even with the Trump era. Climate change denial — including claims that global warming is a hoax perpetrated by an international cabal of scientists — has been a badge of partisan identity for many years. Crazy conspiracy theories about the Clintons were mainstream on the right through much of the 1990s.And one half-forgotten episode in particular seems to me to have foreshadowed much of what we’re seeing right now: Republican reactions to the mostly successful introduction of Obamacare.The Affordable Care Act went into full effect in 2014, amid dire predictions by Republicans. The act, they claimed, would drive insurance premiums sky-high, fail to reduce the number of uninsured, and have a devastating effect on employment.None of that happened. Instead, millions of Americans gained health insurance coverage.Job creation continued, with 3 million jobs added in the year following the ACA’s implementation.As far as I can tell, however, no prominent Republican was willing to admit that the party’s apocalyptic warnings had been proved false, let alone talk about why they were wrong. Nor, of course, did Republicans make any effort to come up with a better health plan.Instead, party leaders simply pretended that the promised catastrophe had, in fact, materialized.For example, John Boehner, the speaker of the House at the time, insisted that there had been a “net loss” of people with health insurance.And in a move that prefigured the Trump team’s desperate attempts to find evidence for election fraud, right-wing groups went in search of health care horror stories, tales of ordinary Americans devastated by Obamacare.None of these tales stood up to scrutiny. But that didn’t matter to the GOP. As I wrote at the time, Republicans had already — pre-Trump — entered the era of post-truth politics.Now, there’s obviously a big difference in immediate impact between refusing to accept evidence that contradicts your policy preconceptions and refusing to accept the results of an election. But the mindset is the same.The point is that once a party gets into the habit of rejecting facts it doesn’t want to hear, one fact it’s bound to reject sooner or later is the fact that it lost an election. In that sense there’s a straight line from, say, the Republican embrace of climate denial to the party’s willingness to go along with Trump’s attempts to retain power.And the Republican Party’s previous history of dealing with inconvenient reality gives us a pretty good idea about when it will accept Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2020 election — namely, never.7 p.m. update:The Central Pacific Hurricane Center reports as of 5 p.m., Tropical Storm Hone is 125 miles southeast of Hilo with sustained winds of 65 mph moving west at 14 mph.

minnpost_2020_88,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Since the killing of George Floyd, I have seen a lot of finger-pointing at the police for their history of brutality against the Black community. While I support the active condemnation of these violent acts of racism, it concerns me that many white Minnesotans have responded to Floyd’s death by distancing themselves from police as “the bad ones.”The assumption of white superiority is the foundation of this country and upholds the entire system upon which these acts of violent racism rest. If you are white and live in this country, there is no way to avoid the influence of beingsocialized into a white supremacist society. It happens to all of us regardless of where we fall on the spectrum. We can see this exhibited inMinnesota’s racial disparities, which are some of the worst in the country. For those of us who are white Minnesotans, the question to reflect on is: How do we contribute to this unfair system, even if it’s by accidentMicro-aggressions, white flight from public schools deemed as “underperforming,” use of racially coded language to identify “good neighborhoods,” appropriating resources not meant for us so our white kids can get even further ahead, remaining silent when we should act or do something, and other more subtle acts of white supremacy kill our Black community members too. These acts do so slowly, over time, through persistent, unrelenting stress and wear on theirmental and physical health. Those of us who arewould-be alliesoften commit some of the worst offenses and are some of the most dangerous because our transgressions are less visible, resulting in a cultural gaslighting that takes its toll.How do we do thisWe need to look around for the omissions. Do our kids have books in their personal library that feature protagonists who are Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC Do we watch or consume media that center BIPOC voices Are those BIPOC characters pigeonholed into racial stereotypes Do we hire, promote, and give decision-making power to those who are representative of the population Do we use our voices when we see inequitable practices in our kids’ schools and not just when changing the status quo affects white kids (ahem, Comprehensive District Design Have we noticed that the very teaching of history in our schools is segregated and that the month in which we do honor the history of Black Americans is the shortest month of the year despite having one of the longest legacies of oppression When we got our degrees, who were the people who taught us For me personally, I became an “expert” in my field in a training program that did not have a single BIPOC core clinical faculty member. The list goes on.The observations I make here are nothing new. Our Black neighbors have been telling us for years that the system is unfair. Yet we continue to omit their voices. It took spectatorship at a modern-day lynching for us to believe them. For those of us who were shocked that the murder of a Black man happened here, that may indicate we have been omitting awareness of our Black community’s lived experiences.White solidarity is a powerful force. We will feel the urge to quit and say “it’s too much” and cite our current difficulties as the reason we can no longer do this work. We will lose people in our social circles. We have to be willing to absorb those losses.Anti-racism is not about making friends. It’s about a commitment to humanity and something bigger than ourselves. We have to be willing to withstand our discomfort and acknowledge that our losses are minimal compared to the death and stolen livelihoods of our Black communities. White Minnesotans can no longer omit ourselves as a recognized contribution to the problem. Once we notice the omissions, we need totake active steps to fill the gaps. We need to startlistening to and amplifying the voicesthat have been leading us for generations. Our collective humanity depends upon it.Kristi E.

minnpost_2020_67,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Banning this destructive mining from the headwaters of the Boundary Waters would deliver multiple benefits of the kind critical to addressing the climate and extinction crisis, including preserving carbon sequestration; avoiding the massive energy demand of large sulfide-ore copper mines and thus eliminating major new greenhouse gas sources; and preserving a 4.3-million-acre ecosystem that provides a refuge for species threatened by climate change.The Boundary Waters region is vital for carbon sequestration.The 4.3 million-acre Quetico-Superior region is primarily boreal forest. Boreal forests store more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem — almost twice as much per acre as tropical forests. Keeping carbon locked in these forests and out of the atmosphere is a vital part of the fight to keep warming below 2 degrees Celsius. According to a federal government report prepared for members and committees of Congress, each acre of terrestrial boreal forest stores on average about 180 tons of carbon in its vegetation and soils. Destruction of boreal forest for industrial mining is a double whammy — the release of much of that carbon into the atmosphere and the loss of the capacity of the land to take up carbon in the future. The loss is even greater if wetlands are destroyed. Soil carbon levels in wetlands are nearly double the level in the terrestrial boreal forest.Mechanical destruction of vegetation and soil is not the only harm that would result from permitting copper mining; the carbon storage assets of the Boundary Waters region (surface vegetation, soils, wetlands, and peatlands are incredibly vulnerable to acid mine drainage – the water pollution that inevitably results from sulfide-ore mining.Protecting the Boundary Waters is critical for greenhouse gas emission avoidance.A leading ally of Chilean mining conglomerate Antofagasta, which seeks to develop the Twin Metals copper mine, is Minnesota Power, a local utility that feeds a group of energy-devouring industrial customers.

We see them when hurricanes strike, floods destroy communities and pandemics spread worldwide. We know that they help land our planes safely and perform inspections to maintain a healthy food and water supply. But for every image you see on TV, thousands more work behind the scenes to keep this country running.They process tax refunds, small business loans, stimulus payments, Social Security checks, and loans for college students. They track biological threats and alert Americans to treacherous weather conditions, among other critical and life-saving tasks.COVID-19 is the latest crisis during which we expect our civil servants to work tirelessly and often around the clock. I take comfort in knowing that our country is fortunate to have dedicated professionals who continue to selflessly serve their fellow man all for the greater good.Throughout the year, but especially during Public Service Recognition Week, May 3-9, we should gratefully acknowledge their service. While we remain shuttered indoors to fight the invisible enemy among us, let’s recognize and appreciate civil servants for what they truly are: the heartbeat of America.Denise MurdenSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_207,"Published 5:13 pm Tuesday, October 6, 2020ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:Winners ought to be lauded. Commendable is the one that has stretched beyond the boundaries of self-limitations. Victory is the reward to those that are able to surpass the tests of strength and prowess in order to defeat the obstacles and win the prize — a trophy. They’ve won. And for all of 15 minutes, the glitter and glamour of the triumph gleams on the face of the winner as bright as the shine on the trophy. My question is, now what?It seems ironic to seek the victory only to comfortably sit back and hold the title of winner. Is there any good that can be done with the platform of winner? What positive influence can be had on the masses from the exploits of a winner? Better yet, what plans for the spread of good and for the initiating of change had the contestant before contending for the win? Or is the trophy the only prize they seek?This November, our great city of Suffolk will participate in the election along with the rest of our great country. I would think that, here in Suffolk, even the average Joe or Joan could appreciate an old fashioned “Clash of the Titans” type of election. But alas, there is but one real contender for the seat of mayor in our city — Mayor Linda Johnson. And in my humble opinion, Suffolk should adhere to the old adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”Broken English aside, the old adage rings true in the case of our mayoral election. Current mayor, Linda Johnson, is Suffolk’s first female mayor. She became Suffolk’s first directly elected mayor in 2009 and was re-elected in 2012 and in 2016. She has done outstanding work in our city. Mayor Johnson continues to display the sentiments of the citizens of Suffolk, and she sets forth the conviction that the seat of the mayor in this city is not a winners’ trophy. It is, however, a seat of positive influence, good exploits, a seat of planning and for the initiating of change.I urge voters across the city to vote Linda Johnson for mayor of Suffolk this November.Delano CalvinSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_3,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .After George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis Police Department (MPD officers, Minneapolis took to the streets to protest his unjust death. Many museums, parks, and businesses cut ties with the department. People demanded Minneapolis Public Schools follow suit, which the school boardultimately did. This decision was widely celebrated at the time, butrecent developmentssuggest the move was more a performative than truly anti-racist policy decision. Actually dismantling systemic racism in our school requires meaningfully engaging with and listening to students. Instead of engagement, there was a quick shift of funds to fill positions that appear to besimilar to security guards.All too often, students’ experiences with student resource officers (SROs are disturbingly similar. SROs play a prominent role in the school-to-prison pipeline. As a recent Minneapolis Public Schools graduate, I have seen how SROs affect my school. Kids who have been labeled as “bad” are arrested in schools instead of receiving help. Frequently, students of color receive the label, while white students receive support. According to an analysis byEducation Week, in 2017, 30% of U.S. schools had SROs in schools. Black and Latinx students were three times more likely to be arrested than white students.While some have argued that SROs build positive relationships with students, that has not been my experience or that of my peers. I don’t know any classmates who would say they have a trusting relationship with our SRO. What’s more, if the goal is relationship building, then why is their backgroundprimarily in law enforcementThe good news is that now the district can now reallocate the money from the police contract or other programs in MPS. This is a huge opportunity! In the small survey that I conducted among 15 Minneapolis Public Schools students and recent graduates, students had a range of ideas for what needs to be funded. The most prevalent response was that we need Black history classes, LGBTQ+ history classes, and history classes that actually represent our student body. Students want teachers of color, our teachers to be higher paid, and more funding to support restorative justice practices, student organizations like Black Student Unions, better child care services for students with children, free college visits, and better school lunches. There are so many things that our schools need.Unfortunately, students and families haven’t been included in decision-making for where this money goes. Students’ demands are not being heard nor met. It isn’t clear how decisions were made about re-allocating the SRO budget. Students, teachers and families deserve to know. This leaves a lot to be desired in terms of community input on the next steps. The school board’s decision to hire private security guards with bachelor’s degrees tells us that they either don’t understand or are not concerned about students’ needs. It indicates they still see BIPOC students as criminals, rather than students who are learning and deserve second chances. Social inequality will not be solved by hiring private security with higher education; it will be solved when we stop assuming that students need to face more discipline. When we focus on actual anti-racism work and true life-learning in our schools each building will transform.The first step to making this a reality is for our school board’s long-term plan to include student voice and transparency about how the previous SRO budget is spent. It’s our futures that are at stake. We deserve a voice.Rayna Acha is a recent Minneapolis South High School graduate and incoming first-year student at the University of Chicago.

eugeneweekly_2020_20,"We ve got issues. Tweeted by Rep. Barbara Lee of California late last month, “Defund the Pentagon Budget” is four words that would have been quickly dismissed a few months ago. But that was before white America’s visceral awakening to centuries of U.S. police brutality and murder of Black Americans, and our nation’s systemic abuse and neglect of Black and Native peoples and other neighbors of color. It was before the pain and fury of living through a pandemic with incompetent, even lethal national leadership. Now, it’s starting to make deeper sense that perhaps our yearly increasing, over-sized military budget has cost us health care, health research and personal protective equipment. It has cost us affordable education, renewable energy development, generous small business loan programs, abundant low-income housing, focused climate change education and planning. In fact it may be costing us the very environment that sustains us. Research by Neta Crawford of the Watson Institute at Brown University cites the Pentagon as the largest institutional user of petroleum and the greatest producer of greenhouse gases on the planet. This year’s $749 billion Pentagon budget is more money than that of the next seven countries’ (including Russia’s and China’s military budgets combined and has been for years. How do we defund the Pentagon budget? For starters, we talk about it. We may even decide, eventually with trusted supporters, not to pay for the Pentagon’s war budget by omitting the amount from our tax payment that the Pentagon receives — a whopping 50 percent or more of what we pay in federal income taxes. This year we can also rally around anarticulate and educational resolution introducedbyLeeto cut $350 billion from the Pentagon budget and redistribute that hard-earned taxpayer money to meet the needs of everyday Americans. Lee notes that last year’s Pentagon budget ($738 billion was the “largest on record” and adds, “The prioritization of defense spending and the underinvestment in public health has led to 10 times more deaths from COVID-19 than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.” She is joined by 28 House members and at least two senators. One of those senators is Bernie Sanders. “We need to cut our military budget by 10 percent and invest that money in human needs.” Supported by Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, as well as Lee and Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin from the House, Sanders’ proposal “would take $74 billion in annual savings from the Pentagon — exempting salaries and health care — to create a domestic federal grant program to fund health care, housing, childcare and educational opportunities for cities and towns experiencing a poverty rate of 25 percent or more.” Both of these initiatives can be the start of a national conversation to reroute money from death and destruction to life-enhancing programs. For decades, groups of citizens across our country and in our community have found ways to protest and/or refuse the use of their tax dollars for war and preparation for war.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_51,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Political polls have value, but their value is very limited.Political polls have value, but their value is very limited.President Donald Trump did much better in the election than the polls predicted. If he had won about 100,000 more votes across Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, he would be headed toward his second term. This is basically the same thing that happened to Hillary Clinton when she lost Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by a combined 77,000 votes four years ago. It is true that President-elect Joe Biden is ahead nationally by more than 7 million votes, but the total number of people who support each candidate continues to have no relevance to how we choose a president.The so-called exit polls, two national surveys taken of people after they cast their votes on Election Day or before, suggest that 6.5 million of Trump’s ballots came from people who said they had just voted for the first time. This factor helped to explain the president’s better showing in the battleground states than the preelection polls suggested.One wonders how any polls could have predicted the increase in new voters for Trump. You can ask people if they plan to vote for the first time, but this is something like predicting the weather a week or two, or indeed a month, in advance. Don’t bet on a sunny day or a rainy day a month out. Very few meteorologists would.Consider a second problem: If a candidate is down in the polls, say by 5 percentage points, it may encourage supporters of the opponent to get out and vote — because they see their candidate needing their help. Likewise, a polling lead like that could harm the candidate who’s ahead, because his or her fans may decide it’s OK to stay home — due to inconvenience, illness or some other reason — because it appears their help will not be needed.This is basically manipulative. Polls, yes, can be manipulative.A poll two weeks out is not like a crisp photograph of the pack at the Kentucky Derby approaching the final stretch: Polls do not give an actual picture of where the candidates are, relative to one another, because it is impossible to get such a clear picture. At best, you can get a picture that is 95% to 97% accurate — and that’s a pretty fuzzy picture. And your picture may actually be 90% accurate or less.At bottom, polls in the information age have threatened the very idea of voting in a democracy because they essentially tell voters what they should expect to happen unless the race really appears nose to nose. The very act of voting is compromised by the pollsters because people expect the outcome to be as predicted by the polls.The polling industry is obviously not going to be put out of business, and polling can have value. But it is critical for citizens to appreciate that polling can both mislead them as they head into the final stages of a ballot measure campaign or contest among candidates — and make it more difficult for the unconventional ideas and people to gain attention.Polls can manipulate us and put brakes on our imagination. Tens of millions of dollars a year are invested in the polling industry for candidates and interest groups in search of a path to victory.There is no easy answer to this question and no easy way to stop candidates and interest groups from using polls.But making citizens aware of the severe limitations of polls is a first step toward putting polls in their place.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

Whether they see a clip of the news on television, catch a headline online, or hear someone talking about the current events, children may notice the chaos that has gripped our nation.The images they see and words they hear may be frightening or confusing. In a time when they’ve already had to deal with the changes brought on by COVID-19, it is important that we are prepared to answer their questions about what is happening.There is no outline of a speech that I can provide, because each child is different. How you speak to your children will depend on their age, their maturity level, their background, and their ability to understand and process certain concepts. There are, however, a few things we should consider covering with them when the questions begin.Now is a great time to discuss the foolish and sinful mindset of prejudice and racism that many in our country still hold. Children will most likely hear various thoughts on this topic, so we should make sure they hear the truth from us. It’s our job to teach our children the difference between right and wrong. They need to hear from us that prejudice based on the color of one’s skin is wrong and that racism is an offense to the Creator of us all.Explaining the protests can be difficult, because there are so many facets to the story that it can be difficult for children to understand. Consider sharing the basics of what happened with a focus on the people who are doing the right thing. They should know that many of the protests are filled with people who simply want to see our country improve, but some people in the protests have done wrong things. A search online can quickly give you images of people doing the right things during these times that you can show your children while discussing the current situation.Once you’ve discussed the problems and have shown them that there are good people doing the right thing, you should reassure them once again that you will do what you can to keep them safe. It’s not their responsibility to solve grownup problems.This doesn’t mean that there isn’t anything they can do to help the situation. Talk with your children about what they can do to help. It may be something as simple as encouraging your children to stand up for anyone they see being picked on by others. Take time to pray with your children for those who are discriminated against or marginalized due to racism, for people who are trying to help the situation, and for our leaders.How little you share or how in-depth you go about the situation is up to you, and it should be tailored to your children. No matter how much you share, your talk should leave them knowing that they are loved, and that you will do what you can to help them. It should acknowledge that there are bad things in this world, but there are lots of good people still trying to do the right thing.

minnpost_2020_141,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The time since Memorial Day has been tragic, heartbreaking and sadly, reaffirming – reaffirming of our lack of progress toward racial justice.On the evening of May 25, George Floyd was murdered while in custody of the Minneapolis Police Department. He was just 46 years old, a father, a son, a brother, a fiancé and a member of our community. Moments like this offer striking clarity and bring to the forefront why YWCA Minneapolis’ mission to eliminate racism is ever more crucial.However, we cannot let this moment and our motivation to create positive change pass. In all things, I ask myself how those I most admire would judge my actions and our progress as a community. For me, those leaders are Sen. Paul Wellstone, my father, my pastor, my God, Khadar Abdulahi (the first young person I worked with who was murdered and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Now I fear they would weep at what has occurred in our community. Minneapolis police officers who are responsible for public safety and stood by while George Floyd died at their hands acted as judge, jury and executioners as they pinned him to the ground with one’s knee on his windpipe – for some 10 minutes – as he pleaded for his life until he died.Protests ensued and are occurring daily as a way to bring awareness to the racial injustice experienced by black people every day and to demand that these officers are held accountable. Unfortunately, these calls for justice have also led to destruction. While I don’t condone looting, burning and destroying property, I do understand the anger and frustration many are experiencing and how people can resort to calamitous behavior when they have been completely stripped of any power and any voice.Today we have debris, boarded-up buildings and a grief-stricken community. Many in our community, particularly the immediate community around YWCA Midtown, are angry and fed up. But they are also now completely lacking access to grocery stores and basic supplies.As a community, we must work to dismantle the systemic racism embedded in our nation that allows these tragedies to continue. We must work toward racial justice. And we must work in partnership with others to hold our elected officials and law enforcement accountable.YWCA Minneapolis remains dedicated to its mission to eliminate racism, empower women and promote peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. We are responding in multiple ways to support our community:How can you take positive action Call your elected officials to ensure that a proper investigation and trial for George Floyd’s murder takes place.

Get involved to advance ourRacial Justice and Public Policywork and bring us into your space to help facilitate difficult conversations about racism and actions we can take to combat it. And remember to take time to process horrific events like this. Practice healing and self-care to ensure your personal well-being.Racism is alive and well in our community. Our hearts go out to George Floyd’s family. He had dreams, hopes and plans, just like all of us. He deserved more, he deserved better.We stand in solidarity with our community.

minnpost_2020_71,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I was raised to believe that police are a necessary component of our society. If crime is an unavoidable part of human life, it made sense that there would be an armed force to combat those acts of violence. Where I grew up near Lake of the Isles, a predominantly white neighborhood, it was easy to feel protected when my peers and I were largely untouched by police. One might say that this affluent neighborhood is already living the reality of safety without policing. People here can send their drug-using children to Hazelden, hire a high-end attorney to get criminal charges dismissed or reduced, and easily pay off tickets instead of accruing ever-increasing fines and a bench warrant. There’s no need for people to work in the black-market economy, thanks to access to better funded schools, leading to higher paying “legitimate” jobs.Police are ill equipped to mitigate the effects, not to mention the root causes, of inequality and disenfranchisement that engender this violence. Instead, they become the enforcers of perpetual economic and social inequity. For example, we have decades of evidence that police cannot end drug sales; they merely ensure that the black markets where drugs and other illegal goods are sold stay in poorer neighborhoods, where wealthy people, who use drugs at equal rates, can purchase them without having to live with the consequences.This year, the Minneapolis Police Department budget is $193 million. We see how an increasing police budget does not necessarily reduce crime (see: the increase in homicides . If we reinvest even part of that large sum into affordable health services or housing and use other parts of the city and state budget to create good jobs, then far fewer people would need the emergency intervention (so often resulting in jail time that police attempt to provide.People who are pro-police and those of us who envision a world where we no longer require policing agree on a very important fact: Too heavy a burden is placed on police officers. As the Star Tribune hasreported, police officers are filing disability claims for post-traumatic stress disorder at an alarming rate. If we have evidence-based plans to make communities safer in the long and short term (and we do, check outtransformharm.org , we can also alleviate much of the trauma that officers endure in their posts.There’s no doubt that the transition to safety beyond policing is a long-term project.MPD150, a local research and advocacy group dedicated to this work, acknowledges this. They write that the transition is “a gradual process of strategically reallocating resources, funding, and responsibility away from police and toward community-based models of safety, support, and prevention.” This transition can begin now, and we can measure the results. When our current methods of dealing with crime and punishment are so demonstrably harmful to large swaths of the population, we have a moral duty to start this process so that everyone in our city can be treated fairly.For so many of us, it’s hard to wrap our minds notions of safety rooted in every person having enough resources. But in the richest country on earth in the wealthiest time in human history, it’s high time we push ourselves past our fear of the unknown and make that vision a reality. What keeps our communities safe is providing the circumstances and tools for well-being. Together we can tackle the root causes of crime. It is not utopian; it is within reach.Emma Weinstein was born and raised in Minneapolis. Currently, she is completing a master of social work degree at the University of Michigan, after which she plans to move back home to be a part of an ever more humane and well-resourced community."
philinquirer_2020_49,"It is long past time for NATO to become a political issue in our domestic politics.Eight months ago, mere weeks before the first case of COVID-19, I was in London meeting with my fellow NATO parliamentarians at one of our regularly scheduled gatherings. While we did not know it at the time, it would be our last meeting for the foreseeable future, and perhaps ever.The mood was ostensibly festive, but nervous not far beneath the surface. We, the elected members of Congress and parliaments of the 29 NATO countries, gathered to discuss the most pressing issues facing the NATO alliance. But we were also there to celebrate a special anniversary, forNATO was turning 70. And yet, gallows humor could be overheard in many of the conversations.“Let’s enjoy our 70th birthday, since we don’t know if we’ll make it to 75,” was the commonly made quip. I heard it several times. I was struck by how many of my British, German, and French colleagues openly expressed this view. It did not matter if the individuals were of the left or right parties in their respective countries. The pessimism about NATO’s future ran across the ideological spectrum. As a German friend, who has served in the Bundestag for many years and is proudly pro-American said to me, “Brendan, I love American politics and follow it closely. We both know that if Trump wins again then NATO is finished.”To me, the dire outlook for NATO was striking, and dangerous. Our traditional allies are planning for a near future in which the United States no longer leads the Western alliance. It is time for Americans to wake up to this reality and that this is not in our interest.The NATO alliance has come to the defense of the United States many times over the years. In fact, the only country to ever invoke Article 5, NATO’s collective defense clause, was the United States after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. NATO forces deployed thousands of troops to military operations, such as Afghanistan, where more than 1,100 non-U.S. NATO forces have been killed. NATO also supports and contributes to the U.S.-led counter-ISIS coalition. Most recently, NATO’s cybersecurity cooperation across the alliance will be key as cyberattacks pummel across sovereign lines.Generally, on the bulk of issues, we tend to be more alarmist than is usually warranted. But on this issue, it is quite the opposite. Tectonic, permanent shifts are happening in our post-World War II alliances while we are sleepwalking.President Trump continues to attack our allies and cozy up to dictators, which impacts all of us. He has attacked Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Denmark, and Sweden. Yet, he has praised dictators such as Putin, Duterte, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, and Erdogan. Due to these actions, our allies are losing faith. The backlash is evident in situations like our European allies resisting American request to reject technology from the Chinese company Huawei in 5G networks. In an interview, the retiring French Ambassador to the United States said, “The current president doesn’t care about the West. He is a nationalist. He is America alone.” This is not what we want for our country. It is our allies and alliances like NATO that deter mutual security threats ranging from Russian expansion to global terrorism. We can’t and shouldn’t “go it alone” as Trump urges.It is long past time for NATO to become a political issue in our domestic politics. In the Trump era, the former bipartisan consensus for leading the West has entirely broken apart. In the Trumpist Republican Party, there is no defense of the Western alliance. Reaganism has no home in today’s GOP.Those who believe, as I do, the world is best at peace and secure with the United States firmly in the lead of the western democracies, find only one party embracing this view. Therefore, unlike in any previous election, we must proclaim this view explicitly, for it is under mortal to an empty and dangerous populism. The world we have known and led since the end of World War II hangs in the balance.Brendan F. Boyle is a member of Congress from Pennsylvania and a voting member of the US delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly."
suffolknewsherald_2020_196,"Published 6:02 pm Friday, October 23, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieThose who know me know that I am a fan of styling my hair in an afro. I truly believe it is a glorious display of my natural crown. The afro has been described as “hair that defies gravity.” The afro stands at attention, in every direction, forward facing on the tops of our heads. To me the afro is a statuesque reminder that God has numbered every hair on our heads (Luke 12:7 . The strands of my afro seem to know that they have the attention of their maker.As we approach the winter months, you won’t see me wearing my natural afro out as much because the frigid air is not good for retaining moisture in my strands. (Yes, you are getting a lesson in Black hair today . To protect our hair from the harsh natural elements of the changing season, many Black women shift to wearing braid extensions and cornrows. We call this “protective styling.” Protective styling is meant to minimize manipulation of the hair because too much fuss with it when the weather is cold can make the hair brittle and break the hair.Recently, I was heading into the Dollar Tree store on Centerbrooke Lane when I noticed two Black women who were wearing their hair in braids. The styles were quite elaborate and looked very nice on both women. Once I got into the store, I saw these same two women again. I was alarmed that neither of them were wearing face masks. I was surprised that they were not abiding by the store rules to wear masks inside the store. They put essential workers at risk.As I left the store, I had a revelation about personal protective equipment vs. protective styling. I thought how interesting it was that these stylish women had taken necessary precautions to protect their beautiful hair strands, but they were not demonstrating that same precaution to protect their beautiful lives. It further occurred to me that our hair is dead cells. Which is more important to protect? Yet, they were walking around with nicely done braids and no mask on their faces. They were walking contradictions.Let me be clear. I am not bashing Black women, protective styling or these sisters in my community. It is true that I am applying this tenet of wisdom as it relates to Black hair. Everyone can learn from this. These days, protective styling applies to our entire community when it comes to fighting the pandemic and reducing the risk of the spread of COVID-19. Whether you have natural hair like mine or not, we all should be more concerned about the protective actions we can take to protect ourselves and our community members.The term personal protective equipment suggests selfish action, because PPE is designed to keep the wearer from harm, injury or infection. On the contrary, the wearing of PPE during this pandemic suggests that we love our neighbor as we love ourselves. When I see you wearing your mask, you are telling me that you love this afro-wearing mother of three even if you have never met me. When I see you wearing your mask, you are telling me that you are an obedient citizen, follower of rules and you can be trusted with my life even if you only passed me for the first time in the grocery aisle. When I see you wearing your mask, you are telling me that you believe in the sacredness of community and family. When you are not wearing your mask, you are as violent to me as Cain was to his brother Abel. When God asked him the whereabouts of his brother, he stated “Am I my brother’s keeper? (Genesis 4:9 . May we heed the admonition of 1 John 3:12. Do not be like Cain who was murderous and evil with his actions.

minnpost_2020_116,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It wasn’t until I moved to Minnesota that I heard the term “Juneteenth.”It seems that when Texas declared the 19th of June to be a holiday in 1980, the idea caught on in the larger Black community and became a national observance. “Juneteenth” was born. Today, Juneteenth is commemorated as an “American holiday.” And we all know what that means: parades and festivals with food and merchandise vendors and folks spending lots of money.I grew up in Odessa, Texas, on the south side of the tracks – the “colored side” of town. My Daddy was a minister and civil rights leader there. His day job was barbering. My Momma was a reluctant stay-at-home housewife. Daddy insisted on making sure that his wife didn’t have to work to support the family. My three sisters and brother and I went to the segregated schools where, with all the other children in the community, we learned reading, writing, arithmetic and “Negro History” from our Black teachers. Since the books we were issued were old, outdated castoffs from the white schools, the teachers taught mainly from their own knowledge and resources – we only pulled out the books when some white person came to “inspect.” Our learning was reinforced by our parents and community when we weren’t in school.For us the “19th of June” was more of a day of reflection. We gathered together for a special early evening meal – barbecue, potato salad, baked beans or black-eyed peas, peach cobbler and homemade ice cream. Daddy would say the blessing and as we ate, he and Momma would tell us the stories of our people, our family. We heard about how Lincoln freed the slaves. We learned that slaves in Texas didn’t know about the Emancipation Proclamation that had freed them until two years after it happened, on the day a Union general read those federal orders in Galveston, June 19, 1865. We heard how some of Momma’s ancestors had run away from their former masters because they feared that they weren’t really free – at least not for long, which would prove to be the truth of what was to follow.We did not “celebrate” this day. We still lived in Jim Crow territory, and being blatant about this day would have been a very dangerous thing to do. Besides, there was nothing to be overjoyed about as our people and our family had been robbed of precious time; many had even died while still enslaved in Texas for those two, long years. Over the decades, as I grew into adulthood, I have kept that spirit and meaning of this day — the “19th of June,” a day of reflection and remembrance – a solemn occasion.Today I plan to observe it by preparing a special meal to share with my son and grandchildren as we talk about what this day is about. We’ll call family and friends and watch a movie or two – for certain “Glory” and another about our people’s history in this country, but I’ve still got nothing to celebrate. Our people still have nothing to celebrate.Makeda Norris is an African-American elder residing in the Twin Cities.

minnpost_2020_26,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We appreciate the aspirations expressed by David Foster and Mark Ritchie in their recent Community Voices article“Minnesota can become a world leader in responsible mining.”However, Minnesota has a lot of work to do before that could become a reality.We agree there is merit in independent certification systems, particularly in global markets when some countries have weak labor and environmental standards. Organic and fair trade certifications are good examples: They have benefited workers, consumers and the environment while supporting the development of new and sustainable jobs.However, the only copper-nickel mine that has reached the permitting stage in Minnesota – the PolyMet/Glencore mine – would fail any reasonable science-based independent certification system.In June 2020, EarthWorks and Mining Canada released guidelines that could be used to certify responsible practices for mine tailings waste management. That document,“Safety First – Guidelines for Responsible Mine Tailings Management,”is based on publicly available data and endorsed by more than 100 environment groups from around the world.The PolyMet/Glencore project would fail all of these basic responsible mine tailings management guidelines:The guidelines conclude that if a mining project is uneconomic because of the costs of a safe tailings storage system, it is uneconomic. Period. Costs of environmental damage, harm to people, reclamation and remediation must not be transferred to downstream communities and taxpayers.As a result, the exercise of treaty rights and the health of downstream communities have been negatively impacted.As northern Minnesota residents concerned about sustainable jobs and Minnesota’s clean water, we make the following recommendations:We welcome the efforts of the authors of the Aug. 7 commentary and urge them to join us in working to end irresponsible mining practices both at home and abroad.

suffolknewsherald_2020_179,"Published 5:32 pm Tuesday, November 10, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Tonya S. SwindellForgiveness involves surrender when my heart is open and tender. Awareness of my own mistakes helps me to reflect and show others grace. But whenever I’m not “there” yet and it’s difficult to let go due to feelings of regret, forgiveness gives me a clue about what Jesus would do.It helps when I consider the nature of surrender. It truly involves a choice that is activated by my voice. As I learn to lay down my pride and let compassion be my guide, my feelings of deep bitterness can morph into forgiveness.It is definitely hard to do, especially when I’m faced with the truth. And even though it seems strange, it is possible for my heart to change. It typically does not happen in a smooth or easy fashion. True forgiveness may take time, like the aging of fine wine.Forgiveness asks good questions and teaches unexpected lessons, like how can I cast a stone when my sins are widely known. It makes me look in the mirror for my own flaws to consider, then remember what I see so that I can develop empathy.True forgiveness involves a journey that is filled with the awkwardness of learning how to exchange my deep mistakes with profound depths of grace. Forgiveness helps me to release the barriers to my peace. Forgiveness allows me to overcome when resentment may have won.The true submission of my heart’s spiritual condition can help set me free from the emotional baggage I carry. Forgiveness helps me to resist when I am tempted to insist that another person’s actions must meet my satisfaction.Forgiveness allows me to go to a higher height of understanding and to let go of my tendency to be so demanding. Forgiveness lets me loose to love all over again, but, Oh God, I need Your help, to show mercy to my friend.It is not necessarily a feeling. But it’s important for my healing. It is something to do on purpose, not an action that is worthless.Lord, I need Your help because of the pain that I have felt. And at the end of every day, it’s so hard to hear You say: “Forgive them, daughter, for they know not what they do.” Then I quickly recall that I have been forgiven, too.Oh, to be forgiven by a God who keeps on giving. His love is immense and He has pardoned my offense. I’m eternally grateful for His loving example. His forgiveness helps me do this, even when my emotions seem so intense.Forgiveness and surrender created a recipe to deliver my heart from regret about the goals I’ve never met. Forgiveness and surrender allowed me to receive the vastness of love that my heavenly Father conceived.Forgiveness and surrender helped me lay to rest, uncertainties about my future when I failed to pass a test. Forgiveness and surrender helped me to stay humble and avoid swelling up with pride when I saw other people stumble.Forgiveness and surrender allowed me to let go when I wanted to be in charge instead of relinquishing control. Forgiveness and surrender gave me another way to let love be my guide and to receive healing when I pray.Forgiveness and surrender brought freedom to my soul and helps my relationships to stay healthy and whole.Tonya Swindell is an occupational therapist.

minnpost_2020_51,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Talk of God has been brought into and out of national politics throughout American history, with various partisan and non-partisan causes, but rarely in our history has any political group weaponized faith for political goals as comprehensively as today’s Republican Party. Although the name of God has been used as a rallying cry for Republicans for decades, the party that claims to support Christian values has developed a twisted ideology where the mere mention of God has become a license for injustice. Consequently, his name is being thrown out in vain by Republicans who seek to avoid being held responsible for their actions, even when those actions go directly against the Scripture.The contradictory nature of devotional statements made by GOP members was put on full display in a recent scandal in Congress, when Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Florida,was forced to resign from a Christian organization’s boardafter publicly exhibiting a behavior profoundly opposite to the values he claimed to stand for.The sinister nature of an ideology that weaponizes faith to justify divisive and dehumanizing rhetoric left little to the imagination as Yoho laid out his non-apology speech on the House floor for calling a fellow member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York , a “f—–g b—h” while standing in front of the Capitol building. Not only did he not acknowledge how his actions were antithetical to Christian values, he also doubled-down on denying that he ever said the words that both Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez anda reporter from The Hill, who was a witness at the scene,had clearly heard. In the end of his non-apology speech, Yoho remarkably argued: “I cannot apologize for my passion or for loving my God, my family, and my country.”As a Christian, I am disgusted that Yoho would appeal to his audience’s love of God as he simultaneously refused to recognize his actions as an assault on the very letter of scripture. The Bible says, “Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister (NIV, 1 John 4:20-21 .”I am further appalled seeing the rest of the GOP members who call themselves Christians allowing themselves to overlook such disgraceful actions and remain silent, which not only make profane the very things believers hold dear, but also appear to endorse the dangerous rhetoric of hate and division in a time when our nation is severely plagued with both. At this time we should come together, united in standing up against inflammatory speech that incites violence and division, and stay vigilant in the face of disingenuous political leaders using faith to cover up hate and claiming to support the values they don’t care to follow. Hate is not and has never been a Christian value.At this time, when the soul of our nation is at stake, I encourage fellow believers to ask themselves if the divisive and hateful rhetoric we see is what Jesus would stand for; if racism and prejudice are what Jesus would stand for; if lying for political benefit is acceptable when the policies fit your narrative. At this point, it is evident that claiming to support religious values has become a powerful political tool for right-wing politicians. The Christian faith has been distorted to fit longstanding political goals, while a dire state of racial and social justice is calling for strong moral leadership.If we want to resemble a hope for uniting and healing within our nation, we must rebuke lies, hate and division. We must rejoice in the truth.Jordan Rynning is a U.S. Navy veteran originally from Kennedy, Minnesota.

Many of us lost loved ones. Some of us lost good health. Some said goodbye to jobs and savings. Many lost their faith in democracy.But still so many of us think there is so much good in so many fellow Earth dwellers that we can still smile and laugh and plan and learn and look forward to finding a path out of a dark period of despair. The pendulum has swung. Not all the way back, but it’s moving.The system worked. The man with 6 million more votes won. The Supreme Court did not decide the victor. Spurious claims of fraud and conspiracy were disproved. Damage was done; it will be repaired.Miraculously, thanks to scientists working together around the globe and around the clock, there are three potential vaccines on the horizon. That is certainly an unprecedented accomplishment in such a short time.Mask wearing may become a universal recognition that an unseen virus is on the prowl killing the unsuspecting, not a boast of political or cultural belief. Perhaps, even, a tardy farewell to the idea ‘I am free not to wear a mask even if it kills or sickens you.’There now will be official recognition that climate change, potentially more dangerous to the human race than the pandemic, must be a focus of worldwide attention, led, at last, by the United States. Saving the planet will be seen as a noble venture — saving lives, saving species, creating jobs.The volatile stock market did not crash. It boomed after the election on the promise of stability and reason and experience and, well, hope.Government should soon start functioning again, as those with experience and dedication and passion for justice and truth come out of lying low to do their jobs with vigor and, well, hope. Gone will be those who gutted the agencies they were charged with caretaking as they sought to prove their loyalty to the boss, not to the people they were supposed to help. Nepotism won’t live at the White House any more.Diplomacy will be prized as a tool to bring people together. U.S. funding for health clinics around the globe will flow again. It will take a while, but America’s name may lose its connotation with greed, incompetence and callousness. America’s reputation for compassion and caring and helping others may start to be restored.Legal immigrants will be welcomed. Foreign students will be greeted with respect and honor. “Dreamers” –brought to this country as children by adults – won’t automatically be deported to countries where they may not even speak the language. Children won’t be caged at the border or separated from their parents.The justice system may live up to its name and won’t be unleashed periodically on political enemies. Voter suppression will be seen as a criminal offense. Pardons won’t be handed out for serious federal crimes as if they were mints on the Oval Office Resolute Desk.The U.S. Department of Education might stop seeing as its mission aiding the for-profit Trump Universities of the world and gradually may be turned around to try to seek to help children and adults learn.Racial divisions won’t be stoked to white heat at the top.The Interior Department won’t be giving out as many public lands and oil and gas and mineral leases to robber barons as the fat cats have been used to getting.Polluting the air and water may not be done with impunity.Yes, it sounds like Utopia. In fact, a few years ago before red hats and the pandemic it was just the way things were supposed to work. There were serious problems and wars and inhumanity, but, in this country, there wasn’t total despair that the best days were over.We all have learned a lot in 2020. It remains to be seen if we can say we learned enough and if the lessons will be retained.Because 2021 will be tough in every way. More death. Sickness. More businesses shutting down. A sagging economy. Food shortages. Evictions. Our better angels taking too many days off. Demagoguery. A struggle to regain our international credibility. Seventy-three million people who think, wrongly, they were shafted.But there’s something in the air (besides a killer virus .

minnpost_2020_161,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“This fever too shall pass” is the response I got from a GOP legislator while venting about the damage that President Trump has caused to the party. But when the fever breaks, who will be there to pick up the pieces of the GOP Many have already taken the easy way out; they just abandoned the party. This is especially true of young people who see a world affected by racial strife, environmental degradation, and economic inequality. They can be forgiven for thinking that only one party contemplates these issues – as only one party currently contemplates these issues.But as they will soon find out, running to the left is not a solution. The American left has focused on these issues for decades, and their solutions have not made a difference, except potentially to exacerbate them. Rather, abandoning the GOP for the modern Democratic Party further emboldens ideologues that have consolidated power and set the stage for a leader like Trump. After Trump is gone, the Republican Party needs to rebuild through the voice of people like me, younger, often newer, but no less committed conservatives.The continued promotion of voter suppression in order to win elections will forever blemish the GOP. When ideas no longer hold sway among adherents, it is those ideas, not the means to validate those ideas, that need to change. The ends do not justify the means. Increased voting restrictions, suing to prevent the counting of ballots, and the purging of rolls is not to prevent voter fraud. It is to prevent the acknowledgment that your party’s views no longer convince a majority of the electorate. The conservativeHeritage Foundation’s Election Fraud Databaselists 1,298 proven incidents of voter fraud from 1979-2020. In 2016 this database lists 50 proven instances of voter fraud out of 136.7 million votes cast.Trump and his allies, however, have been systematically delegitimizing America’s electoral integrity by claiming the election was “rigged.” This is not harmless rhetoric. These statements have forever tarnished one of our greatest strengths, peaceful transitions of power and some of the world’sfreest and fairest elections. Of even greater consequence is that Trump’s actions invite rogue and less friendly nations like Iran, China, and Russia to meddle in our elections. A weaker, more disunited America increases their power, and they know it.I just finished a great novel about life in North Korea by Barbara Demmick called“Nothing to Envy.”A scene in this book made me think about the lack of GOP resistance to Trump. A recent graduate of a prestigious Pyongyang University is sitting in one of the mandatory Saturday indoctrination sessions in a building without heat. As he looks around the room shivering from the cold, he sees everyone else staring glassy eyed as the professors regurgitate party propaganda. He wonders if they harbor the same doubts about the regime. He is confident they do but finding out risks certain death. Trump is no Jong-Il, Stalin, or Mao—he is not even a Jong-un. However, when good people within the power structure do nothing to stop a leader’s worst inclinations for fear of retribution, they create unstoppable movements.If, after the fever breaks, true conservatives do not stand up, I fear the desire for change may never come or there will be nobody — especially young voices — left. History will not forget those who allowed this man to deconstruct the values and institutions that have made America the greatest country in the world. Obtaining a long sought-after court pick, policy outcome, or regulatory burden removed is not a justification. History will not judge kindly those who said nothing and will judge those even less kindly who wait until Trump is no longer a threat to speak up.But even more important, it is also the reason I implore people to stick with the Republican Party and not give up on their conservative ideals.I am not worried about a totalitarian regime led by Trump taking over, our nation is too strong and his resolve too weak. I am more fearful of the stain his legacy will leave on this country and the GOP. I am also fearful that there will not be any young, committed, and forward-thinking conservatives left to rebuild the party. When we see people of conviction and integrity, good people, people of faith, like Amy Coney Barrett, orVice President Mike Pencenot standing up to Trump, it is more than concerning, it is the ultimate betrayal. It will take good people from within — younger and committed conservatives — to say enough is enough. Only with a strong internal challenge will we as America shake this terrible fever. I hope it too shall pass; it cannot come soon enough.Benjamin L.

suffolknewsherald_2020_227,"Published 6:07 pm Tuesday, September 15, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceLast year, a mother shared concerns about her child’s performance at school. She lamented some things about her daughter’s overall effort in her classes as well as her grades, and I could tell she was frustrated. I suggested a few things that I thought would help the situation. She rejected most of my ideas but said that she would do one of them. Weeks later, however, nothing had been done. I was unable to help any further because the mother did not provide me with the additional information and resources I needed to help her daughter in school.In another instance, I was working with a young man who was struggling with his grades. There were several things I wanted to try, but I needed the cooperation of his father. I called, texted and otherwise reached out to him, but I was unable to get him to commit to a time to meet with me for a discussion.Later, both of these students would share their sorrows with me as they learned they were required to go to summer school due to their grades. A lot of it was their fault. They did not put in the effort needed to receive a passing grade, so they had to retake classes. It’s a lesson that I hope they have learned.I was saddened, however, that the parents of these students did not do what was needed to help their children during the school year. I may have been able to assist, and there were things provided by the school that could have helped, but receiving this help required parental assistance.This year, I encourage parents to help their children in school. This is even more important now with virtual learning, as students of all ages are required to navigate new territory and complete more self-directed work.The first step to help students in school is to be aware of what is required of them in their current semester. Take the time to study a student’s schedule, learn what is needed, and keep an eye on upcoming projects. Students of all ages need direction in knowing what is needed and encouragement to stay on top of assignments.Next, it is crucial to stay involved in your child’s progress. Log in to the school’s parent portal frequently, communicate with teachers, and speak with your child about current classes and projects.Once you know their schedule and are keeping track of their work, be sure you do what it takes to help your child throughout the year. This will require verifying their work is being completed, asking them questions about where they are in their assignments, and monitoring grades.It will most likely also require helping them in their work. Students often get stuck in a particular area of a class and need some assistance getting over a hurdle. They won’t always ask for help, either out of embarrassment for not understanding the subject matter or because they do not want to put in the additional effort needed to understand. This is why it is so important to be involved throughout your child’s school year.Lastly, do not be afraid to ask for help from others. Schools have a lot of programs for helping students, private tutors are available, and many caring adults would be glad to help your student in any way they may be able to assist.Keep an eye on your students this year, be involved, help them where, and get help from others when it is needed.

I have struggled with that, as I have felt strong opposition to the current course of action taken by Suffolk Public Schools.As we come to accept the realities of this virus, as people in Suffolk get sick, as people lose their jobs, and as we come to grips with the way this virus is tearing apart society and even taking lives, it is difficult for me to sit by. Students and families are tired and scared, and that’s why I am calling on the Suffolk Public Schools system to do what is right for the students and families.Stop assigning pointless work, give refunds to students who paid for events or paid class dues, cancel unequitable exams this year, move the second semester to a pass/fail grading system, and stop the transition to Edgenuity.This is an unprecedented time of unsafety and uncertainty, and it is of the utmost importance that the Suffolk Public Schools system started to act like it. I have friends whose family members have died, society as we know it is shut down, and as the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 jumps to 136 in Suffolk, the actions taken by the schools are seemingly aimless. As I write this, I am reminded of the feeling that I go to school in a stubborn and self-preserving school system scared to fall on its own sword, but I hope that the school system that owes me a high-quality public education guaranteed to me by the Eighth Amendment to our Virginia Constitution in Section One, will do the right thing.Help us all be able to be happier and healthier in this time of great stress by removing the stress you are burdening each and every one of your students and families with. Some of the best school districts in the country are following similar measures to those which I have suggested, and I realize we are far from the best in the nation, but why can we not aspire to be the best?I want to end with several hard questions: What happens when one of my family members dies? Will I be expected to take exams and finish my Edgenuity? What happens when people in Suffolk start dying? Will you change your actions then? What happens if one of my parents loses their job and I have to get a job? What happens when I have to start taking care of the neighbor’s kids while they pick up shifts?These may just be questions for me, but they are reality for someone else. Stop this course of action, and don’t take for granted the seats you currently sit in. Sometimes I think that the Suffolk Public Schools system tries to prove some kind of academic clout to compensate for a lack of effective pedagogy, and I think that is exactly what is happening.Paul MeadorsSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_136,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Well before the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Minnesota, we faced two serious crises – a serious shortage of quality child-care slots and some of the nation’s worst achievement gaps. The pandemic will worsen both crises.Achievement gaps are differences in levels of proficiency measured between groups of children. They can be measured as early as age 1 and are often caused in part by early learning opportunity gaps, such as the 35,000 low-income Minnesota children under 5 in families unable to afford quality early learning programs. The children most likely to fall into Minnesota’s worst-in-the-nation achievement gaps are children in low-income families due to lack of opportunity.Now, with unemployment rising, Minnesota is likely to see waves of new families with young children thrust into poverty, making the achievement gap problem even more dire. This should concern all Minnesotans.Beyond the achievement gap crisis, there’s the child-care shortage crisis. Before the pandemic, Minnesota families already had a significant shortage, with only two quality child-care slots available for every 10 children under age 5 on average.Now the problem is much worse. A March 2020 survey by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC found that 55 percent of Minnesota child-care programs can’t survive more than a two-week shutdown without public support.Without child care, many essential workers – caregivers, cleaners, deliverers, grocers, first responders, etc. – can’t work. Without child care, many nonessential workers can’t go back to work to fuel a desperately needed economic recovery. Without child care, Minnesota can’t have the educated workforce we need for successful communities and global competitiveness.So, what can we do We co-chair a work group made up of organizations ranging from the nonprofit Think Small to the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce. We recently reached consensus on a white paper that makes a series of recommendations.Why release recommendations now, just as the Legislature has adjourned Minnesota leaders will continue to face many urgent pandemic relief problems in the coming months, so special sessions may be necessary. This issue must be at the top of their future agenda. Also, some recommendations can be adopted administratively, without legislative action.Scholarships offer several practical advantages. They provide direct help, preserve learning continuity, and have bipartisan support to ease the path to swift enactment. They also are aligned with the research about what will best close achievement gaps. We recommend reforming CCAP over time so it has more of these advantages, and immediately adjusting reimbursement rates to put unspent federal funding to use fighting the impact of the pandemic.To stimulate the supply of quality child-care programs, we also propose additional Peacetime Emergency Child Care Grants. Gov. Tim Walz and bipartisan leaders of the Legislature deserve a great deal of credit for quickly passing the first round of grants. Unfortunately, in that first round there was only enough funding to help one of out every four programs that sought help. That initial funding was necessary, but it simply won’t be sufficient.Our white paper also recommends providing more rewards and training to help child-care providers adopt pandemic-specific quality best practices through the Parent Aware Rating system. As we rebuild the sector, we are urging our leaders to build it back better than it was.Adopting our recommendations will help not only ensure that child-care providers survive, it’s a relief package that delivers huge benefits to all Minnesotans: children, parents, workers, employers, taxpayers – essentially Minnesota’s entire economy.The choice before us is as clear as it is urgent. No child care, no achievement gap progress. No child care, no workers. No child care, no economic recovery. We must act now.Jan Kruchoski is managing principal of CliftonLarsenAllen Executive Search and former chair of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce’s Board of Directors.

In the age of Donald Trump, that was a dangerous combination. As Barr leaves office this month, it’s increasingly clear how much damage has been done.Almost two years ago, Attorney General William Barr came to office with long experience, a reputation for competence and an expansive view of presidential power. In the age of Donald Trump, that was a dangerous combination. As Barr leaves office this month, it’s increasingly clear how much damage has been done.Although Trump insists his attorney general did “an outstanding job,” any fair reading of his record suggests otherwise. Some of his offenses could be called merely hardball politics. His public presentation of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report — which detailed appalling wrongdoing on the president’s part — was a master class in partisan spin, blurring the underlying misconduct amid a whirlwind of legalism and misdirection.Other actions were more harmful. Heedless of the reputational damage to the Justice Department, Barr intervened in the prosecutions of Roger Stone (Trump’s friend and Michael Flynn (his former adviser , prompting protests and resignations.He abetted a scheme to investigate Trump’s political opponents, which ultimately led to the president’s impeachment. Perhaps you recall his failed dead-of-night scheme to install new leadership at the U.S. attorney’s office in New York’s Southern District, just weeks before that very office indicted Trump’s former campaign manager?Again and again, Barr has prioritized Trump’s preferences over principle. He pressured federal prosecutors — despite their misgivings — to antagonize companies that had displeased the president, resulting in mountains of needless paperwork, months of uncertainty and (in Google’s case a half-baked antitrust suit.He dropped politically inexpedient cases, intervened in the president’s personal legal trouble, undermined whistle-blowers and inspectors general, and facilitated Trump’s unrestrained abuse of the pardon power.His testimony before Congress was a pageant of belligerence and executive overreach, all to gratify an audience of one.One further incident stands out. Last summer, Barr personally ordered law-enforcement officers to remove peaceful protesters and clergy members outside the White House so the boss could stage a photo op at a nearby church.As metaphors go, it was all too apt: No matter what principle might be trampled, the president must have his path cleared.The rare moments when Barr did the right thing — in refusing to indulge Trump’s claims about a stolen election, for instance — only emphasized how far he had strayed from normal practice. In the end, he was the president’s most effective enabler.No compliment intended.— Bloomberg Opinion"
minnpost_2020_10,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .How many times have you passed by the little plastic neon green figure with the word “SLOW!” on its midriff This “Kid Alert! Visual Warning Signal (V.W.S ,” with its bright red cap and reflective orange flag, encourages us to be careful in our neighborhoods. It gives us a moment to pause and to think of others, to protect the vulnerable, and increase our mutual safety.Because of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting social upheaval, we need to embrace this same advice to slow down in our everyday lives. The “new pandemic normal” is not just about social distancing and wearing face masks. It has also meant that extremism, violence, and the threat of violence have become more commonplace in our politics and social interactions. Thoughtful compromise and negotiation have been replaced with fear-driven “pandemic politics.”More than we can remember in recent history, there are two sides of violent propagandist protagonists that are emerging from the politics swirling around the pandemic:The “violent establishment advocates”claim that it is essential to violently defend the peace at any cost. That law and order are more important than racial and social justice. The threat becomes that violence is the only way to restore peace. These extremists believe that massive increases in police and paramilitary troops are necessary to maintain order. That the protection of property comes first. Such supporters of violence include fascists, white supremacists, militias, nationalists, sociopaths, and others.The “violent change advocates”claim that racial and social justice cannot be obtained without severe violent disruption to our everyday lives. That white privilege must be eliminated forcibly. The threat becomes “No Justice; No Peace.” These extremists believe that massive property destruction in the name of justice is acceptable and inevitable. That property is not as valuable as lives. Such supporters of violence include anarchists, arsonists, looters, communists, sociopaths, and others.Most of us, in normal times, realize that peace and justice must be achieved simultaneously. We also know that human life and property rights are both important. But this virus has not only ravaged the world economy by killing nearly 1 million people, it has also damaged our ability to reason, negotiate, and live in peace as well. The global pandemic has made us much more susceptible to the irrational political perspectives of the extreme right and the extreme left; of the up and the down; of the backward and the forward. We now ride every day on a roller coaster of unsustainable social and emotional upheaval leap frogging from one sensational news or social media story to another.Such extreme bi-polarized politics are based upon the reliance on a mythic “they.” “They” don’t care about others. “They” just want to get “their” way. “They” cannot be reasoned with since “they” are too stupid to see reality. “They” are evil and must be stopped by all means necessary, including violence.But who really are “they” In many cases, doesn’t the political opposition include many of our family, friends, and neighbors Political disagreement today no longer features a marketplace of ideas and civil debate. Now, it has become a dangerous game of chicken that uses violence, name-calling, and stereotyping.What will happen if the candidate you back loses the election Will the world come to an end Think about how you will cope if the opposition wins. Will you accept the results of the election If you cannot see this possible future, you are trapped deeply in extreme pandemic politics and are primed to support thoughtless violence in the future.What we need is that little neon green figure as our mascot for 2020. We need to calm the violence and extremism in our nation and in our hearts by following the warning to SLOW! Instead of racing about uncontrolled in this era of anger, frustration, and fear, we need to seek time for reflection. We all need a moment to pause and to think of others, to protect the vulnerable, and increase our mutual safety.Only by better understanding the politics of those we oppose can we realize lasting peace and change. They are not the enemy. They are fellow members of our community.Dave Berger of Plymouth, Minnesota, is a retired sociology professor who taught for nearly three decades at Inver Hills Community College."
hawaiitribune_herald_2020_30,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°From this year on, Dec. 14 will be known as the day in which the nation’s efforts to stop a deadly scourge bore fruit, as the first COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered to health care workers throughout the country, giving a downcast nation hope that the end of the pandemic is finally in sight.From this year on, Dec. 14 will be known as the day in which the nation’s efforts to stop a deadly scourge bore fruit, as the first COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered to health care workers throughout the country, giving a downcast nation hope that the end of the pandemic is finally in sight.Hours after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, 3 million doses were on trucks and planes headed to the nation’s hospitals. The first immunizations were administered to health care workers soon after.By the end of the week, a second vaccine candidate that uses the same mRNA technology, this one from Moderna, is expected to get FDA approval. By early next year, there are likely to be even more vaccines.It’s not the end of the COVID-19 pandemic by a long shot. But barring unforeseen problems with production, distribution or safety, vaccines will be available to the general public in late spring or summer. Until then, we still have months to go during which social distancing, face masks and restrictions on gatherings and businesses will be necessary.That we have reached this point just a year after SARS-CoV-2 was first identified is a remarkable feat. And for this we are profoundly grateful to the many people whose hard work, vision and personal sacrifice made it possible.Thank you to the scientists who started working on the vaccine in February, even before it was clear how widespread the pandemic would become. Thank you to the thousands of clinical trial volunteers who risked their health to take an experimental vaccine for the benefit of others. Thank you to the government officials who worked to limit the bureaucratic red tape that typically makes vaccine development a years-long process, and for doing it without compromising safety controls. And thanks, too, to President Trump.That’s right. Though the Trump administration bungled so much about the COVID-19 response, making the U.S. a global embarrassment and the world’s leader in cases, hospitalizations and deaths, its Operation Warp Speed delivered. Launched in May, the private-public initiative marshaled the resources of government, science, the military and the pharmaceutical industry to rapidly develop, produce and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine.Of course, Trump’s narrow focus on getting a vaccine to the exclusion of other initiatives came with a cost.Dec. 14 also is the day that the U.S. reached 300,000 COVID-19 deaths. And no matter how much credit Trump gets for helping to usher in a COVID-19 vaccine, it doesn’t absolve him of all the other ways in which his leadership failed spectacularly.That Trump simultaneously accelerated the deadliness of this pandemic and its potential cure will be one of the many enduring contradictions of his presidency.For now, the takeaway is that the federal government — supporting scientists and experts, free of interference — can still do great things. We hope that underlying insight can now be applied to the many other massive problems our nation faces.— Los Angeles Times"
minnpost_2020_120,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Qualified immunity is a Supreme Court-invented doctrine that gives police and other public officials broad immunity from civil lawsuits even in cases where an officer of the law has clearly violated a person’s federal constitutional rights. Qualified immunity is not at issue in the prosecution of such criminal cases as that of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Nevertheless it is one of many structural factors in the law that have bestowed broad benefit-of-doubt to police officers and made it next to impossible to hold them accountable for wrongdoing.There are two ways to rein it in. The Supreme Court could reverse some of its sweeping decisions concerning qualified immunity. That’s not going to happen any time soon. On June 15, the justices declined to hear any of the eight qualified-immunity cases pending before the court. Or Congress could amend the federal statutes pertaining to it.Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith have signed on to the Senate version (S 3912 of theJustice in Policing Act of 2020, which among its many provisions promises to reform qualified immunity. To date, Rep. Betty McCollum is the only member of the Minnesota congressional delegation to sign on theHouse version(HR 7120 . Rep. Ilhan Omar has signed on as one of 54 cosponsors ofHR 7085, a stand-alone bill to overturn the doctrine of qualified immunity introduced by Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-Massachusetts and Justin Amash (L-Michigan .If you are asking, “What is qualified immunity” you are not alone. I had never heard the term before May 25, the day George Floyd was killed. In the churn of daily coverage of peaceful protests and calls for police reform in the aftermath of his death nothing I have read really shines a light on the doctrine. If everyday people like me understood the origins and implications of qualified immunity, more everyday people, I believe, would be calling for sweeping and swift change.The history begins with the federal Civil Rights Act of 1871, also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which was passed to combat the atrocities of white supremacy groups in the aftermath of the Civil War.The act gave President Ulysses S. Grant the power to suppress state disorders and to suspend the right of habeas corpus. Grant used these powers robustly, and as a resultthe first-generation KKK was quashed and did not rise up again until the Jim Crow era of the early 20thcentury.Perhaps the act’s most important provision was codified into federal law as 42 U.S.C. §1983,Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights:The statute embodies a fundamental constitutional tenet: Where there is a right, there must be a remedy. The statute is (or was designed to prevent rogue behavior of state-level agents from violating an individual’s federal constitutional rights under the pretext of “doing their job.” It seems simple and just. Nothing is simple and a lot of things are unjust.Supreme Court justices invented the concept of qualified immunity as a defense in 42 U.S.C. §1983 lawsuits in the 1967 casePierson v. Ray. Thepetitioners were a group of white and black clergymen on a prayer pilgrimage to promote racial integration who were attempting to use a segregated interstate bus terminal waiting room in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1961. In an 8-to-1 vote, the justices argued that the officials – Mississippi police officers who arrested the clergy on grounds of breaching the peace – while indeed committing constitutional violations were acting in “good faith” and therefore could raise a “qualified immunity” defense. Justice Earl Warren wrote the majority opinion. William O. Douglas cast the dissenting vote.The polite judicial language now often used in support of qualified immunity comes from the 2009 Supreme Court casePearson v. Callahan. My representative, Rep. Pete Stauber, for example, cited this case in an email to me in his defense of qualified immunity. In this unanimous decision by the Roberts court, the justices wrote, “Qualified immunity balances two important interests – the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.” It is hard to argue with that calm language, especially in a case involving a methamphetamine dealer, a member of a cohort viewed as despicable in our culture. Despicable people, however, also have constitutional rights.InPearson v. Callahan,which centers on Fourth Amendment protections of unreasonable search and seizure, an informant of the Central Utah Narcotics Task Force, wearing a wire, entered the home of an alleged methamphetamine dealer to buy some meth. With completion of the purchase, his colleagues on the Task Force entered the home to conduct a search without a warrant. The Supreme Court justices ultimately determined that qualified immunity shielded the officers from violation of plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights.A group of white and black clergymen in a segregated bus station in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement and a methamphetamine dealer plying his illicit trade during the height of the methamphetamine crisis have very little in common – except their constitutional rights (as guaranteed by due process and the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated but not redressed because of the powerful cultural benefit-of-doubt embedded in qualified immunity that resonates loudly in courts of law with regard to public law enforcement officers.While the Supreme Court has opted to remain silent, it is still worthwhile to consider brief summaries of three of the eight cases they declined to hear (with the salient issues as summarized by SCOTUSblog :InWest v. Winfieldthe issue, which goes to the heart of the case without further details, is “Whether an officer who has consent to ‘get inside’ a house but instead destroys it from the outside is entitled to qualified immunity …”Baxter v. Braceyis a case involving a police officer who unleashed a police dog to apprehend a suspect who had already surrendered. The issue in part is “… whether the judge-made doctrine of qualified immunity, which cannot be justified by reference to the text of42 U.S.C. § 1983or the relevant common law background … should be narrowed or abolished.”Anderson v. the City of Minneapolisstrikes close to home. It involves first responders who discovered a missing college student along the Mississippi River apparently frozen. They declared him dead at the scene instead of following protocol that calls for warming the body. One issue at stake iswhether “… due process is violated when first responders fail to provide any treatment to a person suffering from severe hypothermia, and instead erroneously declare him dead. …”It is now up to Congress to fix qualified immunity, but sweeping and swift change is unlikely. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Republican Party’s only African-American senator, told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that qualified immunity is a “poison pill” and any legislation containing reforms of the doctrine is off the table for Republicans.Here we are. George Floyd is dead, as are recently Manuel Ellis (March 3, Tacoma , Breonna Taylor (March 13, Louisville , Mike Ramos (April 24, Austin , Dreasjon “Sean” Reed (May 6, Indianapolis , David McAtee (June 1, Louisville , and Rayshard Brooks (June 12, Atlanta . And what do we have A mute Supreme Court and a likely-to-be hogtied Congress.Since May 25, I have tried to understand qualified immunity and its consequences for all of us. What haunts me most is the deeply painful irony that a provision in the 1871 Civil Rights Act designed to protect African-Americans from acts of violence perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan in the guise of local law enforcement has been subverted by court decisions to protect law enforcement officers in no guise at all from killing African-Americans.Suzanne Winckler is a journalist who lives in Pike Township on the Iron Range.

minnpost_2020_209,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .According to Jewish tradition, God presented the Torah to Moses, written with black fire on white fire. Though this may sound like a far-fetched supernatural image, the rabbis interpret this to teach that we can derive meaning from both the letters (the black fire and the space around the letters (the white fire . Or better stated: That which is not said is as important (and perhaps more important than that which is said.Many have referred to this election season’s first presidential debate as a “dumpster fire” and a “trainwreck” – something certainly not rising to the spiritual plane of Torah. However, referring to it as such creates a false equivalency between the actions of candidate Donald Trump and candidate Joe Biden. Indeed, one can argue that the uncivilized decorum came more from candidate Trump. However, while putting this behavior aside, we can and should still apply the black fire/white fire teaching to the transcript of the debate. Because what wasn’t said troubles me far more than what was said.The most glaring white space Four simple words: “I denounce white supremacy.” When asked to denounce white supremacy, Trump did not — neither implicitly nor explicitly. This space was then coupled with name-checking the Proud Boys, whose former member Jason Kessler organized the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville where Heather Heyer was murdered.Such an omission alone is enough for me as a rabbi and leader in the Jewish community to have grave concerns for our future should Trump win the election. But as I reflected more deeply about the back-and-forth at Case Western Reserve University, denouncing white supremacy wasn’t the only statement absent from the evening.We didn’t hear candidate Trump say: “I am not a racist” or “Racial sensitivity should be a core value of this country.” We didn’t hear him say “I support the precedents set by of Roe vs. Wade.” We didn’t hear him say “Science is paramount.” We did not hear “Voting is a civil duty,” and even more troubling, absent was any form of “I will accept the outcomes of the election after the ballots have been counted.”I worry about what this silence indicates — and I wonder how both those undecided and decided voters are assimilating this silence. Will this shift their support Does it give them concern for the future of our democracy — or worse, the future of our country Because I am deeply scared. I am scared that these omissions (and others forecast a very specific, treacherous path for this country.A generation before Resh Lakish uttered those words about the black fire and white fire, the great rabbinic sage Shammai shared the aphorism: “Say little, do much.” But this was not about the “white space.” This was about action.Now is the time for action – from both candidates. But also for we as the electorate. Now is our time to invoke our civil duty to vote, and respond to this silence. Now is the time for our actions to reassure a future for this country that unites us and does not divide us. Now is the time for our actions to invoke the golden principle of “love thy neighbor.” Now is the time for us to remember President John F. Kennedy’s charge: We must never forget that the highest form of appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.Rabbi Avi S. Olitzky is a senior rabbi of Beth El Synagogue in St. Louis Park."
minnpost_2020_47,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Years ago I wrote“American Politics in the Age of Ignorance: Why Lawmakers Choose Belief Over Research.”It made two points. One, policy making should be evidence-based. Good policy should be constructed on the best available evidence, data, or research available. Two, so much of policy fails to meet this standard, often because lawmakers willfully ignore the evidence and instead choose to act for personal benefit or at the behest of special interests. The result is that too much policy fails, public money is wasted, and government is far less effective than it could be. Refusing to enact evidence-based policy also yields public cynicism toward government and sets reform up to fail.Political ignorance is not limited to indifference to scientific or social science evidence. This is what Donald Trump has done consistently when it comes to the pandemic. From the beginning of the pandemic he has been in denial of its seriousness, often disregarding Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts’ advice when it comes to precautions, such as mask wearing.There is also a different type of political ignorance. This is when public officials ignore the legal constraints on their behavior or propose policy abandonment and change without considering the consequences or offering alternatives. Again, Trump is an example of both. Consistently he has made policy statements — such as recently implying that he can change or postponefederal elections— when clearly the law and the Constitution say the contrary. He has also endorsed repealing theAffordable Care Actwithout providing a viable policy alternative. The U.S. government is full of attorneys and policy analysts whom the president should have consulted prior to making statements or promises.But Minneapolis City Council is also guilty of political ignorance. Whether defunding the police is a good idea is a matter for public debate. But the way the council has advocated this issue has been a failure. The first mistake was nine council members standing in front of a crowd announcing their intent to defund the police. One problem was that such a policy position possibly violated theMinnesota Open Meetings Law. Nine council members appeared to arrive at a final decision on a matter of public policy that was not decided upon in an official meeting. Some might claim at this rally was only speech making, but the fact that Minneapolis City Councilfast trackedtheir idea to get it on the ballot this November and that they continue to advocate this position suggests that by the time this rally occurred nine of them had already made up their minds on the issue, contrary to state law.Additionally, when these nine members spoke they did so without consulting the law. It seemed as if they were unaware of the City Chartermandating both that they have a police force and a minimum funding level for them.They also seemed unaware when they proposed an alternative to the police that state law governspeace office licensing and training, that there arestate laws regarding collective bargaining and labor unionsthat might apply, and that there was a recentMinnesota Supreme Court decisionthat might limit their ability. Had council members done their job competently and done their homework — which includes consulting their city attorney, whom they are already paying, they might have realized all this.The other major failure of Minneapolis City Council was its inability or dereliction in offering policy alternatives. If police are to be defunded what does that really mean There is merit to putting more money into social service and education programs, but what was their proposal What was and is their plan to address violent crime in the city Some point toCamden, New Jerseyas a successful example of defunding the police and crime going down, but was that a result of defunding the police, privatizing it, or a normal consequence of “what goes up (crime rate must go down” over time We do not know. A case study of one city proves little if anything and, if it does, what was it that worked in Camden Doing some policy research before major policy overhaul would be good and the failure to do so is another mistake.Yes, in some cases crises demand immediate action, but that is no excuse for acting without knowing what you are doing. George Floyd’s death was tragic and something needed to be done. But his killing did not come out of nowhere. Minneapolis’ history of police use of force and racial disparities in education, housing, and criminal justice have been known for years, yet this and previous City Councils failed to act. Dereliction of duty is as much a form of political ignorance as is simply doing something for the sake of looking like one is doing something, especially if there is no evidence it will work.There is nothing wrong with advocates who want a revolution and who want to change the world. They should not necessarily be expected to have the solutions. But there is a difference between being an advocate and a public official. For the latter, as the Beatles once sang: “You say you got a real solution. Well, you know, we’d all love to see the plan.”Public officials who advocate without a plan — or even worse, without consulting the evidence or gathering the information necessary to make good choices — are simply pandering for personal gain.David Schultzis aHamline Universityprofessor of political science.

minnpost_2020_198,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Thin places. Where Earth and heaven bump into each other, and the membrane is permeable. Thin places are strewn all over Ireland.You don’t expect to find them in Louisville or New York.As Thomas Merton recounts in “Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander,” in 1958 the veil was lifted for him at the corner of Fourth and Walnut in Louisville, the center of the shopping district – a far cry from his hermitage at nearby Gethsemani Abbey.“I was suddenly overwhelmed with the realization that I loved all these people, that they were mine and I theirs, that we could not be alien to one another even though we were total strangers.”He had been tempted by the thought that he, as a monk, was a special sort of person, not just different.“It was like waking from a dream of separateness, of spurious self-isolation in a special world. … There is no way of telling people that they are all walking around shining like the sun. Then it was as if I suddenly saw the secret beauty of their hearts, the depths of their hearts where neither sin nor desire nor self-knowledge can reach, the core of their reality, the person that each one is in God’s eyes.”He knows the challenge is formidable: “If only they could all see themselves as they really are. If only we could see each other that way all the time.”About half a century later the veil was similarly lifted in New York for David Brooks, like Merton a prolific writer and influential commentator on social and cultural life, but unlike Merton, not a Trappist monk.“I was surrounded as always by thousands of people, silent, sullen, trudging to work in long lines. Normally in those circumstances you feel like just another ant leading a meaningless life in a meaningless universe. Normally the routineness of life dulls your capacity for wonder.”“Normally …” – that’s how things are just before you stumble on a thin place.“But this time,” Brooks reports, “everything flipped, and I saw souls in all of them. It was like suddenly everything was illuminated, and I became aware of an infinite depth in each of these thousands of people. They were living souls. … Souls in each and every person, illuminating them from the inside … and with that came a feeling that I was connected by radio waves to all of them – some underlying soul of which we were all a piece.”“Suddenly,” “shining/illuminated,” “overwhelmed/flipped,” “depths/hearts/souls,” “could not be alien/connected by radio waves.” To convey what they knew when the veil was torn away, both Merton and Brooks quarry the thesaurus for unfamiliar words and images, or overused ones that can be rejuvenated.In a time when religious language has been weaponized, it’s refreshing to come across retrievals of ancient truths. Merton and Brooks demonstrate that mysticism is fundamentally realistic, the antithesis of sentimentalism.If Louisville and New York, why not MinneapolisWe have a thin place right here: the intersection of 38thand Chicago.Yes, thin places can also be where Earth and hell bump into each other, but after the murder of George Floyd, everything – or at least lots of things – flipped. All sorts of people everywhere started making good trouble.Black Lives Matter insists that we are not alien to one another even if total strangers. The names – names that must be said – that were painted on the street and inscribed on the gravestones in the nearby virtual cemetery are reminders of the core of their reality, the person that each one is.In the mural on the wall of Cup Foods, George Floyd is surrounded by a sunflower – illuminated from inside – and by the names. Merton wished: “If only we could see each other that way all the time.”At its thin place – 38thand Chicago – Minneapolis’s veil was lifted, and the whole world got in on the sight.

minnpost_2020_177,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Germany at the dawn of Nazism, the USA today. Similarities Differences Many today ask such questions, for valid reasons.Another similarity between Germany of the inter-war years and the United States today is about those who enable leaders with authoritarian leanings. Hitler attracted followers from among those who felt national humiliation after the defeat in World War I. Many had not gotten firm ground under their feet after returning from the trench warfare. After the Great Depression, he attracted scores with his protectionist economic policies. Many saw economic benefits, conveniently overlooking the dark side of the Nazis’ program.In today’s America, millions are on the losing side of an increasingly globalized economy and IT revolution, deprived of lines of work that had been a source of pride since the industrial revolution. They too feel humiliated and insecure, let down by political (and ridiculed by cultural elites. Others see 401(k benefits in a stock market that roars in delight at Trump’s deregulation program, no matter the long-term cost. Yet others do not dare to speak up against the new leader because they depend on his political base.There are differences between Germany in the 1930s and the USA today, of course. Trump has not declared as his goal the extermination of an entire people. His ideology is not as clear-cut as Hitler’s, and he does not have the same discipline to stick to a set of core principles. Further, German democracy of the 1920s was young and fragile, in contrast to America’s firmly settled democratic institutions today.Yet the dangers are real. Timothy Snyder, Yale historian of European totalitarianism spelled them out in his short book “About Tyranny.” Closer to home, almost a century ago, Sinclair Lewis anticipated the risks of fascism in his ironically entitled “It Can’t Happen Here.”I was born in Germany in 1951, barely six years after the horrors of Nazism, World War II and the Holocaust. I saw the scars of that history. I immigrated to the United States and moved to Minnesota thirty-one years ago. My American wife and I raised our daughters in St. Paul. I learned to appreciate America’s diversity, the academic institutions in which I work, and the thousands of students I taught at the University of Minnesota. Today, I am concerned.Joachim J.

But due to the pandemic, our celebrations are subdued, so let’s make the most of this unwelcome pause and take a moment to reflect.Now that Thanksgiving is over, we can look forward to the holidays and hang that fragrant wreath, string those twinkling lights and pursue wacky gifts. But due to the pandemic, our celebrations are subdued, so let’s make the most of this unwelcome pause and take a moment to reflect.For many, this is our favorite time of year. We love chestnuts roasting on an open fire and Jack Frost nipping at our nose.Oops. Wrong place.What’s nagging at me is watching the holiday season start earlier and earlier, on the continent for sure, but also here in the islands. So please don’t tell me that you begin decking the halls or shopping for presents before Thanksgiving or else you’ll get stink eye. And if you do, I invite you to ponder possible reasons for these unholy urges to file away for next year.In Seattle, one of my go-to radio stations started playing holiday music at the beginning of November. But who wants to hear “The First Noel” on Veterans Day or “Jingle Bells” before turkey and pumpkin pie? Not me.My way to protest the premature playing of Christmas songs was to boycott that oldies-but-goodies station until the new year. Take that, you jump-the-gunners! And I was equally annoyed when I went to buy Halloween treats and saw the Christmas decorations going up. I’m looking for candy corn, not candy canes.It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the manic activities leading up to these holidays are all about merchandising and shopping. That would explain why there’s no similar frenzy for the Fourth of July where we can hardly muster a parade.You’d think the country’s birthday would be cause for big-time celebration, but there is none, and perhaps it’s because no one shops for the Fourth. Even if you’re obsessed with the American flag, you only need one unless you’re flying them from every corner of your big truck.I’ve also observed patriots wearing red, white and blue outfits on that day, along with star-spangled earrings and striped baseball caps, but then, those go back into storage for another year. So July Fourth. Meh.With no reason for shopping rampages in the summer, we hear diabolical suggestions to start our Christmas spending in August and avoid the December rush. I fell for that once, making my list, checking it twice, and headed to the mall. When I got home, I congratulated myself to be almost done with holiday shopping and stored everything in a secret hiding place. But three months later, when it was time to wrap gifts, I had either changed my mind about that robe for my grandmother or I couldn’t find it.Christmas shopping in the summer was good for merchants but bad for me because I was forced to buy twice. And now I’m reading about attempts to move Black Friday, the beginning of the holiday shopping season, from the dayafterThanksgiving tobeforeTurkey Day.We’ve all watched nightmare scenes of unruly mobs fighting each other at 6 a.m. for a big screen TV. So let’s start that lunacy earlier, why don’t we. The thought of it drives me nuts.The holidays are a special part of the year, and perhaps there are those who wish they could last longer. But an early start to setting the stage and spending only dilutes the excitement and anticipation. How about we resist the urge to decorate like a maniac and shop till we drop?Then, when our sacred days arrive, we can be sane and solvent.Rochelle delaCruz was born in Hilo, graduated from Hilo High School, then left to go to college.

eugeneweekly_2020_16,"We ve got issues. Oregonians deserve peace officers who will serve and protect the public, not control the public. During the first 2020 special session of the Oregon Legislature, we took important steps towards that goal by changing policies that shield and protect bad police officers who have tainted the badge through predatory and unprofessional conduct that all too often targeted and abused Black people and other communities of color. We must improve peace officers’ training, reduce excessive and unnecessary uses of force, and hold officers who willfully violate their oath of office accountable for their actions. During the special session, we made progress in establishing a 21st-century policing philosophy. Now police cannot disperse CS gas (teargas to break up peaceful protests except in response to riots, and then only after giving the crowd warnings. Now we require public availability for records of police who have committed serious professional misconduct, and we require agencies hiring police to check those records. The law now requires police officers to report unprofessional conduct by their peers. Officers can no longer use chokeholds or other tactics that can easily result in death, except to protect their own lives. And we established a process so that police discipline will follow transparent guidelines, protecting both officers and the public. American popular culture focuses on policing as catching criminals, not as protecting the public. While this makes for a good entertainment, it does not reflect the public’s true priorities and realities. As military veterans, we have experienced how challenging it was for our servicemen and women overseas to move from a mindset of “get the bad guys” to “protect the people” as the primary mission. We must acknowledge, too, that not every police applicant who seems qualified should become a peace officer; we must screen for candidates who want to serve and protect. Looking to the future we have much work to do, because not every call to 911 requires police response. For example, a person experiencing an emotional or mental crisis would be better served by crisis intervention specialists like those of CAHOOTS as first responders. This will leave peace officers available to respond to calls they are trained for. At the same time, officers should be competent in using de-escalation techniques and be able to recognize unconscious biases. We all have them, but we can overcome them. Conversely, when an officer willfully violates the public trust or department policies, an independent civilian review and accountability system must ensure due process and transparency. Through these means, we endeavor to build trust and confidence between our peace officers and the communities they swore to protect and serve. Hopefully, the policy changes we made during the first 2020 special session will empower professional peace officers. Maybe it will also encourage those who see the profession as “us against them” to change their perspective or choose another profession. At the end of the day, we must provide our peace officers with the resources to be successful. And we must build community trust essential for peace and harmony. We are not there yet, but we are moving forward on the journey.Our work will continue in future legislative sessions. With your help, we will get there together. Rep.

The error has been corrected.Rural counties in Northern battleground states — which are overwhelmingly white and Republican — seemingly share little in common with diverse, Democratic big cities.Philadelphia, which is nearlytwo thirds non-white,gave its votes to Joe Biden by a63-point margin. Meanwhile, Donald Trump won rural, McKean County, Pennsylvania — which is 95% white — by 46 points.Yet something surprising unites Philadelphia and Pike County: very high rates of poverty and exceedingly low average incomes.Even pre-pandemic,Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate of any big city— 24% — and a median household income of $43,744.McKean County had a poverty rate of 16.8%and a median household income of $46,953. (In comparison, thenational poverty rate was 11%and the median household income was $60,293. In fact, there were more thantwo dozen counties in Pennsylvania with high poverty ratesand with median household rates below $50,000 per year; they, too are overwhelmingly white and rural and gave massive pluralities to Trump.Likewise, while Wayne County, Michigan (home of Detroit and Cuyahoga County, Ohio (home of Cleveland , have large non-white populations, high poverty rates, and a historic propensity to vote for the Democratic Party, both states have large numbers of high poverty, including in mostly white, rural counties that also overwhelmingly supported Trump.The reasons for the disparities between economic conditions and voting behaviors are clear: race and culture. After the Democratic Party embraced civil rights, reproductive choice, gun safety legislation, and LGBTQ rights, rural white voters — even very poor ones — swung heavily to the G.O.P.What, if anything, can help bridge this deep divide? The best hope is for President-Elect Biden and Congress to team up to implement a bold national strategy to boost economic opportunity and mobility in the most impoverished rural and urban counties.» READ MORE:Number of households with hungry children nearing 14 million, study findsIn 2019,58.8 million U.S. residents lived below 200% of the poverty line. That means that, even pre-pandemic, nearly one in five Americans lived in near poverty, pushing the great American middle class even closer to extinction.Even though the largest number of impoverished Americans are white, the racial disparities in U.S. family income are vast.In 2019, when the nation’s median family income was $68,703, it was $76,057 for non-Hispanic whites, $45,438 for Blacks, and $56,113 for Hispanics.As vast as these differences in income are, the differences in assets are a veritable Grand Canyon. According to the Federal Reserve, in 2016, the typical white family hadeight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family.Since the pandemic hit, all these problems have gotten far worse, and anestimated 50 million Americans, including18 million American children, becoming food insecure, unable to afford enough food.The good news is that — based on a poll that Hunger Free America just conducted among 800 low-income Americans nationwide — we know that urban, rural and suburban Americans (and people of all races actually agree on key points of a policy agenda for boosting economic opportunity and mobility. All strongly support: a minimum wage hike, a guarantee of living wage jobs, the increased use of modern technology to enable them to access government benefits and banking services more easily, and a boost in the SNAP (formerly called the Food Stamp program.» READ MORE:How America’s approach to poverty could change in a Biden administration, Congress willingRepublicans, Independents, and Democrats all agree by large margins that the nation must to do more to promote long-term upward mobility for themselves and others.

They understand the importance of moving from owing to owning.Policy makers should thus advance a broad “Aspiration Empowerment/Middle Class Wealth Generation Agenda,” which would give all families the opportunity to advance their dreams through learning, earning, and saving their way out of poverty.These economic and social policies won’t, in and of themselves, bridge racial and cultural divides build up over decades.

There are no longer classes to physically attend, therefore it is empty. I would still be on campus, because I work there, but without the chatter and presence of others, I always feel like I am walking into a dead zone.I came to realize just how important people are to this life, especially recently when I went to the civic Christmas “parade” in town. I honestly thought the spirit of Christmas was fading. It brought me so much joy to see our community unite and make this happen, even if it was done a little differently. I miss attending events, and I missed the feeling of seeing people come together.I hope we will be able to make a come back from COVID and be able to make connections with others once again, especially in college, but we still have to continue to follow safety protocols that include the wearing of masks, social distancing, etc.Although during these times it’s not something that is supported, I think we should start slowly getting back out there. If we continue to follow safety protocols, I think we can all make it work.COVID might have been able to divide us, but it shouldn’t be what keeps us apart.Tymika-Rose Miller-PajimolaHiloPGV and Kilauea1983: PGV begins operation, operates continuously until 2018.1983: Kilauea erupts (Pu‘u ‘O‘o vent , erupts continuously until 2018.2018: PGV ceases operations.2018: Kilauea eruption ceases.2020: PGV restarts operations.2020: Kilauea eruption resumes.David V.

Schools are re-convening and, in my part of Virginia, some schools are virtual and some are in person. I am just praying for all students and teachers to be safe.My staff and I continue to work remotely. I was back in Washington a couple of weeks ago to vote for emergency funding for the post office. Veterans need their prescriptions, seniors need their checks, farmers need their supplies, and letters and packages all need to move expeditiously and accurately. For those people who want to vote by mail, they need to know their ballot will arrive in a timely manner.Although we are working remotely, my staff is ready and available to help with concerns with federal agencies, issues such as passports, missing benefits, lost tax returns, etc. Please just fill out the form at mceachin.house.gov/services/help-with-a-federal-agency and you will hear back from us.This month we will be launching the second year of our Eco Heroes program, an environmental education program for elementary school students. We did this last spring and it was very successful. This program invites elementary students to perform simple, easily accomplishable tasks to show their commitment to the environment. At the conclusion, they receive a certificate and are invited to a reception with me. Many students and parents contacted us to say how much they learned and how much they enjoyed it. To sign up, email VA04.Projects@mail.house.gov and we will send registration information to you.Last month, I met with my Agricultural Advisory Task Force. I very much appreciate the opportunity to meet with local farmers. Agriculture is a significant driver of the economy in our district, and these farms are growing and raising foods for our dinner tables. I appreciate the opportunity to hear first-hand from them what is working and where I can be helpful.I am also virtually meeting with local officials in all of my 16 localities. I want to know, in dialogue with them, what struggles they are having with the pandemic, what resources they need and how I can be helpful. In Congress, we get a lot of information, but it is important for me to chat personally with each locality.Last month, with two of my colleagues, I introduced a bipartisan bill to protect patients from increased out-of-pocket prescription drug costs during COVID-19. We need to ensure access to life-saving drugs, especially during a pandemic. I am committed to ensuring all Virginians have access to affordable, quality health care, including prescriptions, and this is one step towards that goal.I have also joined a letter, with more than 80 of my colleagues, to ask the Department of Energy to reconsider their decision to gut methane pollution regulation. Methane has a direct influence on climate, but also indirectly impacts human health, crop yields and the quality and productivity of vegetation. It also helps in the development of ozone, which is one of the causes of climate change. We need to monitor and reduce the amount of methane gas being emitted, not roll back these regulations.I am eager to see us come together with the Senate on more COVID-19 relief. Families and businesses are struggling, and we need to provide assistance. I co-authored a letter with Congressman Cartwright of Pennsylvania urging Congressional leadership to reject proposals for comprehensive federal corporate immunity in any relief packages. Rather than providing corporations with blanket immunity, we need to adopt clear, science-based, enforceable federal health and safety standards.

For many, this year has been as complicated as learning a new dance. Did you start a new job or leave a job behind? That’s one step. Did you retire? There’s another step. Did you start a family? That’s practically a pirouette.If notable changes occurred in your personal or professional life, then you may want to review your finances before this year ends and 2021 begins. Proving that you have all of the right moves in 2020 might put you in a better position to tango with 2021.Even if your 2020 has been relatively uneventful, the end of the year is still a good time to get cracking and see where you can manage your overall personal finances.Keep in mind this article is for informational purposes only and is not a replacement for real-life advice. Please consult your tax, legal, and accounting professionals before modifying your tax strategy.Do you engage in tax-loss harvesting? That’s the practice of taking capital losses (selling securities worth less than what you first paid for them to manage capital gains. You might want to consider this move, but it should be made with the guidance of a financial professional you trust.In fact, you could even take it a step further. Consider that up to $3,000 of capital losses in excess of capital gains can be deducted from ordinary income, and any remaining capital losses above that amount can be carried forward to offset capital gains in upcoming years.Do you want to itemize deductions? You may just want to take the standard deduction for the 2020 tax year, which has risen to $12,400 for single filers and $24,800 for joint. If you do think it might be better for you to itemize, now would be a good time to get the receipts and assorted paperwork together.Could you ramp up your retirement plan contributions? Contribution to these retirement plans may lower your yearly gross income. If you lower your gross income enough, you might be able to qualify for other tax credits or breaks available to those under certain income limits.Are you thinking of gifting? How about donating to a qualified charity or non-profit organization before 2020 ends? Your gift may qualify as a tax deduction. For some gifts, you may be required to itemize deductions using Schedule A.While we’re on the topic of year-end moves, why not take a moment to review a portion of your estate strategy. Specifically, take a look at your beneficiary designations. If you haven’t reviewed them for some time, double-check to see that these assets are structured to go where you want them to go, should you pass away. Lastly, look at your will to see that it remains valid and up-to-date.Check on the amount you have withheld. If you discover that you have withheld too little on your W-4 form so far, you may need to adjust your withholding before the year ends.What can you do before ringing in the New Year? New Year’s Eve may put you in a dancing mood, eager to say goodbye to the old year and welcome 2021. Before you put on your dancing shoes, consider speaking with a financial or tax professional. Do it now, rather than in February or March. Little year-end moves might help you improve your short-term and long-term financial situation.Mark McGahee can be reached at 757-539-9465 or mmcgahee@isgva.com.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_53,"A longtime Camden resident and former mayoral candidate debates a member of Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform.As protesters nationwide continue pushing to revamp —or abolish— policing, onlookers have pointed to Camden as a potential model for change. Since the city disbanded its police force in 2013 in favor of a county-run force, violent crime besides homicides decreased — but the police budget shot up, and community members have expressed concerns at their lack of input in the process and outcomes.A longtime Camden resident and former mayoral candidate debates a member of Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform:Should reformers look to Camden for ideas?By Theo SpencerConsidering all the negative publicity Camden has endured in the recent past, it would be great for the city to be considered a model for police reform in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the national protests that have followed. As the narrative of Camden as a reform model has circulated national news, two of the most visible supporters in TV interviews are County Freeholder DirectorLouis Cappelli Jr.andformer Camden Police Chief Scott Thomson: two white nonresidents of a city that is overwhelminglyblack and Latino.The irony of Cappelli and Thomson as the spokespeople for Camden’s reform is one of many holes in a policing model rife with contradictions and inconsistencies. As a black man, I was riveted by the unrest that swept across the country. As a Camden resident, I know firsthand that the force here embodies none of the reforms people are yearning for in spirit or truth.Unfortunately, people’s need to find a bright spot in the way minorities are policed has led to a vast oversimplification of Camden’s reorganization. Truthfully, our switch in 2013 was the result of a policy shift designed to get cities to share services. Camden’s overreliance on state resources provided the leverage and cover politicians needed to make broad changes to police services. Predictably, the results for crime have been mixed. While violent crime as a whole went down, homicidesspiked in 2016andincreased again from 2018 to 2019.Recently, activists have started making appeals to defund the police to divert resources to social services. Conversely, the plan in Camden was to get more officers on the street. Coincidentally, at the time of transition, suburban departments were shedding officers due to cuts, so Camden was getting a lot of white officers to police a predominantly black and Latino city.More officers, coupled with an aggressive policing strategy that would facilitate as many as six officers on the scene at minor traffic stops in our streets, lead to the kinds of scenarios that activists are protesting against.Academics have cited civilian review as crucial in reducing police brutality. Many agree the reporting structure where officers report to a police chief who reports to a mayor is too weak. In Camden, the force reports diffusely to the mayor and City Council — yet not to civilians.No one with a basic understanding of the demands of activists right now would seriously look at Camden.In fact, when concerned residents tried toorganize a vote to block the changesto the department, the mayor and other local officials sued to prevent the vote.As it turns out, weaker civilian oversight has meant, for example, that the public has never gotten insight on thedeath of Nerreada Robles, a 17-year-old high school senior killed by a speeding police car last year. Following her death, City Council inexplicablyconsidered a measurethat would reduce the amount of time residents couldmaintain makeshift memorialslike one created for Robles.Since the reorganization of the police in 2013, Camden has been more lucky than good. Any one of the aforementioned circumstances in other places would have caused a riot elsewhere. Frankly, no one with a basic understanding of the demands of activists right now would seriously look at Camden. If America has finally become serious about the notion that black lives matter, it can’t start with a policing model where regard for black lives was an afterthought.Theo Spencer is a longtime Camden resident and currently works as a vice president of software development for a large U.S. bank. Spencer is also a former school board member and was a candidate for mayor in 2013 and 2017.​By ZaneKaleemIn the wake of angry nationwide demonstrations, Philadelphia’s response to peaceful protests exemplifies everything wrong with urban policing in 2020.Not only did we experience somechaosthis month, but after days of public frustration over police brutality, Philadelphia police were caught abusing their power on camera. Officerswere spottedpulling goggles off of seated protesters’ faces and spraying tear gas into their eyes, despite protesters’ obvious efforts to be civil in displaying their outrage over the killings ofAhmaud Arbery,Breonna Taylor,George Floyd, and many other black Americans by officers nationwide. Adding insult to injury in Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenneydid not express regretat the teargassing assault of peaceful protesters by his city’s police force.While unrest unfolded in Philadelphia, across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, police in Camden took a different approach to the trauma and emotion being expressed. Instead of fighting back, Camden policecame togetherwith protesters to march in solidarity with black American communities.How did this happen in one of the country’smost dangerouscities in 2012? A big part of it was community policing.Police are trained to shift their identity away from solving issues with their authority and guns and instead strive for a partnership with local residents.Community policingis a public health approach to public safety that tasks police and community members with collaborating to improve safety and quality of life in their neighborhoods. Camden officialsrevampedthe city’s police force in 2013, with the goal of shifting the culture of policing from one of dominance in the community to greater trust and stronger relationships with locals. Police are trained to shift their identity away from solving issues with their authority and guns and instead strive for a partnership with local residents.Community policing relies on key foundational principles that any city can adopt as a start toward change. These principles lie in procedural justice, which former Sheriff Sue Rahrin King County, Wash., simplified into what was coined theLEED framework: Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity. Under such a framework, officers are trained to listen first, be transparent by explaining why they approach a person or pull them over, and explain the legal process to people who encounter law enforcement, such as when stopped on the highway by an officer. LEED helps police become trusted and have honest discourse with community members.» READ MORE:Camden shouldn’t sanitize away the truth | OpinionNationally, organizations like Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform, of which I am a task force assistant director, havehighlightedthe negative health effects of police brutality and its role in systematizing racism, especially its contribution to poor health outcomes in black communities. TheAmerican Medical Associationshared that more encounters with police in minority communities are linked not just to elevated stress and anxiety among residents, but also to increased prevalence of high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma. Research also suggests thatracial discrimination leads to adverse mental healthoutcomes.Yet, as theAmerican Psychological Associationreports, the evidence suggests that when police “treat people with dignity, respect, fairness and neutrality, people are more likely to comply with their directives and accept any outcome, whether favorable or unfavorable.” What the APA describes matches the public health approach that Camden adopted via community policing.Switching to a community policing model for Philadelphia is a step in the right direction to end police violence. Advocates have yelled their battle cry for change.

It’s a commitment to listen to one another and seek mutual understanding, to be inclusive and to respect our beautiful state and one another.Our city of Clearbrook, unions, chambers of commerce, and more than 3,700 individuals across our state have already taken the pledge to stand up for values that I believe we can all agree on. The Respect Minnesota pledge reads:This pledge is more than just words. It’s a challenge and an opportunity to be better. To do better. To be responsible for ourselves and the world around us.Minnesotans are passionate about the history and beauty of our state and are invested in leaving a great state for future generations, and that includes those of us who are in favor of Line 3.This is a challenging time for all of us, especially here in our part of Minnesota.

minnpost_2020_84,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When our state Legislature adjourned from a special session nearly a month ago, lawmakers again left several important issues unresolved, from police reform to COVID-19 relief funds to energy use. Tragedy, suffering and outrage continues to unfold in our communities, maintaining the need for lawmakers to convene through additional special sessions and address top priorities. Among the many important pieces of legislation for state lawmakers to consider is the Energy Conservation and Optimization (ECO Act.The state’s energy efficiency program, formally referred to as the Conservation Improvement Program or “CIP,” has been a proven source of jobs and revenue since the 1980s — generating a $4 return for every $1 invested in the program. Still, there’s untapped potential. The ECO Act would unlock additional revenue and increase energy efficiency by strengthening utility energy savings goals and adding a greater range of technology and fuel choices. Energy efficiency is the most economical form of energy, costing on average less than one-fourth the cost of conventional power generation ($.02/kWh versus $.05 – .09/kWh . It is much more reasonable to save energy than to build new power plants.The fallout of COVID-19 has hit Minnesota’s energy efficiency industry particularly hard.E2reportsat least 8,000 energy efficiency jobs lost in the state since March. Each job lost represents not only the loss of income for a household but also the reduction of a workforce providing critical services, such as site visits for state energy efficiency programs, health and hygiene improvements to air ventilation systems, home weatherization, and upgrading heating and cooling systems.Upgrades to our state’s energy efficiency program were necessary even before the pandemic, but now the ECO Act may be critical to the vitality of Minnesota’s energy efficiency industry altogether. My company, Energy Management Solutions (EMS , provides energy conservation and management services for businesses to help strengthen their bottom line. We’ve been in business since 1994, yet we have never faced such challenges. This has meant lowering pay and working with 20% fewer employees since January. Productivity declined 35% at our Excelsior office after we started working from home.EMS works with many municipal electric utilities in Minnesota, and we know that they have also been under considerable strain while providing service throughout the pandemic as many of their business partners have had to close or reduce load. Through expanded offerings like fuel-switching, the ECO Act will enable electric utilities to work more efficiently and be able to better plan for energy efficiency goals. Electric utilities will no longer have a spending mandate; instead, they can focus on increasing energy savings and lowering costs for customers.And it’s not just the energy efficiency industry that stands to reap financial benefits from adopting the ECO Act. Saving energy saves money for all of us. Over the past 20 years, our state’s energy efficiency program has saved Minnesotans over $6 billion in net benefits. The ECO Act will build on this success and bring money-saving energy efficiency updates to more homes and businesses across Minnesota. The ECO Act also proposes to double the size of low-income energy efficiency programs, ensuring all Minnesota communities can access the benefits of these programs.If you support lower energy bills and new jobs for Minnesotans, I urge you to ask your state representatives and Paul Gazelka to include the ECO Act among their priorities for another special session. It’s a win-win-win for our state and local community.Gary A. Swanson, PE, is the president and owner of Energy Management Solutions in Excelsior."
suffolknewsherald_2020_60,"Published 9:30 pm Tuesday, June 30, 2020ByStaff ReportsA local young lady who has yet to reach double digits could teach us all a thing or two about compassion and helping others.Aubrey Freeman, 8, attends Mack Benn Jr. Elementary School and has been helping others practically her entire life. For her, it’s a simple concept, and it really should be simple for all of us. We could all take note.Last Saturday, she held a food drive to help feed the homeless. To facilitate social distancing, she set up a tent at the end of her driveway on South Sixth Street, and people pulled up to make donations. She offered them homemade cookies and banana pudding in return.Aubrey smashed her goal, collecting more than 300 food items as well as used clothes and money donations. Aubrey plans to deliver the donations to a local homeless shelter. This wasn’t even the first time she has helped her community, either; she had a lemonade stand last year.Aubrey described her efforts, and the motivation behind them, in simple words that were still wise beyond her years: “I want to help the homeless as much as I can. I just don’t want them to have to go around begging for food and stuff.”Aubrey’s words are a reminder to all of us that one of our main purposes on this earth should be to care about others and do what we can to improve the lives of others. So many people, much older than Aubrey is now, miss that lesson.In our sinful and broken world, many people harbor hate and hard-heartedness against others for any number of reasons and simply don’t want to help. That’s the worst end of the spectrum. Even on the better end, people who have the capacity for compassion oftentimes get so consumed with their daily lives that they are not doing much to improve others’ lives, either.But young Aubrey Freeman, age 8, has broken the mold and put her compassion into action at such a young age. Her family should be proud to have raised this extraordinary young lady, and we are proud to say she’s a member of the community we serve. We look forward to great things in the future from her.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_134,"Published 11:07 pm Friday, May 8, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Biff and Susan AndrewsIn a few days, the Suffolk City Council will have the opportunity to do something really smart and forward-thinking by using two state grants of $400,000 each to create, in coordination with the Department of Conservation and Recreation, a 338-acre waterfront access to the Blackwater River.About 200 acres would join the South Quay Nature Preserve, a 3,753-acre natural area dedicated to preserving the last stand of longleaf pines in Virginia. A new water access park of 138 acres would be created for Suffolk citizens.Currently Suffolk has no access to the Blackwater, which runs from Hopewell to the Nottoway River in North Carolina — over 100 miles of waterway. Isle of Wight has several, as does Southampton County.What a wonderful opportunity for Suffolk! For the rest of time, our children and grandchildren, and future generations can paddle through an ecologically rich river environment including heron rookeries, rare plants, fossilized sharks’ teeth, rare insects, reptiles and mammals. What a gift to future generations! Our granddaughter has already spent a day at South Quay collecting longleaf pine cones for seed to expand the existing stand of trees.The land to be purchased is a family farm of 338 acres. The Suffolk park would connect to South Quay Natural Preserve (with the possibility of future nature trails and would feature a parking area, restrooms, picnic area, boardwalk to a paddle launch, and trails along the river connecting fishing areas. Currently the southwest corner of Suffolk has few if any dedicated recreational facilities. Other parts of the city have recreation centers, motorboat launches, major play parks and more. This part of the city deserves some investment. This land won’t be available forever, and neither will the money designated for this purpose.There are also historical considerations. Not only is it important to preserve the rare flora and fauna for study for future generations, but this waterway was once an essential avenue of escape for slaves. As with Suffolk’s relationship in the historical importance of the underground railroad and the maroons within the Great Dismal Swamp, historic research and preservation needs to be done.Of course there are some naysayers, mainly in Isle of Wight and Southampton counties who don’t want Suffolk residents on “their” river. Naysayers from outside the city of Suffolk should have no impact on Suffolk city business.So, join with us in urging Suffolk City Council to use these state grants and enthusiastically support this important project.

I wanted to write in hopes of thanking whomever helped to create, approve and orchestrate this program. Of all the programs offering assistance during the pandemic, this program is making the biggest difference in my life right now.To make it an across-the-board program for all students takes the stigma out of having to ask for help, and for families who have suddenly taken huge income hits, that’s an amazing thing. The lines are long, and it indicates that the format of the program has been successful at removing any unnecessary shame families might have at accepting “free” food. And the food is impressively healthy, not junk. We know families who suffer financially tend to buy lower priced, less healthy food, but SPS is giving out healthy food choices that kids will happily eat — fresh produce, milk, whole grain snacks and breakfasts. That’s not cheap junk that I feel guilty feeding my kids, and I’m so impressed by this.Moreover, I’ve spoken with a couple bus drivers, and they’ve told me they’re happy to be working as much as before, so they aren’t worried sick over where their next paycheck is coming from. I don’t know if that holds true for all drivers, but to have an option to give work to as many as possible while serving your communities in such a vital way is a smart move.I’m sure there were lots of ways SPS could have used these funds, but the division elected to use them this way instead, and that should be applauded. I see other cities on the news with kids going hungry, and I realize that no matter what may happen with this pandemic, our SPS kids will not be among those that have no meals.

minnpost_2020_92,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Years ago, I performed a timid act of civil disobedience in my English composition course at Fullerton Community College. I arrived early, and on the empty blackboard at the front of the class, I drew a massive peace sign and then took my seat. The professor, an aging and taciturn man (probably my age now , looked quietly at the peace sign, erased it and wrote in large letters, “Generals die in bed.”Having appropriately edited my work, he began his lesson. I have never forgotten that message: It is easy to ask people to risk their lives if the person giving the orders does not face the same risk.Last week, at a meeting of our business resumption team, ourhuman resourcesstaff reminded everyone attending that we, as faculty members, are essential workers. I understood that to mean that we can be required to work in face-to-face settings unless we can demonstrate a medical reason for working remotely. So far, in our planning for the fall, my institution is seeking to maximize face-to-face instruction in a HyFlex model. Smartly, there is a focus on maintaining synchronous instruction, even for courses that will use a significant online component in their HyFlex delivery.Of course, every faculty member I know wants to return to face-to-face instruction. So, too, do our students. Even the best-designed online experience cannot compare to a well-designed and -executed face-to-face class. And so much of college takes place outside the classroom — informally between individual students, in clubs and organizations, volunteering in community, visiting with faculty members during office hours, conducting laboratory or archival research, and so much more.But because of COVID-19, fall 2020 will not be normal. How we proceed should not focus on what we want. It should focus on what is best for public health.Fall 2020 is different for one more reason. Students have signed up for most of their classes as if they will be taught live, face-to-face. That will allow for the best kind of online teaching, where, with technology, we can meet live, synchronously, in real time. Institutions should continue to guide students into classes with specific days and times during this pandemic so we can continue to run synchronous classes even if they ultimately must move online.The choices facingessential workerseverywhere have been excruciating for months now. Workers in meatpacking plants, nursing homes, hospitals, grocery stores, firehouses, police stations, gas stations, liquor stores and dozens of other occupations have faced the virus, and many have died. Now, beginning in the fall, educators will face this dilemma. We will be asked to work, day after day, in highly contagious spaces or quit our jobs without unemployment benefits.What concerns me is that many of those empowered to order us to face the COVID-19 virus are like the generals who die in bed. They will not be entering classrooms several times a week. They will be safe, physically distancing in offices or even working remotely from home — far from dangerous sites of infection that threaten faculty members, students, front-line staff members and families back home.Everybody knows thatcolleges and universities are high-risk locations for infection. Almost certainly, even a physically distanced classroom will become a petri dish of infection after 30 minutes of 25 people breathing the same air. After weeks of discussion, my campus recently announced that it will require people to wear masks in the fall. Both the system our institution belongs to and the Minnesota Department of Health refuse to require masks in college settings, kicking these decisions down to the campus level. Is face-to-face instruction without masks safe for students For institutionsNow we are opening up and seriously discussing returning to face-to-face instruction at all levels of education in the fall.What will be the consequences of opening institutionsafter a summer of backing off on physical distancingEssential workers in meatpacking plantsare forced to risk their lives on the killing floor or go without a paycheck. Meatpacking cannot be done online. I get that. A fair solution for meatpackers, or other workers whose jobs cannot be done remotely, would be to extend unemployment insurance to those workers unwilling to enter the workplace while increasing wages sufficiently to fill the plant with people willing to take the risk.Unlike cutting up meat, education can happen effectively online during this pandemic. Online is not perfect, and in some cases, it is significantly inferior (in certain laboratory, clinical or performance courses, for example . But until we really understand the public health consequences of opening up, we must be careful.Once the threat to public health is reasonable and the virus better understood, once high-quality PPE is abundant for health-care workers and stockpiled at colleges and universities, once institutions have the capacity and money to test, contact trace and isolate — in short, once the risk becomes manageable — reopening makes sense.Before those conditions are met, coercing or pressuring faculty members with their status as essential workers is troubling. And if I am feeling the pressure as a straight white male tenured full professor, imagine how faculty from marginalized populations, and/or those on contingent appointments feel.From a public health perspective, does it make sense to reopen K-12 and higher education at the same time, or is it unwise Does it make sense to reopen campuses completely, or only for certain labs and otherkey courses where face-to-face instruction is crucialHow would planning for the fall change if chancellors, presidents, provosts, chief financial officers, chief human resource officers, academic officers and others had to work regularly in the middle of a physically distanced classrooms for 12 to 20 hours a week Would their ideas about “recommending” or requiring masks change Would they still require a doctor’s note to allow instructors to work online Would they reconsider opening for the fallAll those years ago, my composition professor explained to me that war is terrible because generals die in bed.

suffolknewsherald_2020_122,"Published 9:45 pm Tuesday, May 19, 2020ByStaff ReportsWhen the Suffolk City Council takes up the budget for a final vote on May 20, it will be under a much different environment than when the budget was originally crafted and proposed.The city budget proposal came together on the same timetable it always does, calendar-wise. Meetings and hearings on different parts of it, including the capital improvements plan, happened on a predictable schedule.But the COVID-19 pandemic hit at exactly the right time to cause disruption to the process not only for Suffolk but also for municipalities across the state — and indeed, the state budget itself.While the timing may have caused issues, however, Suffolk citizens can be thankful it happened early enough in the process to allow City Council to recommend adjustments that will ease the burden on city residents.The original budget included a proposed increase in the water and sewer rates, which would have equaled about $4.15 extra per month for the average household. Suffolk’s utility ratepayers already fork over money at an incredibly high rate and could well have done without this increase at all.In addition, a refuse fee increase was proposed that would have hiked bills by $3.95 per month. This fee is billed along with real estate taxes, so it flies under the radar for most taxpayers but does add up to hundreds of dollars per year.Recognizing that the pandemic has caused economic strain for many of their constituents, City Council wisely took one look at the first proposal of the budget, on April 15, and asked City Manager Patrick Roberts to come back with a proposal to defer those increases.He did so, announcing earlier this month that water and sewer rate increases could be deferred for 90 days, and the refuse fee increase could be deferred for six months. These delays will bring no reduction in service but will be a small help to local residents.When the budget was originally proposed April 15, Virginia had been under the strain of the pandemic for more than a month. Businesses across the state had been forced to temporarily close, and that left many of them with no choice but to close permanently. Many workers have lost their jobs, temporarily or permanently, because of the business closures. Those who were fortunate enough to have savings and investments when the pandemic started have likely seen their balances dwindle in the ensuing crisis. We’re now another month in, and though the state has begun the slow process of reopening, hope that the pandemic would be a distant memory by summer seems to be fading.City Council did the right thing urging more austerity in the budget, alongside what was already assumed right from the start. They should vote this Wednesday to approve the proposal and continue to seek ways the city can provide real, meaningful assistance to its citizens.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Last year, the donations also included paper goods to help families.And for the past 41 years, Johnson has been involved with the food ministry at Balm of Gilead Missionary Baptist Church, which also helps the community get access to food that people need.In these difficult times, where many people are struggling to feed their families because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, what a blessing it is to have people like Ruth Johnson in Suffolk.

philinquirer_2020_12,"That is the best way to ensure our schools can continue providing meals to our neediest students, and that no child goes hungry.Amid all the debate around the coronavirus, there has been at least one area that has received fairly widespread and bipartisan support: the need to ensure our nation’s neediest children do not go hungry as a result of the ongoing pandemic. Unfortunately, due tothe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA and Congress not extending needed regulatory relief to schools, we now face the possibility that tens of thousands of American children could start going without meals in a matter of weeks.Since its establishment in 1946, the federal National School Lunch Program (NSLP has been reimbursing schools for providing needy children with free or reduced-price meals. In recent years, the program has supported nearly 100,000 K-12 schools and close to 30 million children. For many of these children, the meals they are provided at school may be the only healthy and regular meals they receive.Under the NSLP, there are strict regulations around dietary guidelines and where and how food is provided. Schools are required to carefully track distribution to ensure only eligible children receive meals. As schools began closing in mid-March due to the pandemic, the USDA, with the support of Congress, moved quickly to issuewaiversto these regulations to allow schools to provide meals through the agency’s more flexible summer programs.» READ MORE:Number of households with hungry children nearing 14 million, study findsThese waivers have been critical to ensuring that schools can continue to get food to our most vulnerable kids. For example, under the summer program rules, schools have been able to provide no-contact, curbside food distribution to any child under the age of 18, without requiring verification that a child attends the school where the food is being distributed. This has enabled parents with limited means of transportation to visit the closest food distribution site to their home and pick up meals for multiple children, instead of visiting sites across town, depending on where their children are enrolled.Despite the resounding success of these waivers, not all of them have been extended for the 2020-21 school year. If that extension doesn’t come through soon, we may see many children go hungry this fall. At a time when we still face record unemployment, schools are anticipating a significant increase in the number of children in need of this food assistance.While some schools will resume in-person learning, where normal food distribution could theoretically take place, many will not. Other schools will start out in person, but change their status at some point in the fall in response to outbreaks or exposures. Among the more than 400 K-12 school districts across the country where food service is provided by Aramark, where I work, 70% are planning to conduct fully — or partially — remote learning for at least the first six to eight weeks of the fall semester.Returning to the strict regulations of the NSLP right now is creating a logistical nightmare for schools, parents, and children. For schools conducting remote learning and needing to continue with curbside food distribution, school staff will need to maintain a roster of eligible children, determine whether each child is eligible for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, and have the curbside capability to take payments from children when required. In addition to the logistical complexity, these transactions significantly increase the risk of COVID exposure for everyone involved.Even for schools that fully reopen, NSLP regulations will make it difficult for meal providers to offer staggered breakfasts and lunches to help maintain social distancing among students. So the rules will actually discourage full reopening and possibly even increase the chance of a virus outbreak that would force the school to shut its doors once again.» READ MORE:Hunger expected to explode here, throughout America, because of COVID-19We are already starting to see the impact of a too-soon return to NSLP regulations. In a school district near Austin, Texas, which Aramark serves, 54% of the population qualifies for free or reduced-price meals. On a typical school day before the pandemic, we were providing 26,000 meals there. Under the flexible summer program rules in effect since the pandemic started, we were feeding about 8,800 children. With NSLP regulations now back in place, we are only providing meals to about 1,100 children each day, representing less than 10% of the students qualified for free or reduced-price meals. With the need for assistance in Texas steady or on the rise, this can only mean that many children are going hungry.» HELP US REPORT:Are you a health-care worker, medical provider, government worker, patient, frontline worker, or other expert? We want to hear from you.There is a simple solution. The USDA, with thebipartisansupportof Congress, should move forward with extending the NSLP waivers that have worked so well over recent months. That is the best way to ensure our schools can continue providing meals to our neediest students, and that no child goes hungry.Barbara Flanagan is the president ofAramark’s K-12 education division."

In Philadelphia it manifests in extreme urban heat, a multi-faceted threat with negative impacts on our physical, mental and social health. Heat waves are the deadliest form of weather, according todata from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Extreme heat creates heightened risks for those with asthma, hypertension, and heart and pulmonary disease.Research also showsthat extreme heat in school settings impacts test performance and a student’s long-term learning.Heat hits some Philadelphia neighborhoods especially hard. One important tool for those residents is having space to express their lived experiences of extreme heat through public art—while developing local solutions.The Heat Response projectconnects local artists and community leaders with residents of three neighborhoods to tackle the problem.While the neighborhoods where the Heat Response Project is focused—Southeast Philadelphia, Grays Ferry, and Fairhill— all have extreme heat in common, the impacts differ. The Heat Response project has built neighborhood teams, each joining a local artist and community members to answer the questions:Why should we care about urban heat and what can we do about it?» READ MORE:Climate change makes some Philadelphia neighborhoods extra steamy. The city has a plan.It starts with understanding how this became a problem. Due to redlining practices and generations of disinvestment, low-income communities and communities of color experience hotter temperatures than surrounding neighborhoods. These hotter temperatures are created by an urban heat island effect, when lack of green space, an abundance of blacktop surfaces that absorb heat, and dense housing combine to elevate temperatures. On a day that is 82 degrees in Love Park, temperatures soar elsewhere — Southeast Philadelphia feels 87.5 degrees, Grays Ferry hits 89.5 degrees, and Fairhill tops the three at 90 degrees.Councilwoman Katherine Gilmore Richardson, who grew up in North Philadelphia, a neighborhood with few to no trees or green space, said it best at akickoff event introducing Heat Response to the citythis fall: “In Philadelphia, your ZIP code determines your life expectancy.”In Southeast, residents participating in community workshops said that even having lived in other places we might imagine as hotter than Philadelphia, such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, and the Philippines, the heat they experience now is different. It feels much hotter living in a neighborhood locked in asphalt. There are fewer opportunities for relief. A community garden that provides shade with a grass patch for laying down a blanket on hot days was cited as a welcome refuge from summer heat. For others, small home gardens with plants and a pergola could make a summer day outdoors “bearable.”Action on the growing climate emergency — and extreme urban heat specifically — must be a local priority, and not limited to summer months. Extreme urban heat is becoming inescapable for so many communities, and its health and economic consequences are harming our most vulnerable neighbors. We have to act now.» READ MORE:Creating a more equal America demands more urban green spaces | OpinionFirst, we must invest time and resources to identify challenges from within communities. We are already hearing a common thread in postcard responses to our project, in poetry and in artwork: Green space is a refuge, but there’s not enough of it where people need it most.Second, we must bring these concerns and challenges to legislators, who have policy and power at their disposal. Urban planning, climate mitigation, housing, and stormwater infrastructure are just some of the sectors that affect the way residents experience and live with the extreme heat impacts of climate change and for which city officials are responsible.Third, we must invest in sustainable solutions. Last summer, extreme heat became even more of a challenge when the public resources that provide heat relief, including pools, community cooling centers, and libraries, shuttered to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The resulting struggles made all the more clear how badly we need more local green space as relief from the heat.Within our cities and communities, what we should do to mitigate extreme heat will vary, but the starting point is the same: listening to residents about local solutions that will work for them. We are excited to continue these artistic expressions and solutions in Philadelphia the coming year.Owen Franklin is the Pennsylvania State Director for The Trust for Public Land.

A flood is an overflowing of a large amount of water especially over what is normally dry land. What we thought was going to be a simple drive to see my mom turned into us experiencing a flash flood warning. We knew it was going to be a difficult ride as the wind was blowing and the clouds were dark as coal. We completed a brief visit and then we headed back. Flash flood warning in effect.As we started to drive, the wind was picking up, and the rain was falling. We could hardly see the road in front of us. My husband asked for everyone in the car to be quiet as he navigated through the backroads, trying to make it to the main road. There were times that we thought we were going to get stuck in the dark, brown flooded water. We could not turn around as the roads behind us were flooded completely. We made it to the main road. The regular conversations began to surface in the car. Looking at the radar, we realized that we were in the middle of a large storm. We continued to move forward. We asked our children if they were afraid, but they said, “no.” They only knew that they were safe because they trusted us with the process to get them home safely. They knew no danger, but we as parents saw the danger. A spiritual shift.We made it home safely, but my husband was still shaky from the drive. We then knew that it was not just a physical storm that we were driving through at the time, but it was a spiritual storm. God was trying to get our attention. The storm was over us; God was pushing us through it. We found out that there were confirmed tornadoes in the areas that we drove through. It was at that time that I began to examine the areas within my life, not realizing that there were many areas under warning that needed attention. We must begin to develop a plan in God to address those flooded areas within our lives. We do not want to drown in the process of trying to get to the “main road.” The main road is the Word of God.Sometimes, we can feel those flooded areas in our lives and in our spirit. Sometimes, God will take us through the flooded waters so that we can appreciate what we have on the dry land. At that time, my husband’s position was to lead, and his task was to make sure that we got home safely. The reason why our children did not know that they were in danger is because they do not always see what we see. There are times that we do not always see what God sees. God can guide us all through the flooded waters so that we can see the sacrifice. There were times that my husband had to push the pedal harder. There are times in life that we will have to push the pedal harder to get through the water. Even when you get through the water, you must stay alert.We forget that situations will surface in our lives that cause us to experience a flash flood warning. You will experience the downpours and tornadoes of life, but you will make it home if you trust the process. One of the things that I noticed along the journey was the hazard lights from the cars in front of us. The lights were in unity as guides so that we could see what was in front of us “physically.” The cars in front of us showed us the way. God will send people your way to show you the way when you cannot see. You must be willing to accept the downpour. Flash flood alert over. Get out of the car and begin building on your new land.

suffolknewsherald_2020_21,"Published 5:00 pm Tuesday, August 11, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Congressman A. Donald McEachinAlthough August is typically a recess month for Congress, my staff and I have been and continue to be busy. My staff, following the recommendations of Gov. Ralph Northam, is still working remotely. Though the district offices are closed, assistance is just an email or phone call away. If you are having an issue with a federal agency, go to my website, mceachin.house.gov, and fill out the appropriate form. I assure you someone in my office will get back to you expeditiously, prepared to learn about your problem and work with you and the appropriate agency to address it.If you want to register your opinion about an issue or invite me or a member of my staff to a virtual or live event, please go the website, mceachin.house.gov, fill out the appropriate form and you will hear from us..Recently, I have heard from many constituents that they are having difficulties receiving unemployment checks from the Virginia Employment Commission. While this is a state agency, not a federal one, I have written a letter to the VEC expressing my serious concerns and reiterating the importance of people getting their much-needed unemployment check. I hope this will help to break the logjam and that Virginians will receive the funds owed to them.This has been a busy month in the House of Representatives as we waited (and waited for the Senate to take up the much-needed and overdue latest COVID relief bill. However, among the work we did accomplish, I am particularly pleased that the Great American Outdoors Act passed, and I want to thank my Senate colleague, Mark Warner, for his work and dedication to this bill.This legislation will fund $9.5 billion over five years to help pay for the National Park Service’s extensive backlog for maintenance from dilapidated facilities to broken sinks and toilets. Here in Virginia, we have more than $1 billion worth in deferred maintenance at our national parks. Particularly during this pandemic, many Americans have visited our national parks for an outdoors vacation. The passage of this legislation will mean we can begin to fix those issues to make our national parks an even better family getaway. Moreover, with this funding, we can create good-paying outdoors jobs so those in need of work can be employed to make repairs in national parks.The bill will also provide permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports natural areas and recreation activities at $900 million per year. Here in the United States, we have unique public lands we must protect and preserve for our children and grandchildren. The Land and Water Conservation Fund ensures that the federal government can continue to purchase open spaces that the public can then enjoy. Land, adjacent to a national park, with beautiful vistas or special land features can be purchased to be added to the park that belongs to all Americans. Permanent resources for the Land and Water Conservation Fund ensures American’s ability to augment and protect our unique places. I was pleased to see the bipartisan support for this significant conservation legislation.I was proud last month to vote in favor of the Child Care is Essential Act, which will provide $50 billion in grants to childcare providers to ensure they are able to keep functioning securely so parents can work and know their child is safe. Reliable, safe and available childcare is essential for working parents. However, during this pandemic, childcare providers have been faced with decreased revenue and, at the same time, increased expenses to implement necessary safety measures such as distancing, masks and more cleanings. Almost three-quarters of providers have had to layoff, furlough or reduce the hours for staff. At the same time, 13% of working parents have had to cut their work hours or leave their jobs because of lack of childcare. I will continue to look out for and support measures to help folks get back to work safely and take care of their families.Congressman Donald McEachin represents Virginia’s 4thCongressional District.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_233,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Even as Americans are experiencing something different in this election year, there remains strong support among voters for confident, knowledgeable presidents who exude clearheaded leadership as our nation’s president.It reminded me of a story involving a good presidential candidate who spoke the truth, got into trouble for it and self-destructed long before the election.I was a student at Hamline University in the late ’60s, serving as chair of the popular Hamline Republican Club (we outnumbered the College Democrats manyfold . One of things we did was help candidates, including the surprise election of South St. Paul attorney Harold LeVander as governor in 1966 and a young Arne Carlson’s 1967 campaign for Minneapolis mayor.We began to contemplate engagement in some manner in the 1968 presidential campaign.Of course, students did not automatically act as a block and we shared differing opinions; an all-campus, nonpartisan political convention of more than 1,000 Hamline students in 1968 did choose New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller as its favorite over Minnesota’s own Vice President Hubert Humphrey.Monitoring campaigns was mostly through newspapers and nighty network news programs in those days. It was long before students had access to the more extensive news and social media outlets of recent years.President Lyndon Johnson, who took office in 1963 upon the death of John Kennedy, had ramped up the war in Vietnam as his major foreign policy accomplishment. Concerning Vietnam, by 1967 things were uneasy on campuses throughout the country, including Hamline. Minnesota’s other U.S. senator, Gene McCarthy, decided to bring the issue of ending the Vietnam conflict — it was never an official war — into the 1968 campaign.I liked the fact that the elder Romney was governor of Michigan (1963-69 and had substantial public support throughout the country; we invited him to speak on campus, but were not successful. A devout Mormon and former CEO of American Motors, Romney had popularized the Rambler and described the “big three” automakers as producing “gas-guzzling dinosaurs.”Romney decided to go directly to Vietnam himself and examine the situation. Upon his return, he had originally said he was confident that the military was doing the right things and that U.S. success was a foregone conclusion. Not long thereafter and after careful study, Romney began to share his doubts about Vietnam, calling it “a tragic mistake.”CBS’ Roger Mudd quizzed Romney on the about-face in 1967. Romney said he had been “brainwashed” by government officials into thinking earlier that Johnson’s policies might work. Almost immediately, Romney’s character, loyalty, and intelligence were called into question by his opponents and the news media. Republican governors, long considered political allies, were quoted as saying Romney was “naïve.” It was not so much that people doubted that Romney had been lobbied vigorously when in Vietnam but that he had been unable to resist the effects of having his brain washed.The Detroit News editorially argued that the state’s governor “was either incapable of maintaining a stand on so vital an issue” or, less charitably, “that he trims his Vietnam positions to accommodate prevailing political winds.”Romney dropped out of the race on the eve of the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire Primary, leaving the Republican field wide open for Vice President Richard Nixon, the eventual winner.Costly political gaffes have plagued candidates since the beginning of America’s unique two-party system.During my more active days of partisan politics, there were several examples following Romney’s “brainwashed” 1968 situation: Edmund Muskie (“for crying out loud” and George McGovern (“1,000% behind Eagleton” in 1972, Gerald Ford (no Soviet domination of Easter Europe in 1976, Jimmy Carter (Playboy “lust in my heart” quote in 1976, Ronald Reagan (“the evil empire” in 1984, Gary Hart (“catch me if you can” in 1984.But few have seen a more unusual presidential campaign than our current Donald Trump/Joe Biden contest, to be sure. It is not just the language but the issues — BLM, COVID-19 — that are driving the 2020 rhetoric.Chuck Slocum, founder and president of The Williston Group, can be reached atChuck@WillistonGroup.ComHe recommends a book, “Observing Our Politicians Stumble,” written by Richfield native Stephen Frantzich, a political scientist who has spent his career at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland."
philinquirer_2020_45,"We need to adopt the same proven model used to tackle the global HIV/AIDS epidemic: self-testing.Right now, we stand on a precipice. Global disruption like the world is currently experiencing presents an opportunity for each one of us to stand up and be on the right side of history. We are grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for public health. At the same time, protesters have taken to the streets to speak out against decades of systemic, pervasive racism.These two issues are deeply connected. It has been well understood that advanced age and preexisting conditions increase the chance of becoming very sick with COVID-19. Initiatives such as theCOVID Racial Data Trackeropened a window into the effect of COVID on communities of color. However, it wasn’t until the CDC’s more comprehensive morbidity and mortality data were made public (after a lawsuit that it became frighteningly clear that vulnerable communities were bearing an undue burden.Again.Looking at 640,000 infections detected in almost 1,000 communities, the data showed that Latinos and Black people werethree times as likely to become infectedwith COVID-19 — and nearly twice as likely to die from COVID-19 — as white people.Despite months of learnings to draw from, testing problems in today’s rapidly expanding list of hot spots reflect a spectrum of failures:Residents ofpredominantly Latino south Phoenixwaited for hours in scorching heat totake a COVID-19 testin June. Despite spiking infections,Sacramento Countyannounced they were closing five coronavirus testing sites in underserved communities due to a growing shortage of testing materials. And Pennsylvania, like many states,continues to struggle with testingand has faced a shortage of supplies and delayed lab test results. Resources for Black communities were falling so short in Philadelphia thatAla Stanford filled a van with tests and administered them — for free— to people lacking access to medical care.COVID-19 is yet another systematic disenfranchisement of Americans of color. This is why we must democratize COVID-19 testing and ensure that communities of color have equal access to health care and knowledge about their health status.Fortunately, we are closer than you might think. One strategy is to adopt the same proven model used to tackle the global HIV/AIDS epidemic: self-testing.» READ MORE:Pa. wants to expand coronavirus testing but faces a shortage of supplies and lab result delays, Wolf and Levine sayRapid self-testing can move the needle by providing tests — and results — to anybody, anywhere, anytime. Self-tests give people a result within minutes, with no instrumentation needed to interpret the results, and no need to transport samples to a lab for processing. Home pregnancy tests may be the best-known example, but self-tests are available for HIV, too.In sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion ofpeople with HIV who knew their statushad almost doubled to 81% between 2015 and 2018, according to a report by the STAR Initiative, UNITAID, and the World Health Organization.The reason? A combination of HIV self-tests that could easily be administered in-home, and the concerted efforts of governments and civil society. Outreach workers literally put kits in their backpacks and distributed them door to door.Rapid self-testing like this could help prevent the spread of COVID amongst our most vulnerable communities in the United States and around the world. Imagine the impact of a test that would not require a trip to a testing site or lab.This vision is already on the way to becoming a reality. For example, scientists at my company are racing to bring a rapid self-test that would confirm active infection by detecting viral proteins (antigens to market by year-end. To date, there are no COVID-19 tests for active infection like this one, which would provide a result at the collection point with no need for an instrument to interpret the results.» READ MORE:Schools can’t reopen safely without better COVID testing for kids, say these Philly pediatricians l Expert OpinionCollaboration between the public, private, and nonprofit sectors can help bring tests like these to scale.

The report goes on to say this is the “best investment America could make in averting an even more tragic and pending disaster.”All people, regardless of zip code, skin color, or primary language, deserve access to accurate diagnostics, effective treatment, and preventive vaccines.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_72,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Some corporations demonstrate strong concerns for the environment. And some swing with the political winds. Put General Motors in the latter category.Some corporations demonstrate strong concerns for the environment. And some swing with the political winds. Put General Motors in the latter category.General Motors announced this week that it was dropping support of the Trump administration’s effort to strip California of its right to set vehicle fuel standards. And it said it would join President-elect Joe Biden’s push for auto electrification to reduce climate warming emissions.It was the right move. But pardon us if we’re not ready to trust the sincerity of GM CEO Mary Barra’s sudden, opportunistic reversal. It will take more than that to convince us that the nation’s largest auto manufacturer is as committed as Ford, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo to tougher fuel standards.This is the company American taxpayers saved from collapse with $9 billion in aid and tens of billions of dollars of loans after the Great Recession. In exchange, the company signed on to President Barack Obama’s new fuel-efficiency standards.But as soon as President Donald Trump took office GM joined the new administration’s efforts to roll back those standards. Barra was a leader in that effort, meeting with Trump during his first weeks in office to encourage the reversal.So Barra’s letter on Tuesday to environmental groups announcing it was flipping its position again rings hallow. Talk is cheap. Until the company demonstrates through its actions a solid commitment to tough fuel standards and a rapid switch to electric vehicles, Biden, environmentalists and Californians should be leery.There are two issues at stake here.First, in the spring Trump handed the oil and gas industry a big windfall by rolling back the Obama-era fuel regulations. The Obama rules required automakers to increase fuel efficiency across their fleets by 5% annually, reaching an average of 54 miles per gallon by 2025. The Trump rules rolled that back to 1.5% annually, with a target of 40 miles per gallon by 2026.The move would lead to release of nearly a billion more tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide and the consumption of about 80 billion more gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of the vehicles built during the terms of the rule, The New York Times reported.Second, the Trump administration issued rules stripping California and other states of their ability to impose tougher standards. California had a federal waiver under the 1970 Clean Air Act allowing it to set tougher standards than those of the nation. Twelve other states and Washington, D.C., had federal authority to follow California’s lead.When California and other states sued to block the rules, the auto industry split, with GM, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler siding with Trump. Meanwhile, five other companies — Ford, Honda, BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo — cut a deal with California, agreeing to standards that are much closer to those set by the Obama administration than those in the Trump mandate. For now, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler remain in Trump’s camp, while GM said Tuesday it would no longer defend in court the Trump rules undermining California authority. But Barra stopped short of embracing the agreement the state struck with the five other manufacturers.Until she walks her talk, it will be hard to believe her company is seriously committed to saving the planet.— The Mercury NewsA new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_162,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In an age of pandemic, we’ve stopped talking much about another health crisis: opioid addition. Not only has it not gone away, it’s getting worse. Recent state data suggest there was a30% increasein opioid overdoses in the first six months of 2020. One consequence is the growth in the number of babies with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, or NOWS, a serious but treatable condition of newborns exposed to opioids before birth.In order to give these newborns a chance at a stronger start in life, Minnesota should change a well-intentioned but counterproductive law requiring health care providers to notify the state immediately if apregnant patientis suspected of using non-prescribed substances, including opioids.While this won’t singlehandedly solve the problem, it would be a step in the right direction. Another important part of the solution would be ensuring input from stakeholders throughout Minnesota, including individuals in recovery who already are a parent, or pregnant.Health care professionals say such mandatory reporting often discouragespregnant peoplefrom seeking prenatal care. That constitutes a missed opportunity to get them into treatment that would help them and their babies.The rate of NOWS cases reported in Minnesotadoubledbetween 2018 and 2019, reaching 102.5 per 10,000 births. Infants with NOWS may have poor feeding, seizures, and/or increased risk of birth complications such as preterm delivery. It is an especially big problem in American Indian communities, whereNOWSiseight timesmore common than the white population in Minnesota.In 2018, theaverage hospital stay costfor each Minnesota infant affected by NOWS was $7,700,or a total of about $5 million. Nationally, about80 percentof NOWS birthsare covered by Medicaid.Over a 10-year period, NOWS costs the United States about$2 billionmore in Medicaid expenditures.In Minnesota last year,667infants developed NOWS. Many of those infants were born to mothers not engaged in addiction treatment or prenatal care prior to delivery.Opioid use disorder is a chronic medical illness with known effective treatments. “The longstanding belief that a medical condition, opioid use disorder, is actually a moral failing has created barriers for seeking treatment, especially in pregnancy,” says Dr. Cresta Jones, a Minneapolis physician who specializes in the care ofpregnant patientsexperiencing addiction.In addition, a lack of culturally appropriate addiction treatment contributes to high rates of untreated opioid use and further reinforces racial inequities in addiction care.Structural racismis a root cause ofracial inequitiesin maternal and infant health outcomes inMinnesota, increasing adverse outcomes for American Indian and Black patients.Pregnant peoplewho might otherwise want help with their addiction may be fearful of being reported and having their children removed from their care and therefore entirely avoidprenatal care. Statistics appear to bear this out: Women who give birth to infants who develop NOWS are12 timesas likely to not receive prenatal care. Infants of moms who do not receive prenatal care arefive timesmore likely to die before their first birthday.Dr. Jones adds, “When I am required to report a patient before I can get her into an appropriate addiction treatment program, it isn’t actually helping her get the resources and education that would help her start to heal and be able to parent. If I am allowed to gain her trust and assess the tools she has for parenting before deciding if she needs a referral to child welfare services, we will see better outcomes for Minnesota’s babies and families. “We know that proper care can improve health outcomes. So what can we do about thisOne step Minnesota can take is to passHF 1892, which modifies prenatal substance use reporting requirements (the file number may change in the next session . Specifically, health professionals or social service professionals would no longer be mandated to immediately report substance use. Rather, they can develop a trusting relationship with a woman, while helping create anenvironment in which patients feel more comfortable asking for help. This bill does not prevent a provider from reporting or referring patients for additional services if their safety is in question.More than20 health professional organizationshave issued statements supporting non-punitive approaches for substance use in pregnancy. Currently,70% of statesdo not have mandatory reporting laws.State law in effect now was likely implemented to helppregnant peopleand protect the fetus. However, this and similar policies have actually had the opposite effect, deterring patients from seeking care and posing even greater health risks. Changing the statute will not prevent clinicians concerned about the mother and/or child’s health from notifying child welfare services. It will instead allow providers time to develop a partnership in care with patients while helping them access treatment for a chronic medical condition.Alexandria Kristensen-Cabrerais an M.D.-P.hD. student at the University of Minnesota."
minnpost_2020_52,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I overheard them as they left the store: “Requiring a mask is an attack on my freedom.” It was fairly early in the pandemic, and it was my first curbside pick-up at the lumberyard. They walked by my car as I negotiated this new way of shopping. I was wearing a mask.Immediately, I thought of my partner. For nearly 20 years, she was the faculty adviser for a campus Amnesty International student group. Amnesty International (AI is the human rights organization supporting prisoners of conscience: people imprisoned for exercising their fundamental human rights.There are many ways to think about freedom, but an international human rights perspective grounds your thoughts in the realities of freedoms denied. Members of Amnesty engage in the rituals of human rights work with the humblest of weapons: pen, paper, and emails.Over many decades, with many friends, we have written thousands of letters and emails to different governments requesting respect for basic human rights. So many people in so many nations are denied fundamental freedoms and access to justice.The Pledge of Allegiance has had its controversies in recent years, but “freedom and justice for all” is an important phrase to repeat to yourself. It should be the world’s mantra. But it is challenging to mix freedom and justice in a way that works for all citizens. That is a dilemma for democracy — too much freedom eats away at justice, and too much justice eats away at freedom.When Europe was divided by a wall, we saw incredible levels of freedom on one side of the wall and an eerie sense of justice on the other. It has not been easy for Europe since that wall came down, and there are now worrisome trends from England to Poland.Democratic processes that endure are hard to create and maintain. Making them work requires constant work and involvement. Democracies do not tolerate idleness or short attention spans. The hard work of successfully blending freedom and justice greets a democracy every morning. That is why history provides so few examples. Historically, some of the cultures that developed and celebrated democratic principles were slave-based economies. Think Thomas Jefferson.It appears this century provides a new context for exploring these problematic issues. What does it mean to be free How do we pursue just resolutions in a messy world What is democracy in the 21st centuryDemocratic processes are dependent upon this elusive blend of freedom and justice. When democratic processes emerge, they fumble and swing from one extreme to another — freedom impinging on justice, justice impinging on freedom. In a sense, every democracy carries the seeds of an ongoing civil war.Separating a democracy into two camps is a formula for disaster. Imagine, for a moment, that you are making a quick, simple salad dressing. You pour a good measure of vinegar into a jar. Then you add a slightly larger amount of oil. Left alone, they separate into two distinct layers. To become a successful dressing for your salad, you must put a lid on the jar and shake vigorously to blend the two.Democracy is the vigorous shaking that prevents these two principles from separating and following their separate paths. Democracy is the daily process of blending freedom and justice within our lives and the lives of those we encounter.Put differently: Democracy is the constant work of keeping freedom and justice on the same path.That is why my partner and I brought together interested students to discuss human rights issues for nearly 20 years. We were shaking the jar.For many young people, the simple fact that democratic processes are dependent upon such an elusive blend and balance of values and responsibilities is a revelation. Consumer societies tend to create people who sit and watch rather than people who stand and do. Consumerism creates a world of simple, well-defined transactions rather than a world of listening and then formulating well-reasoned responses and ongoing interactions.Democracy is hard work.But there is a necessary third ingredient. Everyone who makes salad dressing from scratch knows our vinegar and oil mix needs one more component. After pouring together the vinegar and oil, add a small amount of water. Then vigorously shake the jar. That little bit of water helps the vinegar and oil blend while slightly muting the vinegar.Compassion is at the heart of Eastern religions and philosophies. As the rift between East and West widens, a conversation about the role compassion plays in creating the sort of democracies we envision might be useful: consider the East’s thoughts about compassion and the West’s focus on balancing freedom and justice. Then consider how often we fail to live up to our aspirations – East and West.The world is in desperate need of conversations that rise above those that came before. Every past conversation matters, but we need new ones.Rather than getting angry with the people who won’t wear masks, maybe we should talk to them. Try to engage with them, not necessarily about not wearing a mask. Ask them if they are stressed or angry. Find the source of their unwillingness to wear a mask. Put yourself in their shoes. Demonstrate compassion. Then ask them to please wear a mask.Scolding will get us nowhere.Their souls are simply leaning too far into a perception of freedom inconsistent with our perceptions of justice and community. Be gentle. At some point, they may need to remind some of us that we are leaning too far towards justice. Remember this delicate balancing act and remember the frailty inherent to democratic processes.If we start a conversation, there might be an opportunity to remind our mask-less friends of those who need and deserve fundamental freedoms. Those unjustly imprisoned, confined, and tortured should never be left to fend for themselves. Carry them into your thoughts, actions, and discussions. Their lives remind us that people can be picked up, thrown into a dark van, and tossed into a cell for no reason. Could that ever happen in your communityThe basis of our efforts should always start from this point: the never-ending struggle of communities to blend freedom and justice with a dash of compassion.Keep shaking things up. Mix these vital conversations and thoughts into your daily life.But in the short term: Please wear a mask, and converse with your fellow citizens while 6 feet apart.KeithLuebkerecently retired from teaching nonprofit leadership courses and has several decades of experience directing nonprofit organizations."
suffolknewsherald_2020_59,"Published 7:34 pm Friday, July 3, 2020ByStaff ReportsThe state of Virginia is in the third phase of Gov. Ralph Northam’s reopening plan as of last Wednesday, but state and local health officials continue to urge caution.Numbers in Virginia were falling for quite some time, but they seem to be on the rise again, including locally. On Friday, the Western Tidewater Health District reported its largest one-day increase in cases since May 15. Most of the new cases were in Suffolk.Speaking at the Suffolk City Council meeting last week, the first day of the Phase 3 reopening, Western Tidewater Health District Director Dr. Todd Wagner cautioned people to be vigilant.“The fact that I’m starting to see a little bit of leveling off, a little bit of increase in the percent positivity, combined with the fact that … we just went to Phase 3 reopening, this weekend, we’ve got a large Fourth of July weekend, makes me concerned,” Wagner said at the meeting. That was before the spike in cases on Friday.Although many things have reopened in Phase 3, and there is no more stay-at-home order in effect, life should not be back to “normal” quite yet. The virus is still circulating in our community, so it might pay to be even more vigilant than we have been the past few months.On June 10, the day the stay-at-home order expired, Dr. Norman Oliver, the state health commissioner, spoke with the Suffolk News-Herald and shared some things he thinks people should do this summer to stay safe.First of all, he recommended that people still stay at home if they don’t have to be out.“We feel that people can go out and participate in some activities outside of the home, but the virus is still there, so clearly staying at home will be safer,” he said. “This is especially true for people in high risk groups, the elderly, people with underlying medical conditions — those of us in those categories should only go out if absolutely necessary for the foreseeable future.”Dr. Oliver also said wearing a mask is a way to prevent spread of the virus.“The reason why I should wear a mask is so that I don’t infect you,” he said. “If I’m out and about and spreading respiratory droplets, I can infect others whether or not I’m feeling sick. If the majority of people wear a mask, it can significantly decrease the spread of the virus, so that’s the reason for wearing a mask.”Oliver also recommended that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water, use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available, and keep their distance from others.For more information about COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus, visit vdh.virginia.gov.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

It began to rain. The children went inside, and I went to grab an umbrella. The bus appeared in the few minutes that I was away. No one was standing at the stop, and the driver didn’t stop there for long. It was raining. As I walked toward the stop, the bus moved and began to head in my direction. I thought perhaps she was meeting me to close the distance of my walking in the rain. “That’s nice,” I thought. But I was wrong.When the bus doors were opened, the driver scolded me. “You weren’t there,” she said, pointing and giving me the street corners where she is designated to stop. I thought to challenge her observation with a reply of “You are late,” but I didn’t. I was wearing my mask as I was instructed to do, which thankfully slowed my sass. When I asked for the bags for my three children and elected not to take the extra milk, I got more of her attitude. She explained that I had to take six milk cartons for my three bags. Did she have to be nasty about it?With my arms filled with goodies, I kept my mouth closed and walked away. For a first time meeting, this driver and I did not hit it off well. I was convicted and upset with the encounter all at once.Our emotional and psychological well-being is largely affected with all the change, grief and death that we have endured during the pandemic. We all have bad days, and we likely have more of them these days. Stress does not allow us to behave at our best. I also get that our school administrators, teachers, bus drivers and support staff are under more stress than we know. I am encouraged that no matter the weight of it all, together we can foster an environment of harmony and hope as a team.Teamwork is the key ingredient to successfully educating our children whether they are attending public school, private school, virtual learning or face-to-face format. When you are a teammate, you commit to show up. Showing up means being present not just in position or name only but bringing the best of you to the commitment. A great teammate serves others with the best of your presence, your talent and your resources.I consider being a parent of a school-aged child an automatic membership to the human growth dream team. Like any team that is formed by an organization, we do not get to pick our teammates. But we do get to choose how we approach the opportunity to serve alongside our teammates.The COVID era has given us several challenges to navigate. Now that school has begun in these virtual platforms, we have several more challenges. I will be the first to admit that I have been skeptical of how well we will fare as a team during this virtual learning challenge. I still choose this team. The “us vs. them” approach to this year is ineffective. We are them and they are us at the same time. We are allies and there are no enemies. These are our rules of engagement:4Give everyone some grace. Sometimes grace means holding your tongue. Grace means giving other people the benefit of the doubt. Turn the other cheek even when you feel like being a bit cheeky because someone approached you the wrong way.4Master the art of a sincere “smize.” Tyra Banks coined this term for smiling with your eyes. I know it’s difficult to show someone that you’re a friendly teammate when half of your face is covered. The best you can do is put on a happy face with your eyes. No side eye allowed.4Be positive. As hard as it is to show up for people, it is harder to do it for people you don’t know. That’s why you must amp yourself with positivity before the day starts. Let positive words, tone and temperament be your cloak no matter who you meet.

minnpost_2020_135,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On May 25, George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight just 20 miles from my house. A week later, the president called my city a laughingstock. Instead of focusing on the murder of an innocent man, there are some who want to turn our attention to the rioters. But why have the cries for justice for Floyd been so loud Why is the anger so strong Because people are sick of this injustice that is not new to Minnesota or the U.S. Our country was built with the blood of African-American slaves, our cities segregated by color to protect the sanctity of whiteness, and our schools have become pipelines toward incarceration for our students of color.George Floyd’s murder rekindled a fire across our nation. The same fire that brought MLK to Birmingham, Kapernick to his knees, and thousands of people onto the streets today. Our communities of color are hurting, they are in pain, and they are traumatized by yet another deadly incident of police brutality. The hunting and killing of black bodies is not new to America, but it has become a norm many of us have all too easily been desensitized to. If this week in Minneapolis has taught me anything, it is that I too have been complicit for far too long.As a white woman, who hasn’t lived this experience firsthand and who has privileges too numerous to count, I worry that it isn’t my place to speak. But then I realized that that is the problem — that white people don’t think we have a responsibility here. The communities of color are already toiling away; now it is our turn to step up. White people made racism into the monster it is today. As Martin Luther King says, “A riot is the language of the unheard,” and we must actively seek to hear those whose voices have been stifled for so long.In the midst of the chaos, I decided to reread MLK’s Letter From a Birmingham Jail, which I was assigned in high school two years ago. At the time, it felt like a history lesson; now it is current events. MLK writes, “There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair.” The cup of endurance has run over this week.Many of my friends have attended the protests and riots in Minneapolis. My friends of color have been tear gassed, threatened with violence, and blamed for the destruction of safety and peace in our communities. The people demanding change have been pushed aside for far too long. They are not thugs and they are not looters; they have been looted of their freedom and lives.George Floyd’s murder brought thousands to the streets of Minneapolis, and it has caused uprisings across the United States. Cities may have been on fire after his death, but the fire of racism has been felt by the hearts, minds, and souls of black people for generations. I hope we address the inequities and injustices of the destruction of black bodies with the same swiftness that we did the riots. As we put out the fires across our country we must remember what sparked the first flame. Slavery, Jim Crow laws, and the mass incarceration of people of color was not peaceful; we must remember our own history before we judge the path of others.People of color need to be heard. Seen. And believed. They must be at the center of these conversations. We cannot “restore peace” in our communities if we don’t step outside of our privilege and listen to those who are suffering.George Floyd should still be breathing. Let’s hold people accountable, create meaningful change, and demand racial justice. Only then will we finally be able to take a breath together as a nation that fulfills on its promise to all of its citizens.Jessica Melnik is a student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

Brown/AFP via Getty Images/TNS When it comes to her daughter Emerson’s education, Sarrin Warfield says, she’s “in it to win it.”When it comes to her daughter Emerson’s education, Sarrin Warfield says, she’s “in it to win it.”When Emerson’s assigned school in South Carolina announced plans for virtual learning this fall, Sarrin says she asked herself, “What if we just made this in my backyard and made a school?” After talking with friends who have children the same age as Emerson, Sarrin said, “Let’s do it. Instead of it being a crazy idea, let’s own this process and be really intentional about doing this and make it happen.”Sarrin is one of the thousands of parents around the country who formed learning pods when assigned schools closed. By meeting in small groups with friends’ and neighbors’ children, these pod families could try to keep at least one of part of their child’s life from being upended because of COVID-19.The time-honored practice of school assignment did little to help the Warfields — or thousands of other students around the U.S. during the COVID spring … and then COVID summer and fall. In the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year, officials in some of the largest districts in the country reported significant enrollment changes from the previous school year, especially among younger students.Officials in Mesa, Arizona, reported a 17% decrease in kindergarten enrollment after the first two weeks. In Los Angeles, Superintendent Austin Beutner reported a 3.4% decrease in enrollment, but said another 4% of students couldn’t be found, making the change closer to 7%. Figures are similar in Broward County, Florida, and Houston. In large school districts, these percentages amount to over 10,000 children per district.Some of these changes can be attributed to learning pods. But officials in large cities and even those representing entire states simply reported having no contact with many students.Under normal circumstances, if thousands of children who were once in school suddenly were nowhere to be found, this would be an issue of national concern. Hearings would be held, and officials would demand to know what is happening with schools around the country. Loud calls for change would be heard.But life during the pandemic is anything but normal.Likewise, if more students around the country were failing — say, twice the figure from last year — this would also be worrisome, right? From Los Angeles to Houston to Chicago to Fairfax, Virginia, school officials and researchers are now reporting that the proportion of students earning D’s and F’s in the first semester has increased, doubling in some cases, in comparison to the last school year.Yet across the U.S., many school districts, especially those in large metro areas, still remain closed to in-person learning for some if not all grades and may not reopen at the start of 2021.According to the Pew Research Center, 72% of parents in lower-income brackets report being “very” or “somewhat” concerned this fall that their children are “falling behind in school as a result of the disruptions caused by the pandemic.” With thousands of students not in class, even virtually, and falling grades among those who are attending, who can blame them?For taxpayers and policymakers looking for lessons in the pandemic, the utter failure of school assignment systems to provide quality-learning options to all students, especially the most vulnerable, is clear.The quality and consistency of the education a child received during the pandemic has been dependent on the attendance boundary in which that child’s family lives. At the same time, so many of the issues plaguing education during the pandemic — and for that matter, the entire century leading up to the pandemic — are rooted in policies that fund school systems, rather than individual students.Allowing dollars to follow children directly to any public or private school of choice is a critical emergency policy reform that states should pursue. Such a policy change is overdue.Since it’s anyone’s guess how soon life will get back to normal, we can’t wait any longer for the system to fix itself.Jonathan Butcher is a senior policy analyst in Heritage’s Center for Education Policy.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_33,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Dreamstime/TNS Honesty never was the point of the holiday card.I’ve always been ambivalent about the holiday photo card — the snapshots of “here we are casually walking down a country road” or the ones on a beach at sunset where every family member just happens to be wearing white.I’ve always been ambivalent about the holiday photo card — the snapshots of “here we are casually walking down a country road” or the ones on a beach at sunset where every family member just happens to be wearing white.They are the Instagram equivalent of the holiday letter — a rosy-cheeked, Photoshopped version of a family’s year. A crying kid on Santa’s lap is an allowable transgression, with tears still in service of maximizing adorableness.Now that 2020 has left us all depleted, wrung out with grief and disappointment, this season seems like the perfect time to do away with the pretense of it all. In my mailbox this year, I am hoping to see do-it-yourself haircuts, pants without zippers, and yes, the quarantine 15 that all that home baking piled on.Soon after the baking craze started in May, after the initial wave of lockdown shock started to crest, the “pandemic porch portrait” suddenly was a thing. My social media stream filled with pictures of families gathered outside their homes. When a woman in a local parenting group offered to document our community, I signed up. During our brief session, my husband, our 8-year-old son and I stood looking dolefully at our photographer well over 12 feet away.After we got the proofs, my husband quipped, “Well, I think we got our holiday card photo for this year!” And, yes, we’re using it. When I looked on photo sites to order up prints, I was glad to see new greetings being offered: “Well, that was crazy!” “We tried.” “Good riddance 2020!” and “It’s a merry, all around crazy sheltered Christmas.”They are a stride toward honesty. This year, we have seen the fragility and futility of all those hopeful “this year I will” goals set in January. I wonder how holiday cards can render the heartbreaking absence of loved ones. Will this year’s cards — delivered postelection and pre-inauguration — have markers of political joy or anger? Can any card show what it feels like to see an elderly parent only through the window of an assisted-living facility?The holiday photo card seems akin to the college alumni magazine entry, often just about highlighting accomplishments. Where are the pithy comments about job loss or breakups? Illness or deep disappointment? Perhaps that’s just not the point; it’s not the place to reveal a raw or unphotogenic moment.There was an intriguing article in the Wall Street Journal last year about how the holiday card has evolved — and the visual language of announcing life changes without words. What counted as a breach of convention, such as revealing illness by not hiding medical equipment, showed how strongly the boundaries have been set for smiling kids and perfect backgrounds.This year offers a moment to peel back from the code of visual perfection, allowing us to reveal our flaws. During one emotionally dark winter when I was trying to get pregnant and not succeeding, I stood by a trash can and tore into tiny pieces the holiday cards that “announced with joy” a baby’s first Christmas or Hanukkah. Then I cinched up the trash bag and took it outside. Even the torn scraps seemed to hurt me, lying like fallen puzzle pieces, representing something I so badly wanted but didn’t have.This year, there will be no pictures of children on Santa’s lap. And I hope, for once, my friends will put themselves in the frame and not just let images of their kids stand in for their whole family. Since I can’t see my friends in person, I want to at least see them in the photos. Let this year be the one when we’re all in the picture, as our disheveled, beautiful, surviving selves.I’m sure there will still be some wind-swept beach scenes, at least in Southern California, where a photographer can shoot this scene from afar. But I’m hoping the 2020 cards show the kind of dour honesty this year has forced on us. We’re using our porch portrait and letting our unsmiling faces be what represents us. I’ll write a hopeful message but acknowledge how bad things have been.Honesty never was the point of the holiday card, but there is unity in a shared experience of isolation and anxiety. Maybe the pandemic will have lessened our need to pose on all levels. Maybe in this year’s photo greetings, I will see friends and family telling me, “This is where we stood and waited for this to pass.”Elline Lipkin is a research scholar at the UCLA Center for the Study of Women and teaches creative writing for Los Angeles Writing Classes.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_123,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .A general agreement is that these review boards should involve all stakeholders, including those outside of the police department. While we recognize that this is an important consideration, it is also one of the reasons we do not see many of these review boards being created around the country. In fact, the greater the political pressure for reform and civil oversight of police activities, the more defiant police unions often are in resisting it — with few city officials, including liberal leaders, able to overcome their opposition. While we do not argue that external oversight is not an important component of a more comprehensive police reform, a more immediate, and possibly less resistance-inducing, review process in law enforcement agencies might be similar to the Morbidity & Mobility conferences that are common in Medicine.Morbidity & Mortality conferences are a critical component of clinical governance, and they are mandatory in programs training medical doctors in the United States. These meetings have proven to be important in improving patient outcomes, quality of care, and attitudes towards patient safety. Perhaps more important, these meetings also contribute to the education of clinical staff.Particularly in surgical practices, Morbidity & Mortality conferences, which are non-punitive in nature, are essential components of the surgeons’ career-long self-assessment process. This process requires honest and complete disclosure of all events that might have led to adverse outcomes in patient care. Week after week, trainees in every training program in the U.S. have to stand in front of their peers and mentors, answering questions, learning not to defend their mistakes, rather learning from errors. The system works, as the vast majority of surgeons take pride in bringing their cases to these conferences because they know that owning up to mistakes at the expense of embarrassment within the realm of this process leads to identification of areas of improvement and overall better patient outcomes.A new focus on police training and education with internal non-punitive reviews, similar to Morbidity and Mortality conferences, can lead to the creation of a culture that understands and values the importance of peer support and intervention. Similar to those in medicine, police officers need to understand that they must put professionalism, including peer-review and intervention, at the center of police culture.Binnur Ozkececi-Taneris department chair and a professor of political science in Hamline University’s College of Liberal Arts.Timucin Taneris a transplant surgeon and associate professor of surgery at Mayo Clinic.The views expressed here are the authors’ personal views, and do not necessarily represent the position or policy of Hamline University or Mayo Clinic."
minnpost_2020_13,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Political turmoil about our ongoing pandemic lays bare a persistent problem within the U.S. populace: We are susceptible to contrived scientific controversies. This problem is neither new nor unique to the United States, but it is deadly and getting worse.The New York Timesreportedrecently that Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson assembled for congressional testimony a group of doctors who reject the scientific consensus about several coronavirus protocols. One is a vaccine skeptic who advocates the use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. Another urges the use of a drug the NIH restricts to clinical trials. And another proclaims as “settled science” that masks, social distancing, and self-isolation do not curtail spread of the virus.Johnson’s invitation to these doctors is one example of how scientific controversies are created in the public mind. He provided a forum for the doctors to propagate unsubstantiated scientific claims and to build suspicion about established science.Leah Ceccarelli, a professor of communication at the University of Washington, has examined numerous examples of “manufactured scientific controversy.” She notes that one strategy used to encourage belief in a scientific controversy is to cultivate uncertainty about a specific finding. Most science contains a measure of ambiguity, and in many cases some individual scientists disagree with the scientific consensus. That provides opportunity for political actors to sow doubt about conclusions that enjoy near universal agreement within the scientific community.One way this occurs is through appeal to the belief that two sides exist in every debate and that those sides merit equal representation. This is often coupled with the claim that one side is unfairly suppressed.Johnson’s hearing featured the same strategy. “There’s a blackout on good information,” Johnson said, “so people are being denied information to make intelligent choices.” And Johnson conveyed to the Times his belief that the scientific establishment has ignored, sabotaged, and “censored” data about alternative treatments and protocols. His effort was to give voice to these supposedly silenced minority viewpoints.This strategy often works, because the value of fair play in the marketplace of ideas is central to American culture. To counter the strategy seems a violation of that basic value. When defenders of the scientific consensus, both Democrats and Republicans, decided not to participate in the hearing because they did not want to legitimate “theories that are at odds with the broader scientific community,” they appeared to quash a fair debate. And when they worked with health experts to insert into the Congressional Record a statement that dismisses the doctors’ views, they appeared to suppress unfairly those who disagree with them.The result is the creation of uncertainty about widely held findings. The doctors in this case did not need to prove anything. Uncertainty is all it takes to manufacture a controversy in the public domain that exists nowhere in the scientific community.Scientific findings are reliable because the community of scientists, the entrance to which requires a lengthy apprenticeship and demonstrated expertise, has agreed upon a specific, rigorous, and logical set of criteria for the evaluation of scientific claims. Science does not produce absolute and unchanging truths. History sports numerous examples of scientific knowledge that has been modified or overturned by later work. But science produces knowledge that is more reliable than other types of knowledge because it is subject to the rigors of evaluation based upon criteria about which scientists are in universal agreement.We can recognize that scientists disagree with each other, that individual scientists have interests, that scientific truths are not immutable, but none of this should lead to the conclusion that scientific claims admit degrees of uncertainty comparable to political or theological or artistic claims. A scientific theory is not a hunch or a guess or an unverified conjecture. It is a well-supported explanation of how the natural world works that the scientific community embraces with a high degree of confidence; so high that the explanation would be modified or abandoned based only on compelling evidence verified by replication.To find one or two or a handful of rogue scientists who question a scientific consensus means nothing. Because that does not constitute a challenge to the criterion that matters: agreement among the legion of experts who make up the scientific community.To be clear: The doctors Johnson invited to his hearing (or any scientists who question established theories are not rogue scientists because of their hypotheses about scientific issues. They are rogue scientists because when their work does not stand up to the scrutiny of the scientific community, they take their hypotheses to the court of public opinion. And the unfortunate result is that manufactured controversies lead us to embrace ideas that do not pass scientific muster, and that are at best misinformed and at worst fatal.Jeffery L.

suffolknewsherald_2020_18,"Published 5:39 pm Friday, August 14, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieImpossible. For U.S. parents forced to school their children because the pandemic has us in fear. Impossible.Imagine me singing these words to the tune of the song “Impossible” made famous in the 1997 Rodgers and Hammerstein version of the movie “Cinderella.” It was sung by two of my favorites, Whitney Houston and Brandy. This song keeps playing in my head as I consider the upcoming school year.A New Jersey mother that I follow on Instagram made a video post that had words affixed to the bottom of the screen that read, “I need this pandemic to go away.” She was explaining how her daughter’s school principal could not answer the questions she asked of her because so many details of the pending school year were still being worked out. The mother was frustrated and I could tell she was near tears as she said, “I just want to figure this out and make the best decision for my kids.” I am sure I speak for many when I say I feel her pain.Children have so many questions. I believe the pandemic made that truth more prominent. Not having answers to their questions has been a difficult and humbling reality as the mother of my three brilliant gems. I know I am not supposed to have all the answers, but I like being able to help them when I do.Parenting during this pandemic has been the most eye-opening event in my life. I have literally had to come face to face with me: my fears, my selfishness and all these other ugly sides of me that I keep under wraps pretty well. Quarantine has also revealed to me some beauties that I am grateful to have discovered. I understand that there is something sobering about not having the answers. There is a wisdom of giving our children what we know and teaching them how to find what we don’t know. Awareness of our limits is actually a place where possibilities are born.You have likely heard of the young, viral sensation Keedron Bryant. Twelve-year-old Bryant recently became known to the world from a home video of him singing the words, “I Just Wanna Live.” I was unaware that Keedron’s mother wrote the lyrics to this song until I watched an Access Hollywood interview of Keedron and his mother. Something she said really resonated with me. She didn’t know how to tell Keedron to respond to the injustices and the outrage and the pandemic that was swirling around him. God gave her a message in her notes from prayer. She gave those notes to her son and sent him upstairs to seek the Lord about how to minister the words to others. He was to return when God had given him something. From Keedron’s obedience, the world now has a message of heartfelt honesty and hope for healing.I am not Keedron’s mother, but I am the mother of young black men. I am the mother of children who are not going back to school in the same way that they are accustomed. I am the mother of children who have questions. I am a mother and a parent, like many of you, who does not have all the answers. But this is what I do know for sure. I am also a mother like Johnetta Bryant with my limits and my prayers. I know for sure that those two things have brought about unforeseen possibilities when I give them to the Lord.Perhaps the most accurate line in that “Cinderella” song that closely relates to our experiences of today is “the world is full of zanies and fools who don’t believe in sensible rules and won’t believe what sensible people say. And because these daft and dewy-eyed dopes keep building up impossible hopes, impossible things are happening every day.” Indeed they are.While I am encouraging myself, I say to the parents who are facing what seems impossible right now, trust what you have in your hands and give it to your children. Parental knowledge is invaluable. It has been proven by our Father in Heaven. Our parental status carries much power. We don’t exercise that power near as much as we probably should.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of Nonprofit Leadership and Management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

eugeneweekly_2020_15,"We ve got issues. Iwas born in Eugene. A Black baby of two revolutionary Black parents and the fifth child of our crew. I grew up the only Black girl in every aspect of my education. I met other girls who were bi-racial Black and white as I got older. We had different permission from our parents. We understood things differently. When you’re young the narrative of your parents is what drives your foundational decisions. We foundationally were different. As I grew older the definitions of blackness outside of my household became increasingly more relevant. My ideas around blackness didn’t reflect the history my parents taught me. The blackness that was acceptable didn’t match the blackness I was born into. Outside of my home, blackness was aggressive and over sexualized; it was strength throughout inflicted oppression, athletically directed, lacking intellect and something to maintain in support of whiteness without reproach. I learned how to fit in quickly. Always knowing, quietly, that I was smarter than the rest of them. I learned how to switch my language, my style and my approach. However, racism is tricky when fed to children of color as repose, discipline and behavior modification. Racism is tricky when fed to children as safety measures and deemed necessary for their survival. With this onslaught of colonization and anti-blackness regiment, how do Black children survive and ever see and love their true selves? The narrative our ancestors have given our great grandmothers, our grandmothers and our mothers is aplaybook to the magic that lies within our melanin. It can shield our souls from the lies we are taught to take in. Our connection to a higher source of truth through our ancestry line is how we process it. That is insider information. Some of us survive, some of us do not. I don’t mean in a physical way, although that can be justly argued. I’m speaking on a conscious level — conscious level of truth about our very soul and placement in this world. Insisting that our truth, or powerful existence, our undeniable value is not only subjective, but objectively real, factual. As I’ve grown, and untangled white conditioning to allow what my parents instilled to shine through, I’m left with a deep understanding of whiteness. I know before they do what racist proposition I’ll be invited to critique or participate in. I canintuitively see where the line is for them on the truth around racism, and to intentionally avoid that space to appease the predictable fragility that follows. I know how to recognize performative support, and sincere ignorance. Am I scarred? Or do I carry a secret weapon? I know them better than they will ever know me. I can act as “properly” as they require for their own comfort. I speak their language, often more eloquently thanthey do. Is that a gift? That is assimilation. Assimilation is not a gift. That dance is not a gift. The gift after all of these years of healing the white conditioning is to have grown to a space of unapologetically Black. I survived. I do not wrestle with what is right and what is white. I no longer wrestle with permission to wear my hair free, to allow my body to be big, to laugh loud when joy sweeps over me. I survived.

minnpost_2020_174,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The basic idea behind this proposal is to let low-risk people in the U.S. socialize and naturally become infected with the coronavirus, while vulnerable people would maintain social distancing and continue to shelter in place. Proponents of this strategy claim so-called “natural herd immunity” will emerge and minimize harm from SARS-CoV-2 while protecting the economy.Another way to get to herd immunity is through mass vaccinations, as we have done with measles, smallpox and largely with polio.A population has achieved herd immunity when a large enough percentage of individuals become immune to a disease. When this happens, infected people are no longer able to transmit the disease, and the epidemic will burn out.As a professor ofbehavioral and community health sciences, I am acutely aware that mental, social and economic health are important for a person to thrive, and that public health measures such as social distancing have imposed severe restrictions on daily life. But based on all the research and science available, the leadership at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and I believe this infection-based approach would almost certainly fail.Dropping social distancing and mask wearing, reopening restaurants and allowing large gatherings will result in overwhelmed hospital systems and skyrocketing mortality. Furthermore, according to recent research, this reckless approach isunlikely to even produce the herd immunitythat’s the whole point of such a plan.Vaccination, in comparison, offers a much safer and likely more effective approach.Herd immunity is an effective way to limit a deadly epidemic, but it requires a huge number of people to be immune.The proportion of the population required for herd immunity depends on how infectious a virus is. This is measured by thebasic reproduction number, R0, how many people a single contagious person would infect in a susceptible population. For SARS-CoV-2,R0 is between 2 and 3.2. At that level of infectiousness, between 50% and 67% of the population would need to develop immunity through exposure or vaccination to contain the pandemic.The Great Barrington Declaration suggests the U.S. should aim for this immune threshold through infection rather than vaccination.To get to 60% immunity in the U.S., about 198 million individuals would need to be infected, survive and develop resistance to the coronavirus. The demand on hospital care from infections would be overwhelming. And according to theWHO estimated infection fatality rate of 0.5%, that would mean nearly a million deaths if the country were to open up fully.The Great Barrington Declaration hinges on the idea that you can effectively keep healthy, infected people away from those who are at higher risk. According to this plan, if only healthy people are exposed to the virus, then the U.S. could get to herd immunity and avoid mass deaths. This may sound reasonable, but in the real world with this particular virus, such a plan is simply not possible and ignores the risks to vulnerable people, young and old.TheGreat Barrington Declarationcalls for “allowing those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally … while protecting those who are at highest risk.” Yet healthy people can get sick, and asymptomatic transmission, inadequate testing and difficulty isolating vulnerable people pose severe challenges to a neat separation based on risk.First, the plan wrongly assumes that all healthy people can survive a coronavirus infection. Though at-risk groups do worse, young healthy people arealso dyingandfacing long-term issuesfrom the illness.Second, not all high-risk people can self-isolate. In some areas, as much as22% of the population have two or more chronic conditionsthat put them at higher risk for severe COVID-19. They might live with someone in the low-risk group and they still must shop, work and do the other activities necessary for life. High-risk individuals will come in contact with the low-risk group.Asymptomatic spread is compounded by shortcomings in the quality of testing. Currently available tests are fairly good, but do not reliably detect the coronavirusduring the early phase of infectionwhen viral concentrations can be low.Accordingly, identifying infection in the low-risk population would be difficult. These people could go on to infect high-risk populations because it is impossible to prevent contact between them.Without sharp isolation of these two populations, uncontrolled transmission in younger, healthier people risks significant illness and death across vulnerable populations. Both computer models and one real-world experiment back up these fears.A recent U.K. modeling effort assessed a range of relaxed suppression strategies and showed thatnone achieved herd immunity while also keeping cases below hospital capacity. This study estimated a fourfold increase in mortality among older people if only older people practice social distancing and the remainder of the population does not.But epidemiologists don’t have to rely on computer models alone.Sweden tried this approach to infection-based herd immunity. It did not go well. Sweden’s mortality rate ison par with Italy’sandsubstantially higher than its neighbors. Despite this risky approach,Sweden’s economy still suffered, and on top of that, nowhere near enough Swedes have been infected to get to herd immunity. As of August 2020, only about7.1% of the country had contracted the virus, with the highest rate of 11.4% in Stockholm. This is far short of the estimated 50%-67% required to achieve herd immunity to the coronavirus.There is one final reason to doubt the efficacy of infection-based herd immunity: Contracting and recovering from the coronavirusmight not even give immunity for very long. One CDC report suggests that “people appear to become susceptible to reinfection around 90 days after onset of infection.” The potentially short duration of immunity in some recovered patients would certainly throw a wrench in such a plan. When combined with the fact that the highest estimates for antibody prevalence suggest thatless than 10% of the U.S. population has been infected, it would be a long, dangerous and potentially impassable road to infection-based herd immunity.But there is another way, one that has been done before: mass vaccination. Vaccine-induced herd immunity can end this pandemic the same way it has mostly endedmeasles,eradicated smallpoxandnearly eradicated polioacross the globe. Vaccines work.Until mass SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, social distancing and use of face coverings, with comprehensive case finding, testing, tracing and isolation, are the safest approach. These tried-and-true public health measures will keep viral transmission low enough for people to work and attend school while managing smaller outbreaks as they arise. It isn’t a return to a totally normal life, but these approaches can balance social and economic needs with health. And then, once a vaccine is widely available, the country can move to herd immunity.Steven Albertis a professor and chair of behavioral and community health at theUniversity of Pittsburgh.This articleis republished fromThe Conversation."
hawaiitribune_herald_2020_64,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In January, Joe Biden will take charge of an executive branch left in woeful disrepair. Practically every important federal institution has been scorched by four years of sustained assault by his predecessor — none more so than the State Department.In January, Joe Biden will take charge of an executive branch left in woeful disrepair. Practically every important federal institution has been scorched by four years of sustained assault by his predecessor — none more so than the State Department.President Donald Trump has damaged American diplomacy in word and deed. His secretaries of state, first Rex Tillerson and then Mike Pompeo, have damaged the department deeply. Their open hostility toward career foreign affairs professionals has led to an exodus of talent, leaving important roles either unfilled or, worse, manned by unqualified political appointees.All this is now Biden’s to fix. To lead the repair effort, he plans to nominate former deputy secretary of state Antony Blinken as head of the department. A career diplomat, Blinken has an insider’s knowledge of what needs fixing, and the credibility with his fellow professionals to do the job. It will help, too, that Jake Sullivan and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden’s candidates for national security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations, have also held top positions at State.Those are promising choices, but the president-elect must also conquer his own proclivity for personalizing foreign affairs. As a longtime member of Washington’s foreign policy establishment — both as a senator and as Obama’s vice president — he has more than a passing familiarity with many world leaders, and often cites old friendships when asked how he might deal with difficult diplomatic challenges.America would be better served by returning foreign relations to the realm of institutions rather than individuals. Under Trump, only one of 28 assistant secretary positions is filled by an active-duty career officer confirmed by the Senate. Biden should rebalance the department’s leadership, so that the majority of Senate-confirmed positions are held by career diplomats. He should reduce the number of ambassadorships awarded to loyalists and fundraisers. Shrinking the size of the National Security Council staff would also go a long way toward restoring the role of the State Department in carrying out foreign policy.The experience of Biden’s team also gives it credibility to carry out much-needed reforms of the diplomatic corps. As Thomas-Greenfield has pointed out, the State Department trains almost twice as many Portuguese speakers as it does Arabic or Chinese speakers. Restoring America’s credibility and leadership in international affairs will require its diplomats to be as fluent in hitherto neglected issues of global import — such as climate change, pandemic preparedness and economic inequality — as in matters of traditional strategic importance to Washington.The new administration should work with Congress to devise policies to attract a more diverse and digitally savvy diplomatic corps that draws on the country’s full range of talents. These could include making it easier for mid-career professionals from the private sector to serve overseas and encouraging diplomats to spend time working outside of government. To appeal to younger recruits, the department’s system of promotion and career advancement should be revamped to reward innovation and outstanding performance, not personal connections and length of service.Biden’s campaign promises to “build back better” were directed to the economy, but he has an opportunity to apply the credo to American diplomacy. He shouldn’t waste it.— Bloomberg Opinion"
minnpost_2020_44,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It’s not helpful or fair to throw shade on schools and districts for distance learning “Version 1.0.” Minnesota school administrators and teachers had to shift long-established systems of in-person instruction to an online format in a matter of days. Educators skilled in the interpersonal arts of instruction, facilitation, motivation, and compassion were suddenly constrained to the impersonal tactics of video conferences and emails while their own children also learned at home. Families and students struggled to adjust from the predictability of scheduled school days to the stressful shapelessness of remote learning.It was tough all around. Minnesota must collectively commit to doing distance learning better this fall.One of the critical factors determining how much schools and districts improve their distance learning efforts will be whether they carefully listen to the parents and guardians of their students. Parents are now closer to the experience of school than teachers, and their role in facilitating education has been greatly expanded. From tech support to discipline to motivation, it all falls primarily on parents. Only parents know the full context of what’s happening in a household, and how this impacts the success of individual learners.In anticipation of continued distance learning this fall, The Jay and Rose Phillips Family Foundation of Minnesota commissioned a survey to elicit in-depth feedback from BIPOC families and families with lower incomes. The survey was designed by ACT Research and implemented by The School Transformation Collaborative, a local parent leadership organization that is working to build parent councils and elevate parents’ voices and power within the education system. Survey findings were reviewed by parents in focus groups to identify key recommendations for distance learning “Version 2.0” this fall.It’s not too late to set the bar high for the new school year. Now that we have the guidelines for re-opening, we urge educational leaders to invite parents into their planning processes. Have them critique your current ideas. Have them share what they experienced last spring and what they hope to experience this fall. You can jump into parents’ ideas by reviewing thesurveyfindings and watching thevideoof our recent virtual town hall conversation.Joel Luedtke is the program director of The Jay and Rose Phillips Family Foundation of Minnesota.

There are times when we do not have a clear focus on the view; we stay tucked in a soiled place. Life has been unexplainable during this season of revelation and change.Just the other day, my mind became a fog. As I sat on the bench under a tree, something caught my eye and grabbed my spirit. The shell of a cicada was attached to the tree. Then, childhood memories of finding the shells of cicadas in my grandma’s yard approached me in this new season of revelation and change. There are times when things from the past will travel to you, but it is how you approach it in the new season that determines how you will emerge from the soil. As I inspected this empty shell, the Holy Spirit began to download words into my spirit: protection, patience, presence and power. It is time to emerge from the soil to shape your shell.Although you may not see them, cicadas are around you. There is a process that is taking place under soil while you wait. You may not see the opportunities in this soiled place, but when you start to break through the soil, you will be able to complete your assignment. Cicadas shed multiple times during the maturing process. While you are in this place, there are some things that you are shedding as your shell is taking on a new form. Cicadas stay in waiting, deep in the soil, for 17 years before emerging. You are getting ready to emerge. Sometimes, you must dig in the dirt and just stay there: maturing in the soil.We sometimes move ahead of God to get a “cheap view.” When the time is right, you will step out of the soil. It is then that you get an “expansive view” because you were waiting in the process. God was preserving you, and now it is time for you to emerge. People will inspect your shell but may never know the extent of your shedding, and that is OK. The only thing that they need to know is that you emerged from the soil and so can they. I had no idea that the cicada was on the tree, but it was there. You may not understand everything that is taking place in the soil, but God is there.Despite what it physically looked like to others, Esther became a queen. Despite what it looks like, you are getting ready to emerge from behind the curtains. God organized this season of revelation and change so that He could get you to shed some things that you have been holding onto from your past. While you are going through this process, the Holy Spirit will be in the soil with you: teaching you and preparing you. He is getting ready to push you up so that you can break the surface: emerge.Originally, I was focused on the circumstances within my mind, and the shell of the cicada was there the whole time, yet I did not see it. What some may find ugly and has no purpose, I found intriguing, perfect form with a bold statement, “I was here.” We can hear cicadas making noise while they are mating. It is time for you to make some noise with your gift. What we model now will be proven by the shell that we leave behind. Some may feel like cicadas leave behind a mess; their shells serve as fertilizers to “boost plant life.” Are your fertilizers seeds of change that will boost the future? Do not become afraid of emerging from the soil in this season. You have been in there long enough.Ariane Williams is a teacher, minister, published author and liturgical dancer.

suffolknewsherald_2020_34,"Published 2:53 pm Tuesday, July 28, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Joseph PerryHow much time are you putting in prayer?I hear so many people say, If there were ever a time to pray, now is that time. We are living in unprecedented times that have us on the edge, because we don’t know what to expect next. It seems as though anything and everything can happen in each passing day. It has gotten to the point that the numbers of those who have become infected and who have died from the pandemic no longer surprise us. It seems as though we are living in perilous times — times where trouble appears to be lingering in every area of life. It has gotten so bad that we aren’t even sure if our children will be able to attend school. Those of us who are doing ministry and in particular, pastoring churches, are being stretched to lead in innovative ways. I also want to say, while we do ministry, continue to do it safely.Prayer is needed everywhere. And we need people who are willing to pray, as we see so many people who are losing hope in our nation and in living in this world today.But no matter how bad things look, no matter how bad it seems, we must keep praying.In Acts 4:23-31, we find Peter and John had been arrested, they had been reprimanded and later released by the Rulers of Israel for preaching and healing in the name of Jesus. They left and went to their family and friends and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. They all lifted their voice to God on one accord to thank God for their release.Through the trials and tribulations of this world, we must keep praying until something happens. There should be a coming together. Peter, John and the believers prayed, and the Bible says the prayers of the righteous availeth much. We need to keep praying no matter what.If your job is on the edge on ending, if your health seems to be on hold from healing, if your marriage seems to be unstable, keep praying. If you are under pressure, and feel as though you’re under the gun, keep praying to the Lord. Partner with a person to help you pray. It may look like nothing is happening when you pray, but something is in fact happening in the atmosphere. Something is happening in the spirit realm. You may think your prayers are just hitting the ceiling. You may think God is not hearing your prayers. But prayer has an unfailing resort. God is always moving on our behalf. God is always working on something for you.Know that praying can have unusual results. God won’t ever sit down and turn away from you as though He is not concerned. Those who stood up for the sake of Christ were threatened, but they spoke the word of God with boldness. You can’t walk around in fear. You keep praying, because there are unusual results when you pray. God can show up in the last hour. God can do anything, but you have to keep praying.The Bible says, and the place where they were assembled together was shaken, the power of God moved in each of them. When we pray, powerful things happen. He is able to do exceeding abundantly all that we can ask or think. Something happens in us and around us, ultimately for us, when we call up the One who has all power in His hand. Trust Him to be God in your life.The Rev. Dr. Joseph A.

A blood test looms on the horizon, using specific markers in the blood that may detect changes in the brain 20 years before symptoms occur.Scientific leaders, including the Alzheimer’s Association and representatives from more than 25 countries, are collaborating with technical guidance from the World Health Organization to track COVID-19’s long-term impact on the brain.Research on the APOE-e4 gene variant — the most well-known and strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease — has largely been done in people of European descent; however, genetic risk for Alzheimer’s may not mean the same for all races and ethnicities. New research finds APOE-e4 has a very different effect in Latinx populations.The drug pipeline for Alzheimer’s is heating up. Suvorexant, used to treat insomnia, is FDA approved for use in people with Alzheimer’s. Awaiting approval is Pimavanserin, a drug that treats hallucinations and delusions in Alzheimer’s.

philinquirer_2020_50,"COVID diagnoses, quarantined colleagues, and increased volume all contribute to major delays in getting your trash and recycling off the streets.As COVID-19 multiplies across our region and nation, our frontline workers continue to bear the brunt of this pandemic. Sanitation workers are no exception. It is no secret the Philadelphia Streets Department has been challenged with maintaining trash and recycling collections on a consistent schedule for several months.Many direct and indirect factors related to the coronavirus are at play. We are experiencing workforce shortages due to injuries, COVID-19 and other illnesses, and requirements for quarantining crews exposed to COVID-19. Plus, the department is seeing large increases in trash and recycling tonnage curbside due to more waste being generated at home.» READ MORE:Philly is so far behind on trash pick-up that one City Council member has called it a looming ‘public health crisis’Add in personnel working overtime cleaning up after protests, and more recently, severe weather producing torrential rains and flooding. Needless to say, these factors have created the perfect storm.Currently, our curbside tonnage data is showing trends in excess of 25%, and in some cases as much as a 50% increase each week, compared with collections over the same period one year prior. The increase in tonnage alone impacts our ability to collect trash on time with current resources.To put this figure into perspective, a 25% increase in tonnage is equivalent to more than one full day of extra trash curbside each week. This means that a normal week of collection, which is scheduled to be collected over five days, is realistically taking us six, and sometimes seven, days to complete. Add in factors such as bad weather and/or hampered staff attendance, and five normal collection days can easily multiple into seven or eight days.We want residents to know the Streets Department takes this issue seriously and is working to address the challenges and return to on-time collections. We have already begun to adjust our operations. This includes balancing necessary overtime with budget constraints, deploying more trucks and available staff when possible to accommodate the increased tonnage, and when necessary shifting crews from collecting one material (trash or recycling to the other.» READ MORE:How early can you put out your trash in Philly? Your garbage questions, answered.From a planning perspective, the strain on resources and the variations in that strain makes it nearly impossible to predict how far behind we will be each week because the increases in tonnage fluctuate weekly and vary across the city. This unpredictability, coupled with the challenge of employee attendance and additional impacts of COVID, really adds up. Working in this uncertain environment also hampers our ability to provide advance announcements of delays to residents.We understand and share the concerns of our residents.

During the pandemic, there have been credible reports of inadequate medical care from:In Minnesota, immigrant detainees in Sherburne County Jailsay they have been refused COVID-19 testing. Minnesota county jails holding immigration detainees generally lack adequate medical care for detainees with mental health issues and have denied medication to treat mental health. Minnesota jails also have used segregation — isolation for 23 hours per day without access to books or other materials — as punishment for complaints.Even before the pandemic struck, medical care was denied to seriously ill and dying detainees across the country. In January, immigrant detaineesheld in Essex County Jail in New Jerseyreported being prescribed Bengay for a broken rib, being denied access to their own medical records, and being denied treatment.

minnpost_2020_68,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’ve been an educator my whole adult life and I’ve always believed that school is a golden place.But that’s not true for every student. For some children, school is hell. Sexual assault and sexual harassment are perpetrated on victims of all ages, including on children in K-12 schools.Recent data from the Office of Civil Rights shows that20% of girls and 5% of boys are abused in K-12 schoolsin student-student or student-adult situations. And these child victims of sexual violence are 14% more likely than other young people to be victims of rape or attempted rape when they go on to their first year of college.There are more than 862,000 students in Minnesota’s public K-12 schools. This means that according to the figures from the Office of Civil Rights, nearly a quarter of a million Minnesota K-12 students, 215,000 children, are victims of sexual abuse, violence, or harassment.There are 56.5 million K-12 students in the U.S. And 25% of that number is a shocking 14,1 million children who are likely to be sexually abused or harassed during their K-12 experience.A Minnesota Lawyer article (May 5, 2017 reports, however, that there is a wall of protection surrounding K-12 schools. This wall makes it very difficult for those who are assaulted or harassed to bring charges against the students or adults who perpetrate these crimes.There are some efforts to crack that wall.There is a second lawsuit against DeVos and the Department of Education as well, led by the ACLU on behalf of organizations dedicated to helping students who have experienced sexual harassment and sexual assault at school. Those organizations include Know Your IX, the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Girls for Gender Equity, and Stop Sexual Assault in Schools.Why this legal assault on Betsy DeVos She has led the Department of Education to change Title IX, toloosen efforts to protect childrenfrom abuse andto increase protections for the abusers.The Education Amendments Act of 1972 is known as Title IX. It prohibits discrimination in any educational institution that receives federal funds.Most people think of Title IX only as the impetus to making girls’ sports available at schools. But in 1994, the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights applied the law to a prohibition on sexual assault on campus, which includes K-12 institutions.A 2009 study, however, showed that school assault rates had not declined and that students who were found guilty of sexual assault faced almost no consequences, only minor sanctions like counseling, community service, probation – or nothing. Sexual assault survivors faced the harshest punishment – seeing their rapist at school every day. Title IX was failing.Based on the results of that 2009 study showing Title IX’s failure, the Obama administration issued a ‘Dear Colleague Letter’ in 2011.Federal agencies can issue guidance documents called ‘Dear Colleague’ letters that interpret existing laws and regulations. Although these letters lack the same force as federal laws, they are important policy statements, and it is expected that these recommendations will be followed.This ‘Dear Colleague Letter’ reinforced the requirement that schools investigate sexual assault and provide services forsurvivors. The letter set out rights and protections foraccusedstudents as well, including due process and appeals.An important element addressed the standards of evidence. The Office of Civil Rights requires only the “preponderance of evidence” standard, the lowest standard, in resolving discrimination and assault cases, which gives the benefit of the doubt to the victim. Some schools were using the “clear and convincing” standard, which has a higher threshold than the “preponderance” standard, making it more difficult to find someone guilty. The Dear Colleague Letter reiterated that the “preponderance” standard should be used in sexual assault cases.What happened to Title IXIn September 2017, Betsy DeVos announced that the Dear Colleague Letter guidelines would be rescinded and that new practices would take effect on Aug. 14, 2020.I believe, as do many others, including the AGs and the ACLU, that these changes are harmful to students who experience sexual assault or harassment – and, in many ways, these changes revert to the unsatisfactory and inadequate standards that existed before the ‘Dear Colleague’ letter.In particular, the change allows schools to decide sexual assault cases usingeithera “preponderance of evidence” or “clear and convincing evidence.” This will make it harder to hold perpetrators accountable. Reports of sexual harassment will be held to a more skeptical review than reports of harassment based on race, national origin, or disability, which use “preponderance of evidence.” This creates a second-class standard for reports of sexual harassment and assault.The lawsuit brought by the attorneys general states, “According to the federal government’s own data, sexual harassment against students remains pervasive and mostly unreported. With the Department’s final Rule, sexual harassment will not become less common — but it will, as the Department acknowledges in the Rule, become even less regularly reported and remedied.”The Department of Education itself anticipates that far fewer cases will be reported, noting, in fact, its estimate that four-year institutions will now investigate 32% fewer reports of sexual harassment and assault than under the ‘Dear Colleague’ guidelines.We have seen the outpouring of women’s stories about sexual assault and harassment with the MeToo movement. The impunity for sexual assault begins here – in grades K-12.We must protect our children, especially those in K-12 schools who are the most vulnerable.World Without Genocide will host a public program about Title IX via Zoom tonight (Wednesday, July 22 from 7 to 9 p.m., featuring attorneys Lindsey Brice from the Minnesota Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Abigail Henchek from Gender Justice, and Jessica Melnik, director of Girls United MN.

suffolknewsherald_2020_63,"Published 9:00 pm Friday, June 26, 2020ByStaff ReportsIf it’s true what they say that every end is a new beginning, then the seniors of Suffolk’s high schools have had an unusual new beginning this year.The COVID-19 pandemic canceled their last three months of going to school in person and brought lots of challenges and heartache at what might have been. But rather than remember this time as one of disappointment and missed opportunities, we hope the class of 2020 instead finds resilience, strength and pride in their accomplishments in the midst of extraordinary circumstances.King’s Fork, Lakeland and Nansemond River high schools celebrated their seniors last week in a socially distanced fashion, first with virtual graduation ceremonies on the day their actual graduation would have taken place. Then, on Monday and Tuesday, the seniors got to return to each school one last time, riding in cars decked out to the max, celebrating their graduations in style.The excitement and joy in the air were just as contagious as a regular graduation, without the contagion of the virus being much of a concern due to the outside venue.The graduates we talked to had a great attitude about everything that has happened.“I actually like this,” said Chainey Lippard, a graduate of King’s Fork High School who plans to study cosmetology. “I think this is a better idea than traditional graduation. I feel like it was more fun and everyone has a better time.”“It’s heartbreaking, because I’m the first in my family to actually get this far,” said Shiasia Wiggins, a Lakeland graduate who already has her associate degree and plans to attend Virginia Commonwealth University to study accounting. “It took away some of the memories I would have had that I could look back on and tell my family in the future. But I made the best out of it, and we’re celebrating the best way we can.”Over at Nansemond River High School, graduate Eddie Velez, who plans to go to Old Dominion University for video game design and development, said “I think I liked this maybe more than I would have an actual graduation. … This is short and to the point.”With a great outlook like this, we know Suffolk’s class of 2020 will go far in life.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_48,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Vaccination scrambleVaccination scrambleIt is so disturbing to see our so-called president contort in rage and denial on television every day. All the well-funded efforts by the GOP Giuliani/Trump machine have failed so far in canceling the results of our recent election. So sad to see a nervous collapse in progress. But here is a new tactic they have not yet tried.They must request the U.S. Supreme Court to decree that only native-born U.S. citizens who can prove that they voted for Trump can get vaccinated against COVID-19, and the justices can also allow for voters in error to retrieve their ballots and change their vote. It will be required to present a birth certificate and a certified ballot which shows a vote for Trump.This might result in a great surge of Biden voters who will change their original vote in order to get vaccinated, and — voila — Trump will be saved!Far-fetched, you say? Maybe not, as there may be enough gutless voters around as shown by the rather small margin by which Joe Biden won the election in the first place. I had expected a much larger blue landslide.Adrienne S. DeyHiloKern a bad choiceAlthough Zendo Kern deserves credit for his successful business and his contributions to the community as a volunteer, he does not appear to be the right choice for planning director.He does not have experience in a government planning position, as required by our county charter. He would also be hampered in fulfilling director duties by the need to recuse himself from making decisions on a number of projects that he assisted through his business. In addition, he donated $2,700 to Mitch Roth’s campaign. This may pass muster with the Ethics Board, but casts a cloud over his appointment.Mr. Kern has worked on projects that would negatively impact the community. One is Royal Kona Village, which recently sparked community concerns about traffic, school capacity, water needs and archaeological sites.Another is the Hickey request for an after-the-fact permit to host weddings on agricultural land, in September 2020. The Planning Department did not support the proposal because of concerns about noise and light pollution; safety with visitor, staff, and truck traffic; inappropriate use of agricultural land; and nonconformance with the General Plan and Kona Community Development Plan.Another dubious project is Fairview in Kona, which proposed a 40-room lodge on agricultural land in August 2020. A dozen testifiers opposed the project. The Planning Department did not support the proposal because of concerns about noise; safety with visitor, staff and truck traffic; invasive species; lack of water and wastewater infrastructure; and inappropriate use of agricultural land.I urge Mayor Roth and the County Council to consider other names for planning director.Martha “Cory” HardenHilo"
minnpost_2020_158,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Hitler took power in Germany in January 1933. From the very beginning, Jews were targeted with policies and local, regional, and federal laws to restrict their rights in every sphere of life. They were denied access to schools, hospitals, libraries, and other public services; to the practice of their professions; to having any items of value but especially radios, the link to the outside world; to sitting on park benches, riding on trams and bicycles, shopping at stores for food, and owning property.In 1935 Jews in Germany were stripped of their German citizenship, their last hope for legal protection of their rights.And then came Nov. 9 and 10, 1938, a brutal turning point. Paramilitary troops and ordinary people took to the streets in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia in unprecedented violence against Jews. The actions were organized by the Nazi leadership, Hitler Youth, and by the SA, the Stormtroopers. Members of the various units wore civilian clothes to operate under the fiction that this was a spontaneous expression of public outrage.The rioters burned hundreds of synagogues – and the synagogues burned in full view of firefighters, who had orders to intervene only if the flames spread to nearby buildings. Rioters shattered shop windows and looted more than 7,500 Jewish-owned businesses. The shards of glass that filled the streets gave the devastation the nameKristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Jewish cemeteries were desecrated and women were raped.And more than 30,000 Jewish men were rounded up and incarcerated in Dachau, Buchenwald, and other concentration camps.This wave of terror was covered by newspapers all over the globe. According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, “No other story about the persecution of the Jews received such widespread and sustained attention from the American press at any other time during the Nazi era.”Yet nobody intervened.Nobodylooked at the maelstrom of hate that was building against the Jews and cried STOP! There were no military, political, diplomatic, or economic actions against Germany.Nazi leadership gathered in 1942 at Wannsee, a Berlin suburb, and planned the “final solution to the Jewish question.” The goal was to create a Europe that wasJudenfrei, free of Jews, to be achieved by rounding up and deporting Jews to ghettos and then transporting them to their deaths at extermination sites.Beginning in 1938, cities and regions throughout German-occupied Europe proudly and publicly announced when they becameJudenfrei.Some examples:We know the ending of the story: 6 million Jews were exterminated, simply because of who they were.A few months ago, I read with horror that cities in Poland were posting signs declaring that they were “Gay-free.” Nearly 100 Polish municipalities now boast that designation,a newspaper distributed stickers with the same slogan and a crossed-out Pride flag, and participants at a Pride march in the city of Białystok were pelted with stones and bottles by nationalists and far-right groups.This is shocking on two counts. First, the six concentration camps used exclusively for extermination during the Holocaust, including Auschwitz, were all located in German-occupied Poland. That a country with a history that includes the presence of the Holocaust’s worst horrors is again the site of hatred against a vulnerable group is almost unimaginable.Second, the slogan of ‘Gay-free’ and its resonance toJudenfreiis terrifying, given our awareness of the historical consequences of the hate and dehumanization in making cities free of Jews.Attacking the LGBTQ community played a major role in Poland’s right-wing president, Andrzej Duda, July re-election to a second five-year term. He has demonized that population, claiming that they are “worse than communism,” which Poland endured from 1945-1989.What has been the global response to “Gay-free cities”Like the United States, Poland is a deeply divided country; 49% of the population voted against Duda in the July election. The homophobia and hate have energized the LGBTQ community and its supporters throughout Poland and abroad.The European Union has cut off funding to six of the “gay-free” municipalities. The “twinning” city of Fermoy, Ireland, has canceled its connection toNowa Dębain southeast Poland.But this hasn’t stopped the hate from spreading. Duda has capitalized on a right-wing movement that supports a Poland with no Jews, no Muslims, and no gays.Antisemitism is seeing a resurgence. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL recently conducted a survey of Poles’ attitudes towards Jews. Fully 48% of Poles, or 15 million people, hold antisemitic views. At least 79% of Poles believe that the Holocaust did not happen. Among the 21% who do believe that the Holocaust was, in fact, an actual occurrence, they maintain that the number of Jews who died is greatly exaggerated.Duda did not win only on an anti-LGBTQ platform; he rallied people with appeals to antisemitism.Fully 10% of Poland’s pre-war population was Jewish, or nearly 3.5 million Jews. More than 90% were murdered in the Holocaust. The Nazis seized their property, which was later nationalized by the Polish communists after the war. The Polish economy has benefited significantly.Poland is the only EU country that has not legislated on and supported property restitution.Duda’s opponent promised to address this issue, and Duda claimed that his opponent would sell Poland out to the international Jewish community and take money from Polish families to pay “Jewish interests.”This is the rhetoric in Poland today: gay-free in a place that, 75 years ago, nearly became completely Jew-free.Anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-Jew.Who will be nextWorld Without Genocide will host a webinar on Tuesday, Nov. 17, from 7 to 9 p.m. CST, “From the Nazis’ Jew-Free Cities to Poland’s Gay-Free Cities Today: The Spread of Hate.” The program is open to the public.

minnpost_2020_87,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Police departments that get more equipment from the militarykill more civiliansthan departments that get less military gear. That’s the finding from research on a federal program that has operated since 1997 that I have helped conduct as a scholar of police militarization.That finding was recentlyconfirmed and expanded by Edward Lawson Jr.at the University of South Carolina.This federal effort is called the “1033 Program.” It’s named after the section of the1997 National Defense Authorization Actthat allows the U.S. Defense Department togive police agenciesaround the country equipment, including weapons and ammunition, that the military no longer needs.Much of the equipment isbrand newand some is innocuous – like file cabinets and fax machines. But the program has also equipped local police witharmored vehicles and helicopters, as well as weapons meant to be used against people, like bayonets, automatic rifles and grenade launchers used to deploy tear gas.The seeds of this program came in 1988 as the Cold War was ending. The military was shrinking, while police were feeling overwhelmed fighting the drug war. Aprovision in the National Defense Authorization Actallowed military surplus to be distributed to state and federal agencies combating drugs. In 1997, the program was expanded to include all law enforcement agencies –including school districts. That additional eligibility led to a dramatic expansion in the program, and over the past 23 years police all across America received billions of dollars in military-grade hardware oftendesigned specifically to fight in the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq.And yet, all that equipment has done more harm than good. Militarization of policedoesn’t reduce crime or improve officer safety– but it does make civilians less trusting of the police, with good reason.In our study, my coauthors and I found that the police agencies whoreceived the most military gearhad, in the year after getting the equipment, arate of civilian killings more than doublethat of police departments that had received the least amount of military equipment through the 1033 Program. While data limitations limited our analysis to four states, our findings were replicated withnationwide data.Federal records of how muchmilitary gear has actually been givento local police areinconsistent, poorly maintained and sometimes missing altogether. But between 2006 and 2014, the available records reveal thatmore than $1.4 billion worth of equipment was distributed. While the 1033 Program is the most significant source of military gear for police in general, it is not the only source of military equipment for police: There are other similar federal and state grant programs, and many big-city police departments havemassive equipment budgetsof their own with which they can purchase military-grade hardware.Together, research has shown, those influences leadpolice to emphasize the use of forceto solve problems they encounter in the community. The equipment comes at no cost to the departments, but they have to pay to maintain it, which can bevery expensive. To justify the costs, and help defray them, police often use the gear to serve search warrants targeting drug crimes. That can make the departmentseligible for additional federal grants– and for ashare of the valueof any property and money seized during drug raids.As a result, supposedly free weapons and vehicles can lead some police to use aggressive deployment strategies that make civilian casualties more likely. Other departments mayalready have a military-style mindsetand are taking advantage of an opportunity to stockpile more equipment.These increasingly aggressive deployment strategies of militarized police disproportionately harm communities of color, for instance in Maryland, whereSWAT raids consistently target majority-Black neighborhoods.While police often claim that militarized gear is a necessity in order to prepare for “worst-case scenarios,” there is ample evidence that receiving agencies use military gear in inappropriate situations. While the killing ofBlack EMT Breonna Taylorin her home in March grabbed headlines, she is but one ofmany civilianskilled by policeunderquestionablecircumstancesduring no-knock raids, when police force entry into a building or home without announcing themselves.For obvious reasons, such raids carry an unreasonably high probability of death in acountry with more guns than people. These and other overaggressive deployments are the direct result of public policy that gives militarized gear to local police, with little training or oversight.In our research, we don’t make any determination of whether specific killings by police were justified or not. In our view, too often the question of legal justificationtakes a very narrow look at the few seconds just prior to a lethal interaction. We believe that a wider perspective is useful: Local, state and federal rules and training influence the behavior of police agencies across the country. When policing strategies are overly aggressive, an increase in civilian casualties tends to follow. While the resulting killings are often called “justified,” they’re more often the avoidable result of policy decisions made well before the incident in question.Casey Delehanty, Ph.D., is an assistant professor of global studies atGardner-Webb University.This articleis republished fromThe Conversation."
suffolknewsherald_2020_121,"Published 10:24 pm Friday, May 22, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieMother’s Day is always a time of special reflection. I think this year, the day served as much of a saving grace. It afforded us a much needed shift in conversations. I dare say that our contemplations and celebrations for Mother’s Day inspired some revelations that are necessary for enduring these challenging times.Mothers really learn something about change as they are nesting an unborn human within their womb. They know well the process of change and how changes can be beautiful.An older woman and I were sharing stories of how we learned the gender of our children while they were in the womb. Her husband was adamant with all three of their children that he did not wish to know the sex of the child before the birth. He said, “if God had intended for you to know what was going on in there, He would have placed a window on your stomach.” It is a hilarious statement. Yet, it makes a great point about how God prepares mothers to leave the results to Him and keep our focus on the process.While the child is in the womb, doctors and resources provide information for pregnant mothers that empower us to manage the changes in our body, changes in our environment and the change the infant will bring to our lives. Yet, we cannot see what is going on inside of us. We have no idea what is going to happen at the moment of birth. Of course, we have our ideal pictures of what that will look like and we can dream. As we wait to meet our little girl or boy, we have the role of managing the process to the best of our ability.Everything that we do in life is a process. Nothing is instant. Real maturity takes place when we learn to focus our attention on processes rather than the end result.I read a blog post recently about a mother who began running to help her process her thoughts. Weight loss became an unintended result of this new discipline. When she began making estimates of how much she needed to run to possibly reach a weight loss goal, the running became less fun for her. It was good to have the target, but she lost focus on what was getting her to her goal.Life is a process of becoming.My daughter recently said to me, “Mom, isn’t it crazy how our lives don’t always turn out the way we think they will?” I responded, “No, that it is not crazy. That is the beauty of seeing our development over time.” Someone said that we are all works in progress. I would further say that we are all becomers in process. The growth process is a series of changes that occur naturally or normally.Everyone wants to get back to what we used to call “normal.” We may have our desires for what the end will be. But our role right now is really to do our best to manage the process. In doing so well, we will achieve a good end. The changes have not been comfortable, but neither were the kicks of an unborn child. The changes were not what we could control, but neither was the emergency C-section that saved the life of your son who was being strangled by his umbilical cord. Mothers have taught us how to willfully and gracefully submit to change and allow changes to teach us a few things. Let’s pray for our commitment to the process in all of this.Here’s to mothers who are the champions of this unprecedented season. Your ability to accept change as beautiful is helping us all to endure the process.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of Nonprofit Leadership and Management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

suffolknewsherald_2020_75,"Published 9:38 pm Tuesday, June 23, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceTelevision reality series “Survivor” completed its 40th season recently. The show premiered in 2000 when 16 Americans were dropped off on a deserted island near the coast of Borneo with a simple yet complex concept.The 16 “castaways” would work together to survive on the island with very limited supplies. They would also vote one person out of the game every few days, using a majority rules method, until there are only two players remaining. At that point, the contestants voted out of the game would choose one of the final two players to win the game by voting for the one they felt best played the game. The winner would be named Sole Survivor and claim the $1 million prize.The show has evolved and changed over the years, but the goal remains the same. Contestants must vote out their fellow players before they get voted out themselves. There are many players at the start of the game, but only one person wins the prize.It’s a strategy game unlike anything else, and it makes for a fascinating show. Watching contestants try to figure out how to vote out their fellow players while still causing those fellow players to vote for them to win the game has kept me glued to the screen. I’ve watched every episode for 20 years.There are some parallels between “Survivor” and real life. The contestants must work together to build a shelter, start a fire, find food, and create a society in which they live until the end of the show. Likewise, we have all been placed on this island we call earth, and we must learn to live together if we wish to survive.The part of “Survivor” that doesn’t translate well into real life is the focus on voting out one player at a time with the goal of becoming the sole survivor at the end of the game.Unfortunately, there are times we treat each other as if there can only be one winner among us. We form alliances and strategize against those who we feel can’t help us climb to the top of our “tribe.”We spend too much time working against each other instead of working together to build a better place in which we all can live.How much better would our country be if we spent as much time trying to support and encourage each other as we do trying to get ourselves to the top of the ladder?How would our current situation change if we spent time trying to learn from each other, encouraging thoughtful dialogue, instead of entrenching ourselves with our allies?It’s time for us to realize that life is not a giant game of “Survivor.” There isn’t one winner. We don’t have to “vote someone out” for us to stay in the game. We can, and should, work together to make things better for all of us.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_91,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I recently lost a close friend to cancer. We became friends as teenagers in the mid-1990s and went to high school and college together. Our upbringing couldn’t have been more different. I grew up in what would become Michele Bachmann country while he grew up in Wellstone country. My parents came to the U.S. from India in the 1970s and his family had been a part of the Twin Cities for generations. Despite these differences, we developed a common bond as students that came, in part, from a mutual appreciation of rebellion. In history class my friend loved topics about the protests of the 1960s, counterculture, and Vietnam while I was obsessed with Malcolm X and historical insurgences against colonization. We were very close to the point where my parents would often refer to him as my sibling.Eventually, I attended grad school at Oxford and spent a lot of time traveling through the Balkans. I quickly realized that very spirit of rebellion that brought my friend and me together as adolescents very much extends into the rest of the world. Beyond national history, the proof exists in the past of the multitude of religions that are both so adequately represented in the Twin Cities and on a larger scale, Central Europe. So many of the stories of perseverance from the region during the Yugoslavian war or both World Wars stem from these religious mythologies. Christianity was created out of a movement against a colonizing force in The Levant and resulting exploitation of the local population in Jerusalem. Islam’s roots came from a drive to counter corruption and exploitation stemming from the elites of the tribal societies within the Arabian Peninsula. Judaism’s history is filled with stories of rebellion in the midst of persecution. While many have discussed the role that religion played in dividing people in Central Europe, many forget that persecuted communities also called upon these stories of rebellion to endure.Since my travels, my career has focused on helping people understand the benefits of using technology as a proxy for physical experiences. For example, mobile banking took off in rural Africa partially because of the challenges farmers faced in physically getting to banks. Telehealth has removed the need to physically visit the doctor for every ailment. Dating apps have become one of the most predominant ways to meet people.If 25 years ago, two kids in Minnesota whose upbringing couldn’t have been more different could create a sibling-like bond due to shared rebellious instincts, certainly the mitigation of the physical geography due to technology is also bringing together similar people, but at a global level. The proof points are already manifesting. The world is marching in unison through a common Black Lives Matter banner. Statues are being toppled.The fact that this protest has spread with so much fervor from a mid-size city in the United States seems to be due in part to a shared digital experience that transcends a simplistic narrative. The Black Lives Matter protests are just the latest in worldwide frustrations from a generation that has been negatively impacted by two to three economic catastrophes. This generation also organized around last year’s Youth Strike for Climate and the 2017 Women’s March.Recently, some people have been quick to dismiss this phenomenon as “cancel culture” or “woke-ism,” which seems like a nonsensically simplistic explanation given the fact that there are literally paintings of George Floyd on bombed-out buildings in rural Syria.There is a risk in over-simplifying these narratives. A few days before the shooting of protesters at Kent State, President Richard Nixon labeled anti-war demonstrators communists. Three years before the failed coup d’état in Turkey in 2016, protesters fighting against economic and cultural policies were labeled looters by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Rebellion is part of our collective past. Understanding this history helps us understand the weaknesses of the status quo at the time of dissent. By minimizing what is bringing together people across the globe in rebellion, we are missing an opportunity to critique today.Essentially then, the very people who proclaim to be protecting history and its symbols seem to be ignoring the fact that there are people coming together in ways that were never before possible and as a result, there are lessons to be learned from the very history that is being made today.Zameer Baber grew up in Blaine, MN and attended high school in St. Paul.

philinquirer_2020_11,"The democracy envisioned by our founders—one with universal, tax-supported schooling at its core—hangs in the balance.The future of public education is on the ballot this year.Unfortunately, most voters aren’t aware of this. The pandemic has displaced school funding and teacher pay as critical issues —issues critical enough in 2018 and 2019 to fuel massive protests across the country. Many families are focused solely on the immediate questions of when and how their children will physically return to school. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has drawn schools into his culture war,claiming that young people are being taught to hate America and demanding what he calls “patriotic education.”Behind the crisis and Trump’s distractions, however, is a simple truth: Rather than working to improve public education, his administration has waged a full-frontal assault on it. And four more years will have devastating consequences forthe nearly 90% of American children who attend public schools— children of both Republicans and Democrats.» READ MORE:chool choice and the fight for public education’s soul | EditorialWhen Trump selected Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, many took it as a sign that he wasn’t serious. After all, DeVos seemed to know little about public schools. But that was a product of her extremism. Over the last four years,she has been crystal clear that her primary interest in the public education system lies in dismantling it. For evidence, look no further thanher proposed Education Freedom Scholarships plan, which would redirect $5 billion in taxpayer dollars to private schools.Unmaking public education is a long-standing goal of libertarians and the religious right. Conservative economist Milton Friedman conceived of private school vouchers in 1955, and four decades later was still making the case for “a transition from a government to a market system.As they see it, public education is a tax burden on the wealthy, an obstacle to religious instruction, and a hotbed for unionism. Rather than a public system controlled by democratic values, they’d prefer a private one governed by the free market. If they had their way, schools would operate like a welfare program for the poor while the rich would get the best education money could buy. The result would be entrenched inequality and even more concentrated segregation than now exists.This extreme view has never caught on, largely because public education is a bedrock American institution. Many states created public education systems before the nation even existed. Massachusetts, for instance, was educating children in public schools long before tea was dumped in Boston Harbor. In 1787, the federal government explicitly mandated that the center plot of land in every new town in the territories — land that would become states like Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois — be reserved for schools, and that other plots be used to support those schools. After the Civil War, Congressdoubled down on that commitment, requiring readmitted Confederate states, and all new states, to guarantee access to public education in their constitutions. In each of these foundational periods, leaders positioned public education at the very center of our democratic project.The founders and their successors recognized that public education is essential to citizens ability to govern themselves, not to mention protect themselves from charlatans and demagogues. Public education is the surest guarantee of individual liberty, the founders understood — no less essential than a well-trained army to the survival of the nation. That’s why they recognized that the education of American citizens couldn’t be left to chance.Public education could have evolved in a very different manner, with the wealthy paying to educate their own kids, while the poor relied on charity. Indeed, so-called “pauper schools” existed prior to the advent of universal tax-supported education. But this approach had major flaws — low-quality opportunities, stigma, and financial instability. Horace Mann, the leader of the “common school” movement, understood that public education could only succeed if it was high-quality, if it educated all children together, and if the burden and benefit of taxation were shared by the entire community.» READ MORE:If charter schools help kids of color, why aren’t the Democrats more supportive? | OpinionDemocrats and Republicans have long disagreed about the particulars of education policy. But until the recent past, support for public schools was firmly bipartisan. This was true at the state level, as well as at the federal level. But that has changed in recent years. In states likeArizona,Florida,Indiana, andOhio, Republican lawmakers have embraced controversial school voucher programs over the objection of their own constituents. And at the federal level,Betsy DeVoshas — contrary to what most Republican voters want — advanced a radical effort to dismantle public education.As the election approaches, the Trump campaign is vulnerable on education. While his supporters may agree with some of his positions, they also like their public schools and the role those schools play in their communities —particularly in rural areas. They believe that education should be adequately funded and open to all, and thatteachers should make a decent living. They know that an educated populace has long been the backbone of America’s democracy, as well as its economy. These are American beliefs, red and blue.We are here to sound an alarm to Republicans and Democrats. The future of our nation’s public schools is at stake. And insofar as that is the case, the democracy envisioned by our founders — one with universal, tax-supported schooling at its core — hangs in the balance.Jack Schneider and Jennifer Berkshire are the authors of“A Wolf at the Schoolhouse Door: The Dismantling of Public Education and the Future of School.Derek Black is the author of“Schoolhouse Burning: Public Education and the Assault on American Democracy.”.

Donald McEachinIt is the holiday season, and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a blessed and peaceful holiday, whatever you celebrate. I would caution everyone that the pandemic is still spreading, so please, wear a mask, social distance and wash your hands frequently as you enjoy your holidays. The end is in sight with the exciting news about two vaccines. I understand we are all tired, stressed and anxious, but we should follow public health advice and soon those vaccines will improve our lives significantly.With the rate of COVID worsening, my staff is still working remotely. Please know if you have any issue with a federal agency from a missing passport to a lost tax return to misplaced benefits, please go to my website, mceachin.house.gov, and one of my very able constituent services representatives will get back to you with assistance.This month my office initiated a new program — annually, we will be naming a Veteran of the Year from our congressional district. Our veterans have risked their lives to keep our country safe and free, and we owe them lifelong respect and gratitude. Many of our veterans return from their service and find other ways to improve our communities, so we are excited to shout someone out when we can. This year’s honoree, our very first one, is Dr. Harold Sayles of Henrico. Dr. Sayles served in Operation Urgent Fury-Grenada and Operation Desert Storm. He received, among other commendations, the Bronze Star for Valor and the Legion of Merit. As a veteran, he has received national recognition for his work with the Veterans of Foreign Wars and is on the Suicide Prevention Task Force for veterans for the VFW’s Southern Conference. He is post commander for the American Legion in Richmond among other volunteer activities.Professionally, Dr. Sayles serves as the executive director of the Crater District Area Agency on Aging and is an associate pastor of Rising Mount Zion Baptist Church in Henrico. We thank Dr. Sayles for his ongoing service to our communities.Last month, with one of my House colleagues, I introduced the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2020, legislation to protect children in federally assisted housing from dangerous lead exposure and poisoning. The legislation would adopt federal prevention measures, including comprehensive risk assessments, to determine the presence of lead hazards.While the incidence of lead poisoning in children has diminished, current federal regulations are still inadequate. No child should be put at risk of lead poisoning, which often requires long-term medical treatment and special education services, because some impacts can cause permanent damage.The legislation would specifically require landlords to disclose and control lead hazards if found in the home, as well as provide notice to tenants about their rights. It would also provide a process for families to relocate on an emergency basis, without penalty or the loss of assistance, if a lead hazard is identified in the home and the landlord fails to control the hazard within 30 days of being notified of the presence of lead. I look forward to advocating for this policy as it moves throughout the legislative process.Congressman A.

minnpost_2020_29,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“They” claim that voter fraud will be rampant this fall,with the dramatic increase in absentee ballots.Among others, theBrennan Center for Justice debunks this claim.As of Primary Election Day in Minnesota, there were almost 645,000 applications for absentee ballots requested. Of these, so far, more than 500,000 ballots have been accepted,according to the Star Tribune.The best evidence concerning whether voter fraud exists comes from states that have been using mail-in voting exclusively. The New York Times reported that, “In eight states and Washington, D.C.,every registered voter will be mailed a ballot ahead of the election. California, D.C. and Vermont will do this for the first time this fall.”Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washingtonnow have all-mail elections.There have been only ahandful of fraudulent votesin these states, certainly not enough to affect an election outcome.In2016, incidents of voter fraud were“next to none”out of more than 137 million votes.For example, in Colorado,there were 30 cases of alleged voter fraud(including in-person voting from 2005 to 2018, according to the Brookings Institution. This was out of a total of 15,955,704 total votes cast, or 0.00019%. In Hawaii, the rate was 0.00003% from 1982 to 2016.Despite these facts, President Donald Trump convened a panel on voter fraud, but disbanded it afterit found no real evidence of voter fraud.Nevertheless, it is imperative that all necessary steps be taken to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, in order to achieve the necessary credibility that this year’s election requires. Secretaries of state throughout the country have established mail-in voting procedures designed to eliminate fraud. Each step of the mail-in voting process addresses the possibility of fraud.This is particularly true in Minnesota. Minnesota does not automatically send a ballot to every registered voter. Here, one must firstapply for an absentee (mail-in ballot,even if he or she is registered. A voter can apply for an absentee ballot without being registered, but must simultaneously submit a voter registration application. The address of registration must match the absentee ballot application address (or a new voter registration must be submitted . If, for example, a voter is registered at one address, and has moved since he or she last voted, a new registration must be filed. Any application for a mail-in ballot must clear this hurdle.If a voter is uncomfortable with voting by mail for whatever reason, that voter can still vote in person. Of course, in Minnesota, one can go to the polls on Election Day, as has been true from the beginning. Onsite registration is available if the voter does not appear on the rolls of the precinct where he or she appears to vote. In order to register, one must prove one’s current address. This can be done by state-issued identification (driver’s license or identification card . But it can also be proved by mail to the voter’s address, e.g. a utility bill. And, finally, someone with personal knowledge can vouch for the voter.In addition, early voting can be done in person at the local election office. “You can vote in person at yourcounty election office…. S omecities and towns offer in-person absentee voting,” according to Minnesota’ssecretary of statewebsite. For this year’s general election, the first day to vote is Sept. 18.The issue of double voting is also frequently raised. However, if a voter has already voted absentee, the roster provided to the election judges at the polling place will bemarked with “A.B.,”indicating the voter has already voted.Similarly, if someone has already voted absentee, but does not appear on the registration rolls, the election judges consult a list of those who registered via the absentee ballot process to ensure no duplicate votes are cast.All the evidence points to very little potential for voter fraud. And procedures are in place to eliminate this potential. While it is every voter’s duty to vote, and ensure the accuracy and completion of his or her vote, existing infrastructure minimizes the possibility of fraud.The white noise about voter fraud is little more than fear mongering. Don’t be scared off. Whether you choose to vote by mail or in person, you can make sure your vote is received and counted.Ronald Goldser, of Eagan, is the vice chair of DFL Senate District 51 (Eagan/Burnsville ."

suffolknewsherald_2020_22,"Published 4:59 pm Tuesday, August 11, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceHe rolled the bowling ball down the lane, but the ball curved to the right, hitting only three out of the 10 pins. “This is stupid!” he said loudly. “I never win at anything!”I know games such as bowling can be frustrating, so I let him stew for a moment while he waited for the ball to be returned. He rolled again, and the ball went in the same direction as his previous throw, knocking down only one additional pin. He sulked back to his seat, aggravated and angry.A minute later, it was his turn again. He grabbed the ball and threw it carelessly down the lane. “I don’t even care anymore,” he stated emphatically. I stopped the game for a moment so we could talk.Children, like most adults, like to do well in — and win — the games they play. This desire can lead to them becoming frustrated or angry if they are losing or if things aren’t going as well as they had hoped. When moments like these occur, we have the opportunity to teach our children how to be a courteous competitor.We should begin by empathizing with their frustration. Some of us are more competitive than others, but we’ve all had times when we were frustrated about things or upset when things didn’t go our way. It’s important to remember that they are still growing up and learning how to understand and handle their emotions.Children can get very involved in the games they play, and, for some, it is the most important thing in the world at that moment. When we notice children becoming upset over a game, we can remind them of the purpose of the game. Taking a brief pause from the game to remind them that they are playing to have fun, that the outcome of the game doesn’t have any consequences, and that sometimes you win and sometimes you lose can help them calm their upset emotions and refocus on enjoying the game.There may be times when a more direct approach is needed about what is allowed and what is not allowed. “I know you’re frustrated and upset that you’re losing. It’s OK to be frustrated, but it’s not OK to throw the game piece across the room.” Statements like this let them know what is acceptable behavior and unacceptable behavior when they are playing a game. It acknowledges and allows their emotions while setting rules for their behavior. Set your expectations and follow through with consequences for poor behavior or praise for good behavior.It’s OK for kids to be happy when they win or upset when they lose, but it’s important for them to understand how to be a good winner and a good loser. Teaching them now how to be good sports can help them understand and control their emotions later in life and perhaps even allow them to enjoy more the games they play today.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_119,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .June is Homeownership Month and it cannot be missed that Minnesota has one of the highest homeownership rates in the nation. For white households. And one of the worst racial disparities in the nation with black households owning homes at 26%. This has beenwell documentedand discussed, as leaders have prioritized this conversation. A statewidescorecardwas launched earlier this year to keep track of our progress on these very issues so the talking turns into action, and yet we have not improved this gap. In some areas, we’re seeing the issue worsen as home prices increase and wages remain stagnant.A fewarticleshave begun to highlight the connection between systemic racism and affordable housing, even affordable homeownership. Affordable homeownership advocates have known this for decades; it is one of the key reasons for our work. We know it is true that affordable homeownership has been out of reach for communities of color, and we know it is true that our state (and many others have used racist policies to keep it out of reach. TheMapping Prejudiceproject has been recording these intentional efforts and continues to find more through deed restrictions and covenants.In an attempt to solve these inequities, we’ve focused on financial literacy training, coaching and goal-setting programs, social service supports, homebuyer education … and many other things that are designed to educate, empower, support and lead to success in homeownership. These are all good things – knowledge is power and an informed, educated consumer is more successful in the market. Housing and financial counseling and coaching are valuable and important tools – but they are not enough. If they were, this opportunity gap would be closing, and it is not.Even if our lending partners offer new products that are also safe for consumers, we still have a supply problem. The median sales prices in April for a Twin Cities home is $315,000, with the average sales price for the state reaching $305,000 according to theMinnesota Realtors ® April Housing Statistics report. Basic economics will tell you that to decrease price, we must increase supply. Developers, funders, and communities need to come together to increase the number of affordable homeownership opportunities created in our communities.In special session, our legislators should focus on a bonding package — one that includes housing infrastructure bonds with an expanded use for single-family affordable homeownership development. As they consider what supports our economy will need post-COVID, we need our state to invest in resources that keep people in their homes – funding for foreclosure prevention counseling, grant programs for homeowners to cover missed mortgage payments, and deeper investments in homeownership production.Now and going forward, we must center increasing access for Black, Indigenous and communities of color when making policy and funding decisions regarding affordable homeownership preparation, production and preservation. Philanthropic and public partners must support increasing supply through production, along with supporting down-payment assistance funding and housing counseling programs. These programs have worked before; when combined with an increase in supply, we can increase access and opportunity.We need to continue to invest in these resources and tools, while also looking at the homeownership system and what changes need to be made as we work toward creating a more equitable housing market.Cristen Incitti is the executive director ofHabitat for Humanity of Minnesota(@HabitatMN .

minnpost_2020_230,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Unfortunately, this is not the reality. The newest and loudest critique has been flung by none other than our country’s president, who recently offered his thoughts on the way history is taught in schools. President Donald Trump would like you to believe that he is not only the greatest president of all time, but he is also a budding historian, expert curriculum writer,child-welfare advocate, and protector of the way things used to be. Spoiler alert: He is not. Trump is not a fan of critical thinking. He is not a fan of calm, rationale discussions. He is a fear peddler, and while he would like to sell you on the idea that we should fear teachers, it is Trump who is actually scared of teachers and their students. He is scared of teachers who think for themselves and gravitate toward new research-based curricular topics that shed light on historically marginalized voices, perspectives, and events.As a former elementary and middle-school teacher and current elementary education lecturer at the University of Minnesota, who coordinates elementary social studies instruction, I have seen how incredible teachers can be, day in and day out. Most teachers are naturally inquisitive people, who are never satisfied with simply teaching what has always been taught. Trump, however, would like you to believe that teachers are political actors, utilizing deceitful and dogmatic beliefs to indoctrinate your child. According to Trump, “the left has warped, distorted, and defiled the American story with deceptions, falsehoods, and lies.”One of these lies Trump would like you to believe is that curriculum like the 1619 Project is propaganda akin to Black Lives Matter. The truth is, Black lives do matter, and not because other lives don’t matter — of course they do. Black lives matter is a message of protest and affirmation because for more than 400 years, our country, its leaders and its laws have made it clear that they do not matter. They did not matter when they were forced into slavery, hung by a rope, killed by the KKK, beaten by dogs, denied the right to vote, red lined out of a home, and had their last breath taken away by a police officer. You tell me how these are “deceptions, falsehoods, and lies.” This is our country’s history, all of it, and we cannot continue to deny students the right to learn it all by calling this type of teaching indoctrination.I have been fortunate to work with teachers from all around this country. I have taught in public schools, private schools, and charter schools. I have taught in large cities, suburbs, and in rural communities. I have taught in schools where the majority of students were African American, Somali, white, and Hispanic, and in schools with a diverse mix of students. I have taught with colleagues who were new to the profession, as well as colleagues who had been teaching for decades. In all of my experiences with teachers, I haveneverencountered a single colleague who wanted to indoctrinate their students. In reality, teachers are focused on helping students to think critically for themselves.What Trump fails to realize is that at our core, teachers believe students are innate learners, with the capacity to learn new and complex information that is both challenging and contradictory. In railing against theNew York Times’ 1619 project, which delves into our country’s racist past and present, Trump misses the point entirely. This research-based, award-winning set of essays, turned curriculum, is not a “Marxist doctrine,” but an evolution into how Americans need to reckon with our collective past. While Trump wishes to believe “America’s founding set in motion the unstoppable chain of events that abolished slavery and secured civil rights,” he is wrong. If we continue to teach students that the story of America is a story of progress and prosperity for all, we will continue to silence the truth, and perpetuate the horrific injustices that have plagued this country since the founding.In my current work, I have the fortune of working alongside aspiring teachers, as they work toward their Elementary Education Teacher License. As part of this work, I teach their social studies methods course. I believe it is important that elementary teachers be familiar with content and concepts and be able assess instructional resources in order to use the most worthwhile ones to support their students’ progress toward major social studies topics. It is equally, if not more important, that elementary teachers also provide opportunities for their students to experience differences; be exposed to challenging, perspective-opening ideas; learn to see the value in all people; and gain the freedom to make their own choices. In teaching social studies methods, I try to demonstrate and provide opportunities for classroom culture building, where relationships are fostered, individuals are celebrated, and at times, where things get heated and emotions run high.Educators have a responsibility to create opportunities for all students to learn, feel challenged, grow, and be successful in whatever future they choose. This work does not take place in a vacuum, devoid of context, and separated from reality. If Trump is sincere in his desire for American schoolchildren to be given a “patriotic education” then he needs to understand real patriotism does not come from blind loyalties, ignorant beliefs, and selfish actions. Real patriotism comes from knowing you do not live in a perfect country whereprosperity has been fair and equal from the beginning, but that instead, patriotism comes from the celebration of differences, the desire to support your neighbor, and from our collective capacity to learn from our past.The greatness of our country does not come from our ability to boast the loudest, but from our ability to acknowledge our faults and to be better, to do better, and to live better.Jeff Henning-Smith, Ph.D., is a lecturer in elementary social studies educationat the University of Minnesota."
philinquirer_2020_46,"Non-medical switching leaves Pa. residents with chronic health conditions at risk.To respond to the coronavirus, our state legislators have made millions of dollars available for relief efforts and issued sweeping mandates to support social distancing, demonstrating their will to take bold action to protect the health of Pennsylvanians.And yet – it remains legal in Pennsylvania for health insurers to alter a patient’s coverage in the middle of the plan year, leaving those who are locked into their policies with nowhere to turn for help during one of the most challenging moments in our nation’s recent history.This dangerous and little-known practice is called non-medical switching, and Pennsylvania lawmakers have not yet acted to address it, despite the fact that it can have serious implications for patients. I know this firsthand, because when my insurer tried to non-medically switch me, I nearly lost access to the only medication that helps me manage my rheumatoid arthritis.» READ MORE:I lost my health insurance when I got laid off during the pandemic. How can I get coverage?That is why I am calling on the state legislature to sendHouse Bill 853, which will end non-medical switching in Pennsylvania and protect patients’ access to their prescriptions, to Governor Wolf’s desk for his signature.More than ten years ago, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA , an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes severe swelling and pain in my joints and also affects my eyes, heart, and lungs. Because of my condition, I had to retire early and give up hobbies I loved, including swimming, biking, and competing in triathlons. Living in constant pain took a toll on my mental and emotional health as well. I have experienced increased anxiety and depression because of what’s happening to my body.It took years of work with my doctor to find a medicine that reduced my pain and allowed me to lead a normal life, and the prescription that my doctor chose is the only thing that limits the pain caused by my RA.My story is not unique. For many patients with a chronic condition, finding a treatment plan that stabilizes their health can require trial and error. RA is the most common form of autoimmune arthritis, affectingmore than 1.3 million Americans, including thousands of our fellow Pennsylvanians.Last year, my insurance company non-medically switched me in a way that blocked access to my prescription. Thankfully, my physician quickly intervened, and I was able to stay on my treatment plan. But others in Pennsylvania with similar chronic health conditions may not be so fortunate.» READ MORE:Q&A: What can I do to limit joint pain from arthritis?Non-medical switching can cause serious health and financial problems. When insurers change their formulary coverage, copay costs can skyrocket without warning, forcing patients to choose between staying on their prescriptions and living within their means. Epilepsy patients who lose access to their medication because of non-medical switching can experience a recurrence of seizures which can threaten their job security and their life. Other patients may have to visit the doctor’s office more frequently, or even the ER.For patients who depend on a medication to keep their health stable, it is frightening to receive a letter that says you have to change your treatment plan or pay more out-of-pocket for your current prescription. It’s even scarier to receive the news that your plan has changed at the pharmacy counter.Like so many Pennsylvanians, I carefully evaluate health plans to pick the one that allows me to afford my treatments. But any insurance company I choose can change its obligation to me on a whim, while I cannot do the same. I live in fear to this day that my benefits could be pulled out from underneath me at any moment, and because of the coronavirus pandemic, I am more afraid than ever of losing coverage for my medication and of unpredictable changes to my budget. It’s upsetting and unethical.House Bill 853 would end this insurance practice once and for all, and it’s time for lawmakers to take it up. This bill is a simple solution to ban non-medical switching that supports Pennsylvanians who rely on certain treatments to manage a chronic health condition – those who are most at risk of the effects of coronavirus.No one should have to worry about their insurance coverage changing at any time – especially people who depend on a prescription to live a normal life, and especially during a global pandemic. If I can’t change my health plan to save money in the middle of the year, insurers shouldn’t be able to either.Tien Sydnor-Campbell is a volunteer patient advocate and member of the Global Healthy Living Foundation’s 50-State Network.

eugeneweekly_2020_3,"We ve got issues. With the passing of John Lewis, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Chadwick Boseman, Kobe Bryant and more, it has felt like a loss of greatness, a loss of connection, like pillars fallen. I don’t know these people, but they were all symbols of something, and it’s different for everyone. Each created tangible change that benefited others. They were consistent, steadfast, focused. With the fires, the relentless smoke, painful loss, devastating genocide, rampant racism and, of course, the consistency of COVID, it’s hard to find strength for the upcoming election. We don’t know what’s happening. The what if’s are almost paralyzing. Fear is at its height, and we all know there’s more to come. This is why the memory of the people we lost this year is critical. It’s critical because they each were a symbol of purpose. Read their stories, not just what we know of them on social media, but who and why they lived their respective lives. Purpose. It’s the hardest thing to understand because there is no set of instructions. It’s the age-old question: What is life all about? In a healthy Black community, Black household, Black friendship, we are taught and challenged that we are here for a very specific purpose. This is how we face relentless racism. This is how we accept the fact that Black people are expected to not only match white expectations of knowledgeable contribution but to be better than our counterparts to even be heard. Our collective reality in this society is with poignant purpose. Our fight is about value and respect. Each person individually and collectively has a purpose, whatever it may be. I want to share the purpose of Black resolve. We are taught that we are not here for others, but by others, of others, to serve within our purpose, each other. An understanding of the greater good is essential. The wellbeing of our families, our men, our children, through doubt, through fear, through violence, through despair. The collective wellbeing as a whole. It requires the acknowledgment of a healthy relationship with change, with grief. We focus on the development of our purpose as if it is our lighthouse in the fog. I lend this piece of perspective to guide us through the fog of 2020. We all have a purpose. It doesn’t have to be grand, it doesn’t have to influence the masses, it doesn’t have to make the news. We just have to get up every day and work for the greater good of ourselves, our families, our neighbors. We have the greater purpose within us. You are needed in this world. We all have a purpose. Your purpose may be to learn; open your ears. Your purpose may be to listen; quiet your mouths. Your purpose may be to grow; accept your opportunities, easy and difficult. When each meaningful effort has the intention of purpose, for the greater good, we will overcome, and we will persevere.

suffolknewsherald_2020_228,"Published 5:47 pm Friday, September 11, 2020ByStaff ReportsSeptember is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, and today wraps up National Suicide Prevention Week.This round of these annual observances come at a unique time. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been hard on everybody emotionally, but some are struggling more than others. The social isolation, hopelessness, overexposure to constant bad news, financial devastation and more that many have experienced due to the pandemic can create a maelstrom that some may find it difficult to escape.There are some ways you can help:Ask: Asking the question “Are you thinking about suicide?” communicates that you’re open to speaking about suicide in a non-judgmental and supportive way. Make sure you take their answers seriously, especially if they indicate they are experiencing thoughts of suicide, but never promise to keep their thoughts of suicide a secret. Listening to their reasons for being in such emotional pain, as well as listening for any potential reasons they want to continue to stay alive, are both incredibly important when they are telling you what’s going on.Be there: This could mean being physically present for someone, speaking with them on the phone when you can, or any other way that shows support for the person at risk. An important aspect of this step is to make sure you follow through with the ways in which you say you’ll be able to support the person — do not commit to anything you are not willing or able to accomplish.Keep them safe: It’s important to find out a few things to establish immediate safety. Have they already done anything to try to kill themselves before talking with you? Does the person experiencing thoughts of suicide know how they would kill themselves? Do they have a specific, detailed plan? What’s the timing for their plan? What sort of access to do they have to their planned method? Knowing the answers to each of these questions can tell a lot about the imminence and severity of danger the person is in. The more steps and pieces of a plan that are in place, the higher their severity of risk and their capability to enact their plan might be. Or if they have immediate access to a firearm and are very serious about attempting suicide, then extra steps (like calling the authorities or driving them to an emergency department might be necessary.Help them connect: Helping someone with thoughts of suicide connect with ongoing supports can help them establish a safety net for those moments they find themselves in a crisis. Additional components of a safety net might be connecting them with supports and resources in their communities.Follow up: After your initial contact with a person experiencing thoughts of suicide, and after you’ve connected them with the immediate support systems they need, make sure to follow-up with them to see how they’re doing. Leave a message, send a text or give them a call. The follow-up step is a great time to check in with them to see if there is more you are capable of helping with or if there are things you’ve said you would do and haven’t yet had the chance to get done for the person.The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-TALK.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

While they varied in their takes on the shutdowns, they all showed the power of language in shaping our attitudes toward the continued pandemic.Starr Restaurantsposted a message of hope: “This is just a temporary setback so that we can make bigger strides forward as a community against the pandemic.” While such statements acquiesce to the restrictions that went into effect Nov. 20, they maintain a strong sense of community.Other businesses met the restrictions with more resistance. Subversus Fitness in Center City took to social media witha letter to the City of Philadelphia: “The immediate focus must be on data-informed efforts to reduce the spread with masks, tracing and distance while also enhancing survivability of infected people” they wrote.

They can only claim that they have zeroknowncases, outbreaks, or exposures.The media saturate viewers with symptoms and clinical discussion around COVID in the same way that sex education classrooms induce fear among students about STIs. At this point in the pandemic, words likespread, transmission, protection, tested, andinfectedcan be numbing. So numbing that there is little awareness of their impact. But the subtle difference between phrases likecasesandknown casesmatters. One projects a certainty we all wish we had right now — when in reality we don’t.We’re uncertain, we’re afraid. Our lives and our livelihoods are at stake. People fear testing positive for COVID in the same vein as they might fear testing positive for herpes. For that reason, many are either not getting tested, or fear disclosing their results or risk factors to their communities due to internalized shame.COVID and herpes simplex virus (HSV are two viruses with different symptoms and potential outcomes. However, there is overlap in how society interprets those who test positive. If you test positive for herpes, society tells you that you must’ve done something wrong. There is an assumption that you either didn’t wear a condom or slept with too many people. If you test positive for COVID, many will assume that you either didn’t wear a mask or didn’t socially distance.» READ MORE:As COVID restrictions resume, Philly restaurant owners are again denied a seat at the table | OpinionCOVID and herpes share in a conversation of ethics and assumed fault as viruses.

suffolknewsherald_2020_101,"Published 5:30 pm Friday, December 11, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieFour days out of the week, you can find me sitting beside my first-grader halfway listening in on his virtual class.You’d be surprised how looking into the window of a first-grade learning environment creates interesting musings. I sit there mostly for my own convenience, because I need to know what he is assigned to do, and because without me sitting there, he lacks the discipline to sit and pay attention.Recently, they were given a research assignment in which they could select any animal to use for a writing topic. Mrs. Mary Coombs showed the children a video presentation that must have listed 30 or more possible animals they could choose. To demonstrate the instructions that they were asked to follow, Mrs. Coombs used an owl for her writing sample. After she finished sharing her instructions, she asked if anyone had questions. One of the children responded, “Well Mrs. Coombs, I had no other choice but to choose an owl.”There was an awkward silence on the Zoom call. To my knowledge, she never told the children that they had to choose the owl. How had he determined that he had “no other choice” considering all the possibilities presented to him? Maybe he understood something about choice that we did not.I gathered a bit of wisdom out of the mouth of this babe. There is a lesson that I wish to share from my window into a first-grader’s world.Since the election this year, I have thought a great deal about the freedoms and rights that we are at liberty to exercise in the United States. I have also thought a great deal about the history of this nation that once denied and to some extent still denies its inhabitants the freedoms of choice. There are many, many examples and stories of decisions made because people generally believe that they have no choice or they are forced to do something because the choice is not theirs to make or there are few appealing options to choose from.Some say every choice is not so serious that we should weigh them so heavily. Moreover, the choices we make dictate what we believe about freedom and particularly free will. How well do you choose for yourself? Do you understand why we have been given this power to decide of our own will and of our own choosing?I find it remarkable and precious that our creator actually gave us the freedom to choose. All powerful as He is, he is not a dictator who insists that we follow His rule or else. He consults with us and allows us to make up our own minds whether we want the same things that He wants for us. To invite God into our decision-making is practical. Believers should seek God’s guidance in all things. Deuteronomy 29:29 says, “The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.”Much like what the first-grader demonstrated in his selection of the same animal that his teacher selected for her paper, if you follow what the teacher chose, how can you go wrong? The Bible is our writing sample. We get to decide whether to follow where the teacher leads us or to choose for ourselves. When God shows you what His choice would be, is there any other possibility that you need to consider?That is a pretty insightful first-grader, if you ask me.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

minnpost_2020_181,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Who is my neighbor Over the course of life’s wanderings my answer to this question has gone through expansion and contraction cycles, and as I stumble into middle age over the cracks and potholes I recognize I’ve treated the question at times as rhetorical and metaphorical, but increasingly in recent years, literal. Especially this year, and especially at this time of year as I make decisions about the votes I will cast for elected offices in November.Humans have a natural tendency to nurture — with our families, pets, gardens, clubs, teams, businesses — reflecting the importance of people, where we belong, and what we are responsible for. We can recognize nurturing in the actions of people who inspire us. We read about nurturing in the newspaper and other media every day in wide-ranging stories of long-sustained efforts in every sector of life from global politics to sports to race relations, in obituaries telling us how the world is a better place because of ideas, values, and visions nurtured. Nurturing is not something the political right or the left can claim — thankfully it is a nonpartisan path to tread.In his 2015 book “The Nurture Effect,” Anthony Biglan argues for nurturing as the core of solutions to challenges faced by individual people, families, schools, and our larger society (among other roles in his influential career in social/behavioral science, Biglan directed the research consortium of the Promise Neighborhoods initiative under the Obama administration . He describes nurturing as a scalable practice supported by decades of research across sectors of society that drives improvements to the human condition at the individual and systems levels. Biglan traces the origin of his push for nurturing to his work on a 2009 Institute of Medicine report on preventing social and health problems: “I began to see common threads that ran through all successful programs, policies, and practices … all of them make people’s environments more nurturing.”Back to the question “who is my neighbor,” I have settled on the answer of “everyone in Minnesota.” Business and pleasure have taken me all over this state to experience the richness of its people, places, and pursuits. But rather than a simple balm for my struggling spirit and a road map for action, this answer adds complexity. The decisions I make at the ballot box this November cannot possibly nurture all my neighbors in the ways they would define it. It is not a zero-sum calculation, but what nurtures the (mostly white neighbors on my block may not nurture my BIPOC neighbors. Decisions that nurture my urban hometown or my beloved wild lands may not nurture the farmers who grow my food or the mining families who produce resources for our state and far beyond. I try to listen and learn but I don’t walk in the shoes of others. I embrace the tension in having no simple answers and in rejecting the dichotomous choices of our politics.There will be winners in this election who will earn the responsibility of nurturing their entire constituencies, and must be held to account in that regard. I cling to an optimism that I am not alone in the hope that our civil discourse can embrace the difficult shades of gray it has shied away from in this age of the echo chamber, and collectively our tendencies as nurturers will pave smoother roads for all our neighbors.Tim Moore is a psychologist who lives in St. Paul with his wife and three children."
suffolknewsherald_2020_55,"Published 9:53 pm Tuesday, July 7, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceToday’s the day I turn the big 4-0. It’s hard for me to believe that I’ve completed 40 trips around the sun, but there is no stopping time. Every year seems to go faster than the one that came before.I took some time the past few weeks to assess my life as this milestone birthday approached. I thought back to the dreams and goals I had earlier in life. Like many children and young adults, I believed I could take on the world and come out on top. Like many adults, I’ve had to come to terms with not reaching those goals, and I’ve watched many of my dreams crash and burn despite my best efforts to succeed.I discovered something in my reflections through a song that I listened to in the 1990s. The song is a strange mix of tragedy and joy that resonates with me today in a way that it could not have done when I first put the CD in my player back in the ’90s. I ask that you indulge me as I share this revelation. It is, after all, my birthday.The lyrics of the opening verse sound more like the blues than a pop-rock song. It says, “I’ve watched my dreams all fade away and blister in the sun. Everything I’ve ever had is unraveled and undone. I’ve set upon a worthless stack of my ambitious plans, and the people that I’ve loved the most have turned their backs and ran.”I am sure that many of us can relate to those lyrics as dreams have failed and people have left us, leaving us with a feeling of being unraveled and undone. This isn’t a song of despair or hopelessness, however. Soon the song will declare, “This is the good life!”The song tells of the good life the artist found in Jesus Christ. He says, “I found everything I could ever need here in Your arms.” It’s a bold statement from someone who sang, “I’ve lost everything I could ever want and ever dream of” just one line before. It may sound strange to some people, but it’s something I understand perfectly.The older I get, the more I realize that dreams, accomplished or not, do not determine my ability to have a good life. The good life isn’t found in accomplishments. The good life is found when I am in the arms of the One who created me, loves me, and has promised to guide me and keep me.Dreams and goals are not bad things. We should strive to be the best we can be, but I worry there are many people who place their ability to have a good life on achieving certain accomplishments. Therefore, any setbacks on reaching certain goals in life bring despair and hopelessness.I have not reached my dreams. I’ve had people I love walk away from me, and I’ve had my share of heartaches. Nevertheless, I know I’m in the arms of the One who loves me and who will never leave me. Therefore, as I turn 40, I can say, “This is the good life.”I urge those who feel like they are unraveled and undone to turn to the One who promised “life to the full” to anyone who comes to Him.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_210,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .My, how times have changed. Today’s MPCA is a servant of the mining companies, making strenuous efforts to avoid enforcing the Clean Water Act and preventing the Lake Superior Chippewa Bands or environmentalists from doing it, either. I will give you two very recent examples: the water discharge permits issued to PolyMet Mining and to MinnTac.Theraison d’êtreof the Clean Water Act is to regulate and limit point sources of pollution – the contamination of water – by chemical, biological, or physical agents. In general, if there is the risk of the discharge of a pollutant by a source, that pollutant is supposed to be limited at the point of discharge by a site-specific PCA permit that includes a water-quality-based effluent limit for that pollutant. So-called WQBELs are the heart of the Clean Water Act.Neither the PolyMet permit nor the MinnTac permit as issued by the PCA has WQBELs.The PolyMet water discharge permit, issued as the Mark Dayton administration’s PCA commissioner was headed out the door, was found objectionable by a senior staff member of the Environmental Protection Agency because, among other things, it lacked WQBELs. As we know, our PCA, along with political leadership at the EPA’s Region 5, suppressed the objections, and we would have never known about them if they hadn’t been leaked.Also in 2018, in the case of MinnTac, the MPCA issued a half-hearted water permit to replace one that expired in1992, to head off an EPA enforcement action because of off-the-charts sulfate pollution that the EPA found in an inspection. And again, we only found out recently, because of aFreedom of Information Act request to the EPA, that the MPCA and the EPA’s political leadership were behind the kid gloves treatment of MinnTac. The new permit didn’t have WQBELs. The lack of WQBELs is one of the reasons that theMinnesota Court of Appeals struck down the new permit; the old permit didn’t have them either.Both the PolyMet and MinnTac permits remain in litigation: PolyMet before the Court of Appeals and MinnTac before the Supreme Court. There are almost never do-overs when mining permits become final; Reserve Mining’s water discharge permit was a drawn out but glorious exception.If the MPCA is successful in slipping the environment a mickey on either of these permits, there will be nothing for anybody, including the Lake Superior Chippewa Bands or the environmental nonprofits, to enforce. That’s because of something in the Clean Water Act called the “permit shield.” The shield allows a polluter to defend an action against it under the CWA by proving that it is in compliance with its permit, regardless of how improvidently or corruptly the permit was issued by the regulator. If you get the right regulators, they are not your regulators; they are your defenders.That is what happened at a closed copper mine near Ladysmith, Wisconsin, known as the Flambeau Mine. Levels of copper and heavy metals pollution were discovered in streams surrounding the mine (it didn’t have stored tailings because the ore was all hauled off site that exceeded limits that would have been permitted by the Clean Water Act and Wisconsin water quality standards. It didn’t matter, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals said in a suit brought by environmentalists,because the mining company was in compliance with its poorly written – and perhaps corrupt – permit.It’s a pity, but we don’t get to elect the commissioner of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. We do, however, get to elect the governor. If you believe, as I do, that the reign of industry capture, inattention, and corruption at the MPCA must come to an end, Gov. Tim Walz needs to hear pointed questions from you. After all, it’s his administration now, and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan’s as well.If enough people do that, perhaps we’ll return to the days of leadership on the environment exemplified by our regulatory leaders in the Reserve case.Steve Timmer is a retired Twin Cities lawyer.

As part of making that happen, the majority of Americans who support progressive ideals should make specific demands of President-elect Joe Biden.As 2020 mercifully draws to a close, there is reason to be optimistic that 2021 will present opportunities for progressive change, to the betterment of all. As part of making that happen, the majority of Americans who support progressive ideals should make specific demands of President-elect Joe Biden.Here are a few:Restore balance: Republicans have used redistricting and voter suppression to create an unlevel playing field; the Democrats should tilt it back. Yes, do away with the filibuster, especially in such a closely divided Senate. Yes, let Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have voting representation in Congress. Yes, add seats to the Supreme Court. And let’s be fair about it: put these ideas to voters as referendums, debate the merits and abide by the results.No pardons for Trump: The most corrupt president in U.S. history faces a slew of potential criminal charges for everything from tax fraud to obstruction of justice to the same campaign finance violations that sent his personal lawyer to prison. Trump, the divider in chief, should not be able to escape justice on the grounds that this would be “divisive.” Charge him, try him and, if warranted, lock him up.Eliminate the Electoral College: This accommodation to slavery has diminished our system of governance long enough. It’s time to pass a constitutional amendment to establish the principle of one person, one vote, like everywhere else. Let’s start with advancing the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which aims to get a sufficient number of states to agree to cast their Electoral College votes for whichever presidential candidate wins the popular vote.Ensure the right to vote: Both houses of Congress must pass a new national Voting Rights Act, named after the late Rep. John Lewis, to protect the ability of every citizen to vote and to have that vote count. No party or state should be able to make voting harder for political gain.Address climate change: We have dawdled long enough, putting the planet in peril. Now we must work at breakneck speed to contain the damage. The impacts from our heedlessness will still be severe, but they can be survivable. This is an all-hands-on-deck situation that requires strong leadership and a spirit of global cooperation. And yes, that will be as hard as it sounds.End endless wars: The U.S. war in Afghanistan needs to come to an end, along with U.S. involvement in Syria, Libya and Yemen, as well as our government’s determination to stoke conflict with Iran. We can redirect defense spending to domestic needs, and end up enhancing our national security.Reform the criminal justice system: The United States has the world’s highest rate of incarceration, for which it pays enormous financial and human costs. During the campaign, both Trump and Biden broke from the once-bipartisan consensus that the more Americans we lock up, the better. Biden rued his support of a 1994 crime bill that spiked incarceration, and Trump boasted about the baby steps he’s taken toward reform. Now it’s time for some big steps.These are all worthy and attainable goals. But they will not come without pressure. A loud, proud, sustained, united front of progressive advocacy is needed to help bend the arc of the nation’s moral trajectory toward justice.Bill Lueders is editor of The Progressive.

minnpost_2020_139,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Word on the street is that we are living in unprecedented times. Within our lifetimes, this is true. There have been other pathogens and deadlierstrainsof coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but none called for the intense self-isolation protocol of now. However, few among us were alive during the 1918Spanish fluwhen, like now, people were encouraged to stay home and wear masks to prevent the spread of the contagion that killed an estimated 500 million worldwide. Even before 1918, there was the Cocoliztli epidemic of 1545, the Black Death of 1346, the Plague of Justinian of 541, and dozens of others. Arguably, the current pandemic is very much precedented.What truly is unprecedented however, are the lives affected by COVID-19.The stay-at-homers, who benefit from time to refocus on what is important, while simultaneously toeing the line between loneliness and solitude. Families are divided even further or finally brought under the same roof. “Essential” and “non-essential” workers, all impacted by the financial consequences of slowing down. And the patients, who from their hospital beds, either connect with their family over video call as they recover or are given special permission for a last visit from masked loved ones as they breathe their last breath.What hurts the most: People, who lived unprecedented lives, are drowning in their own bodilyfluids. They are dying despite the best efforts of respirators and doctors. To protect others and ourselves from similar death, precedent shows that we should sit at home and wait for a vaccine.George Floyd’s death is not unprecedented. He died through asphyxia. Echoed in the gruesome death of Floyd are the words, “I can’t breathe.”Floyd could not breathe. His name joins those ofEric Garnerand Michael Brown, on a growing list of unprecedented lives ended because not enough changed to protect them.Justice for Floyd means unprecedented change. It means a reason to believe that his death will not be a precedent for another. If both nonviolent and violent protests do not motivate change, please tell, what will There must be a way to better the world by working within the system, not outside of it.As the Class of 2020 and millions of American students’ lives continue from home, there is time to explore the issue of racism and police brutality. Time to feel alongside Floyd’sfamilyand friends, as they work through such personal grief work while embarking on the long journey of prosecution. Time to read politicians’ reactions, from President Donald Trump’smisinformation-flaggedtweets, to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s inadequately wordedstatement.

Each state will receive at least $1.25 billion, plus an additional amount based on population. Virginia’s total is $3.3 billion, $1.5 billion of which is for local governments.Unfortunately, the fund provides little actual relief for state budgets but instead all but compels them to devise new spending that can be attributed to COVID-19, by limiting spending to emergency expenses or newly adopted programs. Federal guidance has confirmed that the legislation prohibits states from using the aid to pay for expenses already budgeted prior to the emergency, doing nothing to replace the losses in tax and fee revenue that have disappeared and cannot be recovered.Equally the case is the effect on local government: Without additional flexibility and support, municipalities face pressure to impose large increases in property taxes and business taxes at precisely the time those businesses will be struggling to rebuild and rehire their employees.Congress should address this unintended outcome quickly by providing states and local governments the flexibility to use money from the Coronavirus Relief Fund to offset lost tax and fee revenue that would otherwise have paid for ordinary operating expenses after March 1, or provide one-time tax relief to individuals and businesses to revive the local economy.Christian N.

However, this is not necessarily the case.Returns on investments in countries that give more aid to help fight global poverty are usually almost 10 times the amount that is put in. The United States investing in futures abroad also means investing in futures here at home. Businesses see that it is of interest to every American, no matter where you live and where you are from, that global poverty is addressed.The world’s fastest growing economies are also some of the world’s poorest, and helping their growth means helping growth at home. Companies like Amazon, investing and building in Suffolk communities, do that in part because the wider market is growing and affecting domestic production to meet a growing demand, and this is because as people escape poverty, they start to build lives for themselves that mean being opened up to a wider market.Supporting organizations like The Borgen Project mean that every citizen can take in their hands the future of American commerce as well as the wider goal of building a better future for all in Suffolk, in America, and beyond.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_6,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Once again, President Donald Trump has decided to squander the value of the presidential pardon in order to reward allies and score political points. On Tuesday, the White House announced five commutations and 15 pardons, including a full pardon for disgraced former U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.Once again, President Donald Trump has decided to squander the value of the presidential pardon in order to reward allies and score political points. On Tuesday, the White House announced five commutations and 15 pardons, including a full pardon for disgraced former U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.It’s hard to think of a recent political figure less deserving of a presidential pardon than Hunter.For years, a growing trail of evidence showed that Hunter had treated campaign donations as personal slush funds to pay for video games, dog food, private school tuition for kids, hotel rooms for his mistress and all sorts of other personal expenses. Even after he was indicted by a federal grand jury for misusing a quarter of a million dollars in campaigns funds, Hunter tried to blame the spending on everybody but himself, or brush off the charges as a politically motivated witch hunt.And when Hunter finally did plead guilty (after his wife made her plea and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors , he didn’t bother to apologize publicly to his constituents or donors.The pardon arrives in the nick of time for Hunter; the former congressman was supposed to begin serving an 11-month prison sentence next month. But Hunter was no victim. He was greedy and abused the public trust, which is already pretty fragile. His estranged wife, who is currently serving three years of probation for her role in the misuse of campaign funds, was not given any relief by Trump.Trump also pardoned another disgraced former Republican House member, Chris Collins of New York, who pleaded guilty last year to securities fraud and lying to investigators. And what do Collins and Hunter have in common? They were the first and second members of Congress to endorse Trump.It should be no surprise at this point that Trump chose to overlook the self-serving crimes of two of his more ardent supporters. This is a man who puts fealty over morality. So much for Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” when he got to White House. He’s instead given some of the sleaziest characters in D.C. pool floats and cocktails to lounge in a bog of entitled corruption.The president’s power under the Constitution to grant pardons can be an important safety valve when the criminal justice system fails or when an offender has served his time and turned his life around. Among his latest pardons, for example, Trump commuted the remaining sentences for several women convicted of drug offenses. (Granted, even these worthy pardons came as the result of advocacy by celebrities and high-profile supporters. Far too often, Trump has given pardons to undeserving recipients with whom he shares a personal or political affinity. He’s given clemency to former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, an epically corrupt politician who once appeared on Trump’s reality TV series “Celebrity Apprentice”; former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, a hero of the anti-immigrant right who’d been convicted of contempt of court for ignoring an order to stop racial profiling by deputies; and conservative provocateur Dinesh D’Souza, who was pardoned after pleading guilty to campaign finance fraud.Just as troubling is that Trump has used pardons in an attempt to undermine the justice system. His actions Tuesday included pardons for two men who pleaded guilty to lying to investigators during the the Russia investigation. These were the latest in a series of pardons he’s given to allies who were successfully prosecuted as part of former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Trump also pardoned members of the U.S. military and military contractors accused or convicted of war crimes. On Tuesday, he pardoned four former U.S. service members who were convicted on charges related to the killing of Iraqi civilians while working as contractors for Blackwater in 2007.During Trump’s remaining weeks in office, he is likely to use the pardon power again in offensive and damaging ways. He will test this country and its democratic norms all along the way out the White House door.— Los Angeles Times"
philinquirer_2020_27,"With a full third of the school board in need of replacing, some educators and activists are wondering if it’s time to reconsider how members get a seat at the table.In early November,Lee Huang announced his resignationfrom the Philadelphia Board of Education, making him the third board member to vacate a seat this year. Based on guidelines set forth in Philadelphia’s City Charter, board members are appointed by the mayor, but with a full third of the school board in need of replacing, some educators and activists are wondering if it’s time to reconsider how members get a seat at the table.The Inquirer tapped an educator and parent to debate the city’s chief education officer:Should the Philly school board be elected instead of appointed?By Zoe RooneyOver the last few weeks, we’ve watched threats of voter disenfranchisement play out on a national scale. As we’ve seen Philadelphians step up to ensure every vote is counted, we have simultaneously been confronted with our own disenfranchisement when it comes to our Board of Education.We recently learned thatanother member of our appointed board is resigning, and the mayor is in the process of filling the vacancies. Philadelphia’s students, families, and educators are locked out of the process, afforded neither a vote nor a voice.» READ MORE:Another Philly school board member is resigning; mayor must now replace a third of the boardWith the recent resignations ofAmeen Akbar and Lee Huang, following that of Chris McGinley last April, the Philadelphia Board of Education has three open seats. These vacancies come just as the district faces many extraordinary challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, looming budget deficits, district systems that perpetuate anti-Black racism, and ongoing issues with toxic school buildings.The nominating panel, selected by Mayor Jim Kenney, convened on Nov. 17 to begin the process of selecting candidates. The mayor’s chosen nominees will then be passed to City Council for confirmation in December. Since the panel first convened in 2018, there has been little opportunity for public comment or involvement. Instead, they have met almost entirely behind closed doors, locking out the residents of the only Pennsylvania district withoutan elected school board. This round was no different — the first remote meeting only allows citizens to submit written comments in advance, with no public participation during the meeting.Members of the Our City Our Schools coalition, who worked to abolish the School Reform Commission, looked forward to a return to local control that would give Philadelphians a voice in the decisions made about our public schools. We wanted local control to mean community control, accountability, and board members who listened and responded to the needs and concerns of students, families, and educators.Instead, we have seen the mayor’s Board of Education continue the legacy of the SRC, acting as a rubber stamp for district leadership, and ignoring community members who testify and write in with concerns. Even worse, they do this while giving lip service to transparency, community engagement, and communication. Philadelphians will continue the fight for a transparent, representative, and accountable elected school board. Until then, we demand that the mayor open up the current selection process so that it is fully public and transparent.“We wanted local control to mean community control, accountability, and board members who listened and responded to the needs and concerns of students, families, and educators.”The nominating panel should conduct its business in public, not in executive sessions out of the view of most Philadelphians. Public hearings must be held at multiple points throughout the process, before backroom decisions are codified by handshake deals. The public must be able to review the full list of candidates with sufficient time to learn about them and must have the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns in front of the nominating panel and City Council.While members of the Our City Our Schools coalition believe that community voice and a more transparent process are important steps forward, we know these steps alone will not fix our Board of Education. We need more.We need our board to include public school educators, activists, and parents of students who attend schools other than those in expensive, gentrified neighborhoods or with special admissions criteria. We need students to have a real voice as voting members of our board. While the two nonvoting student representative seats are a step in the right direction, the role functions more as a token than an opportunity for actual student power in decision-making. The student members lack a vote, autonomy, preparation, and training, and two students cannot effectively represent a district of more than 200,000.We need board members who understand the necessity of undoing years of SRC-imposed “reforms” on the district, such as the large-scale expansion of charter schools, rampant outsourcing of district jobs and services to contractors, a revolving door of standardized tests, curricula, and mandates imposed on educators, and the traumatic closures of numerous neighborhood schools.Philadelphians must have the right to vote on their board members just like every other Pennsylvanian. While we keep organizing toward that reality, we deserve real transparency and a voice.Zoe Rooney is an educator, parent, and member of Parents United for Public Education, a citywide organization focused on engaging families on issues of quality and equity in public schools. It is part of the Our City Our Schools coalition.By Otis HackneyIn 2017, when Mayor Jim Kenney announced that Philadelphia had secured local control of our public schools, he was adamant that members of the school board should be mayoral appointees. “You can hold me, and future mayors, accountable for the success or failure of our schools,” he vowed at the time.Three years later, it’s clear this is still the best choice for the School District of Philadelphia, which educates almost 200,000 students each year.This structure was not decided in a vacuum: prior to that change, we had examined different board structures, including the idea of elected board members. But the mayor and I believed that a mayoral-appointed school board, with Council confirmation, was the best type for Philadelphia.Remember that this came after years of finger-pointing during which students and families were told that the state of their schools is someone else’s responsibility. We knew that accountability rests with the mayor who makes the appointment, and with the City Council who approves the members. The buck truly does stop with us.This month, the mayor will select three new board members for approval by Philadelphia City Council. Once approved, they will join a committed group of six other leaders who volunteer their time, expertise, and energy to set the vision and goals for the School District. The board also hires, supervises, and evaluates the superintendent and authorizes and renews charter schools.“To transition to an elected school board would require significant changes to the charter and state law.”Through this governance, we have stepped up as a city, increasing our investment in and accountability to our students. Between 2018 and 2021, the city’s contribution to the district more than doubled. This effort, combined with the oversight of our Board of Education and leadership of Superintendent William R. Hite Jr., led to a stable two years of operations and education for the district.» READ MORE:As COVID-19 cases surge, should schools stay open? Around the Philly region, approaches vary wildly.The COVID-19 pandemic has also shown why true alignment between the School District and the City of Philadelphia is vital.

To transition to an elected school board would require significant changes to the charter and state law.And elections for the Board of Education in Philadelphia would set up regular, deeply ideological battles that would be costly, painful, and not necessarily focused on student success. As we have seen over the past decade, there is significant monetary support of different ideologies. A school board election would open a fierce process with the potential for other interest groups — besides education experts — to shape the future of public education. By placing the appointment with the mayor, who has responsibility for the success of the city as a whole, there are opportunities for all voices to be heard and moderated.» READ MORE:Citing surge in COVID-19, Philly schools reverse reopening plan; will continue virtual instruction until further noticeResearch has shown that urban districts under mayoral control have performed better than their peers. The Center for American Progress (CAP reviewed peer cities Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., and noted these systems have seen substantial improvement in student performance. CAP also found that mayor-led districts use resources strategically, leading to lower administrative costs, and resources getting directly into classrooms through lower teacher-student ratios.Now, as we look to the day when students can return safely to the classroom, we build on three years of local control and accountability.

Its mission is to create a sustainable medical and social service system which provides quality care for all the people of Hawaii Island.Barry saw the cost crisis as more of a business issue than a medical one because of flawed payment models, fragmentation of information, and broken workflows. It was a problem which could not be solved by the medical system alone but requires the entire community to collaborate.In the end, he felt we needed to care for health not just treat disease, and not only take personal responsibility for our own health but help each other care for our mutual well-being. Barry shared three principles to meet this formidable challenge: (1 Only together. (2 Make the invisible visible. (3 Try — and don’t expect to get it right the first time.It’s been a year since Barry’s death, and Community First, led by president and chairperson Toby Taniguchi, continues the work of being the forum that brings business leaders, medical and social service providers, health plans and community members together.Community First called a meeting for a Regional Health Partnership in October. I attended as a community member, and as a retired teacher felt out of my element, but I feel moved to continue Barry’s legacy so I am contributing by making the invisible visible — sharing our discussions and informing the public of the progress being made.The meeting was led by Community First’s Executive Director Mike Sayama. At this gathering, community leaders focused on the continued challenges brought about by COVID-19. Lisa Rantz, executive director of Hilo Medical Center Foundation, worked with state partners to successfully recruit new doctors.Dan Brinkman, CEO of Hilo Medical Center shared updates on COVID-19 responses at HMC and Yukio Okutsu Veterans State Home. Representatives from HMSA, AlohaCare and Dr. Hannah Preston-Pita, CEO of BISAC, have partnered with agencies and legislators to address COVID-19 from a community perspective and increase folks’ access to care and information.Christina Higa, PhD from the Pacific Basin Telehealth Resource Center, talked about the substantial increase in telehealth use to maximize access and safety. In addition to maximizing the use of telehealth, the Regional Health Partnership discussed effective care for high-need, high-cost patients, determining on/off island services, and developing a community quality improvement process.Ending uninformed and unnecessarily painful death is the work of both the Community First Advance Health Care Directive committee, and Brenda Ho, CEO of Hawaii Care Choices. The AHCD committee holds monthly virtual sessions to help folks complete a directive that documents one’s end-of-life wishes. It is led by Charlene Iboshi, Amy Hamane and a group of dedicated volunteers.Now in its sixth year, the organization’s Blood Pressure Educator Project has UH-Hilo School of Nursing seniors teach sixth-graders how to take blood pressure readings of adult family members and friends. Children teach adults much about good health.With COVID-19 at the forefront, the Our Kuleana campaign and its eye-catching ads was developed by Randy Kurohara to inspire our community to come together to end COVID-19 spread on Hawaii Island.We are trying mightily, and small steps have been taken. We have learned that achievements come from making mistakes along the way. These are just a few examples of ways our community is coming together to care for our health.As Barry’s first principle says, “Only together” can we succeed.Karen Maedo is a community advocate. Community First is a nonprofit founded by Barry Taniguchi in 2014. Today it is led by Toby Taniguchi and a volunteer board of community leaders. It serves as a neutral forum for the community to come together and as a catalyst for solutions to improve health and lower medical costs on Hawaii lsland based on the community good.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_178,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Earlier this summer George Floyd died after allegedly passing a bad $20 bill buying cigarettes. He was Black. He was killed by law enforcement on Memorial Day, our holiday honoring those who die serving in the U.S. military.I watched the video recorded in front of Cup Foods only once. Never again. My stomach keeps knotting. I cannot even look at the stills now. I cannot bear to see his face and I am just this side of vomiting every time I think about his death.After reflecting on this, I think I have figured out why. Fifteen years ago, I passed two counterfeit $20s bills and nothing happened. Not only did nothing happen, but I did not even remember it until Floyd was killed.To my memory, it was a sunny warm weekend in Minneapolis. My wife, Sue, and I were short of wine for the weekend and we wanted sandwiches for lunch. It is a classic Saturday Minnesota ritual: off to our favorite wine & cheese shop. It’s the best place to go for wine, sandwiches and any cheese we could think of.Sue had just completed her annual garage sale with a good friend and offered me some cash. I took enough to cover the cost.The clerk checked our stuff through. I paid her with two $20s to cover the bill, about $35. Moments later she said, “These are both counterfeit.”“That can’t be. How can you even say that to me If you give them back my bank will replace them.”“No. Can’t do that. We give the bills to the police at the end of the shift. I need your name and address and phone number now. And you need to pay for this.”I had two more $20s from the garage sale and I gave them to her.“You’re good.” This after she tested the bills.Then Sue and I walked out and continued our happy afternoon on a bright golden day in Minneapolis.Why didn’t Floyd have that outcomeFor a lifetime I’ve rejected out of hand any reference to “white privilege” because I always worked hard to make the cut. Nothing was ever handed to me. But I realize that what happened with those two counterfeit $20s precisely embodies white privilege: Because of my skin color, in spite of my irritation & impatience, I got the benefit of the doubt. Floyd did not, and now he is dead.I’m 82, and this is the first time in my life I have recognized such privilege in my life. Until Floyd was murdered, I never understood that there have likely been many ways where I got the benefit of the doubt.Jacob Blake is maimed now. Breonna Taylor, killed. My dread has deepened. Another memory has surfaced.A more frightening event occurred in the late 1970s when my son and daughter were still school kids. I was driving a rental car on a business trip in California. Again a lovely summer day and this time, a routine traffic stop: A trooper signaled me to pull over. I pulled over.It is almost unbelievable that I am still alive. I knew I had not been speeding. I doubt any Black dad would have done what I did.During a traffic stop in July 2016 Philando Castile played by the rules and stayed seated in his car in St. Paul. He was shot and killed by a police officer. With white privilege, a disease toxic and unseen, both Floyd and Castile have lived and died with a counterfeit liberty.My hope is that memories of personal moments similar to mine return to many white men and women like me. We need to recognize guardrails of white privilege present in our everyday lives. What seems normal is clearly not — the liberty I have always taken for granted is as counterfeit as the $20 bills George Floyd and I took from our wallets.We must recognize the cultural forces protecting white people, allowing many of us to err, to blunder and then continue the hard work of building a family and a life and a career. At the same time many others lose their lives and opportunities.It is crucial that whites like me do this now because the more we recognize ourselves in younger Black men and women, the more we can use our influence to help them receive the benefit of the doubt. Then and only then will we all know and have an authentic liberty in our own lives.Please listen to Black men and women peacefully working for liberty for every one of us. And at a minimum, if you recognize your life in mine, please donate to one or all three of these nonprofits: NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund; the ACLU; Equal Justice Initiative.Boyd H.

eugeneweekly_2020_19,"We ve got issues. With the COVID-19 pandemic in full roar, we the small, independent restaurants, are facing an existential crisis. Restaurants have always seemed a recession-proof business. Sure, the individual business could struggle and fail, but as a whole, restaurants thrived, grew and succeeded. People have to eat, and people like to drink, and people love to be social. Special occasions happen all the time; it is always someone’s birthday, or anniversary or graduation. The other end of the spectrum is filled with food trucks, small take out joints and the entire fast food sector. The industry keeps chugging on. Everyone reading this is aware the last 30 years have given rise to the internet along with mass and social media. This allowed the world to share knowledge, ideas and traditions in new and unique ways — a proverbial melting pot. It has brought this country a bounty of culinary choices and delights, from celebrity chefs and the Food Network™ to more personal awakening of a world full of exotic spices, heirloom vegetables, boutique wines and artisanal spirits. It helped to drive small, independent restaurants to the forefront of dining in America. Our cities and towns are stocked with amazing chefs and stupendous waiters. Local farmers markets are filled with regional pride and global awareness. This makes a more diverse and interesting food scene than ever before. Sure, the large chains (owned by large conglomerates and backed by deep pockets are pushing the same mass-produced food that is cost-driven, heavily advertised and lacking in love. These “restaurants” food businesses have always been focused on putting profit first, but even they are trying to keep up with the trends from the little guys. This has been a very good couple of decades to be a foodie. We (the little guys are much better at poaching that duck egg, stirring the Manhattan or remembering your cat’s name than we are at cash flow and P&L reports. We love the food, the drink and the community. If we understood money, we would be bankers. Our understanding of analyzing sales is usually along the lines of “more butts in seats = more money!” Which brings us to the problem we are facing. We cannot put “more butts in seats.” We don’t even have as many seats as we did before. Often smaller restaurants sell as much in an hour on the weekend as we do over an entire Tuesday. With social distancing, we have lost the busy Friday and Saturday nights. We have lost our bar seating, and our two-top tables. We have lost the ability to just add a seat to the end of a table, or to squeeze one more person in. A lot of us have lost 70 percent or more of our potential seats. There aren’t enough seats in a socially distanced dining room. What we do have is time. We have the earlier and later hours of the night, and slower days of the week. We can seat more people on Tuesday or Wednesday or at 4:30 or at 9 pm than we do now. The dining culture evolved around the idea that you go out to eat around 6 or 7 pm on the weekend. Places that are packed on Friday at 6:45 are where to go. Busy means quality, and if a place is slow, it must be bad. We must change that idea for small restaurants to survive. We want more people to make reservations so we can plan better. We want people to start dining earlier or later and on different days. We want couples to start a tradition of “date night” on Tuesday. We need people to start to feel that they can have a great time with great food on any given night and not just on the “busy” nights, because there aren’t any “busy” nights with social distancing. The problems we face are not unique to us. We are literally “all in this together” (cue heartfelt music . The social distancing required for us to beat this virus affects the corporate chain restaurants too, it is just that they have deeper pockets, better cost controls, and often an ability to operate at a loss. If we have a war of attrition with this virus, at the end of the day, only the large chains will be able to last. The industry will keep chugging on, just without us. We can adapt to these changes so we can continue to serve our community and friends. We ask that you adapt and change your habits along with us.

One, against “The Room Where It Happened,” was by the Department of Justice seeking to bar the high-profile account of Trump’s erratic antics in the White House, written by former national security adviser John Bolton. The other was a an ill-fated effort by the president’s brother, Robert, to suppress “Too Much And Never Enough,” an unflattering book about the president’s upbringing and pre-Oval Office days by their niece, Mary Trump, a psychologist.Both suppression suits were brought under prior agreements. The one against Bolton was founded on his alleged violation of an agreement to allow pre-publication review by the administration to ferret out any sensitive national security secrets. The one against his niece was filed in probate court in New York, based upon a non-disclosure agreement (NDA among family members signed years ago in probate proceedings regarding the death of the family patriarch, Fred, the president’s father.Both challenges failed, but for different reasons. The Bolton book was allowed to be distributed over misgivings by the federal judge hearing the case in Washington because it was “already in publication … the damage is done.”In the niece’s case,Trump v. Trump, a New York state surrogate court judge a few days later ruled that he lacked jurisdiction, prompting a new case that was re-filed in the state Supreme Court, the jurisdiction’s lowest level civil trial court, where a judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO barring publication. But an appellate court overturned the TRO on grounds that the book publisher was not a party to the NDA.Despite their differences, the outcomes were similar – and not surprising. The courts’ refusals to prohibit the publications follow a long line of precedent. For nearly 90 years, the law in this country has almost continuously barred these censorial attempts.Neither of these two cases turned solely on that precept. But the outcomes stemmed from a proscription in a Minnesota lawsuit that established the defense of no “prior restraint” of communications under the freedom of speech and press provision of the First Amendment.Landmark litigationThe landmark litigation,Near v. Minnesota,began in the Roaring Twenties and extended into the early Depression days of the 1930s. It concerned Minnesota’s Public Nuisance law, a measure known as the “Gag Law.” Enacted in 1925, the statute permitted closure by government authorities of publications deemed “malicious, scandalous, and defamatory.”The 1925 nuisance law allowed the authorities, led by then-Hennepin County Attorney Floyd B. Olson, later to become governor, to shutter the most notorious paper in Minneapolis, The Saturday Press,an effort upheld twice by a Hennepin County judge.The adversaries who squared off in this case were political as well as legal luminaries. Olson, from the north side of Minneapolis, later became an esteemed liberal governor of the state, even mentioned as possible presidential caliber before his sudden death of cancer in 1936 at age 45. The Press was represented by Thomas Latimer, who subsequently served a two–year term as mayor of Minneapolis, overlapping with Olson’s tenure as governor, both of the Farmer Labor Party, a forerunner of the DFL.The lawsuit twice reached the state Supreme Court, which on both occasions rejected freedom of press challenges to the “gag” law. Initially, it deemed the measure an appropriate way to uphold “public morals” and the “public welfare,” equating scurrilous publications with other businesses such as “houses of prostitution,” lotteries and “noxious weeds,” among other unpleasantries in 1928. It relied only on the state free speech and press clause in Article I, § 3 of the Minnesota Constitution. But a year later, the tribunal in St. Paul reiterated that outlook under a newly raised First Amendment claim under the U.S. Constitution.At that point, the challenger was about to drop the case and the newspaper, until Col. Robert McCormick, the conservative publisher of the Chicago Tribune, the self-proclaimed “world’s greatest newspaper,” stepped in and bankrolled his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.Closure condemnedThe newspaper closure was overturned in 1931 by the Supreme Court, which held the law unconstitutional in theNearcase. The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes. He began by characterizing the “suppression” of a publication as a matter of “grave importance.”Reaching back to 17th-century English law and the echoes of the Revolutionary War, he condemned the law for creating “an effective censorship that constituted impermissible ‘prior restraint ” of freedom of expression in violation of the First Amendment. While that proposition seems self-evident today, it was not so at that time. To reach that result, the court had to apply the First Amendment to a state law, which had never before been done because it was commonly understood at the time that it and the other provisions of the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government but not states or other local units of government. In fact, a Supreme Court ruling 16 years earlier, also a case from Minneapolis, recognized that limitation on another topic: the right to a jury trial in civil cases in Minneapolis& St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Bombolis.The seminal case was nearly decided the other way; it was a 5-4 vote of the justices. Minnesota’s first Supreme Court jurist, Pierce Butler, wrote a dissent. Joined by three archconservative colleagues, he opined that the law was a constitutionally permissible proscription on illicit journalism because “distribution of scandalous matter is detrimental to public morals and the general public.”Nor was the majority ruling unqualified in castigating censorship. It noted some examples of expression not protected by the First Amendment, including obscenity, defamation, and national security concerns such as publication of military matters like schedules of transport ships and the “location of troops.”But the foundation of the principle against “prior restraint” was laid.Restrictions retrenchedThose restrictions have, to be sure, been retrenched somewhat over the years, as theNearcase has become the leading precedent not only against “prior restraint” but for broad First Amendment protections for expression through speech and press in all forms, including today’s social media.Its most prominent application came 40 years later when the Nixon administration sought to prevent publication of the Pentagon Papers, which revealed ineptitude, deceit, and secrecy by government officials in conducting the Vietnam War and selling it to the public. The “location of troops” phrase from theNearcase was the keynote of the attempt, claiming that publication of the purloined documents would jeopardize national security and engaging in diplomacy and foreign affairs.But the Supreme Court in 1971 inNew York Times Co. v. United States,did not buy the argument, rejecting it largely on grounds of theNearrationale against “prior restraint.”Nearis now considered by Supreme Court scholars to be one of the court’s most consequential cases.Marshall H.

minnpost_2020_197,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In Murdock, Minnesota, a “Nordic heritage group” called the Asatru Folk Assembly has purchased a church building. This group is a white supremacist group, promoting “white purity.” Groups like Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA are part of a larger movement termed “Neo-Völkisch” that raises up Northern European and Germanic ancestry as an appeal to potential members but is a veneer for extremist, racist attitudes and actions. AFA in particular grounds itself in its interpretation of the language, iconography, and interpreted beliefs of Nordic countries. It employs a neo-pagan “Odinist” worldview to justify exceptionalism for white people and to suggest their superiority (it’s worth noting that many pagans are anti-racist and strongly disavow AFA and similar groups . The Asatru Folk Assembly group in Murdock is an outpost for this international organization that is presenting itself as a community and service organization, situated in a small town in rural Minnesota.If Scandinavian Americans are dismayed and disturbed by people and groups who use Nordic themes and heritage as weapons against people of color, immigrants, and Indigenous people, we should not ignore this misuse of history and culture but hold it up for study. We must also acknowledge that we are not neutral. Asatru Folk Assembly and groups like it capitalize on the notion that Nordic people are somehow pure and absolved of guilt because we have averted being labeled as perpetrators and wrongdoers. In fact, Scandinavians have been party to and beneficiaries of the systemic establishment of our country’s racial inequities.When whites removed Native Americans from their land, Scandinavian settlers claimed those same lands through the Homestead Act. When formerly enslaved people were being denied the 40 acres and a mule that Reconstruction had promised them, Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes were able to begin building equity weeks after coming here on their own free will. Decades later, while Blacks struggled to secure fair housing opportunities in the Twin Cities, Scandinavian Americans bought houses with racial covenants in their deeds, guaranteeing segregation for generations. Were those different times Yes. And the consequence is that in 2020, Scandinavian Americans who are white consistently benefit in material ways from the racial disparities that plague our state. Even “back home” in the Nordic region, the indigenous Sami as well as immigrants and people of color struggle for parity and recognition.So when a white supremacist group lays claim to Nordic ideology, I acknowledge the convenience of these references — that they conjure up whiteness (denying the increasing diversity in Scandinavia as well as Scandinavian America and summon its dominance and privilege. When people refer to “good genes” or praise the superiority of northern Europeans, I am aware that these are falsehoods that capitalize on widespread attitudes.I am working to confront the responsibility and culpability I bear as a white Minnesotan of Scandinavian descent and to commit to righting the inequities that persist here and elsewhere. I hope that Scandinavian Americans will join in rejecting everything AFA stands for — its hateful and damaging language and actions that obstruct the progress so many are working to secure for our Black, Indigenous, and immigrant neighbors, friends, and families. Local residents of Murdock are taking steps to organize and express their opposition to AFA through Murdock Area Alliance Against Hate because they see this group as dangerous and threatening. Their brave actions are part of the work we can all do to stop white supremacist efforts wherever they emerge.Nina Clark is a Minneapolis resident and professional in the field of arts and culture."

She was my older son’s fifth-grade teacher a couple of years ago and the Battle of the Books coach for my fifth-grade son, Bauer Haden, this season. So we are and have been fans of this passionate, dedicated and exemplary teacher for many years.Mrs. Phillips deserves praise and acknowledgment for her efforts to keep Oakland students learning during this very difficult end of the school year. Quarantine has not been easy for anyone but has added an additional burden to teachers.Particularly as she is not the assigned fifth-grade teacher of these students, the gift of her time and experience is commendable.Mrs. Phillips has led a voluntary, online Zoom class four days a week to maintain math and reading skills for fifth-grade students.She assigns small exercises both for “homework” and during class time. She comments and responds to submitted work through Google Classroom. My son is engaged and involved during her class time.This dedication over and above a printed handout cannot be overvalued.I also appreciate her creating small student work classrooms on Zoom so the students may have peer discussions while working problems. I feared peer group problem solving would be lost in online learning.I am grateful for her efforts to continue the book club. Five days a week, she hosts an online book club where she reads to students as they read in the book, along with her, in Zoom. She takes her personal time to deliver and pick up these books to the porches of private homes.

minnpost_2020_33,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .You can always count on Americans to do the right thing, after they’ve tried everything else. —Winston ChurchillDuring World War II the U.S. and Great Britain were not always on the same page about how to fight an unprecedented totalitarian enemy. But the allies worked out their differences, won the war, and founded a new world order, led by the United States.Now, 75 years later, the rest of the world is amazed and bewildered that America failed to do the right thing when facing a pandemic and is saddled with a divisive and dysfunctional government.Are we really acting differently from the supposedly ignorant and superstitious Middle Ages even though something called science has changed the world in the meantimeWhatever the cause of our ongoing calamity — psychological impairment, mass delusion, abysmal leadership or just widespread nastiness — let’s agree that many problems need to be fixed, ASAP, to return to something like a stable nation. But howFrom ancient history there has been a recognized guide to political and ethical issues. The Greek philosopher Aristotle provided benchmarks, or what can be called best practices, that have been respected for more than 2,000 years. Some of them could be useful now. That’s not to say there aren’t many other traditions or cultural avatars with valuable advice. But let’s consider his particular ancient wisdom. (A good guide to his ethics is “Aristotle’s Way,” by British scholar Edith Hall. Notice that these rules do not exactly rise to the level of rocket-science difficulty. In fact most of us use these guidelines one way or another all the time without a second thought in doing our work, managing households or raising families. These unspoken rules of thumb are something that we learn and practice as the lessons become habitual.Aristotle argued that these useful habits lead to virtue and a good life, although not everyone follows that path or anything like it. Taken together, his suggestions may seem to us like a fancy form of self-help but were actually considered practical knowledge, as opposed to formal logic or pie-in-the-sky theory. With all our current problems and chaos, it’s a prize irony that we Americans have such a reputation for a can-do spirit and “getting things done.” Expect that to change.Seeing national and local leaders who have avoided these common-sense fundamentals, or turned malicious, is both remarkable and mystifying. We wonder and shake our heads over how much important work is not getting done, or done in the worst ways possible for lack of this basic civilizing toolkit. That’s when trains go off the rails and damage assessment begins.Having seen the steep downside of “shaking things up” with no particular plan, we can hope for a slow recovery and better role models as leaders. Life itself provides enough stress without mere citizenship being a recipe for more. Most of us are ready for a time when we don’t have to feel apologetic about this country, or see more signs like this one posted outside a restaurant in London:ALL AMERICANS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ADULTLarry Struck is a writer and former expat now based in Edina."

As a mother of a 5-year-old going into kindergarten, I do not believe that it is physically possible to keep children so young separated from one another. Children at this age not only learn from their teachers, they also learn how to socialize. They learn how to work with other children and how to handle others’ feelings. How could bus drivers possibly maintain separation of children along the ride?Yes, there are parents who put their children’s lives at risk by going to work and coming home, like myself. However, if our job is essential, can we really afford not going to work when we have children to take care of? How do we know that other parents are not sending their children to school with symptoms?When we have an option to not put children at risk, then that should always be the answer.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_13,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°An image from an electron microscope shows SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. (NIAID-RML/Zuma Press/TNS The COVID-19 pandemic has seen remarkable and rapid research in vaccines and therapeutics, but disappointingly little research to shed light on the interventions we currently use to reduce SARS-CoV2 transmission. That is a problem because even with vaccines on the way, we will be stuck with COVID-19 for a considerable time. We urgently need more research to identify and disseminate the most effective and least disruptive interventions and practices to reduce virus transmission, for this pandemic and the ones that will inevitably follow.The COVID-19 pandemic has seen remarkable and rapid research in vaccines and therapeutics, but disappointingly little research to shed light on the interventions we currently use to reduce SARS-CoV2 transmission. That is a problem because even with vaccines on the way, we will be stuck with COVID-19 for a considerable time. We urgently need more research to identify and disseminate the most effective and least disruptive interventions and practices to reduce virus transmission, for this pandemic and the ones that will inevitably follow.Governments, businesses, schools and of course individuals are implementing a host of protective coronavirus strategies, but rarely in ways that would allow us to directly compare different options. Until we build evaluation methods into these efforts, we can act but we will not learn the best way forward.The most rigorous way to evaluate strategies is by conducting randomized trials. Randomized trials are true experiments that essentially flip a coin to assign people (or larger units such as schools or clinics to groups that either receive or do not receive the particular intervention of interest. Because randomization makes the groups similar in every way except the intervention — and because no one knows which group is which — any differences in what happens can be attributed to the intervention, not to things like variations of age, gender, race, health status or other treatments.Compared with the testing of coronavirus vaccines and drugs, few randomized trials exist on the effects of nonpharmacological transmission-prevention efforts. Although a preponderance of evidence leaves no doubt that wearing masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing are effective, especially in combination, there is more to learn about how best to carry out and promote these and other efforts, and how to tailor them to local situations. A consortium of scientists and public health experts, called the BESSI collaboration (BESSI stands for “behavioral, environmental, social and systems interventions” , is calling for more research — especially trials — to fill in knowledge gaps.The BESSI collaboration has identified 1,725 drug trials (213 with published results related to COVID-19, compared to just 11 trials of behavioral, environmental, social and systems interventions (three with published results , none of which are U.S.-based. Of the $3.3 billion in global funding for COVID research, only 3% to 4% has been spent on public health as opposed to pharmacological interventions, according to an analysis conducted at the University of Southampton in Britain.Not every question can or needs to be answered with randomized trials. Randomized trials are expensive and difficult to organize, and less rigorous study designs, including observational studies and modeling, are also helpful. A recent ambitious modeling study using data from 56 countries, for example, identified a broad set of promising non-pharmacological interventions, implemented by governments, that appear to reduce COVID transmission.Still, compared to randomized trials, these approaches are more likely to be exaggerated or wrong. Confirmatory trials are important to inform adoption of promising interventions if there is real uncertainty about the best option, especially if the proposed actions are disruptive, costly or can cause serious side effects.While the best research methods will vary with the type of question being asked, there should be little argument about building tests into the private and public, local, state and national efforts underway to combat the pandemic. For example, there are thousands of colleges and universities struggling to design policies to bring students back to campus. This presents the opportunity to conduct randomized trials evaluating such things as quarantine regimens, social bubble designs or ventilation changes in dorms and classrooms.President-elect Joe Biden has released his plan to bring the pandemic under control. Among other things, it calls on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide community guidance and resources on how and when schools and businesses can safely open and when they need to shut down. To create the evidence to inform such guidance requires a substantial, coordinated increase in the relevant public health research.COVID-19 isn’t going to be eradicated anytime soon. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands more lives may be lost. We need stronger political and public health leadership, and a refocused research agenda, to help us learn our way out of the pandemic and prepare for the next one.Steven Woloshin is a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and director of the Lisa Schwartz Foundation for Truth in Medicine.

minnpost_2020_103,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The demand for health insurance company bailouts and recent news reports about a surge of applications for Medicaid and Minnesota Care programs — due to tens of thousands of workers losing income and jobs in the pandemic — reveal once again the chronic failures of our inefficient employer-based private health care system.Meanwhile, the great Minnesota-centered national uprising over racial discrimination is dramatizing once again that our country suffers from shameful inequities in the care provided to people of different races, incomes, and places of residence.In these perilous new circumstances, the case for Medicare for All (M4A — an efficient and unified national system of health care financing that provides high-quality health services to everyone — has grown stronger than ever.Despite an ever-present flood of misinformation from those making huge profits from the status quo, almost all reputable research and projections about M4A indicate that Americans overall would pay significantly less than we do now under our irrational mishmash of public and private plans and programs.That’s the finding of my recently publishedreview of seven studiesconducted by academic economists and health policy experts to estimate the cost of health care under the M4A bills currently before Congress (H.R. 1384 and S. 1129 .The conclusions of these studies are remarkably similar. The average of their estimates of health care costs under M4A is a 5.7% decrease from what we currently spend, despite more people being insured, out-of-pocket payments being eliminated, and more benefits being added.How can this be The answer lies in eliminating private insurance administration waste and negotiating down the cost of prescription drugs. Private insurance companies spend 13.2% of premiums on administration; the current Medicare program spends 2.3% on administration. Our drug prices, currently the highest in the world, also would be dramatically reduced. Under either M4A bill, current Medicare restrictions on negotiating with pharmaceutical companies would be abolished, leading to savings of at least 10 percent and perhaps as much as 40 percent. Over time other health care savings would also be possible.Overall spending under M4A would decrease even though federal spending would increase. The necessary federal revenue would be obtained not by increasing the amount of money paid for health care but instead by redirecting money now flowing through the profit-seeking private health care bureaucracy. The funds would flow instead through the federal government and then on directly to hospitals, physicians, and other health care professionals.The pandemic has made the perils of poor coordination starkly vivid, creating confusion about how to organize testing for the disease, how to distribute scarce equipment, and how to proceed in testing treatments. Under M4A, the federal government would be motivated to make public health activities more effective. At present, failures in public health increase health care costs primarily for private insurance companies. Except for higher costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the government suffers no financial consequence for failing to prevent disease. These mismatched incentives result in underfunding of public health.COVID-19 and the national protests over George Floyd’s brutal killing have put the costliness and inequality of U.S. health care on full view. Early in the pandemic, New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo astutely observed that the net effect of bailouts and temporary expansion of federal public health entitlements was “Medicare for All But Just For This One Disease.’’ We know that M4A would serve us well beyond the current pandemic and the current surge of social unrest.The preponderance of research shows that the cost of M4A is not an obstacle to its implementation. The principal obstacle has been fear of the unknown, but this fear is now more than counterbalanced by fears of the pandemic and uprising. We must seize this opportunity to build heightened public awareness of our defective system to become better informed, and to take action. We must build on the growing political will to enact universal health care and to manage the transition to it.Gordon Mosser, M.D., is a Senior Fellow in the Division of Health Policy and Management at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health."

It was stating that the School Board has decided that students need to continue to learn online. The article discusses how the student will stay online, but this is not the best choice for our students and children.Understandably, schools are having reopening issues due to COVID, but students suffer from not having a traditional education. As a college student and a sister to a fourth-grader, I see how online learning impacts her and not being as effective as a traditional class. Online learning is causing issues between students, parents and teachers. Students are not getting the necessary help that they need, and it has become frustrating for parents. Issues that have come up during online learning are issues with the technology and with parents that do not understand how to use the applications or devices. Parents were promised a tutorial in using the technical programs, but there was no tutorial given. Students are also missing the crucial socialization that they get when in class with their peers. As a college student, I see the same struggles with my education. I have a hard time getting help from teachers, as some do not respond to emails. The classes are becoming more self-taught than having a teacher teach us the material. Students rely on other sources to help understand the material, which is the same for some K-12 students.As I mentioned before, COVID is making life hard for everyone, but we need to do more for our children and students. Students need to return to school, and there are ways to return students to school safely. Suggestions that could help with this is to sanitize all high touched items such as doorknobs or desks. Students and teachers can wear masks, use hand sanitizer as needed, and separate desks six feet apart. We need to get our students back into the schools. This can happen if everyone in the community comes together and understands that online learning is impacting our children negatively.Emily BoychuckWakefieldOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Even if you don’t plan to make any indoor stops on your trip, it’s a good idea to carry it with you anyway, just in case you need it.But AAA Tidewater Virginia is sounding the alarm that hanging a mask, or any other item, from your rearview mirror is a bridge too far.Just as not wearing a mask is a safety hazard, hanging a mask or anything that obstructs your view from your rearview mirror is a safety hazard, as well. So while you should keep your mask with you at all times, we recommend finding a place for it where you will remember it and can easily access it that doesn’t block your view.“Having a clear field of vision is extremely important for your safety,” said AAA Tidewater Virginia spokesperson Holly Dalby. “Items such as masks, air fresheners, parking placards or anything else that reduces your ability to see things around you is a safety hazard and could increase your risk for a crash.”In a typical city, a driver encounters as many as 200 situations per mile. The eyes provide nearly 90% of the information needed to respond to road conditions, traffic patterns, signs and signals. Spotting signs is largely a function of side vision. Obstructing this field of vision, even partially, can cause you to miss things that should be seen, such as signs, pedestrians, wildlife, motorcycles, bikes or other vehicles.In Virginia, drivers are not allowed to hang anything from their rearview mirrors while driving, including handicap placards. You should remove these while the vehicle is in motion.Let’s all stay safe during this pandemic by wearing our masks, and by not keeping them on our rearview mirrors.Some other vision-related driver safety tips include:On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_64,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When the pandemic broke out, the Star Tribune reported a record number of guns sold on Good Friday — we can guess a good number by Christians. I know friends and relatives who have purchased guns to protect themselves and family.Good Friday is the day when the church remembers when Jesus refused the “protection” of violence. He scolded Peter, “No more of this!” — “Put away your sword. Those who take the sword perish by the Sword.” Early Church fathers said, “When Jesus disarmed Peter he disarmed all Christians.”Missing in the conversation and soul searching today over police shootings and historical lynchings of Black Americans is the urgent question: Are both George Floyd and Officer Derek Chauvin victims of religious beliefs that have little to do with what Jesus lived and taught regarding justified killing and violenceSome years ago, a colleague and I attended a lecture by Lt. Col. David Grossman, author of the book “On Killing.” Both of us work on veterans’ issues, including healing moral injuries and traumatic memories. There was so much local interest by police, sheriffs, military and first responders for the topic and the speaker that it had to be moved to a larger venue.Grossman noted that four policemen had been killed in the line of duty the previous year. That same year more than 400 police had committed suicide. Grossman felt the problem behind the suicides was the officers hadn’t developed “bulletproof minds” — facing the fact that they were going to have to kill. “There’s an evil world and people out there; people out there are dangerous and you have to be ready to kill,” he said.Lt. Col. Grossman and I both identify as Christian and during my two years of combat infantry training for the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, I experienced earlier versions of “killology” training aimed at overriding our natural resistance to killing.The New Testament indicates an aversion to kill is God given. Grossman was bothered by the fact that while new strategies have succeeded in getting more men to kill — in Vietnam, 90-95% of the troops fired at the enemy — over five times as many have commuted suicide than have been killed in combat since then. Currently at least 20 veterans per day commit suicide and more languish in psych wards, suffering from PTSD, moral injury and other ills. (I have no question that had I implemented in actual combat what I had been taught, I would be a psychiatric basket case and wouldn’t be writing this article. Over the past decade Grossman’s remedy — developing “bulletproof/warrior minds” — has invaded police departments and influenced police officers’ attitudes. Officers Jeronimo Yanez, who shot Philando Castile, and Chauvin reported taking similar training to the training I had in the infantry.If Jesus in the Garden had responded in the way Yanez, Chauvin and I had been trained to respond, there would be no Christianity. If Jesus had instructed his disciples to go “get the other ear” he would have been another warrior lost in history. But he responded with mercy and love, healing the sliced ear of the high priest’s servant — the very person who eventually took him to his death — forgiving the soldiers and religious authorities who were executing him because they “didn’t know what they were doing.” Responding the way he did revealed a different reality behind what we think is real.Those authorities thought they were justified in killing Jesus — that they were following God’s will. But in dying the way Jesus did, he revealed a God who loves all humanity, including those executing him — one who identifies with the victims throughout history, not the victimizers.All of us can agree that Jesus did not advocate random chaotic violence. So that leaves the Christian Church with the question: Did Jesus live and teach justified violence or did Jesus live and teach nonviolence If he advocated justified violence, when and where did Jesus say violence and killing are OKGandhi said, “The only people who don’t see Jesus as nonviolent are Christians.”Indeed, the Christianity community has killed more people in wars than any other identifiable group in the last 1,700-plus years. It was not always thus. For its first 300 years it was pacific. Despite several attempts by the Roman Empire to eradicate it, Christianity grew by leaps and bounds because followers found something more powerful than dominative coercive power: the power of mercy, compassion, healing and love for both friends and enemies.Early Christians believed that compassionate love was power that not even death could destroy. They did not retaliate when attacked, even refusing to protect themselves against people taking them to their execution. Plus, Christians couldn’t be in the fighting Roman army and kill or they would excommunicated. No church writer in the first 300 years did anything other than condemn violence. Nonviolence was church Orthodoxy.That changed when Constantine legitimatized Christianity and gave the movement buildings, wealth and property. A Constantinian Christianity began a downward spiral toward violence in order to protect its assets. As a result the rest of the world does not see Christians as “lambs” but as violent victimizers. The church’s quest for property, money and markets is linked with the growth of Western Civilization, Crusades, the Inquisition, the Doctrine of Discovery, the Holocaust, milestones of white supremacy — including religiously legitimatized slavery and the slaughter of Indigenous people.Justified killing is manifestly legal. However, is it consistent with what Jesus lived and taught Jesus came to bring peace. His church no longer is a peaceful salt and leaven in the world, which hardly looks more peaceful than 2,000 plus years ago. The church — Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Evangelical — continues to believe that governmental legitimacy, wealth, privilege and prerogative is preferable to following Jesus’ way.Allan Bostelmann, LICSW Emeritus, is a U.S. Army Infantry veteran.

eugeneweekly_2020_35,"We ve got issues. It is painful to see harm come to the people and the places you love. The recent fires in the McKenzie Valley and other parts of western Oregon have been heartbreaking because we have personal connections, from the practical to the spiritual. We all want to help put it right, to rebuild community, to renew chances to make lives and make memories. It will take time, sacrifice and a groundswell of support. It can begin with land and water. Starting last week a group of local organizations comprising the Pure Water Partners deployed staff to meet with landowners who’d lost homes and trees and surroundings along the McKenzie River. The assessments will help identify priorities and bring resources for site cleanup, hazard removal, erosion and run-off prevention, and replanting. All of these actions will reduce the impacts of fire on the McKenzie. That river provides drinking water to most of us reading this paper, dozens of miles downstream. I chair the board of one of those member organizations, and see its recovery work today as both a responsibility and a privilege. There is a way you can help directly, both for near-term needs and for the long-haul resilience in the community. On the voting ballot this month is a pennies per day measure (20-312 that will support the Upper Willamette Soil and Water Conservation District. The UWSWCD is the public’s voice in water and soil conservation, and represents all citizens of eastern Lane County. The measure will also fund habitat conservation work by partner organizations in each of the four upper Willamette watersheds. It will reach across urban and rural water and soil. It will directly support local farmers and gardeners. It will provide students with a doorway to the natural world and to careers in natural resources. It will strengthen the natural infrastructure that is rooted in the High Cascades and is networked throughout our communities. Clean water and healthy lands are basic human rights. When the latest fire is a memory, the local stewardship of land and water will still be challenged as Lane County grows and changes in sometimes unpredictable ways. We need stable funding to ensure their care, not completely dependent on the currently fickle stream of grants derived from lottery revenue. We need your support, and we need your involvement. The Soil and Water Conservation District Board members are voter-selected. After casting your ballot in favor of Measure 20-312, please consider joining us in this work. You can learn more about us at UWSWCD.org and about the ballot measure at CleanWaterandHealthysoil.com. Caring for each other begins with caring for places we all call home. We’re fortunate to have rich soils and abundant clean water in Lane County. With your support, we can keep it that way for generations to come.

The world was at standstill, sports were canceled, and the everyday life we knew was shutting down around us.The world was quiet for once, and everyone’s undivided attention was turned to the news as it unfolded on May 25, 2020, of an unarmed black man that was killed by the police during an arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota. There were four police officers involved in his senseless murder. The former officer’s name is Derek Chauvin; he had his knee on George Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, which led to his death. The entire arrest was caught on camera by people of the community that were standing nearby, and the former officers still did not stop knowing they were being recorded, and while Mr. Floyd was begging for his life by stating “I can’t breathe” multiple times.That day, it became apparent that we are not only fighting a respiratory virus, but another virus called racism. Due to the coronavirus, the entire world was outraged behind his death and enticed protests in all 50 states and more than 12 countries. We must stand up for what is right in a time where we have the attention and platform to get the message of “Justice for all” across to a system that was not designed to protect people of color. We must obey laws that were set up to hinder us, not protect us from the very ones to protect and serve our communities.In a time like this, a leader with words of encouragement is direly needed to unite the country and not tear it apart from the head down. The time for change is now. For many years, we have been reminded that we are not that far from slavery by the Confederate flags and statues around the country that still stand to this day. With our voices being heard, they are being taken down slowly and quietly, but they are not going unnoticed by the white supremacist groups who recognize those monuments as history.As black people, we are tired of being unheard, murdered because of the color of our skin. We are humans, we have rights, and we deserve justice like everyone else in the justice system. This November, we must vote for change to ensure we keep going in the right direction of getting the justice we demand, not only protest and march. As a race, we must remain united to get the respect we deserve as citizens, business owners, scientists, politicians and lawmakers of our communities to enforce the change.

minnpost_2020_154,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Like many people in this era of quarantine and social distancing, I’ve turned to uplifting news stories, gripping novels, and entertaining podcasts for solace and diversion. But for deeper insight I’ve been rereading theBook of Job.To recap: By almost any standard, Job would be considered a real civic leader. He’s wealthy and by the time’s standards “blameless and upright.” The New English Bible reports he owns 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 asses, and many slaves. He cares for the needy, and when he enters the public square, high-ranking citizens listen respectfully to his opinions. He’s the kind of person publishers might pursue to write a best-seller, “Top Ten Leadership Lessons from Job of Uz.”Yet God agrees to let Satan deprive Job of all his wealth, his sons and daughters, and even his own health. Satan has presented a challenge: Let’s see if Job remains so righteous and God-fearing once his fortunes have turned and he’s brought low.Job is left with next to nothing and afflicted with “running sores from head to foot.” He launches into a lengthy lament of self-defense and demands that God show up and explain why he’s being so mistreated.Finally, God relents and (in effect says from the whirlwind: “Listen up! Look around. Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundations Did you set the boundaries between land and sea Do you control the weather and the seasons Do you determine the laws of nature on earth“Just take a look at all the marvelous wild creatures in the world. They accomplish amazing feats without your help.”At last, Job drops his defenses and his eyes are opened to his lack of control over creation and his relative insignificance in the universe. He repents his former ignorance and arrogance.In times of crisis, we humans are easily tempted to turn to seemingly powerful men and women; humans understandably yearn for the all-seeing savior, or the guarantor of better times. Yet, Job’s story points away from such illusory hope.The writer of Job offers a powerful counter-punch to an old (still familiar story: that material success is a sign of God’s favor and deserved by those who are widely celebrated (even if their success stems from forced labor . The Job story admonishes all of us who are leaders, would-be leaders, and engaged followers to pay attention, to be humble about our own abilities to control outcomes, and to harmonize our actions with natural systems. It prompts us to remember that we must care for our earthly habitat.An especially vital leadership skill just now is storytelling that makes sense of our current tragedy and offers a vision of a sustainable future. What, then, is the story that wise leaders and followers might convey today Perhaps it’s simply a modern version of the Job story, one that points out the limitations of powerful people and nations, celebrates the awe-ful beauty of the natural world, and recognizes that the most sustainable leadership is vested in a host of collaborative leaders and engaged followers.People are hungry for such stories. Witness the response to the bedtime tale and YouTube sensation “The Great Realisation” or to former President George W. Bush’s recentvideo message.It took a lot to get Job’s attention, and the massive global pandemic has finally awakened more and more people to the planet’s fragility and the interconnected fate of its human societies. Let us craft a host of new stories that help us act on these insights.Barbara C.

The only state to miss the safe harbor deadline was Wisconsin, due to a Thursday court hearing — meaning that Badger State electors will be the only ones subject to congressional challenge.Tuesday, even as the Supreme Court declined an attempt by Trump allies to overturn Pennsylvania’s results, Texas’ attorney general asked the high court to block four other states from filing their Electoral College votes because they adjusted their voting procedures to enfranchise people during the COVID pandemic.

philinquirer_2020_8,"Police academy recruits should be unarmed in the first phase of their training because it would teach them to reflexively open the distance with people in crisis, use cover, and de-escalate.The killing of Walter Wallace Jr. by policeshows just how much and how little has changed in the last year in both Philadelphia and across the nation.Last November, as a Vermont chief of police and a 19-year New York Police Department veteran, I publishedan op-edin the New York Times where I argued police shouldn’t be so quick to shoot people in crisis armed with knives. I argued that police academy recruits should be unarmed in the first phase of their training because it would teach them to reflexively open the distance with people in crisis, use cover, and de-escalate. Officers would learn not to yell stress-inducing, escalatory commands because they wouldn’t have the lethal weapons that give these orders force. They could then be trained on firearms as life insurance, not problem-solving tools.Police around the country dismissed these arguments as dangerous ones that pandered to policing’s critics. Countless police academies still show recruits video after video of officers being attacked and killed under every circumstance. Many still teach recruits the fallacious “21-foot rule,” that anyone with a knife who gets within 21 feet of them can stab officers before they have time to react. The statewide police academy in Vermont had a scenario where it punched recruits hard enough in the head to knock them unconscious as a lesson for taking their eyes off a hitchhiker for a moment.It had to be suedby an injured recruitto stopgiving its trainees brain trauma.» READ MORE:Reimagining policing: 14 ways to change a broken system | OpinionThe day my op-ed came out, I had an interview with Philadelphia city officials. They were looking for a new police commissioner.Danielle Outlaw got the position, which she richly deserved, but my discussions with City Hall were illuminating. They had a genuine interest in reducing use of force by police but were concerned by a lack of progress. I told them that to change an agency the size of the Philadelphia Police Department would take a decade, it would require more racial and gender diversity, and it had to be doggedly sustained through the inevitable changes in administration.I know from experience that changing a police department culture is a tall order.In 2016, my police officers in Burlington, Vt., killed a schizophrenic man armed with two knives. They shot himwhen Tasers failedto safely end a four-hour standoff. The painful lessons we learned from that led us to help the Police Executive Research Forum develop and pilot apathbreaking de-escalation curriculumdesigned for armed people in crisis. It incorporates the distance, cover, de-escalation, and communication that reduce the need for split-second decisions that can lead to gunfire.Last week, the International Association of Chiefs of Police announced thata randomized controlled trialof the program in a major metropolitan police department showed it works to reduce the use of force while keeping officers safe. Yet, most of the nation’s 17,000 police departments haven’t adopted anything that resembles it.» READ MORE:Reforming police requires action, not commissions | OpinionChange in Philadelphia will require its police to get over the idea that a person in crisis with a knife is a death sentence unless they open fire. In England and Wales, where knives are the norm and beat cops don’t have guns, police rarely shoot and kill more thanfive people a year, compared with 1,000 in the U.S.The death of Walter Wallace Jr. is proof of how wide the gap has grown between what U.S. police are trained to do and the restraint the public expects of them. The tactics are there, the training has been developed, and for America’s police leaders to ignore this historic opportunity will result in nothing but more unnecessary killing.Brandon del Pozo is a drug policy researcher at Miriam Hospital/Brown University in Providence, R.I.

Especially for those of us of a certain age. It’s a sensory experience in which the glaring blue light of our digital age falls woefully short. Sitting at our kitchen table with a cup of coffee or tea in the morning turning the pages of our hometown newspaper is somehow more comforting than ever. Reading about the good work of our friends and neighbors is uplifting in these troubled times.Lone Star Lakes is another comfort for the senses and a jewel in Suffolk’s crown of Parks & Recreation. Right now is the perfect time to visit. It is sparkling! The leaves are turning, and the beautiful lakes are a mirror for all the splendor that is happening in the canopy above. The roads have been recently paved, so it is perfect for walking or riding bikes. If you like fishing or boating, it has numerous quiet places to launch your canoe, kayak or small fishing boat. Suffolk Parks & Recreation offers canoe and kayak tours if you want to learn. Look for their ad in the SNH.I would like to commend Susan Saunders, our local voter registrar, for making our voting experience in Suffolk very comfortable. It is obvious that a lot of preparation and hard work went into planning the logistics for this year’s election challenges. Information about voting has been made available in the paper, and cards were sent to Suffolk residents by mail explaining the process for voting early in person, early by mail, or in person on Nov. 3.At first I was very apprehensive about the whole thing. I thought I’d vote early by mail, but decided to vote in person early. When I arrived at the registrar’s office on Market Street, there was no line. There was a person working the parking lot to point out where to park, then there was someone to welcome me at the door. There was a pleasant, socially distanced person smiling behind a mask all along the way. Where else does that happen?I checked in, got my ballot and voted. Easy! There were a number of friendly Suffolk folks coming and going in ones and twos doing the same. We nodded to each other with a certain inner calm knowing we had made a good choice.

minnpost_2020_72,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .This is the 14th ina series of occasional commentaries on the judicial systemfrom the perspective of a District Court judge. The author is now retired.As a young assistant U.S. attorney in the 1970s, I sometimes wondered if the reporters and I were sitting through the same proceedings. There were reporters who would focus on something they thought would make for good copy but which had little importance to the case I was trying. But in time I came to have a high regard for reporters who took pains to accurately describe proceedings in a fair and balanced manner.That’s not to say the news media always performs admirably. Reporters are human; they don’t always report as accurately as they should. Neither do reporters and editors always make the best choices about what to include and exclude from an article.Unfortunately, the news media isn’t always ready to acknowledge its shortcomings; it wants to be the judge of its own fallibility. A past experience with the press is a good example. At the start of the football season in 2017, I wrote an op-ed that was critical about how the news media treated a young woman who had come forward to report she had been sexually assaulted by several University of Minnesota football players. I had some knowledge of the matter because the young woman and the players had appeared before me in court on a request for a harassment restraining order.At the hearing, the young woman testified for an entire morning on direct and cross examination — approximately three hours — describing in agonizing detail what she said happened during the night in question. The restraining order issue settled over the noon hour, but the next day the news media failed to detail the young woman’s testimony, notwithstanding the columns of copy and on-air time the media had dedicated to the dispute in the days prior.It wasn’t until six weeks later, when the University of Minnesota Disciplinary Report relating the sordid events on the night in question was leaked to the media, that news organizations finally reported in detail what the young woman said happened. In the meantime, the reporting made it seem as though the players were being treated unfairly because they hadn’t been criminally charged.As a judge, I couldn’t comment until after the matter was finalized and even the possibility of further proceedings was extinguished. But after some of the football players were expelled or suspended and the time for appeals of the administrative process had run, I submitted to the Star Tribune the op-ed, entitled, “It Was All About Football — When the Media Lost Sight of Human Values.” I expressed how appalled I was at how the press reported on the matter. I hoped that if there were similar complaints of athlete sexual misconduct in the future, the news media would report more fairly.The Star Tribune didn’t publish it. That was the paper’s right — a newspaper doesn’t have to publish any article, including one that comments critically on its coverage. But refusing to acknowledge criticism does little to bolster the news media in the public’s eye. In an era when the president repeatedly decries what he says is “fake news” and singles out the media as an “enemy of the people,” it may be natural for the press to seek comfort by refusing criticism — but it won’t garner the respect that the press seeks and deserves.But the Star Tribune also published several articles about the denial of its request for the juror names. It even published an article to announce that one other media entity joined its motion — as though that’s news. Equally concerning is that the paper’s articles tended to be one sided, drawing principally on their own attorney’s arguments, the statements of their own selected expert and their own managing editor — as though those are the authorities on which public opinion and the courts should rely.Now the Star Tribune is using the same strategy because it disagrees with an order filed in the George Floyd murder case limiting access to some evidence, pretrial. The Star Tribune and others filed a motion asking that the order be rescinded, as is their right. The motion will be heard and decided by the court.But rather than respect the judicial process, the Star Tribune is again using its pulpit to try to influence public opinion and the courts. Prominent on the first page of its State section last week was a one-sided article summarizing the press’ argument without input from any adverse party, and before the court has heard or ruled on its motion. The article says the Star Tribune filed a motion “chastising the court,” which is exactly what its article is attempting to do — outside the judicial process.What is concerning is the theme that emerges from the paper’s conduct. On the one hand, the paper is reluctant to allow itself to be criticized; it wants to be the judge of its own fallibility. On the other hand, the paper isn’t reluctant to use its position to advance its view of the fallibility of others.Whatever merit the Star Tribune motions may have, using its position as a news organization to advance its interests in court is unacceptable — it’s an inappropriate use of its power in a community in which the Star Tribune dominates the news.Respect for the press is important to a strong, democratic society. So when the press doesn’t do as well as it should, or when it uses its position to advance its own interests, or demonstrates disrespect for the judicial process, it should be all right to point it out. The press isn’t perfect, and if it understands that fact, perhaps the press will do a better job the next time — if so, we’ll all benefit.Mel Dicksteinrecently retired as a judge inHennepin County District Court, where he handled a mix of civil and criminal cases.

They may also be using the computers at the library for such vital tasks as communicating with family and friends, seeking health care, registering to vote, obtaining government identification, completing schoolwork and more.In other words, the computers at the library are not just for fun and games. They are a lifeline for people who do not have any other access to computers or the internet.The past 10 months have been a hardship on these people, as Suffolk’s public libraries have been closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. While closing the libraries was a necessary move to prevent community spread, it also cut off this means of access to people who need it.Thankfully, libraries and recreational centers will be opening for technology access this Monday, as reported by Rachel Wartian in this edition.“Access to technology is a great need in our community, especially during COVID-19, and we are pleased to be able to provide access to a variety of options including internet accessible computers in our libraries and recreation centers,” Library Director Clint Rudy stated.The city’s two main library branches, as well as the recreation centers at East Suffolk and Whaleyville, will have hours starting Monday when technology access will be available. There are protocols that must be followed, of course — users must wear a face covering, take a health assessment and abide by a one-hour time limit. They also must have what’s needed ordinarily for access: for example, a free library card for the library or a recreation center membership for the rec centers.However, we’re glad to see this move taking place to allow people to get access to this needed service once again. Appreciation is due to Rudy, Parks & Rec Director Mark Furlo and other city staff who have worked on this project.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Skate parks in the Hilo is something that should’ve been done a while ago. Skate parks would be something that anyone could visit, not just skaters. I believe that skaters should have a designated spot to skate instead of having to use public spaces and buildings as a substitute for a park or a ramp to skate on.Hilo needs skate parks, Although I don’t skate, why not think about the kids and skaters that do skate? They don’t cause any trouble; they are just trying to have fun. Having more skate parks means more kids would be happy. I know they would greatly benefit from it.I know some people will say that making more skate parks makes a bigger problem with more skaters. I understand, but the only reason these skaters are a problem is because they don’t have a designated spot to skate, so they basically skate in places they shouldn’t. Skaters deserve to have fun, too.I believe that it is important that we make skate parks in Hilo. It would be fun for everyone.

suffolknewsherald_2020_96,"Published 10:49 pm Friday, June 5, 2020ByStaff ReportsWe’ll say it unequivocally again.Black. Lives. Matter.You might reply, “All lives matter.” To that we say, of course they do. But all lives cannot matter until the lives of African Americans and other people of color matter just as much in this country as white lives do.And right now, while it should be true, it just isn’t.The nation was reminded of that again about two weeks ago, when George Floyd died in Minnesota after a trio of police officers held him down, one with his knee on his neck, until well after he had become unresponsive. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after arriving via ambulance.It was reminded on March 13, when police in Louisville, Ky., broke down the door to the home of Breonna Taylor, a local EMT, with a no-knock warrant, supposedly as part of a drug investigation. No drugs were found in her apartment, but police shot her in her own home.It was reminded in May, when the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery on Feb. 23 in Glynn County, Ga., finally came to light when a radio station posted video of the shooting. In that shooting, two or three white vigilantes in their trucks chased Arbery as he jogged, hit him with one of the trucks and then shot him.These are only some of the most recent incidents in a country with a long, long, long history of violent injustices perpetrated against people of color by white authorities, vigilantes and mobs.But in the past couple of weeks, just since George Floyd’s death, the tide seems to be shifting. Could it be that the horrible weight of the evidence available in Floyd’s case — the nine-minute video that clearly shows plain and simple murder of a handcuffed black man by police officers — is finally crashing down on Americans who had thus far managed to convince themselves that there is no such thing as systemic racism? That there is no such thing as white privilege? That if people of color would just not commit crimes, not resist arrest and politely do what they’re told, they wouldn’t get killed?It’s past time to seek justice in America, not just for the privileged few, but for everybody.

minnpost_2020_142,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The death of George Floyd at the hands of officer Derek Chauvin, whose record of brutality is well known, shows that years of police reform efforts to educate and retrain officers have failed. Decade after decade, the so-called bad apples remain in abundance on the Minneapolis police force. Systematic brutality, harassment and killing goes unabated.It appears it’s police officers who control the police, not the City Council, not the mayor and not the police chief. If they did, officers like Chauvin would long ago have been terminated. It is time elected officials admit what is common knowledge in the community; they are not in control of the police.If city officials are serious they must take actions to clean out the MPD.The black community is well aware of the extent of this infection. They experience it daily. As the record of Chauvin illustrates, their firsthand knowledge is routinely ignored. A measure of the lack of accountability is data that showssince 2012, individuals filed 2,600 misconduct complaints against MPD officers, yet only 12 officers were disciplined.At a press conference on May 31, St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter mentioned the legal and legislative roadblocks long in the way of meaningful change in policing. These include police union contracts and state and federal laws limiting the legal parameters available to extend community control over policing. Clearly the steps advocated here would require substantial revisions of existing law and contracts; however, they offer a constructive platform for further discussion.Carter and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey both said that Minnesota cannot allow another death like that of George Floyd. If not, they warn our community would likely suffer through another rebellion and more violence. As is evident in the demands emanating from the protesters and community leaders, this must begin with convictions in the death of George Floyd.Some 40 years ago, black activists raised the demand for community control of policing practices and those who patrol their communities. A model developed by Chicago activists and political leaders offers a detailed account of how community control could function. Briefly defined, community control means active citizen involvement in the policies, hiring and oversight of police. As a friend of mine says, black taxpayers are paying for a law enforcement system that acts as an oppressor in their own community.In Minneapolis, once the roadblocks are removed, meaningful change must begin with an agreement that all current police officers reapply for their jobs. Those who have committed acts of brutality should not be rehired. Community members will sit on interview boards and review officers’ records in cooperation with legal input, law enforcement personnel and experts from outside the department and MPD officials.Existing hiring procedures across the nation typically fall under the sole jurisdiction of law enforcement officials. In some locations, community members play an advisory role, but lack any authority. The recruitment process is largely self-selective, in that individuals who want to become law enforcement officers simply enroll in an accredited academic program. Depending on the state, there may be some checkpoints along the way for psychological fitness, but given the routine, persistent levels of police brutality and harassment, these are clearly ineffective.Dustin Schwarze and Mark Ringgenberg, those involved in the 2015 killing of Jamar Clark, had a record of overzealous policing and/or profiling while employed by other police departments, yet were hired by Minneapolis. A hiring committee that includes black residents would likely have rejected their applications.Steps toward community control of police:The goal of moving toward community control is to create a relationship between officers and citizens that leads to safer neighborhoods, less crime and more rewarding work for law enforcement officers. The rehiring process advocated here, in itself, offers a truth and reconciliation process during the interview, retraining and probationary periods.In light of the public outcry over the ongoing incidents of officers killing unarmed African-Americans and other people of color around the nation and in the Twin Cities, it is difficult to imagine any other route to fair policing and safer neighborhoods.Wayne Nealis is a writer and longtime peace and labor activist living in Minneapolis."
minnpost_2020_0,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Being in government means I have the responsibility to practice this in the policies we enact. Unfortunately, that’s not how Senate Republicans see it, despite so many of their own proclamations of faith.And as a daughter of a single mom who counted on food stamps and housing aid to make ends meet, I knowgovernmentis integral to keeping Minnesota’s promise to care for those in need. During our most recent session this month, Senate Republicans stopped the Legislature from providing critical support to the very people our faiths implore us to protect: the poor, the elderly, and the homeless.Minnesotans are struggling to put food on the table or keep a roof over their heads. But Senate Republicans stopped a one-time emergency payment of $500 to our lowest-income families. I can’t imagine a time when these funds could have helped working and struggling families more: months into a pandemic that has devastated their way of life and a few weeks before Christmas. But the truth is for Senate Republicans, the very notion of this one-time money – which wouldn’t have raised any taxes — was a non-starter. They left out our poorest children and families.The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for Minnesota’s long-term care facilities. Residents are older and many have underlying medical conditions, making them more susceptible to serious symptoms or death due to COVID-19. This risk was compounded by the congregate living settings and staffing shortages that existed long before the pandemic. While our administration’s Five-Point Plan successfully mitigated some of this impact, many of these strategies – like emergency staffing, testing programs, and case management – cost money. Without further funding, these life-saving strategies could end. Despite Republicans repeatedly claiming Minnesota should prioritize long-term care response, they decided to stop funding these critical efforts. They left out our elders in long-term care.And finally, our neighbors experiencing homelessness are especially susceptible to the impacts of COVID-19. They are five times more likely to end up in the hospital or ICU than Minnesotans in general. Bringing people inside safely from the cold is life-saving work, and essential to keeping hospital beds open and reducing demand on heroic health care workers. But even once inside, shelters are often crowded. Tight quarters limit safe places to distance and isolate from others, which is critical to stopping the spread of the virus. Along with the DFL caucuses in the House and Senate, we requested funding to provide services to adults, youth, and families experiencing homelessness. This funding would maintain access to spaces where Minnesotans experiencing homelessness can safely isolate and provide more support for shelters and outreach workers who are doing critical work to keep COVID cases low among Minnesota’s homeless population.I am grateful that the federal government’s recent relief bill will support many of the programs we fought for – but we know there was a lot left out at both the federal and state level. It will not fix the gaps that Senate Republicans have chosen not to fill. As Minnesotans, we have long prided ourselves on setting aside politics for the greater good. We donate food to the hungry, coats to the cold, and gifts to those who wouldn’t otherwise have them under the tree. Never is that tradition more celebrated than during the holiday season – and at a time when COVID has laid bare disparities that many Minnesotans face, never has that tradition been more needed.As we celebrate, we are called to be generous, to hope, to love one another. This pandemic isn’t over, and neither is our fight for Minnesotans. As we move toward a new year and a new legislative session, I am more determined than ever to fight for our Minnesota values so that we can continue to care for Minnesotans who need us most.Peggy Flanaganis the lieutenant governor of Minnesota."
eugeneweekly_2020_23,"We ve got issues. Ientered the criminal justice system 8,643 days ago. I was 17 years old. My crime shocked many, including myself. I was sentenced to 25 years to life in the penitentiary. Now, at 41, I am 15 months from appearing before the Board of Parole for the first time. There I will face a panel of three who know me only by an inch-thick institution file. I will need to explain what I did and why I did it and who I am. I am terrified. I’ve heard from other prisoners that the parole board puts more focus on the crime committed than the growth and insight gained in the many years after conviction. I will have to relive that moment. I will have to articulate it in a way that shows that I am no longer that boy prone to outbursts of violence. I am a man who has spent more than two decades struggling with shame for what brought me here. My future depends on how I explain it. I must write a parole packet that includes all the minute details of my crime, the programming I’ve participated in and an overview of why I should be paroled — something that I inherently understand isn’t deserved. I have become an award-winning writer while incarcerated, but I’m finding it extremely difficult trying to write this document for the board. I worry that my words, real and heartfelt to me, will be interpreted as cheap and meaningless when considering the permanence of the harm I caused as a teen. My family and friends tell me to trust. They tell me to listen to my heart and just write. So I do. I’m writing about the shame I feel. I’m writing about accountability and remorse, and how I’ve grown to completely understand the importance of my choices. Even the small choices. Especially the small choices. Sitting inside my cell, I write draft after draft by hand. My garbage can often piles up and spills over with wadded up paper, all these versions which fail to tell the story of who I am. I strive for complete transparency. I want to write with my chest torn wide open. I owe the truth. Nothing but. I’ve been working on this document for seven years, and I’ll keep working on it for 15 more months. It’s not just my lifeline; it’s my understanding of myself today and how I got to where I am. My peers, many who’ve seen the Board of Parole themselves, often tell me that I will do fine. They say that I will likely be given a second chance by a board who will recognize the hard work I’ve done. They tell me that my long resume of clear conduct, educational achievement, leadership opportunities and programming speaks for itself. At times I feel hope. But I also feel its absence amidst the humble understanding that continued incarceration is not unmerited for the crime I committed. Some things can’t be erased or rewritten.

Maria could no longer move around. All her smiles, laughs, and babbles had turned into a cold stare. She had increasingly become irritable over the last two months, but her parents thought it was one of the changes associated with child development.After some tests, Maria was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor and was referred to a hospital for specialist care. Doctors did emergency surgery to help relieve the pressure on her brain, hoping to improve her chances of survival. The months that followed were extremely tough for little Maria and her parents, with frequent hospital visits and admissions for cancer therapy and managing complications. Her parents struggled to understand medical information and keep up with both Maria’s health needs and their own emotional needs. After a nine-month journey with brain cancer, Maria passed away.Cancer is theleading cause of non-injury-related mortalitiesamong children 0-19 years in the United States. Each year about15,590 new cases of childhood cancerare diagnosed, with an expected1,780 mortalities. Childhood cancers often differ from adult cancer and arenot strongly linked to lifestyle,but they have been linked tosome biological and environmental factorsthat may have existed during either the prenatal or postnatal period.Childhood cancer survival has greatly improved over the last four decades as a result of scientific advancements in detection and treatment, with84% of children now having a five-year survivalrate. Despite the significant improvement in the overall survival rate of childhood cancers, thousands of young lives are still lost annually from cancer. Minority children are disproportionately affected, having more than38% increasedrisk of death compared to whites.The estimated direct cost of cancer carefor each hospital stay for a child with cancer is $40,400,and as much as$123 millionis spent on childhood cancer care annually. Aside from hospital stays related to the main cancer therapy, other factors such as infections, surgical complications, pain and nutritional deficiencies drive the frequency of hospital stays. There are also outpatient visits that disrupt parents’ or caregivers’ work schedules. Indirect costs of cancer care are incurred from providing the non-medical needs of the sick child, transportation to health facilities, and temporary accommodations during treatment. Direct and indirect costs, together with parental employment challenges arefinancially crippling for families impacted and worse so for the minority populations.Although progress has been made in cancer research and treatment, according to American Childhood Cancer Organization (ACCO , there is a longstanding existing gap in funding allocation for childhood and adult cancer research and treatment with more funds dedicated to adult cancers. Currently only4% of funds allocated to cancer research and treatment are dedicated to childhood cancer. This is woefully inadequate considering the impact of childhood cancer on our future generation. Previous efforts have led to improved treatment for childhood leukemia, which was previously the leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.There is an urgent need for the state and the entire country to be committed to investing in childhood cancer research and treatment to reduce the mortality associated with other cancer types — includingbrain and central nervous system tumors, which are currently the leading cause of childhood cancer deaths. To help eliminate the existing survival disparities, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP should be expanded to children from all racial and economic groups diagnosed with cancer and they should be granted equal access to care in specialized cancer centers where they can receive quality care from multidisciplinary teams.Joseline Haizel-Cobbina, M.D., is a graduating MPH student at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health."

Character and values should matter.While growing up, my family, friends, teachers and church taught me that we live in a world of diversity and should celebrate and honor it; that honesty, kindness to others and creatures, empathy before judgment, tolerance and civility give one integrity and earn them respect. These are values I believe in and cherish.

minnpost_2020_115,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Distrust, fear, and loathing of law enforcement has permeated African-American communities in the Twin Cities — with good reason — since long before the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. But even those most familiar with local law enforcement’s well-documented record of violence against Black, Native, and other marginalized communities may not realize just how far back those sentiments reach.Although it’s impossible to say with any certainty, evidence suggests that the relationship between Black people and law enforcement began seriously deteriorating in the Twin Cities in the late 1880s, when an African-American man was shot to death by a cop. It may well have been the first case of a law enforcement officer killing a Black Minnesotan — and it’s remained largely forgotten for more than a century.On the evening of Sept. 27, 1887, Ramsey County Sheriff Fred Richter shot and killed Tim Graham in the basement of the county jail in downtown St. Paul. Graham was 35 years old, married, and had worked until recently as the jail’s janitor. He had spent at least part of the evening he died drinking beer and playing cards in a nearby saloon. After leaving the bar, he had returned to his former place of employment and somehow gotten inside. It was there, in the jail’s basement, that he had his deadly encounter with Richter.As the sheriff would later testify, he didn’t realize at the time that the man he discovered in the basement was Graham. He insisted he thought Graham was an inmate trying to escape:I commanded him to come out and show himself. He made no effort to do so at first, and I pulled aside some of the clothing in order to obtain a look at his face. Just as I did so, the fellow bumped up against me, still endeavoring to screen his face, and pushed on out into the hallway leading to the street door. He did not heed my command to halt, but persisted in trying to reach the front door, as I supposed, whereupon I fired, and there is the result.Most local newspapers readily accepted Richter’s version of events. They also played up circumstances that reflected poorly on Graham — especially his alleged fondness for liquor. The St. Paul Globe reported that “a telltale flask in the right pocket of Graham’s sack coat showed that he had stimulated himself for the accomplishment of some purpose, probably murder.” But St. Paul’s most influential African-American newspaper, the Appeal, hinted that other, more nefarious motives on the sheriff’s part, were at play. “There is something beneath the surface that has not been brought to light,” the newspaper’s editor, John Quincy Adams, wrote, “and therefore a full investigation of the affair should be had.”A coroner’s jury met two days after the killing to examine its circumstances, but the outcome was never really in doubt. Five of the six jurors were white. The jury’s sixth member — African-American businessman Thomas Lyles — was the only one who seemed interested in pursuing the case further. After an hour and a half of deliberations, the jury ruled 5-to-1 that Richter was justified in killing Graham. Lyles was the sole dissenter.For many Black Twin Citians, the jury’s decision confirmed what they had always suspected — that justice was anything but colorblind in Minnesota. “Nothing that has transpired in this city since our advent seems to have so aroused the Colored citizens as the killing of Tim Graham by Sheriff Richter,” the Appeal declared. “The sentiment among them is almost unanimous, that the killing was unjustifiable, the verdict of the majority of the coroner’s jury to the contrary notwithstanding.” Compounding the injustice, the Appeal lamented, was the fact that outrage at the verdict was shared “by a large number of whites who are not so hide bound and affected with color prejudice, that they cannot render a just opinion where the two races are concerned.”On the evening after the jury’s decision was announced, Thomas Lyles and Rev. William Gray of Pilgrim Baptist Church called a community meeting to discuss possible responses. About three dozen people showed up. The participants discussed ways to bring the case before a grand jury, but they knew chances of a reversal were slim. If anyone advocated a public protest, the suggestion was not recorded. With so few options for justice available, the Appeal expressed the helplessness that many of its readers felt. “We have come to the conclusion,” John Quincy Adams wrote, “that that because a county officer, a white man, has killed only a Negro, nothing can be done about the matter.”A week later, a grand jury affirmed the decision of the coroner’s panel and cleared Richter.“And that settles it,” the Appeal concluded.From our vantage today, with outrage over the death of George Floyd spreading across the globe from Minneapolis, it’s hard to imagine how another killing at the hands of law enforcement, 133 years ago, failed to generate more than a few days’ headlines. But 1887 was a different time. With the previous census showing fewer than 500 Black residents in both St. Paul and Minneapolis, the Twin Cities African-American community did not possess the sheer numbers or political clout needed to effect major change. And despite the Appeal’s assertion of substantial support among white Minnesotans, there was little evidence to suggest that any of them were willing wage a fight for racial justice in the name of Tim Graham or any other Black victim.Those were the realities that Black Twin Citians had to cope with in 1887. And while succeeding generations have despaired that the outrages perpetrated by our criminal justice system continued as decades passed, we can at least hope that the energy evident in today’s protests will bring the kind of justice that Tim Graham was denied.Dave Kenney is a freelance writer specializing in Minnesota history."
minnpost_2020_24,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Rabbi Olitzky is the proud father of twins. When they were infants, he would dress his son in blue and his daughter in pink. Clearly this was gender stereotyping, but it was the least one could do to add order to the infant twin chaos.He was stunned and humbled when his son reached kindergarten and declared that his favorite Disney princess was Cinderella. This was not because Rabbi Olitzky was worried or ashamed that his son was a fan of a princess, but because his son clarified: “Abba, of course I love Cinderella — she’s the princess for boys because her dress is blue.” In that moment he realized how much he had erred and immediately became the student of his toddler teacher.Pastor Baudhuin is also a father of twins — identical girls. One of his favorite pictures of them is one that made it onto the Metrodome Jumbotron at their first baseball game in matching pink Minnesota Twins garb. In the summer of 2019, “baby A” came out as trans, identifying as male and preferring he/his pronouns. His identical twin sister posted on Instagram: “y’all, I have an identical twin brother!” Since then Pastor Baudhuin and his wife have been on a journey through legal name and gender changes for their son, all the while realizing that every Halloween since second grade their son has chosen a male character for his costume.Putting aside the issue and challenge of a binary gender model, let us be clear: Blue is not a “boys” color and pink is not a “girls” color. Further, both of us learned very quickly as young fathers (contrary to our own upbringings that there are not boy toys and there are not girl toys. All children can play with dolls. All children can play with trucks. All children can play sports. All children can play video games. All children can enjoy books. All children can enjoy arts and crafts.We therefore beg of the retailers that seek to woo us during this holiday season: Please stop the gender stereotyping! And pragmatically speaking, don’t you realize that you double your consumer base when you do not limit yourself to one side of the binary gender spectrumGift-giving during Chanukah likely began in the early 20th century. There were efforts to mimic Christmas traditions, which were becoming less Christian-specific and more “American.” These 20th–century American Jews saw the joy brought to others during Christmas, and wanted to share that joy with their families. Hence, the parallel gift-giving season of Chanukah and Christmas was born — and also why we are speaking out. Because the gender stereotyping eliminates and prevents joy.During this season, we are taught both in Judaism and in Christianity to consider what poor messages we are reinforcing. We must commit ourselves to raising confident girls by watching not only the content of what we say but the context — Judah AND Judith should both be recounted as heroes of the Chanukah story. We must commit ourselves to avoiding compelling traditional masculinity on our boys — why does Mrs. Claus have to play second fiddle to SantaRegardless of gift-giving roots and the meaning around them, what we do know is that we each have seen our children’s eyes light up at the sight of gifts under a tree, around a menorah, or in whatever family and cultural rituals people celebrate. Let us continue to do that, but let us also name and confess the harm that can be done in the gender-typing that exists within it as well. And let us work collectively to break down those norms and create a world in which our children are liberated to explore their identity — because that would be the greatest gift of all.Rabbi Avi S.

minnpost_2020_114,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the calls from family and friends around the world are coming through these past few weeks, I am out of words. How can I talk about the U.S. leading in COVID-19 cases and deaths And since May 25, how can I respond to why, in the land of opportunity, George Floyd died at the hands of police only 13 blocks from my house For those of us advocating forCulturally Enriched Communities, healthy and connected communities in which everyone can thrive, none of this is surprising. Minneapolis is one of the healthiest and well-off cities in the nation and yet, it experiences some of thewidest health, income, educational, death, and incarceration disparities in the US.For the past three weeks, I have been gathering stories of communities through buildings and places where many of the protests occurred. When I started, I called this storyline “Landscapes of agony.” Agony is one of the 52,803 Greek words used in the English language and it captures extreme suffering, one of the emotions that propelled dozens ofartiststo take advantage of the plywood that covered windows and transform our city into a messenger of hope.Landscapes of Hopespeaks to how Minneapolis can lead the way for racial and social justice. Here are three steps:Decision-making must be led by those on the ground and communities impacted and must be founded on responsibility and accountability. All sectors together — from federal, state, and local governments to public safety officials, educators, health providers, businesses, faith leaders, city planners, designers, and citizen advocates — must denounce racism, injustice, and marginalization in all forms.We can start with housing.Stable housinghas long been tied to well-being an all fronts, from health to school outcomes and job prospects. “The right to home,” however, pushes us to work toward homes that support diverse meaning-making processes — from how we eat and sleep to how we play and work. The city of Minneapolis has a serious shortage ofaffordable housingand census data shows about half of renters in the city struggle to pay their landlords. Avoidinggentrificationis an instrumental aspect of community development, particularly in a city that has long struggled withsegregation.Supportingminority businessesis also dependent on synergistic practices. Take, for instance,East Lake Street, envisioned as one of Minneapolis’ sixcultural districts. Driving down Lake Street one can witness Mexican bakeries and markets, Black barber shops, signs in different languages, and some of the city’s most beautiful murals. If we zoom in on Latinos, Minnesota is home to more than9,000 Latino-owned businesses, which bringpromise for a thriving economyto the state and beyond. In 2018, Minnesotans in immigrant-led households had$11.2 billion in spending power(after-tax income and paid $4.4 billion in taxes. Nearly 16.8% of theU.S. labor force in 2016 was Latinos, and Minnesota is counting on foreign-born residents, most of whom are working-age adults between the ages of 18 and 65, to counterbalance the trend of Minnesota’s general population toward a higher proportion of older adults who are not of working age.North Minneapolis’Juxtaposition Artsis one of the manyBlack-led arts organizationsin the Twin Cities. It is a nonprofit youth art and design education center, gallery, retail shop, and artists’ studio space. Being teen-staffed, it helps develop community “by engaging and employing young urban artists in hands-on education initiatives that create pathways to self-sufficiency while actualizing creative power.” In anareawhere 36.3% of the residents are below poverty and 56.3% are Black or African-American, access toafter school programs is instrumentalin improving academic performance, classroom behavior and school attendance, reducing drug use, encouraging physical activity and good dietary habits, and increasing parents’ working opportunities.Minneapolis has one of the largest urban Native communities in the country, and many live close to Lake Street, where the majority of the protests took place. Native American nonprofits such asMigizi Communications, which provides media arts training to hundreds of youths a year, are instrumental in eliminating disparities as Native Americans face some of thegreatest disparitiesin health, income, and education and American Indian youth experience thelowest high school graduation ratesin the state, a stark reality of 51.0%, followed by Hispanic (66.8% and Black (67.4% youth. Migizi collected over $600,000for rebuildingfrom more than 13,000 donors.Art and theater create opportunities for people from different backgrounds to come together and learn about each other’s dreams and aspirations, bringing the “I” closer to the “We.” TheIn the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatreis a Lake Street landmark. Its annual May DayParade,Ceremony, andFestivalhave been vibrant examples of art as community building in the Twin Cities area for 45 years.

suffolknewsherald_2020_194,"Published 6:05 pm Friday, October 23, 2020ByStaff ReportsThe Suffolk Police Department welcomed 15 new officers to its ranks during a badge pinning ceremony Oct. 21 in the City Council Chamber at City Hall.In these times of civil unrest, a global pandemic and financial challenges, these 15 individuals chose to take an oath of office to serve and protect our community.In the best of times being a police officer has never been an easy, safe job. One can assume that, for the most part, those that do choose to put their life on the line do so because they want to make a difference in their community, they want to help people. We commend these officers.However, there has been a history in this country where a few who wear the badge have abused their power, taken liberties they should not have and in doing so have left a swath of damage that will take years of work to repair.A daunting task, but one it appears this administration is ready to take head on.During the pinning ceremony, Interim Police Chief Al Chandler said he appreciated the new officers answering the call to serve, but said they must do so with integrity. It is among the things they need to remember, he said, while they serve as officers. He went on to say, “The very things that seem to be problems are going to be looked at in history as the time that we got it right.”“Our citizens have to believe that what you say is truth,” Chandler said, “because they know who we are. There is no room for error, there is no room for anything short of 100% honesty.”Opportunity is knocking for this administration, current officers, new officers and each of us to be a part of rebuilding that trust.

minnpost_2020_73,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Earlier in the year — January is National Mentoring Month and May is Mental Health Month — I began thinking about this subject.At the behest of my wife in early 1998, we began a journey into mentoring of kids that lasts to this day. The two of us started with two grade-schoolers through an Urban Ventures program.We soon learned that mentoring is a most effective way to offer a hand-up to youngsters. Each of those fine individuals from north Minneapolis remains our friend — along with their adoptive mother; one has graduated from college, earned a master’s degree and is working in her chosen field.To be effective, adult mentors must log face time with their kids. For the first several years, we spent five to six hours a week with our new friends, doing things that was both worthwhile and fun. As the years evolved, many more mentees — whether officially or unofficially — became part of our family. To be done right, staying close to a young person through the age of 25 or so can make a huge difference.We also decided during this time period to host foreign students in our home through several programs; we keep in contact and have visited many of them in their own countries as they enter adulthood becoming doctors, teachers, business owners and engineers.The parents of half of our nation’s kids say they’d welcome a non-family adult mentor to help their children succeed, yet only about one in three has such a person available. Sadly, countless other young people are not on a waiting list of any sort and could use a caring adult to be a part of their lives.Today’s COVID-19 pandemic/police and community unrest times reveal the increasing challenges for youngsters. Here are some facts affecting American kids’ health and safety:Oprah Winfrey, based on her own experiences, said “a mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself.”Indeed, mentoring can be a key ingredient to changing things as an advocate for a child’s future. Active attention to the roles that parents, teachers and local schools play is required. Elected officials, too, who decide government policies at every level, must be informed to be a part of the solution to young people’s challenges.Chuck Slocum is president of The Williston Group, a management consulting firm.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_53,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The U.S. government has struggled almost since its birth to balance politicians’ predilection for rewarding political friends with patronage jobs with the public’s need for government officials to work on their behalf without undue political interference. So the government has evolved a federal civil service system that, imperfect as it is, helps insulate the professional government class from overt political interference. And now, of course, President Donald Trump is trying to blow that up.The U.S. government has struggled almost since its birth to balance politicians’ predilection for rewarding political friends with patronage jobs with the public’s need for government officials to work on their behalf without undue political interference. So the government has evolved a federal civil service system that, imperfect as it is, helps insulate the professional government class from overt political interference. And now, of course, President Donald Trump is trying to blow that up.Two weeks before Election Day, the president issued an executive order creating a new class of federal employee, Schedule F, for “positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition.” He then ordered agencies across the government to determine by Jan. 19 (yes, Inauguration Day eve which positions should fall under the new category.Critics say tens of thousands of government employees could be affected. At the same time, the administration has been moving political appointees into jobs with stronger protections, “burrowing” in Washington parlance, that could keep them in place long after Trump exits the White House.It can be hard sometimes to see how the wheels turn inside the White House, but the timing laid out in Trump’s order suggests he was preparing the ground for a wide restructuring of the federal civil service during a second term. Thankfully, he will not have that term, at least not now. And because this bit of connivance was done by presidential order, President-elect Joe Biden can undo it.But damage can still be done. Political appointees in at least two key agencies — the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management — are racing to meet the president’s deadline, setting the stage for potential mass firings of government officials in the waning days of the Trump era. The budget office, which plays a vital role in assessing agency budgets and reviewing proposed regulations, reportedly plans to reassign 88% of its work force (about 425 positions to the new Schedule F, which would expose every one of those employees to summary dismissal. The personnel office similarly is seeking to reclassify a large portions of its 3,500 employees.Why should you care? A government that demands political loyalty to a president from its key bureaucrats is not a government by, for and of the people. It is a fiefdom.Trump’s mercurial personality has led to an endless string of U-turns in his support for, then denouncing of, government officials who have opted for truth over obeisance.A stable democracy needs stable institutions (not to mention a stable president , and that includes a professional class of government officials who understand how the process works, the history of the mission, and how to make an enterprise so large and unwieldy actually do what it is supposed to. And, most importantly, to approach their work with the nation’s best interests in mind by relying on objective truth in forming, assessing or advising on policies.No one can argue with success that the federal bureaucracy can’t be improved, and there are good arguments to be made for reassessing the current civil service system to make it less complex and more responsive, including making it simpler to dismiss poorly performing employees. But that’s not what Trump is doing, or even advocating.We encourage the incoming Biden administration to work with Congress on a fact-based analysis of the civil service system with an eye toward making it better — and to shoring up its resilience in the event of a future Trump (or Trump-like administration.— Los Angeles Times"
minnpost_2020_143,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .George Floyd could have been me, my students or many other black men in our city and our nation.This has been a difficult week following Floyd’s killing at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD . I am sickened and deeply hurt by what transpired on that day, which coincidentally happened to be my birthday. I have had my own encounters with MPD in the past. While I was picking up my children at my mother’s house and loading them into car seats a few years back, police demanded to know my identity and questioned me aggressively — for no reason at all.This means we are not in face-to-face contact with our Kings and Queens, as we call them, as part of our effort to change the narrative and the negative terms often used to describe black people. How do we support them when we can’t physically engage or physically see one another to give a hug, shed a tear or listen to their voices How do we create a space that is free from judgment to hear their uncut, raw emotions at a time like this All the while, my proud OBSA team members — Jamil, Richard, Marques, Isa, Shawn, Qiana, Dena, Nneka and Umar — and I are left trying to manage our own emotions.In the storied history, context and spirit of blackness, we always find a way to meet our students’ needs, in the words of Malcom X, “by any means necessary.”Our team didn’t allow distance learning to be an obstacle. We put on masks and went out in our community and became visible. We attended marches and made phone calls to check in. We participated in clean-up efforts and food drives and hosted a virtual healing space. My wife and my two older daughters were out protesting on the I-35 bridge on Sunday, May 31, when a semi-truck drove into the crowd.We also witnessed King Payton Bowdry, one of our alums and a college senior, leading a rally inspired by B.L.A.C.K (Building Lives Acquiring Cultural Knowledge , a class we developed collectively in Minneapolis to help us answer questions about who we are and to uphold pillars of student engagement, character development, knowledge of self and identity.We have heard so much pain, anger and anxiety from our Kings and Queens during these most traumatic and trying times. We share that they should exercise their First Amendment rights to a peaceful protest. We should also be mindful of those who are more outraged by the so-called riots and not by the murder of George Floyd. We want peace, but we also want and need justice.As a people and as a community, we are not new to adversity. Our office does not pretend to have all of the answers. We admit that we are also navigating and processing our own feelings, as our Kings and Queens provide us with hope and comfort during this time of ultimate discomfort.Building these essential skills is paramount for black survival in a society that has shown time and time again its anti-blackness through its interpretation of policies and laws. As a department, we remain in constant communication with one another, working to brainstorm the best ways to support our community right now. We don’t do this for recognition; we do this because it’s right.The events we are facing today are about a far broader, more systemic problem. We are pushing for the end of police brutality, but we are also addressing disparities that affect black people negatively: educational outcomes, homeownership, employment rates and access to appropriate health care.In my office, we’ve seen positive results from our work: Academic outcomes have changed positively here for students in our programs, with gains in both student attendance and achievement. Are we, as a society, ready to allow black people to create their own programs to address these issuesIn Minneapolis, we are showing that the answer is yes.Michael V.

suffolknewsherald_2020_97,"Published 10:48 pm Friday, June 5, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Abigail St. E. BilbyAs places of worship across Virginia begin to resume their ministries, committees draft guidelines for social distancing and mask-wearing requirements, and parishioners decide whether or not to attend in-person religious services, it is increasingly important that religious leaders understand the complex role that they play in this pandemic. As leaders with the ability to impact and influence dozens, hundreds or even thousands of people, they carry a responsibility to make informed and logical actions that can save lives.The current pandemic is a worldwide conflict. Just within the United States, some people hoard supplies, others protest recommended safety precautions, and in extreme situations act aggressively towards other people doing their best to protect their families. Dr. Marc Gopin, global peacebuilder and director of the Center for Religion, Diplomacy, and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, says that during times such as these, religious leaders can serve as inspirers of guidance and comfort. They play an integral role as peacebuilders in their communities; trusted to offer spiritual guidance and compassionate care for their congregants, these leaders face the coronavirus pandemic with a unique set of responsibilities. To meet these needs in their communities, I propose three steps that religious leaders can take to better protect and uplift their congregations during the coronavirus pandemic.The first is for religious leaders to educate themselves and then their congregants about the coronavirus. Religious leaders must do their best to learn the facts of the pandemic so that they, as trusted centers of guidance, can pass this information on to their congregations. The WHO and the CDC have both recently released guidelines for religious leaders arguing that is it their duty to ensure that they provide information to their congregations that is accurate and medically sound. The understanding here is that if religious leaders act as authority figures distributing reliable, researched information about the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a possibility that congregants will take this information seriously.The second is for religious leaders to lead by example. In areas where social distancing and stay-at-home orders are in effect, religious leaders can search for alternatives to in-person meetings, such as video-recorded services and virtual counseling sessions. Leaders can firmly request social distancing and adhere to limits on group gatherings during essential ceremonies such as funerals. By modeling this behavior to their followers, religious leaders can communicate the importance of every person taking these precautions in their personal lives.A third step for religious leaders to practice responsible peacebuilding in the midst of this pandemic is to teach universal religious values in a language of belief that congregants understand. In his 1997 piece “Religion, Violence, and Conflict Resolution,” Gopin emphasizes that lessons of empathy, interiority, the sanctity of life, and the inner self and well-being — which are central to many religions — could greatly impact personal behaviors of practitioners.Although there are many religious leaders who already do not heed warnings by trusted sources of disease information, refuse to take measures themselves, and instead label this pandemic as a hoax instead of something to offer spiritual guidance through, religious leaders ultimately have a responsibility to protect their congregants and the people around them during this pandemic. This moment in history is a time for these leaders to step forward, in their communities, and around the world, to act as responsible peacebuilders.Not every leader will take every precaution to ensure the safety of their followers and others, but for every religious peacebuilder that does, dozens, hundreds and even thousands of lives can be protected here and around the world.Abigail St. E.

eugeneweekly_2020_22,"We ve got issues. There are approximately four million miles of road in the United States alone. To put that in perspective, that’s about 16.7 times the distance from the Earth to the moon. So yeah, that’s a lot of road. The interesting thing about roads is, as great as their expanse may be, at any given moment, as you are bustling along, you can only ever see the tiny fragment of road you happen to be traversing. Windows down, music up, pedal to the metal, the sheer distance is an afterthought. The road, however, may mean something a bit different for some of us. It’s a little longer. A little more dangerous. I myself am very much aware of the road behind me because I am constantly checking it to make sure I am not being followed by a cop, or a man, or both. For some, the road is a reminder of what they lack — in the ’50s and ’60s, it signified wealthy whites driving new cars on new roads out to new suburban white-picket-fence homes that Black Americans were denied loans to purchase. The road was a knife, severing and slicing up low-income communities to make way for highways in cities like Atlanta, Baltimore and Detroit. For some, the road, along with its unreliable public transportation, is the difference between barely making it to work on time and filing for unemployment for the second time this year. For Oscar Grant, a Black man who at just 22 years old, was killed in 2009 by a BART station police officer in Oakland, California, it was a death sentence. For unwelcomed visitors in this country, the road is an agent of the state, and on an unlucky day, one failure to signal can mean the onset of your deportation process. For the invisible children in the Democratic Republic of Congo, who slave for next to nothing to extract the conflict materials made into automobiles, I don’t think the road ever ends. If we could see the full expanse of the roads on which we were traveling, we would know we were building roads to nowhere. This status quo isn’t working. Our transportation system in Oregon produces nearly 40 percent of Oregon’s greenhouse gas pollution, kills nearly 500 people a year, chokes our communities with toxic air, and fails to serve people who don’t have reliable access to a vehicle. This unsustainable system of transportation needs to be reimagined for the movement of people and goods, not cars. Gov. Kate Brown’s Executive Order on Climate Action 20-04 requires agencies to prioritize reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Statewide Transportation Improvement Program 2024-2027 package offers the Oregon Transportation Commission and Oregon Department of Transportation a chance to demonstrate that they are taking this direction seriously by allocating funding in a way that reduces greenhouse gas pollution and improves equity outcomes. Funding non-highway projects supports a transportation system that allows Oregonians of all ages, abilities, and income levels to safely, affordably and conveniently get where we need to go. Funding non-highway projects also reduces the burden of air pollution, traffic injuries and deaths, and the impacts of climate change on communities. Non-highway projects are the most effective investments to meet the EO 20-04’s requirements for ODOT to prioritize activities and investments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is time for the OTC to show climate leadership, and for us as Oregonians to call upon OTC to do so. Our status quo isn’t “the way things are.” We have chosen this road. Now let’s unchoose it. Aimee Okotie-Oyekan, native to Nigeria, West Africa, is pursuing a concurrent master’s degree in Environmental Studies and Community and Regional Planning at the University of Oregon. She organizes with the NAACP Eugene/Springfield Environmental and Climate Justice Committee and has passions for raising awareness about the intersections of environmentalism and social justice."
minnpost_2020_1,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .An opportunity came along last summer to do some good for the Earth and at the same time engage in a form of distraction late in my working life. Owners of a piece of property a distance from our family farm in western Minnesota reached out and asked if we were interested in renting 120 acres that was coming out of the Conservation Reserve Program.They found us based on what they heard we had done on our own farm, located west of Willmar in Chippewa County.We have in the last three decades converted a small 320-acre crop farm into a cattle and hog operation that sells all the meats produced directly to stores and individuals. I told them I would only use the land for grazing.The land is damaged, as is all land in agricultural use. Because it is on glacial till with a gravel subsoil andsteep slopes, it is designated by the government’s Natural Resources Conservation Agency as highly erodible. The damage is stark. As a measure of the trend in agriculture in the 30-plus years this farm has been in standing, unused grass, it is possible to step down from the property corner a vertical distance of at least 6 feet to the corner of the adjacent corn field. This drop is a crude measure of row crop agriculture’s breathtaking soil loss to the creek below in that time.Later, I was to discover even earlier damage, swales hidden in this neighboring field that hadn’t been tilled in decades. The swales caused the pickup to buck and roll as I drove from one area to anotherthrough standing grass. I could feel with my feet where the farmer, the ancestor of the current owner, had planted corn on slopes far too steep half a century and more ago, and created gullies that carried soil to the bottom.I showed the owners the stunted brome grass on the hilltops and sides where it was mixed with goldenrod, and the lush patches of reed canary grassand cattails in the low areas between the hills. We saw how the soil was thin with gravel exposed in places on the hills, but very thick at the bottoms where water often stood. I made the argument that the land needed animals managed in a planned grazing system. Managed grazing will develop a strong and extensive root system under the grass.Those roots will keep rainfall in place and more soil on the hills, drying and improving the low creases, and also begin the process of returning atmospheric carbon to the soil, where much of it came from over the years of tillage.Four pairs of leather gloves and two shirts ruined by the barbed wire didn’t dim the satisfaction I took in the pandemic summer’s work. It seemed to push toward a turning.Then, another turning: Democrat Collin Peterson, chair of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, lost the seat he had long held here in the rural Trump wave.Peterson based his representation of the Seventh Congressional District upon speaking for the largest half-dozen or so crops farmers in each county. He kept the money flowing to these operations, cloaking it in heavily subsidized crop insurance. This crop support inevitably got bid into increasing land values as growing farm operations bid up both land values and rents in what was actuallya publicly supported effort to grow more corn, soybeans and wheat. This locks out young start-up farmers, traditional livestock farmers and stymies efforts to get livestock back on the land.CRP, established in 1985 to take fragile lands out of production, offers regular payments over the 10- to 15-year life of the contract. Land must be established in a cover crop, generally a perennial grass, and noxious weeds must be controlled. There are slightly over a million acres currently enrolled in Minnesota.I would like to have stood with Peterson, who thinks of CRP more in terms of crop supply control, viewing the 6-foot drop off to the adjacent corn field to get his take on the effect of row cropping at work.For Earth to remain viable for human habitation for more than a few decades, agriculture must change.It must give up its centuries-old fascination with annual crops like wheat and corn, and begin the study of how perennial plants fit food production. Perennial plants, properly managed as under a good planned grazing regimen, incorporate atmospheric carbon into the soil as organic matter, thus beginning to reverse centuries of burning off carbon through tillage. Even carefully planned rotations of annual plants without tillage will not safeguard soil and build organic matter like a good stand of perennials.Perennial plants must be developed for food production instead of this shortsighted focus on breeding plants that can withstand chemical applications. Wes and Dana Jackson established the Land Institute, a nonprofit research center in Salina, Kansas, in 1976, and have been working on perennial replacements for annual crops ever since. They and their staff developed Kernza from intermediate wheatgrass, useful for both grazing and its wheat-like kernel. It is currently being distributed and commercialized by the University of Minnesota with the help of certain grain milling and baking businesses. Another ongoing study is of Illinois Bundleflower, a potential protein source for livestock and humans.Production of perennial crops requires close on-site management driven by observation, experience and a feel for natural systems. This is especially evident for Kernza production, which is best done by a mix of cropping and livestock systems. We have few people in the farm population even capable of this breadth of management anymore. A different set of farming skills and a new attitude are required. It will take both time and financial stability to learn them, and then to apply them. The need for decision-making based upon observation and knowledge of place and its biology presupposes that operations cannot be huge. Perennial agriculture will create a different human social structure around it.Jim VanDerPol and his family have been farming and learning from the land for nearly 45 years. He has been writing about what he sees for about as long."
philinquirer_2020_9,"If we are going to save the next Walter Wallace Jr., we must first acknowledge that reality.When I watched the video of Walter Wallace Jr., 27, being gunned down by two Philadelphia police officers on Monday, I was overcome by sadness and rage. Then a sense of calm certainty overtook those roiling emotions, because I was sure of one thing.This would not have happened if Walter Wallace Jr. were white.My assuredness was not based on statistics, thoughBlack men are vastly overrepresented among those who are killed by police. It was not based on identity politics, though I am as Black as they come.My firm opinion that a white man in mental health crisis would not have suffered Wallace’s fate was based on the fact that in America, police give white men the benefit of the doubt. That’s true when white men are armed, like thebat-wielding white vigilantes in Fishtown who assaulted peoplein the wake of the George Floyd protests. It is true when they are white supremacists, likeDylann Roof, who was taken to Burger King by policeafter killing nine African Americans. It is true when they are mentally ill, like James Holmes, who killed 12 and injured 70 at a Batman movie premiere and was taken alive by police.» READ MORE:Walter Wallace Jr.: A Black life that mattered | Jenice ArmstrongThis is not to say that white men are never killed by police in America.

We also know, through The Inquirer’s reporting, thatpolice were called to the residence two previous times that day. When officers arrived for the third call, Wallace was on the porch with a knife. He walked to the street with his mother trying to calm him down. Then, as Wallace walked toward them with a knife in hand, the two officers — who were not equipped with tasers, according to Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw — fired a barrage of at least seven bullets apiece.This, even as Wallace’s mother begged police not to shoot her son.Perhaps you can imagine a white mother imploring police not to shoot her mentally ill son and police shooting him anyway.However, I cannot.» READ MORE:Black and Blue: 190 years of police brutality against Black people in PhiladelphiaStill, there are those who even now are justifying the police killing of Walter Wallace Jr., a young Black man with a family who loved him. Among them is John McNesby, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge Number 5, the local police union.“Our police officers are being vilified this evening for doing their job and keeping the community safe, after being confronted by a man with a knife,” McNesby wrote in a statement on Monday evening. “We support and defend these officers, as they too are being traumatized by being involved in a fatal shooting.”McNesby’s statement, which didn’t mention Wallace’s family, went on to ask the public to have patience as the facts are gathered.That’s the problem with policing in America’s Black communities. When cops shoot Black people, their unions and enablers support the officers, no matter the circumstance. Yet they expect the public to wait for the facts to come out.That kind of hypocrisy, from police unions that support a president that African Americans overwhelmingly view as racist, is no longer acceptable.

If that was us who killed someone , we would have names out there.”Khabir is right, but this is about so much more than simply naming names. It’s about admitting the truth.Walter Wallace Jr. would not have been subjected to a barrage of bullets, endangering bystanders and his family, if he were a white man in a white community.

Please know we are working hard every day, and your calls and emails will be answered.This month we concluded sign-ups for our 2020 Eco Heroes program, where elementary students sign up to perform some simple, but meaningful, environmental tasks, and are rewarded with a certificate and reception with me. It is a great way to involve some of my youngest constituents to teach them about the importance and responsibility of preserving our environment.As of this writing, the court has extended the census date until Oct. 30. With that in mind, I held a call with faith leaders to ask them to remind their congregations to fill out the census. The census is how $675 billion dollars is allocated, and we need to get our fair share. Federal dollars pay for everything from school breakfasts to Medicaid to SNAP benefits.I also had an extremely informative and moving roundtable on Black maternal mortality with three expert panelists. All of us learned a lot, such as how to assist and support expectant and new mothers. I am so grateful these professionals joined us. If you would like to watch a recording of this roundtable, it is available on my Facebook page.With all the concerns that have been raised about mail issues, Congresswoman Spanberger and I toured the U.S. Postal Service Richmond Processing and Distribution Center and met with postal workers. We were reassured they feel prepared for the potential number of vote by mail ballots.If you want to register your opinion about an issue or invite me or a member of my staff to a virtual or live event, please go my website, mceachin.house.gov, fill out the appropriate form and you will hear from us.

Recently, I led a bipartisan letter, with Senators Warner and Kaine and Congressman Morgan Griffith, to the Federal Bureau of Prisons about the egregious conditions — the lack of personal protective equipment and the rampant spread of COVID-19 — in federal prisons here in Virginia. This letter follows one written nearly four months ago to which I had not yet received a response. Not only do these conditions put the individuals and staff in the prison at risk, but also they increase opportunity for community spread.I was also pleased to cosponsor the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a bipartisan bill that requires reasonable accommodations for pregnant women, if such accommodations do not unduly burden the employer. These can be reasonable changes such as providing a chair or allowing pregnant woman to have access to a water bottle. Pregnancy is a unique condition and we need to be supportive and helpful, so every pregnancy ends with a healthy mom and baby.Congressman Donald McEachin represents Virginia’s 4thCongressional District.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_65,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The Institute for Economics and Peace ranks 163 nations and territories according to relative levels of peacefulness. The Global Peace Index (GPI criteria are “Societal Safety & Security, Domestic & International Conflict, and Militarization.” Iceland ranks first, Afghanistan last, Canada sixth and the United States 121st. Factors behind the low U.S. ranking shed light on ineffective U.S. responses to the pandemic, our wealthy country’s failure to meet the essential needs of its people, and the flawed model of policing and public safety demonstrated by the police killing of George Floyd.The first factor impeding peacefulness is inequality. Sociologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Picket examined basic indicators of social well-being and compared outcomes in more equitable countries (Scandinavia and European democracies with those in the United States. Benefits of living in the more equitable societies included: higher empathy, trust, life expectancy, cooperation, community cohesion, self-esteem, and social mobility; lower rates of alcohol and drug addiction, infant mortality, child poverty, crime and violent crime, including homicides; better physical and mental health; greater gender equality in employment, political participation, earnings, and economic autonomy; less social distancing and obesity; fewer prisoners and punitive prisons; less belligerent foreign policies and more generous foreign aid.The National Bureau of Economic Research reports that 90% of U.S. household wealth is held by the richest 20%, with the richest 1% holding 40%. The upper middle class and middle class, together comprising 40% of households, held 10% of household wealth. The remaining 40%, lower middle class and poorer households, held just three-tenths of 1% of the nation’s household wealth. Not surprisingly, Wilkinson and Picket’s research showed the highly unequal United States last or near last in almost every measure of social well-being, which helps explain its low GPI ranking. Massive inequalities lead to inequities that undermine “societal safety and security,” aggravate domestic conflicts and impede good governance.National Security and public safety are undermined by inequality and the massive costs of endless wars, the insatiable desires of the military industrial complex, and the militarization of domestic policing. Armed police, like their military counterparts, are expensive and ill-equipped to address communities suffering the consequences of inequality, poverty, low wages, a dysfunctional health system, racism, and underinvestment in housing, education, and mental health.When militarized systems of “public safety” bring police carrying racism and guns into situations where they don’t belong, people like George Floyd get killed. When COVED-19 strikes amidst a public health system gutted after years of neglect and a for-profit health care system reigning supreme, hundreds of thousands of Americans die. “Defunding” militarized policing and the U.S. military is a vital component in building a more peaceful society. “Defunding” doesn’t mean eliminating. It means reallocating resources and redefining missions in order to provide human and financial resources to systems better suited to meeting essential needs, including public safety and security.Improving peacefulness and our nation’s GPI ranking will require transforming policing as part of broader efforts to promote equity at all levels of governance. Medicare for all would be a good start. Guaranteeing all Americans an adequate retirement income by subjecting all income to the Social Security tax would help too. And reducing military spending and establishing progressive wealth and income taxes for the richest 20% of Americans who control 90% of household wealth could provide funds needed for the transformation of our communities and nation.Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer is emeritus professor of Justice & Peace Studies at the University of St. Thomas (retired ."
eugeneweekly_2020_34,"We ve got issues. Social Security’s benefits are modest but vital. Three out of five beneficiaries aged 55 and older rely on them for most of their income. One out of three relies on them for virtually all of their income. As important as Social Security is in good economic times, its benefits are even more essential during this pandemic and the resulting economic collapse. To ensure that Social Security’s already modest benefits don’t erode over time, they are adjusted once a year to account for inflation that makes purchasing food, medicine and other essentials more expensive. Due to a flawed measure, though, the just-announced adjustment for 2021 is only 1.3 percent. Ask seniors and other Social Security beneficiaries whether their expenses have gone up by more than 1.3 percent and you will get a resounding yes. To ensure that Social Security benefits maintain their purchasing power, Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-OR has introduced The Emergency Social Security COLA for 2021 Act (HR 8598 . DeFazio’s legislation, co-sponsored by 59 fellow Democrats, would provide an emergency 3 percent cost of living adjustment in 2021. This legislation is both wise and timely. It provides crucial protection to the more than 215,000 Social Security beneficiaries in Oregon’s Fourth Congressional District as well as the nearly 65 million beneficiaries across the nation. As important as it is to all Oregonians and all Americans, the emergency adjustment is especially important to women, people of color, those who are LGBTQ+ and others who have been discriminated against in the workforce and are the most reliant on Social Security. Moreover, because women and Hispanics, on average, live the longest, they are particularly affected by the cost of living adjustment, which compounds over time. The emergency adjustment is necessary because the current method of calculating inflation doesn’t accurately measure the expenses faced by Social Security beneficiaries. The automatic adjustment was enacted in 1972. At that time, the government only produced one measure, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W. But this index, based on the expenses of working people, does not accurately measure the expenses of seniors and people with disabilities. Social Security beneficiaries have higher health care costs than the general population — precisely the type of costs that have risen and continue to rise most sharply. They tend to spend less on clothes, recreation, and the latest technology — all costs that have risen more modestly. It is time to enact a more accurate measure. In addition to his emergency 2021 adjustment, DeFazio proposes that permanent fix. He has introduced the Social Security Expansion Act, which would use an inflation index tailored to the expenses of seniors — the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E. Importantly, his legislation would also expand Social Security benefits across the board, increase the minimum benefit, and restore Social Security to long-range actuarial balance, by requiring those earning $250,000 or more to contribute to Social Security at the same rate as a minimum wage worker. Expanding Social Security will create jobs and restore the economy. Social Security beneficiaries spend our hard-earned benefits in our local communities. Not surprisingly, an AARP report has found that every dollar of Social Security benefits generates $2 of economic output. In just the month of December 2019, Social Security beneficiaries in Oregon’s Fourth Congressional District received a total of more than $2.9 million! DeFazio deserves great credit for his leadership and tireless work on behalf of Social Security beneficiaries. He is pursuing both short-term and long-term solutions to this year’s inadequate cost of living adjustment, as well as a broad-based increase in Social Security benefits. He is in step with Joe Biden and fellow Democrats who favor expanding, not cutting Social Security. This is in stark contrast to Donald Trump, each of whose budget proposals has included cuts to Social Security. And Trump has announced that if re-elected, he plans to “terminate” — his word — Social Security’s dedicated revenue. That would end Social Security as we know it. Make no mistake: Social Security is on the ballot in Oregon’s Fourth Congressional District and across the nation. If DeFazio is returned to Washington, along with Joe Biden and a Democratic Senate, Social Security will be protected and expanded. If Donald Trump remains in power, Social Security may not survive.

minnpost_2020_155,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .This is a complicated Thanksgiving for counting our blessings. The traditional cornucopias still spill with harvest abundance; what’s empty are the chairs. Throughout Minnesota,too many thousands of spots at tables are unoccupied because of COVID-19 deaths. Far more belong to loved ones who are safely staying away. And how many restaurant chairs sit idle All of them.Some of our vacant seats would otherwise be filled this election year by certain family members of certain mindsets. A welcome reprieve, thatWe who do gather are not the same people we were last November. We’ve been made urgently aware that, while most of us will have some chair somewhere come Thursday, many of us have never been invited to share in the spreads that privilege and prosperity offer. Widespread divisiveness and hurt manifest as anger, which hardly encourages our coming together.Regardless, the calendar calls on us to give thanks. To whatever degree gratitude has been a simple reflex for us in the past, this Thanksgiving it can’t not be reflective. We get to—it would seem we rather have to—practice deepening our gratitude by doing so when it’s neither automatic nor easy. It’s like being forced to try a new recipe because we’re missing ingredients for our usual one and the store is closed. We have to use what we have on hand. We can’t whip it together by memory. We don’t know how it’s going to turn out.Could be we’ll end up liking it better.Gratitude can be found on the flip side of most everything: Rarely is anything 100 percent bad. According to the science of healing, the tenets of recovery programs, the very anchors of faith, gratitude can sweep clouds from the sky and rewire our mental and physical health. It’s less a counter to that which weighs heavily than a companion, one that’s subject to timing and sensitive to outside suggestion. We don’t deny our difficulty and pain. Nor do we force positivity before our pop-up thermometer tells us we’re ready or settle into hardship as if it’s the only truth. We simply ask, Is there a slice of good here Might there even be a slice topped with a little whipped cream Maybe the answer sweetens our situation straight away. Maybe later. No matter; the very asking opens our thinking to the possibility.“Gratitude is a both/and,” says Minneapolis intuitive healer and ordained minister Nancy Lindgren. “You feel all this hard stuff but there are also beautiful things happening.” It’s real, the grief, anxiety, depression, resentment and fear these days. It’s real any day. Notice it. Tell someone about it. Write about it. Allow yourself to wholly feel it, Lindgren advises. Then recognize that your feelings may have some built-in solace. Those empty chairs at the Thanksgiving table “The sadness wouldn’t be so big if there wasn’t the love,” she says. What good fortune it isto know or have known big love. “The gratitude is for the richness of being able to feel all that and in having the luxury to do so,” she says. “There are people on the streets who are spending 100 percent of their energy just surviving.”Simple thanks for simple things can sustain us, too. Our dress pants still fit. A cardinal is at the bird feeder. There’s pie. The gift of this Thanksgiving is that we can be wherever we’re at. Expectations are low. Obligations are fewer. Excuses for not doing what we don’t want to do are ready-made. Maybe, just maybe, we have the time and mental space to consider a bright side. Like the folding chairs we haul out on holidays and keep stored at the ready year-round, feelings of gratitude are always there for the opening.Kitty Shea is a Twin Cities freelance writer and editor."
suffolknewsherald_2020_81,"Published 9:22 pm Tuesday, June 16, 2020ByStaff ReportsLast Thursday’s School Board meeting was an embarrassment for all of Suffolk.First, let’s say this: Every elected body of any size, at any level, needs somebody like Sherri Story.Elected bodies need someone who will do the hard work. Someone who will frequently visit the institutions they are charged with governing to see what’s really going on and to learn the concerns of the ground-level stakeholders. Someone who will ask questions and fight for answers. Someone who will ensure the transparency of the body and its meetings and records. Someone who will not simply rubber-stamp every proposal that comes along. Someone who challenges the groupthink culture most large organizations, governmental or not, are prone to developing if they do not actively prevent it.In other words, every elected body needs someone who’s just a little bit contrarian. On the current Suffolk School Board, that person is clearly Sherri Story, who has done all of the above and more since she joined the board a year and a half ago.But because of Story’s outspokenness, most of the rest of the board members have gone out of their way to attempt to silence her. So fervent have they been in their desire to censor her that they adopted norms and protocols restricting their own free speech so that they could restrict hers, as well. Story’s violations of those norms and protocols — things like posting about school issues on her Facebook page and talking to news media about school issues — have attracted several disciplinary actions, culminating last week in a public censure that brought a lot of conflict out into the open.Story was accused of past racist behavior by Tyron Riddick, a fellow board member and past student. Similar accusations came during the public comment period from another previous student and a previous staff member at King’s Fork High School, where Story was an IB science teacher. These allegations are truly disturbing, and we strongly suggest that Story address these accusations in a public forum soon.On the other hand, we were disgusted by rhetoric from Karen Jenkins, another fellow board member, who found it appropriate to use a rallying cry from recent George Floyd protests — “We can’t breathe” — in her comments in favor of Story’s censure. That these last words of Floyd, a black man, as he died in Minnesota on May 25 at the hands of a white police officer would be co-opted for political purposes here in Suffolk is repugnant.As for Story’s behavior as a board member, has she always gone about her work in the best, most productive way? No. Even before she was elected, it was clear there were going to be personality conflicts, but those have progressed beyond mere conflicts to an embarrassing spectacle that is distracting the board from its real work. Story demonstrated unprofessional behavior in refusing to participate in the rest of the meeting and then leaving early.Story says she’s being bullied by some of her fellow board members. For what it’s worth, fellow board member David Mitnick says the same, and it seems the only problem the others have with him is that he often sides with Story in votes that have become predictably 5-2.But other board members say it is Story who not only is bullying them but also is badgering and harassing the superintendent, department heads, school board attorney and other professionals who deserve the time and space to do their jobs without constant interference from a single board member.Who’s really bullying who? Both sides have plenty of evidence. It just depends upon whom you ask. But we truly hope that this board can begin working together more productively very soon — for the good of our students, teachers, other staff and community at large.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

ChaquetteKeaauOnline school is roughHeavily shaken by this COVID-19 crisis, many of us are currently dealing with some issues, and my main issue is online schooling.It’s taking a big turning point in my life, and with the mindset I have, I was thinking that online schooling would make things easier for me and others. Unfortunately, it has made things quite difficult. There is more work to be done, there are poor online instructions given, and with the lack of interpersonal communication it makes it hard for us students.In my honest opinion, teachers are lacking big time, meaning they don’t reply as quickly when we need the help for assignments. It then gets a bit hard to stay motivated and want to hop online for school. Lastly, technical difficulties are such a pain. Everyone goes through it, and we can’t help it.Online schooling is giving me such a headache, my head is about to pop off. It’s beating me up right now. But, I do believe online schooling can become a lot better than it is right now. This can be accomplished if we all work together as a team.That means that teachers are going to be more on it with providing the help that is needed, and for my classmates to not take advantage of this whole staying home thing due to this pandemic.I’d like for teachers to understand that when we have technical difficulties, it ain’t our fault. Some of these teachers get upset and think otherwise.When it comes to group projects, students need to contribute to it, not wait until the last minute when it’s due the next day.In conclusion, online schooling has taken a big turning point. More work has been given out to us students, teachers provide poor online instructions, and with the lack of interpersonal communication it makes it hard for us students.I believe that these problems should be addressed so that it’ll make things a bit easier, not only for me, but other students who are facing these problems.Lilliane ToledoHilo High School studentThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

He is in ongoing conversation with the Biden campaign about policy matters, and there are rumors of a possible Cabinet appointment or even a run for mayor of New York a year from now. In his books, articles, speeches, interviews, debates, and podcasts, Yang has offered a wonk’s paradise, a cornucopia of novel or newly synthesized ideas grounded in rigorous evidence-based analysis and rich entrepreneurial experience — ideas such as 1 the “Great Displacement” of American workers by automation and the creation of a “permanent shadow class,” 2 a “freedom dividend” (Yang’s version of UBI paying $1,000 per month to all citizens over 18 years of age, 3 new standards for measuring the economy like “childhood success rates” or “proportion of elderly in quality care,” 4 a “data dividend” that compensates citizens for commercial use of private data, and 5 a digital “social credit” system with “time as the new money” operating in a refurbished “human” capitalism. Yang presents these and a host of other provocative ideas as integral to his vision of a national economy and community radically transformed to meet the exigencies of the age.He is a person who, in the spirit of constructive engagement, has been willing to say things that risk annoying his supporters, one who has tried to break the bonds of political polarization with calls to comprehend the other side or with pleas to resist the very natural, human tendency to respond to offense with acrimony and hostility. Sometimes he’s articulated these calls and pleas in less than artful or elegant ways. On occasion he’s tripped and worried the very Asian-American community he embodies and represents as Taiwanese-American. Now and then his generally endearing sense of humor has prompted for some a stereotypical joke too far (e.g., when he said, “We need to do the opposite of much of what we’re doing right now, and the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math.” Yet in all of this, one discerns in Yang a genuine compassion for the dispossessed and a deep desire to get beyond the vituperative conflicts of political partisanship for the sake of promoting the common good and delivering our nation from the historical crisis in which it finds itself.I direct theInstitute for Freedom and Communityat St. Olaf College, and this is exactly what we are trying to do: challenge presuppositions, question easy answers, and foster constructive dialogue among those with differing values and contending points of view.

He assumed that I would be critical. Instead, we encouraged him. It is great to witness him exploring creative ways to share the word of God. He had created a Bible verse video clip and the majority of the content included him reading the scriptures. I said to him, “What is there to critique? You are reading God’s word. There is nothing that I can say to that.”I ended my comments by repeating an old adage that I learned from my childhood pastor at Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Americus, Ga. The Rev. Walter L. Great used to say, “if you cannot add or multiply then do not subtract or divide.” He would often make this comment when he was asked to give final remarks at the end of a service in which he was not the keynote speaker. When Rev. Great stood up and made that statement, we knew it was time for the benediction. In his eyes, enough had been said and done. He understood what was sufficient. The word of God is sufficient. In fact, nothing is enough without the word of God.Summation is the mission of maturation in a flawed human nature. We attempt to secure this idea of sufficiency by adding things to ourselves. We know many people who still question whether they have done enough, have said enough; whether they themselves are enough. We do this because we do not have a real understanding of God’s grace. And those who think they do understand it don’t wield the grace of God as often as we should. I am guilty.Following last week’s article about becoming a practitioner of the life God has given to me, I was reminded that it is the grace of God that enables me to carry out the will He has ordained using the gifts He has given. I can do nothing of my own that will add anything above what God has already done in the sacrifice of his Son. Even the creative ideas that I have are not my own.His word tells us that “my grace is sufficient” (2 Corinthians 12:9 . It means that the grace of God is enough to equip us for everything and every good work. It means that grace added to our flawed human nature created a human being endowed with divine talents that make us qualified and called for the purposes He has for each of us.I am guilty. I watch other people in awe of their gifts and talents. I now understand that I am looking at someone who is no better than I am. He or she has learned to wield the grace of God in such a way that her gift or his gift has made room for them. Romans 12:6 says, “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them.” The enemy keeps whispering the lie of “if I had this or if I had that.” You know what you have? You have grace. You plus His grace is the sum of sufficiency. Everything that comes after grace is a supplement to the work. Everything that you gain in return for its use is just evidence that God’s grace abounds.Grace keeps adding and multiplying. If you are reading this and doubtful that you have what it takes, replace your doubts with a word of grace. We should praise God every day that grace does not divide or subtract. Because if it did, none of us could ever learn to do math.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

(Dreamstime/TNS Monarch butterfly, get in line.Monarch butterfly, get in line.Federal officials have acknowledged that the once ubiquitous orange-and-black visitor to backyards and gardens is a candidate for threatened or endangered status. Nonetheless, no immediate — nor even short-term — action will be taken to save them. Why? Because other species are at the front of the line, awaiting the designation.Environmentalists are sounding an alarm that projected delays of up to several years could mean disaster for the butterfly that used to be a common sight on the North American landscape, where 90% of the monarchs live.On Dec. 15, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said emergency action could be taken earlier and will be evaluated annually, but current plans call for a proposition to list the monarch under the Endangered Species Act in 2024 unless things improve. Or get worse.And even once the proposition is made, another year (for public comment would follow.The delay in a monarch rescue mission comes despite an unheard of public campaign on behalf of the butterfly. That campaign reached from school classrooms to garden clubs to environmental groups and government agencies. Since the effort began picking up speed in 2014, milkweed plants (a lifeline for monarchs are being planted or nurtured countrywide.Still, the monarch is all but disappearing. Its population in the eastern U.S. has dropped by about 80% since the mid-1990s, and it’s worse in the West. The culprits are development, herbicides in cropland and global warming, which indirectly impacts the monarchs’ annual migration.Getting the monarch on the list now would require federal agencies to consider — consider — the effects of land development on the butterfly and its habitat.That should happen without an endangered designation, but it doesn’t.So the listing is critical. Literally.Federal officials said that a rigorous science-based evaluation already has found that the monarch is in jeopardy, but other listing actions came first. The Trump administration has listed only 25 species, fewer than any since the endangered species measure was enacted in 1973. The Obama administration had added 360. Advocacy groups have said 47 species have gone extinct waiting to be listed.This underscores a broader problem that seems endemic at all levels and departments of government: the mire of bureaucracy, red tape, intransigence, lethargy.

He is determined to live a life dedicated to righting various kinds of wrongs as some measure of atonement.I don’t know what the grandfather did, and I don’t know if John is aware of any of the specific details. The point is that it doesn’t matter – to John or to me. The grandfather was part of a huge system that perpetrated injustice, preyed on vulnerability, exploited power, terrorized the weak and the disadvantaged, exulted in cruelty and meanness.John’s pain was obvious at every class as we studied the genocides in Rwanda, former Yugoslavia, the Holocaust, Congo, Darfur, and Myanmar. He saw the patterns of greed, the usurpation of authority, and the malevolent thrill in destroying others based solely on their identities of race, religion, ethnicity, national origin.Four hundred years ago the first ship arrived with slaves at the colony of Virginia. For 400 years African-Americans have been without reparations, apologies, or prosecutions of the perpetrators of slavery, racism, bigotry, hate, and violence.John is taking responsibility for what his grandfather did in the murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others. Where is our responsibility for four centuries of slavery, racism, thousands of lynchings, inequity in education, poverty, health, housing, and every single aspect of life For police brutalityOur ancestors were culpable.

It’s a key area where the Trump administration has let the country down, and something that President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to fix with a major surge of new testing capacity.Vaccine or no, testing and tracing COVID-19 infections will be crucial to returning America fully to work and school. It’s a key area where the Trump administration has let the country down, and something that President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to fix with a major surge of new testing capacity.But even many countries that have committed to an aggressive testing regime are finding it extremely expensive and time-consuming.In response, some have relied on a method that isn’t much talked about in the United States, though it’s well understood: Pooling the lab samples of several people at once.With new evidence showing its effectiveness — as well as potential weaknesses if it isn’t done correctly — pooling is something the Biden administration should seriously explore, especially as a way of reopening schools once the current surge subsides.Pooling samples is exactly what it sounds like. Sometimes it involves using the samples from nasal and throat swabs, or in its simpler form, collecting saliva in cups and mixing it, usually from five people at a time, sometimes more. If the test comes up negative, all the people are considered clear of infection.If not, everyone in the group is retested individually. It can dramatically cut down the number of tests that need to be performed, which means far less cost and less straining of capacity.Some private schools, such as Duke University, have been using it in the United States and have stayed open without outbreaks.On a much larger scale, China used it to test almost the entire population of Wuhan, where the virus was first identified in December. That’s 11 million people.Yet pooled testing has been rare in the United States. In part, that’s for good reason: The testing is effective only when infection rates are low — because that means less chance of needing to retest each person in a group — and for the most part, we’re falling short.The tests can be highly accurate, but that depends on how the testing is done and how many people are in each pool. Overloading the pools would yield too many false negative results, because multiple clean samples in the pool can dilute an infected one below the test’s ability to detect the virus. Still, this is an especially promising avenue for schools, where infection rates appear to have stayed on the low side, compared with the general population.By bringing down costs, students could be tested more often, making everyone feel safer about reopening campuses.We’re still hoping not to lose the entire academic year.— Los Angeles TimesThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_179,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Clean Cars Minnesota gives Minnesota and its residents more choices, not less.Clean Cars Minnesota is the effort to adopt clean car standards here in the North Star state. If adopted, it will increase consumers’ choices of and access to cleaner cars and trucks (both gas-powered and electric while saving drivers money on fuel costs and, in the case of electric vehicles, maintenance fees. Arecent reportshows that cost savings over the life of a gas-powered vehicle can range from about $800 for cars to almost $2,000 for pickups.Clean Cars Minnesota is also a state’s choice. While many auto regulations are handed down by the federal government, a quirk in federal policy surrounding emissions standards allows two to exist. States pick the one best for them — i.e. the federal emissions standards, to which no alterations can be made; or clean car standards, originally drafted by California and so far adopted and upheld by 14 states and the District of Columbia. Clean car states currently represent about 35% of annual new passenger vehicle sales in the U.S.Clean Cars Minnesota is needed because of federal rollbacks to existing regulations.Beginning in 2012 federal tailpipe emissions standardsmatchedthe clean car rules. This means millions of Americans enjoyed cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars and trucks that ultimately saved them money while reducing carbon pollution. Unfortunately, those benefits were cut by the Trump administration in March 2020 when it announced that it would gut its own emissions standards, despite analysis by its own agency finding that such a move wouldcost 13,500 American jobs. Analyses conducted since show that these rollbacks promise to release an additional453 million metric tonsof carbon pollution. It is because of this federal failure that Minnesota took the lead.Clean Cars Minnesota has widespread support among the public and organizations.Last December,more than 2,400 public commentswere received by theMinnesota Pollution Control Agency(MPCA as it sought feedback on Clean Cars Minnesota. The majority were overwhelmingly supportive for reasons of health, climate, and choice. Since then the support has only deepened, with numerous positive letters to the editors published around Minnesota,including from thoseliving outsidethe Twin Cities. More recently, not one, but two letters of support for clean car standards were released. One collected the signaturesof 46 organizations, many of them local and representing a swath of interests from business, health, faith, and the environment. The other sought the signatures of elected officials from around the country who supported clean car standards, including10 officialsfrom Minnesota.Clean Cars Minnesota will adopt established rules, not vaguely defined future policies.Minnesotans want to move forward, not back.In 2007, the bipartisan Next Generation Energy Act was signed into law by then Gov. Tim Pawlenty requiring an 80% reduction in pollution emissions by 2050, with benchmarks to track progress along the way. According to the latest state-level data, Minnesota has only reduced overall carbon emissions by 12% since 2005. The latest science shows that Minnesota’s reduction efforts must be accelerated to avoid the worst impacts of climate change across the state.Clean Cars Minnesota will help Minnesota fulfill the promise it made nearly 15 years ago, by getting us back on track to be the climate leader we know we can be.Anjali Bainsis a senior policy associate atFresh Energy, where she leads on analyzing and supporting policies that accelerate the electrification of Minnesota’s transportation system."
eugeneweekly_2020_18,"We ve got issues. Certain dates are never erased from memory. Dates such as July 4, 1776; Dec. 7, 1941, and Sept. 11, 2001. Perhaps June 1, 2020, may be destined as another. It was on this date that a peaceful assembly gathered in protest of the murder of George Floyd and numerous other African American victims of police brutality. The assembly was a time-honored tradition of people engaging in the practice of rights secured to them by our Constitution — rights to assemble, to speak, to minister, to pray, to heal. It took place on the hallowed grounds of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. The gathering included members and clergy from the church who were engaging in dialogue with the protesters, and providing respite, hospitality and comfort to all who were present. No laws were being broken. Suddenly, without warning, the gathering was attacked by federal police in riot gear deploying tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and a low-flying military helicopter to stampede and scatter the people. The sole reason for this unconscionable assault on citizens who were exercising their Constitutional rights was that Donald Trump had decided to pose in front of St. John’s with a Bible in his hands for a photo-op. There had been no advance notice to the pastor of the church nor any request from the White House for permission to co-opt this place of worship for Trump’s use as a political prop. No lawful authority for this sudden, unprovoked and excessive misuse of force and power has been cited, because there is none. As is usual with this administration, straight answers have been slow in forthcoming as the players scramble to coordinate their narrative. Reports are oozed from the mire that Attorney General William Barr ordered the police to clear the area upon learning of Trump’s desire to occupy and use the church grounds. The president, parroting the legendary Sergeant Schultz in Hogan’s Heroes, “knows nothing” about it. There is much to unpack from this outrage, which sums up this administration in so many ways. First, the context of the peaceful gathering at St. John’s is framed by the graphic and brutal killing of George Floyd at the hands of four members of the Minneapolis police department. His death added yet another victim to the ever-growing list of African Americans who have died from excessive and lethal force applied by white police officers and vigilantes such as those who took the lives of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery. Violence against African Americans has long been entrenched in our culture. Jim Crow laws in the South and segregation in our institutions persisted for almost a century after the Civil War. The heroic efforts of Martin Luther King and other civil rights activists, many of whom were bombed, shot, attacked by police dogs and murdered in the process, focused attention on the grave injustices within our society and resulted in measures such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other remedial legislation. But it is painfully obvious that our nation still has a long and arduous journey ahead to eradicate the cancer of racism and establish true equality among all people in the diverse population that defines the U.S. When Barack Obama was elected as the first African American president in our history, one dared to hope that a corner had been turned. But the embers of prejudice and racism are not extinguished easily amidst a heritage of white supremacy bias passed down and kept alive by generation after generation. The 2016 election cycle put the country on the cusp of further progress. But into this delicate moment of history stepped Trump, whose campaign emphasized going backwards, not forward. His emphasis was on division, not unity. He promised to build walls and deliver massive deportations to keep out and rid the country of supposedly undesirable Hispanics whom he vilified. His rhetoric fed and validated the prejudices of those who would become his base. MAGA was a not so subtle call for a return to nationalism, and nationalism is a synonym for less diversity and a more homogeneous culture. Unsurprisingly, he attracted adherents of white supremacy into the fold. The former Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke, endorsed him. Once in office, Trump began dismantling programs implemented by his predecessor, which included federal oversight of police departments with a history of using excessive force against people of color. Even more disturbing, he used his platform as president to message approval of police methods that crossed the boundary of what was lawful. He heaped praise on Rodrigo Duterte, a dictator who utilized police and vigilante death squads to murder suspected drug users and dealers in the Philippines; he encouraged a large gathering of police officers in Long Island to use excessive force in arresting suspects; he pardoned a notorious sheriff who had been convicted of contempt of a federal court order by continuing to violate the rights of Hispanics, and he pardoned a Navy platoon leader convicted by a military tribunal for his role in actions that involved the death of a prisoner of war. None of this is lost on those who wear badges and wield the heavy responsibility of authority in their interactions with people of color. Police chiefs and commanding officers seeking to train and maintain discipline within the ranks find their efforts swept aside from above. It is the equivalent of the principal telling the students that they can just ignore their teachers. The murder of George Floyd and the justified anger it generated cannot be understood in a vacuum. Our famously thin-skinned president views all protesters as thugs to be “dominated” by the brute force of military might. It is certain he has never entertained the thought that his own rhetoric and actions may well have played a significant part in contributing to the crisis enveloping the country over yet another death of an African American at the hands of the police. The tactics he has encouraged and approved from his presidential pulpit are tactics that are excessive, unconscionable. And unlawful. InBarr, Trump has a like-minded attorney general in his approach to authoritarianism and empowerment of the police. In speeches to law enforcement, Barr has dismissed the concern about police brutality as being nothing more than a narrative from “an increasingly vocal minority that regularly attacks the police.” That statement itself explains why protests are necessary to awaken the conscience of America to the injustices still being perpetrated against African Americans. Marches and protests were an integral part of the civil rights movement and the changes that would not have occurred in their absence. Such protests are vital to democracy. As the nation’s attorney general, Barr should be cognizant of his duty to defend the right of peaceful assembly, not disparaging of protests as disrespectful or “attacks” on police, or rabble to be dispersed by tear gas at the whim of a president inconvenienced by the presence of protesters. It is not difficult to grasp and understand the frustration of vast numbers of people in the country who are witnessing the erosion of their rights and democracy itself. A bedrock foundation of the nation — the rule of law, which holds everyone, whether prince or pauper, to equal stature and accountability under the law — is being shredded before our eyes. Trump, Barr and what passes today as the Department of Justice are engaged in applying a double standard in their treatment of the friends and allies of Donald Trump. The cases of Roger Stone and Michael Flynn bark loudly of arbitrary favoritism and flouting of the judicial system, as do the pardons or commutations of sentences of the likes of Michael Milken, Rod Blagojevich and David Safavian. The law is not being applied equally, and the DOJ has forfeited much of its credibility under an administration that treats it as an arm of the White House, not an independent upholder of justice for the people it is sworn to serve. It is thus no mystery that people have lost confidence in our criminal justice system or have concluded the system is tilted in favor of white privilege. Peering further into the June 1 debacle we find the invocation by the administration to use military power to suppress nationwide protests and label the streets of America as battlefields to be conquered. Unleashing the military might of the country’s armed forces against its own people is the benchmark of every tyrannical government. It is the action of rulers who neither represent the people nor care about their welfare, and whose only interest is in maintaining the power of office. Such misuse of the military would forever stain our democracy and imperil our liberty. We should recognize this call for military action for what it is — a test of the military by Trump. Will the armed forces obey a command to attack our own citizens, or will they remain loyal to their oath to uphold the Constitution? It is encouraging to have heard the responses of retired Gen. James Mattis and other military leaders to this attempt to involve troops against the people. But the pressure to do so will in all probability intensify, and the future of our democracy is in the balance. We must hope the military stands fast in its resolve to protect the people and our heritage from someone who has no regard for either. Finally, I arrive at the layer of the St. John’s episode that implicates freedom of religion and the alliance of conservative Christians with Trump. In the assault on St. John’s and his sequel performance at the Catholic shrine of John Paul II, the president evidenced both an appropriation of religion as a political prop and an intent to dominate religions and their sacred spaces for his own purposes. His intrusions were clumsy, disrespectful, arrogant and even violent as well as uninvited at one of the venues. Christians should reflect on whether any alliance for transitory political favors is worth surrendering their core values, their integrity and being turned into props like upside down Bibles.

minnpost_2020_49,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for integrated governance of public systems. The outcomes of crises such as the current pandemic or the Flint water crisis that started in 2014 and continues today are made much worse when communication, management and decision-making networks are not resilient in the face of upheaval. And we must remain vigilant even during a pandemic; one crisis does not negate another. While COVID-19 should have the brunt of our policymakers’ attention, there are risks in allowing the pandemic response to paralyze other aspects of public policy – such as clean drinking water.Luckily, there is no evidence that the virus causing COVID-19 is transmitted through water. But a failure of our drinking water supply triggered by any of the pressures outlined above would complicate our ability to respond to COVID, as reliable and clean water is an essential part of fighting disease. And a Flint-style failure leading to public health impacts would require attention and resources sorely needed right now to combat this pandemic.First, to help us come to terms with the many contaminants of emerging concern, develop objective prioritization based on comparative risks. And, where action is called for, consider the costs of intervention compared with the benefits for better health. Earlier work on lead contamination (“Lead in Minnesota Water” estimates the cost to address lead in supply pipes and plumbing in parts of Minnesota at $4 billion over 20 years. But the health return could be worth twice that.Second, address the difficulties that small, often rural, communities have in covering the costs of managing drinking water by considering consolidation of suppliers. This will also be important in addressing the brain drain of expertise from smaller systems.Finally, as a minimum the Legislature should consider putting in place a requirement and standards for testing well water at the transfer of property as a better basis for encouraging the safety of water from private wells and as an important signal underlining the importance of safe drinking water for all.It is right to focus attention on addressing COVID-19. Let us use this pandemic to learn the importance of integrated management, and to realize that the situation would be worse without dependable drinking water. Paying attention to policy needs for drinking water can and should never be forgotten.Peter Calow,Ph.D., is a professor at the University of Minnesota Humphrey School of Public Affairs.Ann Lewandowski, M.A., is the senior research and extension coordinator at the University of Minnesota Water Resources Center.Lucia Levers, Ph.D., a research associate, is an environmental scientist and economist at the Water Resources Center."

Timothy enjoyed the trail we visited the previous week, so he was ready to conquer this week’s location. We pulled into the parking lot at the head of the trail, looked at the location, and then looked at each other. The weather was nice, the sun was shining, and the swamp was strangely beautiful, but there was one small problem. There were a lot of bees!Timothy has always been a little wary of bees, so I asked if he still wanted to go. He said yes, so I reminded him of what to do and not to do around bees. We exited the vehicle and began our hike. The walk was a good one, even if the bees did seem to always be near us.We took a break at the end of our path to admire some of the scenery and to listen to the sounds of the swamp that surrounded our wooden walkway. When we turned around to continue our trek, Timothy started a little faster than me and remained a few steps ahead. In less than a minute, though, he stopped in the pathway and turned around to find me. He waited until I was next to him before he said, “Let’s walk next to each other. I don’t like it when you’re not in my peripheral vision.”He’s normally not afraid to run ahead of me, but there’s normally not a swamp full of bees surrounding him. I thought that he was no longer thinking about the bees because he had done so well in the first half of the walk. He was avoiding them when possible, not flailing his arms when they came near and was even telling numerous bee puns. He was doing well, but I learned it didn’t mean the bees weren’t still a concern.This made me think about how our children are doing in this scary and uncertain time. Newspapers, magazines, blogs and various organizations posted columns about ways to help children through this time when COVID-19 first began shutting down our nation. Lately, though, everything has seemed to be quiet about how to help children through this time.Perhaps we are seeing them doing well, so we figure that they are no longer afraid or concerned about all that is happening. Children can adapt quickly to change, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t still dealing with the emotions of all that is happening or that they aren’t worried or afraid.We started well, giving our children a good base of how to deal with these events, but that doesn’t mean our job is done. We must stay in their peripheral vision. We must remain engaged.Let’s continue to work with our children, check on their emotional status, discuss how things are going, and ensure we are there for them at all times.Take some time this week to check on your children. Many of them will seem to be fine, having adapted well to the current situation, but we should look beneath the surface by watching for any signs that they are worried, concerned or afraid. We should talk to them again about all that is happening and ask them how they are feeling. The most important thing we can do is to be there, and to let them know that you are there.

It was displayed for all to see, but I felt like I had walked in on a private moment.A female sat on the edge of a bed while a male was still under the covers using a crumpled blanket to cover most of his bare chest. The picture had no caption, but the nature of the image made it sensual. It was awkward because I knew the people in the photograph. I would usually feel embarrassed looking at people I know in such a suggestive photo, but this picture made me upset instead of embarrassed. I was upset because the people in the picture were 12 years old and 14 years old.I discussed the birds and the bees with them not too long ago, but all I could do was offer advice and set rules for the times that we are together. I am not the father of either one of them, so my ability to control what happens is limited. I was disappointed in the kids, but I was upset with their parents. The kids should have never been in that position, and the fact that neither of their parents were upset about the picture made me sad.When I asked the young man in the picture about the photo, he said, “We were only watching TV.” That may have been the case, but that didn’t make his decision a wise one. I shared some things with him and encouraged him to reconsider his choices.I hope he makes better decisions, but the decision should have never been his to make. I know there are differing views on sex and sexuality, but can we not all agree that kids need our guidance and protection in this area of their lives?We, as a society, have deemed that kids have not yet matured enough to do many things. We place a ban on driving until a certain age, and we then allow them behind the wheel only after lengthy instruction and guidance. We do not allow them to consume alcohol or use tobacco products. There are many things we forbid based on age.We do this because there are many things that they are not yet ready to determine on their own. They may be growing quickly as they hit the teen years, but the transition from child to adult takes a while.Sex and sexuality have caused problems for even the most mature adults, so why would we think they can handle making this important decision on their own? Their bodies are growing faster than their brains, so we must set the rules. It’s irresponsible to leave the choice of what is proper and what is not appropriate to them. Set the rules — such as no sharing of a bed — and enforce them.Likewise, it’s our responsibility to protect them to the best of our ability. No responsible parent would leave a loaded gun lying around the house, but many parents think they can leave their teens to their own devices when it comes to dating and relationships. This is foolish, and it places our children in danger.Parents, I urge you to set rules for your children when it comes to their relationships. They aren’t ready to make these decisions for themselves, and the choices they make may place them in dangerous situations.

minnpost_2020_196,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial from theMankato Free Press.Minnesota election officials and law enforcement are alarmed after learning a company has been posting job listings calling for “security positions in Minnesota during the November Election and beyond to protect election polls, local businesses and residences from looting and destruction.”Tennessee-based Atlas Aegis is recruiting people with U.S. special operations military experience to, they say, protect the polls from “antifas” intent on “destroying the election sites.”The idea of armed non-law enforcement people inserted into the democratic election system should alarm everyone.The far right, with President Donald Trump in the lead, has continued to encourage and defend armed militias toting loaded firearms at protests and refuses to condemn violent white supremacist groups. Hiring special forces “security” to supposedly protect polling sites and neighborhoods is another step toward creating more turmoil and igniting violence.“Antifa” has been a favored rallying point for Trump and others who frame the ideology as a far-left threat that is at the root of all looting, violence and criminal activity. But even the director of the FBI notes that antifa is not a group or organization but an ideology.Anyone, far right or far left, who uses violence or commits crimes must be condemned and every effort made to bring them to justice.But Trump and his followers are inflating the danger and influence of the antifa movement, while defending armed militias and white supremacists, to throw fuel on the fire caused by recent social unrest.Minnesota election officials are working with law enforcement to prepare polling officials for the possibility of private agencies sending hired guns to polling sites. State law allows only one challenger per major political party inside polling locations.That, of course, doesn’t stop those who claim they are there to protect against antifa from congregating and deploying near polling sites, with the clear intent of intimidating certain voters and fomenting discord.The growing push to inject armed radicals into society and the polls leads to less safety and more violence. There is a reason those who were recently arrested for hatching a plot to kidnap and allegedly execute Michigan’s Democrat governor felt emboldened enough to act.Minnesota has a stellar history of running the safest and most secure elections in the country. Unnecessary interference in the state’s elections by private security agencies or armed citizens who aim to “defend” right-wing ideology is a dangerous escalation of tensions.Republished with permission."
hawaiitribune_herald_2020_7,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Photo by RACHEL MURDOCK The Cavanaugh family’s cut-it-yourself ponderosa pine Christmas tree from Pike National Forest.Our Christmas tree has a knee.Our Christmas tree has a knee.“A crooked tree for a crooked year” was my sales pitch when we spotted the bent ponderosa pine on the snowy downslope of Pike National Forest. First just my 6-year-old agreed, and then my wife, and finally my 9-year-old came on board. After we cut it, we found layers we certainly didn’t anticipate.I’d taken the day off work so we could all drive half an hour northwest from our little town at the base of Pikes Peak up into the national forest to secure our tree. It’s a neat annual program run by the Forest Service that’s a fundraiser, family activity and fire reduction initiative all wrapped in one.It seems like every year the day after Thanksgiving my wife and I have the same talk about the tree. Is this the year we break down and buy a fake one? (They’re expensive, but they last so long. Should we pick one up at the local nursery? (We got a nursery tree last year that cost, gulp, more than $100, but it was postcard perfect. Last year Americans bought 26.2 million Christmas trees at a median price of nearly $77, according to the National Christmas Tree Assn. But now we’re going for the national forest program. Sure, it takes more time and the tree’s a little less than a looker, but it costs $20, helps protect our community from fire, and we (mostly have fun doing it.Besides, this year’s U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree came out of a national forest in Colorado. If a Colorado tree’s good enough for the National Mall, it’s good enough for the Cavanaughs. We sent a spruce to Washington, but ours would be a ponderosa pine. The forestry program at Colorado State University estimates pinus ponderosae scopulorum covers 2 million acres of the state, about 8% of Colorado’s forestland.We secured our permit online, and in early December, headed out of the house on a blue sky day and into the crisp air at about 9,000 feet. Walking in ankle-deep snow, I zeroed in on our unusual ponderosa pine. It came out of the ground about 2 feet, then bent 90 degrees, and thereafter slowly curved upward toward the south.I’m no arborist, but I couldn’t see any reason why it had developed a human-like hinge joint. There was no other tree, no natural object forcing it in any way. It seemed like a freak occurrence.Like 2020. What a year, for all of us, a year where we all hooked a hard turn from where we thought the year would go. At the time, the tree seemed like a perfect metaphor for an awful year. So we cut it down and took it home. And we fell in love with it even more with all the fixings and trimmings and trappings of the holidays.But — I just couldn’t put it down — how did our tree get that way?I started firing up internet search engines with multiple word combos and came up with a possible answer that made me more than a little sad. We might have cut down a piece of history. Native Americans often tied young trees down to produce a bend that marked the way to an important destination. These “trail trees” have been identified at nearby Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument pointing toward Pikes Peak. The Ute people considered the mountain sacred, and in 2012 park chief ranger Rick Wilson called these trees “living archaeology” for their historical value.Our tree wasn’t huge, could it have been that old?“Among the many crooked trees encountered,” wrote Raymond E. Janssen in Scientific Monthly in 1941, “only a few are Indian trail markers.” But bent trees age differently from straight ones. One group that tracks the trail trees points out that a bent tree sometimes can grow to only half the diameter of a normal tree of the same age.One clue is in the bark. On our tree it’s rough, dark colored, and a 2003 U.S. Forest Service Field Guide says, “Old tree bark lacks the deep fissures and black color of young tree bark.”I’m almost certain our tree is too young to be the product of Ute or Native American hands. I counted the rings before we put it in the stand, and it seems to be less than 50 years old, but I’ll get an expert opinion after the holidays.This tree. It first excited me as a novelty, a sign of the times, but it’s got more to tell us. There’s an arboretum in Illinois that’s hybridized a white oak species they’ve named Pathfinder as a tribute to the trail trees. However it was made, that’s what I’ll remember — a pathfinding tree that started us on our way out of COVID-19-clouded 2020 to a better 2021.Or maybe something even simpler. I look up from my desk and see this tree bent horribly, like a badly broken bone. And it kept going, kept growing, seeking sunlight, setting roots. Life finds a way, even after the harshest bend.Lt.

philinquirer_2020_26,"From the Tuskegee Study to the Mississippi appendectomies, the U.S. medical establishment has a long history of experimenting on people of color without their consent.The reports that Pfizer’s vaccine is95% effective with no serious side effectsand that Moderna’s vaccine candidatehad demonstrated 94.5% effectivenessin trials are the latest beacons of hope in an otherwise bleak public health landscape.While these breakthroughs are a giant step, a vaccine is only as good as its uptake. That means policymakers and public health professionals need to start planning now to make sure the vaccine reaches all Americans — and in particular, that people of color, who have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic, are able and willing to get vaccinated early.Unfortunately, trends show we have a long way to go to make that happen. According to new research published by theCOVID Collaborative, fewer than half of Black adults and just two-thirds of Latinx adults say they would “probably or definitely” get vaccinated if the vaccine were available and free. Although majorities of both groups believe the vaccine would likely be effective, the low rate of intended uptake is driven by skepticism about its safety. Only 14% of Black adults and about one-third of Latinx adults trust the vaccine will be safe, and Black adults are 19% more likely than others to doubt the vaccine will have been tested for safety in their own ethnic group.» READ MORE:Coronavirus vaccines face trust gap in Black and Latino communities, study findsThese findings are alarming, but hardly surprising. From theTuskegee Studyto theMississippi appendectomies,the U.S. medical establishment has a long history of experimenting on people of color without their consent. Cultural barriers have also sowed reluctance amongLatinxresidents to seek health care.For this to change, there are things policymakers and public health professionals must do starting now to build trust among Black and Latinx Americans.First, we must employ trusted health-care messengers to reduce safety concerns. Public health professionals, frontline health-care workers, the media, and government officials should front-load accessible information about how COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, what safety measures are in place, and what thresholds of safety need to be met before vaccines are approved — especially if emergency-use authorization designation is used for licensure. Providing clear, consistent messaging about vaccine safety will be key to increasing trust in the vaccine. And messages on vaccine safety should be led by trusted health-care professionals, with other prominent community voices taking more of a support role.Second, we must build a pro-vaccine social norm in communities of color. Surprisingly only around 30% of each group said they trusted religious leaders and elected officials in their communities in terms of COVID-19 vaccination. This highlights a case where peer influence can be a game-changer — by helping to increase vaccine uptake.In the COVID Collaborative study, nearly nine in 10 Black adults who believe most of their friends and family would want them to get vaccinated reported that they would do so. However, among Black adults who believed few of their close contacts would want them to get vaccinated, only two in 10 said they would do so.This is where community messengers, such as pastors, teachers, community organizers, and local elected officials, can help lead by example by talking about their own plans to get vaccinated early, and by encouraging the people they encounter to do the same through ongoing dialogues.The influence of peer norms also means that social media platforms like Facebook will need to step up and stop vaccine disinformation from spreading on their networks. Such disinformation canmeaningfully impedeefforts to build population immunity through vaccination.» READ MORE:Public health leaders should address African Americans’ coronavirus vaccine concerns now | OpinionFinally, this is our warning to address the impact of systemic racism in health care. To begin to combat these long-germinating seeds of distrust, policymakers should prioritize expanding health-care access, making health care affordable, and investing in education, housing, jobs, family, and quality-of-life improvements in the communities of color that have suffered the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic.The bottom line is clear: A vast majority of Americans will need to get vaccinated to bring an end to this pandemic. Taking these steps now to head-on address sources of mistrust among Black and Latinx residents will increase our chances of making sure that, once a COVID-19 vaccine is approved, vulnerable Americans actually make the critical choice to get inoculated.Valerie Montgomery Rice is president and dean of Morehouse School of Medicine.

Is she self-righteous or biblically righteous? Is she Holy-Spirit-led or flesh-led?America’s churches are full of people blessed with material things but have no power with God.Since God’s people have nowhere to go, perhaps they’ll repent, return to their first love, receive God’s forgiveness and bring the land healing.It’s clear that the world doesn’t have or know the answer.I believe God is calling His church forth.

I can no longer remain silent due to so-called political correctness. My ire is with Democrat politicians, not necessarily with Democrat voters, though I do not understand their allegiance to the party.If the cancer of cities that have been run for long periods by increasingly socialist Democrats continues to spread, we are all in for a horrid future. Your children and my nieces and nephews face the tyranny and crime of these cities right where they live.Let us look at one example that is fresh in the news. Do you know who Officer Derek Chauvin is? Knee on a man’s throat remind you? Chauvin has a history of 18 complaints over the years, many as serious as those presently lodged against him. He was let off multiple times by Democrat prosecutor, now Democrat Senator and failed Presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar. Now the push to decrease police numbers? Only the thugs and criminals have requested this.Now let us look at one I grew up right next door to in South Bend, Ind. Chicago is 90 miles from the house I was raised in. My family played/partied there often. As a teen I skipped school with friends to go there.Mayor Daley, a Democrat, was considered a crooked politician in many ways and for many reasons, but life was much better there than now. For many, many years, Chicago was fun, relatively clean and safer than today by far. The shootings and murders of one year were less than a few weekends there now. Democrat politicians in that town became increasingly socialist and today just check out the people running the once beautiful city I loved. Look at who they are and what they espouse. My once beloved Democrat Party left me, and I am now afraid of the politicians in the Democrat Party. It is now time to change the party, but the only way to do so is to vote them out for a while.R.

minnpost_2020_207,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Like most Americans, my husband and I have barely traveled in the past six months. But last weekend we drove to Iowa to see my 95-year-old mother-in-law, who has been sequestered in her senior living apartment. The administrators there have done an excellent job of keeping her safe. I wish I could say the same about the rest of the state.I grew up in Iowa, but during our visit I had the odd feeling that I was visiting a foreign country whose customs I didn’t understand. Many Iowans are approaching the pandemic very differently than are Minnesotans.When the virus began spreading, John and I were scared for our own health, since we are both over 70. We hunkered down. When we needed groceries, we wore masks and rubber gloves and visited when only seniors were allowed to shop. We wore masks even when we walked outside. As the weather warmed, we began inviting one or two friends to visit us on our patio, but asked that they bring their own drinks and food. They gladly obliged.As time passed we grew more confident. We stopped wearing gloves, but kept the masks. We no longer shopped during “senior” hours. I started frequenting my favorite book store, Magers & Quinn, followed by a trip across the street to my favorite bakery, The Black Walnut, intent on supporting local businesses. I felt comfortable doing this because of the safeguards put in place: a limit on the number of people in these venues at any one time, social distancing, mask requirements. Magers & Quinn only accepts credit cards. The Black Walnut takes customers’ names for contact tracing. All of these practices gave me a feeling of safety.But I was unprepared for what I experienced in Iowa. When we took our first bathroom break at a gas station, roughly half of the patrons wore masks. When we stopped at a well-known grocery store in the Amana Colonies, the parking lot was full and the store was buzzing. Again, about half the customers wore masks, no social distancing was observed when we stood in line to pay, and the young Amish women in charge of the cash registers weren’t even masked.In my husband’s hometown, I stopped at a favorite coffee shop. Only a few customers were inside, but none wore masks. I stood away from the counter while I waited for the person ahead of me to get his order. But when I went to the head of the line, a young mother, small child in tow, came and stood right next to me for the five minutes I waited, chattering to the barista the whole time.My point is not that I think I acquired the virus from any of these encounters. But I couldn’t help but feel that these unmasked and non-social-distancing people were rude. Rude to me, a person who is obviously a senior, and rude to the mostly masked employees who were serving them.If governors are going to leave decision-making about the virus completely up to residents, then they need to do a better job of educating their populace. They need to convince them that health experts highly recommend masks and social distancing and that such practices are good mannersandsmart.Some Minnesotans wish our state were more like Iowa. I have heard Jason Lewis, who is running for a Senate seat, say that we should quarantine the sick and protect the vulnerable while allowing everyone else to resume their normal lives. But what does this mean How should one behave if he or she sees an older person in a store Or should older people just stay homeWe have close friends in Iowa with whom we have shared many restaurant meals. They tell us that since March they hardly go anywhere because of Iowa’s lax rules. This means they are mostly shopping online, likely making very few contributions to the local economy.And that brings me to another point. Iowa’s lax rules are bad for businesses, especially local businesses. We spent much less money there than we normally would have, because we didn’t feel safe shopping. Our relatives feel the same. They are ordering from Amazon and other online venues, often bypassing local shops.We will keep going to Iowa to see my mother-in-law. But we feel safer among better informed and more thoughtful Minnesotans.Martha Bordwell of Minneapolis writes about current events, family life, and travel."

But four of his Cabinet picks may have an even greater uphill battle.John Kerry, Gina McCarthy, Jennifer Granholm and Pete Buttigieg have to save the world. And not much time to do it.In the worst year in collective memory, people cannot be faulted for putting climate change down the priority list of crises. But a raft of new reports is chilling in unanimously warning that sooner than we think, it will be too late to act.As too much snow blankets much of the Midwest and Northeast, the idea of a warming planet seems preposterous. But think back to the killer hurricanes that outnumbered the alphabet. Think of the misery of catastrophic storms that left millions homeless. Think of the droughts and food shortages and disease and tsunamis. Climate change means that extreme weather gets more extreme. And there comes a point where technology and innovation are too late. The damage is done.According to the United Nations and science researchers around the globe, this is just the beginning. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we have only 10 years left to reverse climate change.After four years where the official U.S. position was to deny the reality of climate change, meaning that reports were quashed, data hidden, pacts discarded and in general the White House scoffed that 99 percent of scientists were stodges, we are vulnerable. It’s as if a giant alien threat were coming at us and, bureaucrats were pooh-poohing the whole thing.Kerry, former senator, former presidential candidate, former secretary of State and negotiator of the Paris Climate Accord, is the new special envoy for climate. He has the stature to be our country’s international face of the battle against climate change. He will have a seat on the National Security Council and will report directly to the president. Kerry said that this indicates the Biden administration understands that climate change is a serious threat to national security.Gina McCarthy former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, will be heading Biden’s huge domestic campaign to deal with climate change.Also, Biden has chosen former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm to be energy secretary; that is an invaluable choice because energy is at the center of combatting climate change.And Biden tapped a strong rival for the president, Pete Buttigieg, for the post of transportation secretary.This is a formidable climate change team. These are the changes that this team must combat. We will know if a few years if they are up to the job.Alaska is warming so fast that in 30 years, how humans interact with Alaska’s environment, the scope of species and the landscape will be unrecognizable. Indigenous communities are already struggling with damaged infrastructure because of melting permafrost. Temperatures are the second-highest they have been in more than a century of record-keeping.Yes, climate change is a natural phenomenon caused by multiple factors over centuries. The problem for this generation is that years of humans burning fossil fuels have sped up change too fast. We now have more intense storms, heat waves, drought and warming oceans. Sea levels are rising, which will wipe out coastal cities. Glaciers are melting and warming seas will harm people’s livelihoods. Whole species will cease to exist.But the good news is that the rest of the world was already worried by the science and didn’t completely pull back from climate change concerns.So in this season of tiny little shards of hope sparkling on the horizon, there should be new confidence that that Biden White House understands that climate change is a monumental threat and one that we must deal with. That is no longer hyperbole.The new U.S. goal is to make the country carbon neutral by 2050. According to a new Princeton University study, this will mean a huge new investment in energy infrastructure. It will be difficult but it is doable and financially feasible given sufficient political will and America’s can-do resolve.For the first time in four years, there is realistic hope we won’t destroy Earth.Email Ann McFeatters at amcfeatters@nationalpress.com.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

minnpost_2020_138,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We all watched in horror last week as George Floyd was killed at the hands of four police officers. I was shocked to my core and thought to myself, “How could any human do this, let alone officers wearing a Minneapolis Police uniform”As everyone else was looking at this from their own perspectives, I was simply numb. I quickly began to question everything I thought I knew. The more time I spent reflecting, the more difficult it was to process. It was no longer just a death at the hands of police; the death of George Floyd shook my belief in humanity.In that moment, I also knew that it is no longer acceptable to see things from our own perspectives and that it is time we begin seeing them through one set of eyes in our country. Racism has been a systematic part of all of our institutions in America since this nation’s inception, and police departments are no exception. It is time we acknowledge our limitations and take action to make systemic changes within our profession.I believe our communities need police, but only if we can achieve police legitimacy. By its very definition, police legitimacy means people have trust and confidence in the police, accept police authority and believe officers are fair and just. Officers can only build public confidence by treating all people with dignity and respect in every encounter.The questions all of us face are, “What now How can we make the transformational cultural change that must occur within police departments across our country moving forward Is it even possible” It will be difficult, painful and take time, but we must work toward actionable solutions that are embedded in a new policing model.It begins with every officer standing up to denounce the actions of the officers that killed George Floyd. Not just today, but each day in both words and actions any time a fellow officer acts in a manner that dishonors the badge.Having lived a life of public service, I know the majority of police officers across the country serve their communities with professionalism, bravery and empathy. We wanted to make the world a safer and better place. Officers who cannot denounce George Floyd’s death should turn in their badge, with no questions asked. Not doing so only endangers other officers and community members in Minneapolis and across the country.Nationally, I hope we will have a robust conversation about creating standards and consistent guidelines for the more than 18,000 police departments that currently have a variety of policies and procedures. Police leaders must have support from elected leaders at all levels and be empowered to remove barriers to progress like the current role of police unions and automatic arbitrations. Many existing union contracts should end, and new ones created to support and foster a culture of procedural justice and return to the pillars of the 21st-century policing model.A police department must have all the tools and resources to effectively hire, train, develop, support and hold all members of the organization accountable. These six pillars address all of the necessary components:Finally, we all need to listen more, and to comprehend what is actually being said. We must acknowledge that we do not have the answers and listen to not simply the words, but understand the real pain and struggle behind the message. Most important, we must listen to our communities, be willing to change and regain the public’s trust.I will continue to listen and learn and use whatever influence and experiences I might have to be a small part of a much larger movement.Janeé L.

suffolknewsherald_2020_157,"Published 6:03 pm Friday, December 4, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonThree little words, burning in their minds and hearts, “We had hoped.” A story from the Bible, Luke 24.Let me introduce you to two men in an ancient time who hoped for a different outcome than the one they were experiencing. The story is like a work of art; we need to ponder the picture until we see all the details.These two men were on a seven-mile walk home. The world of that day was in turmoil. They had put confidence for peace and stability in One called Jesus. They had seen His work, a Leader with authority and power, One Who could change their world. Now, all that faith had been downsided. They had lost hope.Unknown to them but walking beside them was the omnipresent God, risen from the dead. They had not bothered to get acquainted; they were still blinded by grief. They were sad, “down in the dumps” and this One had not even bothered to listen to the news all Jerusalem was talking about. It is so like us. It is hard to believe in an “Omni-God” — all powerful, all knowing and present in every situation — when/if He doesn’t do things the way we thought they should be done. A friendly voice interrupts and begins an “interrogation.”“Hey, y’all, what’s up?” Their answer is like that from people we all know.The men ask, “Are you the only one in all Jerusalem who does not know the things that have taken place?” The Stranger answers them, “What things?”He knew the story far better than they, but they had likely seen that burial tomb, heard the story how it was made very secure but was found open. The body was not there. There was a rumor that some women had seen Him after the resurrection, but who can believe an incredible story like that?Jesus brought to their minds what the prophets had spoken. He called them “fools” and “slow of heart to believe.” They were near their village and it was getting late. Jesus “made as though He would have gone further.” They did not ask questions when this One, still a Stranger to them, pretended He needed to go further. Jesus accepted the invitation to stay with them. They sat down to eat. The women at home must have had the bread ready. Jesus was a guest, but He took the bread, blessed it, then broke it and gave it to them. They recognized Who He was, “the Bread of Life.” He vanished from their sight.The men leave the table and hurry back to Jerusalem to tell their experience to the fearful disciples. Jesus was already there. He ate fish and honeycomb with the disciples gathered around Him, perhaps to prove it was not a spirit but One made alive after death, a lesson for everyone who chooses to believe in Him. There is resurrection life. We need not fear anything when our faith is secure in Him.This is a story that demands credence, even from Christians. Are we not just like that? We have earnestly prayed about something, we think we know what will happen, then are laid low by unexpected changes. If God doesn’t answer the way we think He should, is He still God or have we made ourselves into a lesser god? If we believe God is in control, let’s sharpen our “sword of the Spirit” which fights unbelief and continue trusting God. Only the “Omni-God” knows the roadblocks up ahead. We need to fill our tanks with faith and be ready for that unknown future. It is what the Bible teaches us to do.Myrtle Thompson, 92, is a Bible teacher, retired missionary, educator and writer.

minnpost_2020_211,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .An overwhelming majority of Americans, 85%, say they want fundamental election reforms. But let’s face it, doing so is hard since there will never be big money behind enacting clean election reforms. Money inevitably flows to issues where there are profits to be made. Sadly, there is no monetary gain in making our electoral system truer to America’s ideals.That’s the premise of the Clean Election Reform Grades, created by the nonpartisan nonprofit organization Minnesota Citizens for Clean Elections (MnCCE . The grades reflect the positions taken by 2020 candidates for the Minnesota Senate on five core election reforms. The Senate is the focus, because in recent years that is where proposals have been ignored.Minnesotans can simply go tohttp: www.mnelectiongrades.org, type in the Senate District where they live, and see where their Senate candidates stand on the five election reforms. It only takes a few seconds, and the information is clear with grades ranging from A to F.Each of the five proposed reforms upon which the grades are based is critically important. First, candidates state their position on a constitutional amendment to reverse theCitizens UnitedSupreme Court decision, which took away Congress’ power to limit campaign contributions. That amendment has already passed in 20 of the 38 states required to amend the Constitution.Third, candidates reveal whether they support increased public financing of campaigns, which would partially offset special interest influences.Fourth, candidates disclose their opinion on establishing an independent commission of nonpoliticians to advise the Minnesota Legislature on a fair plan for redrawing legislative district lines.Finally, candidates give their position on a National Public Vote law, requiring Minnesota’s electoral votes to go to the presidential candidate with the most popular votes nationwide, an effort already passed by 15 states and the District of Columbia with 196 Electoral College votes. It would take effect when passed by states totaling 270 electoral votes, the number needed for an electoral college majority.Why publicize “A” to “F” grades based on these five issues It’s nearly impossible for individual voters to gather this kind of clear information on their own since they’d have to go out and individually interview candidates.Better-informed voters will lead to more reform-minded legislators, resulting in cleaner elections and governing. But first, clear and concise information needs to be easily accessible to Minnesotans.Obviously, election reforms aren’t the only issues Minnesotans should consider before they vote. But because those issues tend to be under-discussed during campaigns, Minnesotans need some extra help learning about candidates’ positions on those topics.Unfortunately, when Minnesotans go to the Clean Election Grades, they’ll notice that many candidates receive an “F,” because they refused to disclose their positions to their constituents. That “F” grade is justified, since we won’t have clean elections as long as we have leaders who refuse to share their positions with constituents. (Note: Even after the questionnaire deadline given to candidates, MnCCE stands ready to add candidates’ positions and upgrade their grades at any time. So, if you’re one of the 85% of Americans from all political parties who want fundamental changes in clean elections, check out the Clean Election Grades to inform your vote. Our democracy depends on you.The grades are available athttp: www.mnelectiongrades.orgTom Horner is a former Independence Party candidate for governor and chief of staff to Republican U.S. Sen.

suffolknewsherald_2020_54,"Published 9:54 pm Tuesday, July 7, 2020ByStaff ReportsDo you feel that your family is important to you?Last week, I had an opportunity to go and be a part of my family cookout. We usually have a huge cookout, inviting a lot of friends around the community. Because of the pandemic, we had to back off having a large gathering. I really didn’t want to go even with the small group, because of the pandemic that is taking so many lives. But let me tell you, when I got around my family, it made me feel good. It brings me back to remembrance of who I am and my history. It allows me to be me without all of the trimmings and the titles that we all sometimes hold. It blessed me to be able to sit on my sister’s couch.In Genesis 35, there is an account found of Esau and Jacob, who were twins, but they were totally different. One liked working around their mom in the house, while the other liked being out in the woods with their father. One day, something happened that changed their life in how they treated each other. When this happened, Jacob had to depart from the family. There was so much anger and tension in the home that he had to leave.Years had passed, but one day Esau and Jacob met again, and when they did, they cried. When I read this, I paused because I could feel the overwhelming emotion as I look in this text. So many things were running through their minds. First, they were sorry for what had happened. Growing up will in fact allow you to see and handle things differently. You can’t allow little things to tear up your family. You can’t allow little things to stop you from communicating. No, you have to remember that you are family, and family is important.Also, they were crying because all these years had passed, and time had been wasted. You can’t let gaps come in your life because you’re too busy and you miss moments of being with your family. Whatever has happened, you have to be the bigger person and clear up whatever has happened and get your family together.Lastly, the Lord knows how to bring people back together. Esau and Jacob may have been thinking about each other but never reached out. I’m sharing this with each of you to pass this on, to reach out to the family, stay in touch with your loved ones. When you get back with them, you may be the one to have to create the right atmosphere. Whatever you need to do, just do it and know it’s the right thing to do.Remember, it’s your family, and it’s your history.

minnpost_2020_180,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Here in Minnesota, we often count ourselves lucky to live in what could be one of the most climate-resilient places in the United States because of our abundant freshwater resources. With our 10,000 lakes, we have the water many regions lack. And our tie to the Mississippi is crucial. More than 2.5 million people and countless businesses rely on the Mississippi River, which gets its start in Minnesota, for their water needs.For us, everything hinges on water. Minnesota in its current form can’t exist without a healthy Mississippi. Our lakes and rivers are vital to our communities, supporting not only communities outstate, but also the large companies in and around the Twin Cities. The river is a source of economic prosperity that needs to be protected now.At Ecolab, we manage more than a trillion gallons of water annually for our customers worldwide. Here’s what we know: It’s hard to produce a steady supply of goods and services or grow crops efficiently when you’re besieged by droughts, floods, freak weather and pollution. Healthy watersheds provide a natural buffer that helps ensure stability in a climate-challenged world.That’s especially true in Minnesota. Where do we start Protecting our land.More and more, businesses are learning that natural landscapes are a source of resilience. When present, forests and wetlands are a natural sponge and filter. The rich soils and roots soak up excess water, keeping it from running off into lakes and waterways with the sediments and chemicals it can carry. This recharges our groundwater and supplies our lakes and streams. But now we’re facing the challenge of diminishing forest and wetlands.This must be reversed. Without our natural water storage and filtration, climate-induced excessive rainfalls lead to more flooding and pollution. It will cost four times as much to restore landscapes once they’re lost than to preserve them. That’s why we need to act immediately to protect the Mississippi’s headwaters, which are still 60% forested.The good news is that the work has already started. TNC scientists have identified 200,000 of the 13-million-acre Mississippi headwaters watershed as most critical to securing healthy lakes, streams, and drinking water. Protecting and restoring those areas will take a decade andTNC’s Our Water Campaign, has been raising funds to jumpstart this work.We can’t do it alone though, and it can’t be put on hold until the pandemic is over. Business, government and civil society must come together in the best Minnesota tradition.Businesses should reduce their water footprint and eliminate pollution to alleviate pressure on lakes and rivers. By investing in the protection and restoration of wetlands, they can offset their water usage. They can fund groups like TNC and tell elected officials that natural landscapes are a tangible business enabler for the state.Government can take the lead in setting clear priorities. It’s no secret that America’s water infrastructure is old and literally leaky. We need to invest in upgrades that also promote the reuse of water and installation of “purple pipe” systems that allows us to recirculate non-potable water that’s good enough for industrial uses. Water infrastructure should be a key part of any pandemic recovery plans or stimulus. At the same time, tax and other incentives can be given to companies that make water-smart investments.With their wealth of scientific expertise and awareness-raising chops, civil society groups can help ensure high-quality work and socially equitable outcomes. Individuals can do their part by learning, donating, volunteering and demanding that business leaders elected officials do the right thing.If we get this right, we will not only build the foundations for a climate resilient region, but we’ll also lay the ground work that will enable us to continue to be a next exporter of water and strengthen our economy through the goods, food and services we produce.Making this effort is in keeping with who we are as a state that has a history of coming together to do the right thing and – perhaps most of all – has always had a love affair with its pristine and abundant water.Emilio Tenutais vice president and chief sustainability officer at Ecolab in St. Paul."

These deaths have sadly laid bare, once again, the racial inequalities and social injustices that people of color have endured for so long in our country. The health and economic impact of the coronavirus in communities of color has also been a sad reminder for me of these inequalities and social injustices.It saddens me to see the violence that has erupted. While I believe that the vast majority of protesters and police are people who do not seek out violence, I also believe that the few who do use violence for their ends are to be prayed for and to be held accountable for their transgressions. As my parents taught me, two wrongs don’t make a right. May we seek justice for all who have been wronged as we see the divisions that still exist among people.It is my hope that those who are followers of Jesus will heed the words of the Lord found in 2 Chronicles 7:14 (with some of my present-day comments in brackets : “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and seek to build personal relationships with people of color and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways by being involved in seeking justice for all and working on changing systemic racism , then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.”As the book of James says: “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also (2:26 .” In these days, may we put feet to our thoughts and prayers in our local community.Rev.

eugeneweekly_2020_2,"We ve got issues. Given the enduring impact of Jim Weaver’s accomplishments during his years in Congress as well as the countless friends, colleagues, news organizations and others who have paid tribute to his vision and political courage, it’s gratifying to know that so many Oregonians are now hearing about his impact on our world and the environment we’ll leave our children. Several hallmarks will be cited most often: His success stopping the Washington Public Power Supply System, aka WPPSS, nuclear power plants — battling wealthy New York bond holders, mammoth private utilities, CEOs and the entire Northwest Congressional delegation. Twenty-one in all — none of whom joined our side, even after BPA Administrator Don Hodel started bellowing (today’s hilarious claim that “the Northwest will suffer brown-outs and blackouts throughout the 80s and 90s if Jim Weaver isn’t stopped.” Other accomplishments that stand out: The only filibuster in U.S. House of Representatives history, sustained yield forest management laws, wilderness protection for ancient forests and fisheries habitat, America’s first organic farming bill, stopping USDA rubber-stamping of directives from Dow Chemical, Monsanto and other herbicide makers. And others. Having served as Jim Weaver’s chief of staff for many years I was also there for the wit and irony that probably won’t be included in Jim’s remembrances: In a Congressional hearing, Jim described an out-of-state academic hired by lobbyists to falsely dispute job-loss data as “an economic imbecile.” Afterward, facing Republicans who angrily demanded an apology, Jim was humble, stating, “You’re correct. I was wrong. He’s not an economic imbecile. He’s simply an imbecile.” We escaped amid gales of laughter. Jim wore a small, remarkably natural-looking, hairpiece during his first term — so natural that when it was mailed to the D.C. office from wherever Jim had sent it for cleaning before leaving for a two-week trip to Oregon, no one knew what it was. Someone suggested it was a pelt from an Oregon trapper appreciative of Jim’s habitat protection. So, it was mounted on a plaque and hung on the lobby wall. Jim always arrived by 7 am. When we arrived at 8 am the morning after his return, we saw the plaque, but no pelt. When Jim walked into our meeting we all looked up and immediately recognized that what we’d mounted was no pelt. The plaque was later discreetly removed. Years passed before the story was shared with Jim, who — fortunately — howled with laughter. My favorite Jim Weaver story: The House cafeteria was always jammed at lunchtime. Members and staff would shuffle down a counter, selecting and then paying, but sometimes particularly self-impressed members would push ahead, irritating everyone. Finally fed up, I and others angrily told a group of pin-striped Republicans to stop their bullying. Their leader said, “Hell no!,” then grabbed a placard from an easel and on its back wrote in giant letters “It’s NICE to be Important!WE are.” It was tacked above the counter. A week later a more substantial wooden sign appeared directly below it. In bold letters it stated simply: “But it’s a helluva lot more important to be nice.” No one knew its origins; but soon, I did. I received all of the office’s House administration invoices. A week after the new sign’s appearance, an invoice arrived from the House Carpentry Services Office. Inside, the bill simply said “House Cafeteria Be Nice Sign.” Below it was the handwritten scrawl I’d seen a thousand times before: “J. Weaver, 4th district, Oregon” Knowing Jim as well as I did, I never mentioned it. I’m glad that now, you know. Joe Rutledge served as Congressman Jim Weaver’s chief-of-staff from 1975 to 1984."
suffolknewsherald_2020_229,"Published 5:46 pm Friday, September 11, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieWhat is time? It is altogether apparent while beyond our control. We watch it progress on watches and clocks. We watch it pass in events that unfold. We watch time pass us by. Sometimes I wish I could “un-” the notion of sequence. If that superpower were mine perhaps then I could force the opposite of its course. Yet, I have learned through the years that time is not a tool or influence we could wield. It only gives us the impression that we shall manage its progression. We invest money each year on calendars and planners unaware of which of the blocks in the grid may be our last. When illness strikes or an accident leads to a fatal disaster, we are painfully reminded that we don’t have time. Time belongs to our Master.Wasn’t it Peter in the book of Matthew who had the nerve to tell Jesus, “It’s not your time yet. Lord this shall not be unto thee.” Lately, I find that I am Peter and Peter is me.In Matthew chapter 16 along verse 21, Jesus sat with his disciples and told them what was to be done. Upon hearing the news that they would lose their hero, Peter was bold and said, “No.” Wishing to undo what was already in the plans, Peter stood by with his face in his hands. He was rebuked just for speaking his truth. I’m sure the other disciples were wishing it too. To hear that your hero has only a few days left, you would also want to turn back the angel of death. Jesus told them his death was the will of God. Peter learned that God’s plans need not his approval or man’s nod. Still I wish we could mute the grief or make it easier to accept.And so it goes. Without a choice or say so, we experience loss and mourn the homegoing of our heroes. I was merely 11 in 1987 when my first hero went to heaven. My great-grandfather Alfred “Perry” Harris was like no man I knew. Since my parents separated when I was just a toddler, he was the only man I saw as a real father. Papa Perry was such a great man. His eyes were like jewels. His hugs like the best pillows. Lying against his chest watching billows rise from his pipe were the best days of my young life. How I wish we had more memories together. His death was the first I ever learned of colon cancer.Here I am again with another one of my heroes lost to this disease. There is no ease of mind. It seems there is no cease to the increasing numbers of notable deaths this year. We have lost so much and so many in 2020 that I find it difficult to breathe. This latest news of the beloved actor who played our Black Panther is most difficult to believe.Everyone keeps saying how Chadwick Boseman’s death was untimely. That word “untimely” bothers me tremendously. Our use of the word “untimely” suggests that we have a say so over the how and now of when events are uncovered or the loss of a loved one discovered. You would think I knew him like a brother as much as this death makes my lips quiver and my eyes water. How dare he not share with us what he was going through. Didn’t he know what damage his absence would do? How will there be a “Black Panther 2”?Then the spirit of God quieted my foolish judgment. Who am I to question God’s timing or intent? Although it hurt my soul to hear the news, I had to accept. No one knows our final hour or what will be our cause of death. I was left with this thought about untimeliness. Is death ever favorable or prompt? Until Jesus, it was not.When I read the account of Jesus preparing His disciples for His crucifixion, I do understand Peter’s reaction. Jesus gave them advance notice so that the disciples would understand that God had a plan. No more would death ever be the end game as long as we believe in Jesus ‘ name. The gospel according to the greatest superhero is this: we have the promise of everlasting life in Jesus Christ. Even though the shock of the loss of our on-screen Black Panther hurts us so, I choose to believe that Chadwick Boseman knew what we all should know. Our tenure on earth is not the end of our living.

philinquirer_2020_30,"The Inquirer Opinion team recently asked our readers to share what they are giving thanks for this year.The Inquirer Opinion team recently asked our readers to share what they are giving thanks for this year.The chuckles of my husband that I hear coming from the kitchen as he reads the comics or from his home office as he comes across a medical writer’s joke. The quiet laughter with my 91-year old mother when we share memories of her life. The giggles from my 21-month old granddaughter when I make funny sounds while playing. The long deep belly laughs with my 5-year-old grandson because we are just so silly together. It has been a hard year, a hard 4 years really, but an especially hard year. Laughter is truly the best medicine. I am thankful for laughter.— Laura Harting, DowningtownThis Thanksgiving will be like no other time in our lives as we celebrate having our beautiful granddaughter, Myla, home with us. Myla was born 3-1/2 months premature on March 18 and weighed only 1 lb. 6 oz. For the past eight months, we didn’t know if we should have hope because her condition was critical. Thanks to the wonderful nurses, doctors, therapists and staff of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Virtua Hospital in Voorhees, Myla came home on Nov. 11 to finally join our family. I am so grateful for the care that she received at these hospitals. I am also very proud and in awe of her parents, Michael and Ann, for the love and care that they give to her to keep her alive with a ventilator, feeding tube and suction equipment. I thank God with a heart full of gratitude for our blessings. Our Thanksgiving is every day!— Patricia M. Duffy, Cherry HillDuring the past eight months of the pandemic, I’ve kept every empty toilet paper tube displayed conspicuously in a large bowl on the dining room credenza. Each humble cardboard tube serves as a remembrance of our provisions and our gratefulness for them. Yes, we joined the multitudes searching for that one roll of toilet paper hidden in the back of the shelf. Yet, in all of this time, I’ve never lacked one square of this valuable asset! While the bowl won’t be used as a Thanksgiving centerpiece this year, it is a daily reminder of our many blessings during this time of COVID. Maybe this activity is one of those odd behaviors bought on by stress and uncertainty but it has carried me through these strange days with just a touch of humor while reminding me of our vulnerable humanity.— Leslie Wise, ErdenheimThis Thanksgiving I am thankful for Gov. Tom Wolf. I believe his early and forceful response to the pandemic saved the lives of many Pennsylvanians. As the early months of the pandemic unfolded, it became increasingly clear that the decision-making of governors was the single most significant variable impacting the lives and health of Americans. As I compared Governor Wolf with his counterparts around the country, I felt extremely lucky to have him at the helm in this dark and dangerous time. Prior to March 2020, I thought of Gov. Wolf as a “nice guy.” I viewed him as honest and ethical but, in all honesty, didn’t see him as an especially strong leader. Fortunately I was wrong. He rose to the occasion with humanity and intelligence. Among those in political leadership positions at various levels of government, he is my one and only “COVID hero.” I am thankful that he is my Governor.— Andrew Gelber, PhiladelphiaMy family and I are grateful that my husband, suffering from one of the earliest serious cases of Covid this spring, has recovered with only a couple of minor lingering effects. We are humbled and grateful for all the doctors and nurses at Crozer Chester Medical Center, especially in the ICU, who took excellent care of him over 37 days, including 11 days on a ventilator. We also greatly appreciate the staff at Delaware County’s Fair Acres, who provided physical therapy to get him strong enough to return home. Finally, we are beyond grateful to our families, friends, Swarthmore neighbors, local businesses, our work colleagues, and others who swooped in to provide food, flowers, heartfelt notes of encouragement, errand-running, and emotional support from a distance while we struggled with the uncertainty that the sudden illness brought. We feel fortunate for my husband’s recovery and for our support system.— Virginia Thompson, SwarthmoreWhen I wake in the morning and my feet touch the floor, I am thankful that I lived to see another day. When I go for a run, I am grateful for my healthy lungs and strong legs. And, when I sit in the park and read on a crisp Fall afternoon, I am thankful for the warm sunshine on my face and for the adorable squirrels scampering on a carpet of colorful leaves. Life is truly a visual feast every day. All of us need to take a seat at the table and enjoy the simple pleasures.— Carol A. Pasquarello, PhiladelphiaI’m grateful for COVID-19, but let me be clear as to why: I’m not grateful for a single death, let alone a quarter million - better lives be saved than lessons learned. But virtually all of us have learned to live deeper and more joyous lives resisting the death that surrounds us. When skies clear in spring, let’s remember how our new world came to be.— William Crawford Woods, West ChesterSince I’ve managed to stick around for 94 years, I guess the first thing I’m thankful for is I’m still alive. I am also thankful to be living in the first country in 3000 or so years of recorded history that was founded by people who would govern themselves. What a novel idea. OK, so it ain’t perfect but it ain’t bad either and since it has only been in existence about 300 years, it might be considered a teenager among nations and like all teenagers, it takes a little time to mature. I’m even thankful for protests because they prove we’re trying. I’m thankful for our diversity because it’s our strength.— Ralph D. Bloch JenkintownDon’t you hate those millennials who are glued to their phones, walking down the middle of the sidewalk? Yeah, hi! That was me pre-COVID bumbling around to work or a happy hour. Cue the pandemic. With nowhere to be at no particular time, I’ve unplugged more than ever and found myself looking up to realize that our city is absolutely flush with beautiful murals. If you don’t believe me, walk a few blocks and turn 360 degrees at each intersection. Not only did I see murals on routes I regularly took, but I also saw some become obscured by construction (and painted over during the protests … bye, Rizzo and a few new additions, even during these weird times. I became so intrigued by them that I curated a two-mile tour. I’m so grateful to have the privilege to share this life-sized art exhibit with my friends, with masks of course!— Su Fen Lubitz, PhiladelphiaThankful that I, my wife and our family are healthy, that I have a home to live in, a job to support us, and food on our table. Also for a community that cares for and about us and the very good fortune to be able to help others by caring for them. I’m thankful to be able to provide financial assistance to others though our church and various other charities, such as West Kensington Ministries and Crossroads in North Philadelphia. We give every year, but this year more than most, it’s vital all of us give what we can to those who need it. Finally I’m very thankful for the feeling that being able to give provides me with joy, and hope and love.— John Shaffer, JamisonMy sobriety, safety, health, faith, friends, family, and the victory of the Biden-Harris in the presidential election.— Patricia Joseph, ValenciaThis year I’m grateful to still have a job and a way to support myself, as I know many people who have lost work because of the pandemic. I’m also extremely grateful to live with close friends who have made this time less isolating. I adopted a cat from PAWS in April and she’s brought so much comfort and joy into our home. I’m endlessly thankful to all the healthcare workers in Philly for what they do.— Melissa Goyette, PhiladelphiaBeing thankful and being content very much go hand in hand for me. Recently, my memories began drifting back to the big, raucous, happy family holidays that I miss, and I began imagining future gatherings. It ultimately became tough to be genuinely thankful for all I do have, because all I could think about was what was missing. I found that for me to be truly thankful requires a level of contentment with a very different life now. Learning to be thankful has required me to narrow my focus to the here and now, deliberately recognize what I do have, and to not dwell on what I am missing, especially during Thanksgiving, which is my favorite holiday. I am slowly learning to become content, and in doing so, am learning to be ever more thankful.— Maggie Beck, PalmyraThis year has been the roughest decade of my life, a feeling most likely true for all of us. So much is different. I won’t be celebrating Thanksgiving with my family, still, I have so much to be thankful for. I am thankful for my 13-year old Pomeranian and loving companion. He’s made me laugh and helped me relax when I needed it most. I am grateful that my family and friends are safe and my thoughts remain with those affected. Most of all, I am thankful that a family friend, who very recently battled breast cancer, has come through her surgery, is home safe and healing well. She has shown such strength and grace through it all and has inspired me during this difficult time. I’ve come to realize that, although things are bad right now, I am still one of the lucky ones.— Kristina Cohen, Cape MayWhen this city girl moved to rural northern New York 62 years ago as a bride, I decided to make my first Thanksgiving. There was no such thing as “store-bought” desserts, so I learned through trial and many errors to make my own. Now, even though I live in Philly, I still make all of the desserts and they are the high point of dinner. The kids and grandkids come from CA, CO, as well as right down the street. One year I decided to take the easy way out and instead of making all of the desserts, bought Costco’s apple pie, which is really good. I didn’t say a word about substituting their pie for mine. We’re all at the table eating the variety of happy endings when my CA daughter looked up and said, “Mom, I didn’t fly 3,000 miles for Costco’s apple pie.” I am thankful that my children care enough to stay home because I am medically compromised and hopeful that next year we can all be together for my favorite holiday. So this will be the first time in 62 years that I haven’t made Thanksgiving dinner as none of the kids want to put their grandpop or me at risk. We will all Zoom (yes, this octogenarian has learned how and for the first time we will do curbside pick up from Ryan Christopher’s. But oh, how I will miss all the hugs!— Marian Levin, Merion StationFirst and foremost, would be the right of religious freedom this country allows and then would be my husband, Rick and our family. Thankful for doctors, nurses, first responders and all those who work so tirelessly for our community and are dealing with this years challenges. Thankful for pharmaceutical companies getting a vaccine ready to go and trying to save lives. Thankful for those providing food and housing for those without. I am also very thankful for all of my constituents, for they make my job worth doing. May you all stay safe and healthy.— Councilwoman Anita L. Barton, ConshohockenThis year as our family is scattered, I am most grateful for one thing. I am simply and most humbled to have my family alive. From my 95-year old mother to a fairly young great niece in Israel, we are alive. By our faith in God and lots of caution we have survived. And now with modern medicine, perhaps we can get a grip on COVID-19 and perhaps learned some valuable lessons on life. Nothing counts more than family.— Lois Canter, Cherry HillGive thanks to all the men and women in our military, first responders, and medical teams who keep us healthy and safe from harm’s way. Also to all who produce, deliver, and service our daily needs in agriculture, transportation, retail, and other essential needs. A message of gratitude to all our government workers who perform the necessary tasks in education and municipal services. Let us not forget our religious community, entertainment, and sports which gives us a sense of faith and enjoyment with their dedication and talent. Try to remember those less fortunate by contributing your time or resources to assist in their physical, emotional, or medical needs.—Bob Sweeney, Warwick, RI"
minnpost_2020_231,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .If 2020 has confirmed anything, it is that our same old attempts to eliminate the perpetual racial disparities in our country’s systems and services are not working.Recent events – be it the historic COVID-19 pandemic that isdisproportionately harmingMinnesota’s African American and Hispanic populations, or the devastatingkilling of George Floydin our own Minneapolis – have only further highlighted the severe racial and socioeconomic inequities that we already knew existed for children and families of color.How do I know this I work with racially diverse, low-income Native American and communities of color every day.In 1974, Southside Family Nurturing Center (Southside was founded in the Phillips community of south Minneapolis. The private, not-for-profit agency’s founders had three primary focuses when serving families in the neighborhood: to nurture children, build on a family’s strengths and find alternatives to violence.Fast forward a little more than 45 years later. Our model of supporting families through therapeutic early childhood education, intensive home visiting, nutritious meals, crisis intervention and multiple on-site therapy services has remained relevant, consistent, and most importantly,effective. We have been in this space – both in the Phillips neighborhood and the space of therapeutic early childhood education – for decades, and over the last five years, I’ve seen firsthand the urgent need for our holistic, trauma-informed model. This need not only exists, but appears to be increasing rapidly.Building up true health and education equity requires constant action and ideally, is something that we as a culture should start prioritizing for our children and families as soon as possible. The impact of prevention and early intervention from prenatal to five years is vitally important; and if we’re willing to invest as a community, we can change, or literally tip, the health and education scales throughout a person’s life and our next generation.This is where it gets tricky. “Investing as a community” is both the answer and the challenge to being successful in genuine health and education reform. While the Southside model has a sustained track record of making positive progress for children and families, the reality is that the model of deeply investing in our children and their bright futures is expensive.A true return on our equity attempts will only come with a different investment from what we’ve made in the past. Something needs to happen – we need to try a new approach that is divergent from what we’ve imagined so far. It is my wholehearted belief that investing in and sharing the successes of the Southside model with other Twin Cities neighborhoods and communities is a great place to start.Our new awareness campaign,We Rise: Breaking Cycles, Building Equity, aims to begin this important conversation. I encourage anyone – community members, public and private leaders, developers, and funders – to reach out if interested in engaging. We’re looking for folks who genuinely want to invest their time, energy and if possible, money, into change. For decades, we’ve seen what this family-centered, care-based work can accomplish. We want to share our model with other partners so that more children, families and communities can thrive.Ready or not, the conversation around equity has arrived – in Minnesota and across the globe – and is here to stay. We cannot keep following the same old blueprints and allow history to continue repeating itself. Because it’s just not working.Gathering the talented and passionate people in our community who need to have change-filled, productive conversations That’s a great place to start.Julie Ellefson is the executive director of Southside Family Nurturing Center and has over 25 years of not-for-profit leadership experience in organizations serving children and families at risk for abuse and neglect.

philinquirer_2020_47,"I’m bombarded with sound and chaos. It’s a visual and auditory assault.I stand in front of the ICU doors and remember what this unit was like before March 2020. It was a spacious and controlled environment. Now it’s Temple University Hospital’s COVID ICU, and the difference between then and the present never ceases to jar me, even now, 10 months into this deadly pandemic. As the doors swing open, I’m bombarded with sound and chaos. It’s a visual and auditory assault. I start my shift wondering the same thing I do every shift: Who will die today?As nurses gather for shift change, the central monitor is beeping at our station. The patient’s oxygen saturation is dropping, and his ventilator is alarming as well. We discuss the need to prone him (position him on his stomach after shift change.Ventilator alarms have a distinct sound, similar to a car horn. In the COVID ICU, where COVID pneumonia requires the highest ventilator support for extended periods of time, they sound all day and all night. The respiratory therapists responsible for ventilated patients and those on high-flow oxygen are the unsung heroes of the pandemic. Several of these Temple therapists have contracted the virus due to their prolonged exposure to the aerosolized particles that carry it. They have all returned to work, dangerous though it may be. We need them.I take report from the night-shift nurse and learn that I have three patients today. I want to complain, but I’m reminded of the nurses throughout the hospital who struggle with six-patient assignments. I think of the overworked patient-care assistants, with 20 or 30 patients. I think of all the X-ray techs, pharmacy techs, and housekeepers, who are burning out, and the lab personnel, who are exhausted. No ancillary staff has been spared the physical, mental, and emotional toll of this pandemic. I accept my assignment without comment. Only the alarms sound.» READ MORE:Inside Philadelphia s busiest COVID-19 hospitalAfter report, we assemble four nurses and a respiratory therapist, put on our personal protective equipment (PPE , and place the alarming patient on his belly. Lying in the prone position typically requires a 1:1 assignment — one nurse to one patient. But no patient gets 1:1 care anymore. There are simply too many very ill patients. Turning sedated adults in a hospital bed without dislodging tubes or lines is a physically demanding and tricky endeavor, but we do it every day now. His oxygen saturation rises immediately.As I take off the PPE, an IV alarm sounds in another patient’s room. It’s not unusual for COVID patients to be receiving six to 10 infusions at a time. Pain medication, sedation, blood thinners, vasoactive drips, paralytics, and antiarrhythmics are all delivered through central IV lines. To an outsider, it looks like a tangled mess of tubing. Even for a skilled ICU nurse, it’s a complicated task to maintain each drip, titrate the medications, and ensure that none of them run out before a new bag is hung.» READ MORE:Plummeting morale, decreasing staff, and shrinking resources leave Pa. nurses in desperate need | Expert OpinionI glance at the patient’s nurse, who has several medications in her hand. She has it. We nod to each other because no words are necessary.The low-pitched honk of a kidney dialysis machine sounds. Maintaining this life-support equipment requires replacing and emptying heavy bags of fluid round the clock to ensure that the circuit doesn’t clot. If that were to happen, the patient would lose considerable blood volume — yet another emergent situation. I put on my N95, face shield, gown, and gloves and change the dialysate bag because the patient’s nurse is busy at another bedside.I still have yet to see my own patients.

The patients never stop rolling through the door.Most of the single ICU rooms have been converted to doubles. The rooms are crammed with twice as much equipment and every electrical socket is utilized. However, only one of the two patients can be hooked up to the monitors at the nurse’s station. For a nurse to hear the portable alarm attached to the other patient through the glass, it must be on the highest audible setting. My patient’s alarm is blaring because his oxygen level is dropping while he drinks some water.In an effort to keep this patient from being intubated, he is receiving 60 liters of oxygen at 100% (people typically receive 2 to 6 liters of oxygen at 28% through a high-flow nasal cannula. He has been in the ICU for two weeks and witnessed many body bags being wheeled out of the unit. His roommate is sedated on the ventilator, and the alarm is making him anxious.

minnpost_2020_28,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The Minnesota National Guard’s 34th Military Police Company isdeployingto Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The company’s mission is to “provide security,” presumably regarding the 40 Muslim men whom the United States continues to hold captive there nearly two decades after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.Guantanamo has long been cloaked in secrecy and is rarely the subject of public scrutiny. Here are three facts about the island prison to which the soldiers are headed that they, and all Minnesotans, should know:First, the detainees are an aging and increasingly sick population of torture survivors and victims of similarly significant trauma.For example,Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri,tortured by the CIA, is described by his doctor as “one of the most severely traumatized individuals I have ever seen.” Mohammed al-Qahtani,tortured by the military, developed PTSD, which further exacerbated his pre-existing schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. al-Qahtani’s condition is so severe that a federal courtorderedhe be evaluated without delay by an independent panel of doctors, a process that could result in hisrepatriation.Then there is Saifullah Paracha, a 73-year-old who has had multiple heart attacks andsuffersfrom “diabetes, coronary artery disease, diverticulosis, gout, psoriasis and arthritis;”Nashwan al-Tamir, who has had four spinal surgeries in two years; and Sharqawi Al Hajj, a fragile hunger striker who has repeatedlyattempted suicide. The list goes on.From three decades of providing healing services to torture survivors across the globe, we at theCenter for Victims of Tortureknow that the indeterminacy of such detention creates so much uncertainty, unpredictability, and loss of control over the elemental aspects of one’s life that it seriously harms even healthy individuals.Second, Guantanamo is not prepared for, and cannot handle, a COVID-19 outbreak.As I documented in a recentreportwith colleagues from Physicians for Human Rights, Guantanamo does not have the infrastructure, equipment, or expertise to manage atypical health needs. That problem is acute in the face of the pandemic.On April 7, the military reported Guantanamo’s second case of COVID-19, this one among detention facility staff. It has since “imposed a blackout on disclosures,” perCarol Rosenbergat the New York Times.Were the virus to spread further the consequences could be catastrophic, including for Minnesota’s soldiers. Retired Brig. Gen. Stephen Xenakis, M.D., who previously commanded all Army medical operations in the Southeast region, and who has spent hundreds of hours evaluating detainees and interfacing with Guantanamo’s medical care system, explained why in a letter to Congress:Some detainees have demonstrated serious preexisting illnesses that predispose them to poor outcomes if they become infected and require intensive care. My observations of healthcare services at Guantánamo since 2008 have been that the medical treatment facility … has not been equipped to treat and manage severely sick and complex patients. The spread of COVID-19 among the detainees could quickly overwhelm the capacity of the facility to treat them adequately and safeguard against an uncontrolled contagion across the base.Echoing Dr. Xenakis, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 11 of her colleagues issued ajoint statementon Friday expressing their “… doubts about the Guantánamo prison’s capacity to protect military personnel and detainees from Covid-19.” The statement responds to new information from the Defense Department that thesenators’ soughtregarding Guantanamo’s ability to manage the pandemic.Third, it costs taxpayers$540 million annually— more than $13 million per detainee — to sustain Guantanamo and to operate the war court system there.From 2012 to 2018, thegovernment spent$680 million on the military commissions alone, and projects to spend another billion through at least 2023. These novel courts have secured just eight convictions in 18 years,seven of whichhave been overturned in whole or in part on appeal. The case against the men alleged to be most responsible for the 9/11 attacks has not yet gone to trial.Even President Donald Trump haslamentedGuantanamo’s exorbitant costs and, more subtly, the military commissions’incompetence.Imagine what $1 billion over the next two years could do for the millions of Americans who have lost jobs during the pandemic, small business owners shutting their doors, and schools struggling under state budget cuts and reallocation of scarce revenue.Guantanamo must be closed. Until that day, Minnesota’s National Guard members should be in Minnesota doing work that benefits Minnesota. Requiring them to participate in the calamity that is Guantanamo, especially at a time of heightened health risk, benefits nobody.Scott Roehmis the Washington director for the St. Paul-based Center for Victims of Torture."

Anyone who remembers how awful the aftermath of that storm looked can attest that it seemed almost miraculous that nobody had perished.Last year on May 11, a tornado hit a few residences not far from downtown without any casualties. And now again, downtown and several neighborhoods surrounding it — and residences as far away as White Marsh Road — were struck by two tornadoes spawned by Tropical Storm Isaias. And again — although numerous homes and businesses were damaged and it will take quite some time for many people to rebuild — the most precious, important things are those that cannot be replaced or rebuilt. Once again, no lives were lost.This can be attributed to many things, depending on your worldview — God’s providence, good fortune, or simply the timely warnings from the great folks at National Weather Service Wakefield and a well-educated populace that knows what to do when they hear that warning. We like to think of it as God’s providence with a heavy dose of good science and good work emanating from Wakefield.But however you think of it, the fact remains, and we — as a business that also suffered heavy damage to our office — are so grateful for this piece of good news.And as usual, Suffolk really shows how great it is after disaster strikes.

These liberties and freedoms — taken for granted by some, seen as a right by others — are made possible by the sacrifices of the men and women in the United States Armed Forces. Freedom isn’t free; there is a price to be paid, and that debt has been paid for by our veterans.Veterans Day, originally known as Armistice Day, was created in recognition of the ending hostilities of World War I. In 1918, on the 11th day of the 11th month, an armistice was declared between the Allied nations and Germany. In 1938, Nov. 11 became a federal holiday in the United States, and in June 1954, the holiday was officially changed to Veterans Day, a day to honor American veterans of all wars.Veterans stand up for all Americans regardless of race, social standing, political party or individual beliefs. They willingly put their very lives on the line to defend the United States of America and her people.To all those who have served and sacrificed in the past and those who continue to serve and sacrifice so that we may enjoy our many freedoms and privileges, we thank you.

philinquirer_2020_10,"Two theologians debate a Catholic Trump voter.When Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last month, abortion became a key issue in the 2020 election. Previously back burnered by both former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump’s campaigns, Ginsburg’s death left a hole in the Supreme Court, allowing Trump, who has been called America’s most pro-life president, to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the bench. Unlike the pro-choice Ginsburg, Barrett has spoken out loudly against abortion, and it’s possible thatRoe v. Wade, the landmark court case that legalized abortion, could be overturned if she is confirmed.Meanwhile, Biden, a Catholic,has pledged to makeRoe v. Wade“the law of the land.”As Catholic voters head to the polls on Election Day (or mail in their ballots early , they must make a decision between two candidates: Biden, himself a Catholic, who is pro-choice, but has promised human rights and social service policies in line with Christian teachings, and Trump, whose pro-life stance is strong, but other policies limit access to health care for many people.We turned to Catholics with opposing views to debate:Can pro-life Catholics vote for Joe Biden?By Thomas Groome and Richard GaillardetzMay pro-life Catholics vote for former Vice President Joe Biden? Our consciences lead us to say an unqualified “yes,” and then some. First, theUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops, echoing the teaching of Popes Francis and Benedict, makes clear that Catholics should not be single-issue voters. While we may not vote for candidates because they support abortion, we can do so for the totality of their views. This reflects Pope Francis’ statement that “equally sacred” are the lives of those already born.Further, and recognizing that other Catholics may reach a different prudential judgment, out of the depths of our Catholic faith, we are convinced that not only may we vote for Biden, but even must do so, and for grave moral reasons.As faithful Catholic Christians, we accept the teaching of our church that “every human life, from the moment of conception until death, is sacred.” This being said, we recognize thatmore than 80% of Americans favor allowing abortion, at least in certain circumstances.The greatest Catholic theologian, Thomas Aquinas, taught that laws must reflect “the consensus of the governed” if they are to be effective. So, until the great majority of Americans oppose abortion, Catholics cannot impose our moral norms on the rest of society.“A President Biden will make it more possible for people to avoid unintended pregnancies.”So what are Catholics like us to do with our ethical convictions that cannot — at least at this time — become the law of the land? Again, Aquinas advises that when applying general moral principles, one must take account of the social context and discern how best to apply them. In such circumstances, Aquinas advised that we are to choose the greater good and the lesser evil. The greater good that is achievable now is to significantly reduce the number of abortions with effective social services. Fully confident in the deep commitments of Biden to his Catholic faith, and especially to its social teachings, he — not Donald Trump — is the one who will implement this accommodation.Our best warrant is the record of the Obama-Biden administrations. Over their eight years, and by improved health care and social services, theyreduced the U.S. abortion rate by 27%.A President Biden will make it more possible for people to avoid unintended pregnancies, and that all who desire to bring a pregnancy to term will have the necessary health care and then the resources needed to care for their child after birth.We’re also confident that a Biden-Harris administration will champion an aggressive program to promote adoptions by strengthening the Adoption Assistance Act and streamlining adoption procedures. Further, providing health care that makes available improved means of birth control cangreatly reduce the number of unintended pregnancies. Even for Catholics who accept church teaching forbidding artificial means of birth control, such social services can be seen as choosing the lesser evil — to abortion.Now contrast a Biden-Harris administration to four more years of a Trump-Pence one. Trump has done many things that can be deemed evil. This includes his refusal to address the 400-year pandemic of racism, his approving of Nazi-like groups and their hate-filled rhetoric, his contributing to environmental destruction, his disrespect for immigrants, his dumbfounding denial of the scientific evidence regarding COVID-19, his incessant lying, and the list goes on.It is not for us to dictate the conscience-based decisions of other Catholics. But speaking from the depths of our own souls, not only may we vote for Biden-Harris, but believe we must do so. To do otherwise would be contrary to our consciences — our sin.Thomas Groome is a senior professor of theology and religious education at Boston College. Richard Gaillardetz is the Joseph chair in Catholic systematic theology at Boston College.By Bernadette RepiskyThere was once a time when a politician looking to be the Democratic contender for president of the United States declared abortions should be “legal, safe, and rare.” That was Hillary Clinton during her first failed presidential bid in 2008. Today, the Democratic Party led by Joe Biden would reject her and those words. The former senator from Delawareused to consistently vote to at least limit abortion and the federal funding of it. No more.Biden has devolved on the issue of life. For every positive move Donald Trump has made to defend life, Biden has promised to reverse, repeal, and rescind it. He has declared he will makeRoe v. Wade“the law of the land.” And he said he willend the Mexico City policy that bans federal dollars going to programs overseas that provide abortion. In an affront to religious liberty, Biden also supports policies that would force organizations like theLittle Sisters of the Poor to cover contraception and abortion-causing drugs in their health plans.Biden’s silence as high-ranking members of his party call for looser and looser restrictions on abortion,including allowing abortion through the ninth month of pregnancy, speaks volumes.“For every positive move Trump has made to defend life, Biden has promised to reverse, repeal, and rescind it.”With that in mind, Catholic voters must examine the positions of Republican President Trump and Democratic candidate Biden on this issue.“The threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority because it directly attacks life itself, because it takes place within the sanctuary of the family, and because of the number of lives destroyed,” statedArchbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kan., United States Catholic Conference of Bishops’ chairman, on pro-life activities. “Abortion is an intrinsic evil, meaning that it is never permitted or morally justified, regardless of individual circumstances or intentions.”The Biden-Harris ticket has accepted an endorsement and money from the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.“Life is the preeminent issue,”Archbishop Nelson Pérez of Philadelphia saidthis summer. He also commented on the youth who attend the annual pro-life rally in Washington, D.C., attended for the first time by a sitting president in January.“At least 70% are young adults. They clap, they sing, they hold their banners. They’re just on fire.” I can personally attest to this.These young people embrace science and truth. With its own DNA separate from the mother, created male or female, life begins at conception. The 3D ultrasound image is a baby, a human being, not a “choice.” These youth are the future. A Biden presidency, however, would jeopardize our faith and our country. Not only is Biden “unabashedly pro-abortion,” the Democrats are pushing America toward socialism, a “soul-robbing ideology that always and inevitably leads to totalitarianism, where the government presumes to put itself in the place of God, in the lives of its subservient citizens,” saidFather Edward Meeks of Maryland. Socialists view our church as “an enemy to be destroyed, or, at the very least, to be silenced and marginalized.”The Gospel tells us the unborn John the Baptist leaped in the womb at the mere presence of Jesus in Mary’s womb. Is there any doubt that we’re to honor and respect these yet-to-be-born lives?Bernadette Repisky is a college-educated “suburban housewife” enthusiastically supporting President Donald Trump again.

philinquirer_2020_5,"Horrifying body-cam footage shows, yet again, why Wallace’s death spurred an immediate call to action.On Oct. 26, police unloadedat least 14 roundson Walter Wallace Jr. while his mother begged in anguish for them not to shoot. This was caught on camera — on cell phone video that went viral after the shooting, and on body-cam footage the Philadelphia police released over a week later, on Wednesday night. That horrifying footage shows, yet again, why Wallace’s death spurred an immediate call to action to confront a culture that continues to allow the state-sanctioned murder of Black people.All this followed the summer uprisings, precipitated by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The city joined nationwide protests, and some looting ensued. Philadelphia has long been reeling from the teargassing of assembled protesters on I-95 and along52nd Street in West Philadelphia. Walter Wallace Jr. was 27 years old and experiencing a mental health emergency.» READ MORE:Police video of Walter Wallace Jr. killing raises more questions than answers for Philly | EditorialWest Philadelphia, still with tender wounds from the summer, has been retraumatized by this killing. I’m a lifelong West Philly resident, and the shooting happened on my 37th birthday. Our community will have to begin another healing process. The city at large needs to galvanize to finally abolish the police.The expected rhetoric followed Wallace’s death, with some highlighting his criminal record, saying the cops were doing their job, and dismissing the already denied humanity of a Black person. This isn’t new — this is how a white supremacist culture reacts to violence enacted on Black bodies. Nothing about this is coincidental nor a mistake, especially not in the context of the overcriminalization of our communities in Philadelphia and nationwide. There isn’t any reform that can confront how brutal this system is at the root. Despite body cams and independent investigations, progressive district attorneys, and recurrent, as of yet unheeded demands to defund the police, the culture of policing continues to harm the most vulnerable among us.Philadelphia City Council President Darrell L. Clarke, in an effort to provide the police withnonlethal weapons, committed last week to immediately transferring up to$9.5 million for their purchase— as Black organizers continue pressing the city to take money away from the police budget. It is reductive and problematic to believe the answer to curtailing police violence is pouring more money into its organization. Walter Wallace Jr. isn’t dead because a Taser wasn’t available. Shooting someone 10-plus times is a decision to end a life. Continuing to fund police and ignoring community demands is angering communities who are stripped of resources and pushed out from neighborhoods that don’t need cops to have Tasers. They need and deserve care and concern that doesn’t criminalize them.» READ MORE:Police departments are broken. Is it time to abolish them all together? | Pro/ConThis is why I adamantly decry the continued investment into any measure that suggests “shifts” to a system that doesn’t act accountable to Black communities. Abolition — ending policing without equivocation — is the only response that makes sense. Anything short of moving to completely disarm and disband the police doesn’t align with the refrain that Black Lives Matter. Last week’s shooting is another addition to our unending proof: The police state doles out an absolute end to Black futures, often leading to the death of Black people or their lifelong criminalization. Abolition, however, would secure Black futures.In a city with deep poverty and displacement, which is happening right now amid a pandemic inflicting the most loss and economic devastation on Black and Latinx communities, the impact of police violence increases with community vulnerability. The need to press upon ourselves and each other a different way couldn’t be more evident. I will continue to push for the demands to defund and abolish the police because our lives depend on this racist system being dismantled. Otherwise, our birthdays will be constant reminders of how easily Black lives can be stolen away.Abdul-Aliy Muhammad is an organizer and writer born and raised in West Philadelphia.@MxAbdulAliy"
suffolknewsherald_2020_209,"Published 6:01 pm Friday, October 2, 2020ByStaff ReportsToday’s front page carries good news: the conservation status of the red-cockaded woodpecker has improved to the point that the federal government has proposed downlisting its status from endangered to threatened.The woodpecker, a spiffy little black-and-white species whose males sport a dash of red behind each eye, is a beautiful specimen of ornithology that, for far too long, has been difficult to spot. That’s because its numbers have been steadily falling for centuries.Efforts to reintroduce the woodpecker locally have been ongoing for five years. You can read more of the details in the story, but suffice to say that breeding in the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge has been moderately successful.Folks more consumed with their own lives — and with good reason, with so much going on these days — might be tempted to dismiss the importance of individual species. But no one can deny that the entire ecosystem of our area works as a team, and when you remove one member, the others struggle to survive.Flora species with diminishing population tend to get less recognition than the endangered fauna, but they are often integrally linked. The woodpecker’s past, present and future was and is tied to another diminishing species, the longleaf pine. Longleaf pine is the red-cockaded woodpecker’s preferred habitat, but as of four years ago, only about 200 native longleaf pines remained in the entire state of Virginia. That’s because early settlers used the tree to build ships and to produce pitch, tar and turpentine; they cleared longleaf pine stands for agricultural use; they introduced feral hogs, which eat the seedlings; and they suppressed naturally occurring fire, which is vital to the longleaf ecosystem.It’s known as the “tree that built Virginia,” and it literally was. But in building Virginia, those early settlers destroyed the longleaf pine.Longleaf pine is vital to our area and the survival of many animal species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker. Of the 290 species of amphibians and reptiles that occur in the Southeast, 170 are found in the remnants of longleaf pine forest. Additionally, nearly 900 plant species occur only in the longleaf forests.We’re pleased to see the success of the efforts to revive the populations of red-cockaded woodpecker, longleaf pine and other endangered species in our area.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_90,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Long before anyone had heard of COVID-19 or George Floyd, well before the surging pandemic and the dramatic social justice demonstrations held the globe in their grip, theWorld Health Organization had named2020 the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.No one could have anticipated just how appropriate that commemoration would prove to be. As so many internet memes, driveway chalk drawings and yard signs proclaim, not all superheroes wear capes.Across Minnesota,Nurse-Family Partnershipnurses have continued throughout the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests to support first-time, low-income moms with telehealth visits providing nursing assistance and vital emotional support.For nearly 20 years, NFP nurses in Minnesota have been quietly competent. Now, they are on the front lines, bringing their extraordinary interpersonal and professional skills to the sometimes-overwhelming challenges that have affected every Minnesotan.Their superpower is trust.NFP nurses work one-on-one with moms through pregnancy and the first two years of the child’s life. They develop relationships built on mutual respect and dedication to one goal: healthy families. These critical partnerships enable mothers and their nurses to work as a team to quickly address emotional, physical or developmental challenges that may arise.During the difficult months of sheltering in place, NFP nurses provided iPhones to moms in need through a partnership with Verizon and Action Technologies Group. They enabled them to continue regular contact with moms, providing critical support through these often trying and anxiety-filled days when home visits aren’t possible.In addition to the care they provide directly, NFP nurses connect moms with services that can help them cope in tough times. Access to public health and social services in parts of rural Minnesota is sparse and many families are not aware of how to find those that do exist.Across the United States where NFP operates, more than 317,000 families have been served. Randomized control trials have found that the program reduces child abuse and neglect cases by 48 percent and cuts emergency room visits for accidents and poisonings by 56 percent. The presence of fathers in the household is increased by 46 percent in Nurse-Family Partnership families.NFP benefits all of us by addressing homelessness, injustice, inequity and the myriad impacts of poverty, discrimination and lack of opportunity. It is supported through private donations and public funding, and every dollar spent on NFP saves a remarkable $5.70 for high-risk families.In a recentstatement, Frank Daidone, president and CEO of Nurse-Family Partnership, said the organization stands in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.“At Nurse-Family Partnership, we see the detrimental and life-threatening impacts that structural racism has on the women in our program. When Black women arethree times more likely to diein our country from pregnancy-related causes than white women, there is a real and urgent problem. This is a matter of public health. It is also a matter of equity and justice.”I am proud to supportNurse-Family Partnership in Minnesota,and it has never been more important to support the work of an organization that is proven to end the cycle of poverty in vulnerable families and build strong communities. In celebrating the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife, what better way to honor the heroes in our midst than to support an organization that gives Minnesota families what they need not just to survive, but to thrive.Jim Welsch is co-chair of the Minnesota Nurse-Family Partnership Community Advisory Board, and lives in Minneapolis."
minnpost_2020_69,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When Barack Obama was still our president, I was one of those people who was so mesmerized by his magical speeches that I dismissed racism as a thing of the past. I thought that my job as a citizen was done simply by voting for the first Black president – twice. I did not pay attention to the foreign bombings he authorized or why he was nicknamed “Deporter in Chief.” The birtherism and racist attacks on Obama by Donald Trump and Republicans provided a convenient distraction for liberals from all things Obama did wrong. I was also oblivious to how the police were militarized under progressive leadership in many cities.Imagine this awful scenario for a moment: Your spouse and child have been kidnapped. The kidnappers present you with two options. Option A is that you get to pick between your spouse and your child. Only one of them gets to live. Option B is you say no and let them both die. This is the situation in which many people who identify as being somewhere on the liberal spectrum finding themselves today – where Option A is Biden and Option B is Trump.Most people would feel forced to choose option A. I get it. They would look at the choices before them and do what they think is least harmful in the moment. But what if there was a third, less obvious option – an Option C What if we could zoom out of this situation and say, “Who are these kidnappers Why have they kidnapped my family and what will stop them from doing this again” Option C is rejecting the false choices before us, mobilizing our community and rescuing our family. Once we are done with that, we abolish the kidnappers and eliminate the circumstances that allow kidnapping to occur in the first place.Even if we picked option A, Biden, health care is a human right only if our insurance plan approves it. We can still get evicted in a pandemic. We are still racially profiled, and because we are expendable; we are forced to come to work in unsafe conditions during a pandemic. So, option A guarantees our right to live but only if we can afford to.In this real-world false-choice scenario, the kidnappers are white supremacy and the capitalist systems that support it. Biden’s being the presumptive Democratic nominee is the biggest giveaway that the Democratic Party is just as invested in upholding white supremacy as the Republican Party, just not in a Klannish way. It is a thinly veiled attempt to court white conservative Americans (“the real Americans” by giving them a candidate who is Republican enough but is also not Trump. As for the rest of us, the Democratic Party will tell us that they support Black lives and other nice things. They will tell us that we will get our basic human rights – eventually. What they will not tell you explicitly is that they must first allay white anxiety before they will support Black lives.National uprisings in response to police killings and corporations making record profits in a pandemic as workers get sick all point to the fact that people no longer trust electoral politics and have no reason to. As both Trump and Biden refuse to rise to this moment, these uprisings are our option C. People all over the country are embracing option C because they do not trust our institutions and leaders to look out for us. We are doing so through mutual aid, civil disobedience, protesting and by being street medics. Option C means refusing to choose our oppressor (a white supremacist president or a white supremacy-friendly neoliberal president and instead choosing to not be oppressed. Option C means not falling for vote-shaming tactics. It means telling the Democratic Party that it does not have power over us, that — election after election — it cannot continue to hold us hostage and that members of the party knew what the odds were when they chose Biden as our savior.Option C does not necessarily preclude one from voting for Biden. Regardless of whom people vote for or don’t vote for, option C calls out the game for being rigged, and unapologetically states that we will no longer follow rules that prescribe our oppression.Adnan Ahmed, MBBS, is a community psychiatrist in Minneapolis."
suffolknewsherald_2020_136,"Published 10:25 pm Tuesday, May 5, 2020ByStaff ReportsThe American Nurses Association commemorates National Nurses Week every May 6-12. The annual recognition ends every year on the birthday of Florence Nightingale, considered by many to be the founder of modern nursing after her heroics during the Crimean War.Though this observance was first marked in 1954, the 100th anniversary of Nightingale’s mission to Crimea, it seems all the more necessary and poignant this year.Nurses are one of the cornerstones of our society on a regular basis. Every day and every night and every holiday, in hospitals and doctors’ offices and nursing homes and hospice facilities and emergency rooms and private homes all across this country, nurses are bringing healing to the sick and wounded and comfort to the dying. They are correcting doctors’ mistakes and advocating for patients and their families. They are giving medication, cleaning wounds, suctioning ventilator tubes and doing all manner of tasks that many of us don’t want to even think about, let alone do ourselves. And they do all of this missing meals, skipping their bathroom breaks, pulling double shifts and contending with the implications of a health care bureaucracy that too often values profits over patients.That’s all just “on a regular basis.” Then we have the last few months, which have been anything but ordinary.Nurses on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic are working more shifts than ever, covering themselves in more gear and living with the horrible knowledge that they are likely to catch the virus or bring it home to one of their family members. In Virginia alone, 1,504 health care workers have tested positive for the virus. That’s nearly 7.5 percent of the state’s case total and doesn’t include their family members who may have become infected.During this special National Nurses Week, we give a salute to all of the nurses who are tirelessly putting in the work, now and all the time, to ensure that those who are ill or injured can get the care they need. You all have our undying respect and admiration.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss. The outings include the Los Angeles Dodgers squaring off…Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

suffolknewsherald_2020_62,"Published 9:23 pm Tuesday, June 30, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceWe were studying American history in preparation for his upcoming quiz, but I got stuck when he asked if I could name all of the original 13 colonies. I went through the ones I could remember, and we then worked together to learn them all.One question that I did know was the date the Continental Congress declared independence from Britain. “You know this one, too,” I said. Nearly every elementary-aged schoolchild knows the date of July 4, 1776. It’s a date that is etched in our nation’s history, and it is bound to be an answer on a test question somewhere along the way.As we approach the 244th anniversary of July 4, 1776, let’s pause to look at how and what we teach our children about American history.It’s OK to tell of the heroic acts of the people who risked everything to start a nation they hoped would lead to freedom and a better governing system for them and their descendants. America has had some incredible successes, and there’s nothing wrong with allowing children to have some pride in their country. There is a lot they can celebrate!Children should be allowed to marvel at the bravery of those who stormed the beaches at Normandy and honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve freedom for generations to come. Those learning the history of this nation should know about the great things it has done, as well as the dream of a better life that it still holds for so many.It’s also OK to tell the stories of when America failed to live up to that great dream. They should understand why the Trail of Tears received its historic name. We should tell children about the horrors of slavery and lament the fact that so many people in this country once thought it was OK to own another person. The United States of America has done some wicked things, and we’d be foolish to hide those things from our children.We should include the good, the bad and the ugly when we teach our children about the history of our nation. It would be easy to handpick the stories that make the United States look nearly perfect, but we do a disservice to our children if we ignore the ugly facts in our nation’s history. Likewise, choosing only the stories that paint our country in a negative light isn’t wise or fair to them.Children can understand that our nation’s history isn’t entirely good or totally evil. They should be allowed to know the full story in a way that is understandable and appropriate for their age and maturity level.Sharing the complete story also allows us to discuss the events more fully. We can laud those who helped make this country a great nation, celebrate its successes, lament its failures, and discuss why and how certain evils were allowed to take place. There are lessons they can learn from our nation’s successes and failures. Perhaps as we share, we, too, can learn and grow.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_49,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°When President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20, he will have a unique opportunity to rebuild our battered economy and create the long-lasting change that eluded his predecessors: closing the wealth gap that has left Black and brown Americans, and women of all races, behind.When President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20, he will have a unique opportunity to rebuild our battered economy and create the long-lasting change that eluded his predecessors: closing the wealth gap that has left Black and brown Americans, and women of all races, behind.While what the Biden-Harris administration can accomplish legislatively will largely be decided by the Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5, the new administration should begin thinking about how the economy can be brought back after the pandemic in ways that help right historical wrongs.Biden has already made one excellent decision by nominating former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as treasury secretary. Yellen, throughout her career, has been committed to making the economy work for all Americans. In 2014, she said in a speech that “inequality has risen to the point that it seems to me worthwhile for the U.S. to seriously consider taking the risk of making our economy more rewarding for more of the people.” More recently, she specifically called for closing the U.S. wealth gap.Following Biden’s mandate to “Build Back Better,” Yellen should target the wealth gaps for people of color and women. She and her senior staff can start by improving the next iteration of the Paycheck Protection Program. Only about 12% of Black and Latinx businesses who applied say they received the relief they requested.It has also been encouraging to see President-elect Biden propose sweeping yet pragmatic measures to stabilize and grow our economy, with a particular focus on communities of color.Biden has already committed to extending unemployment insurance as well as a new package of support for small businesses.This is important for communities of color, particularly women of color, since unemployment rates and business failures are significantly higher for those already marginalized in our current economy.The Biden-Harris administration can also help close the racial wealth gap by using the tools the vast majority of white Americans have used to build wealth: home ownership and small business.Today, for every dollar of wealth held by a white family, Latinx families have only about four cents and Black families just two cents.President-elect Biden has released plans to increase down-payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, incentivize production of 1.5 million new affordable housing units and leverage more than $150 billion for small businesses. Biden has also committed to strengthening the Federal Reserve’s focus on racial inequality.For too long, monetary policy either neglected the needs of communities of color or, as during the run-up to the 2008 mortgage meltdown, actually harmed Black and brown communities.The Federal Reserve can ensure that the Community Reinvestment Act explicitly addresses racial inequality.It is also time for the Fed’s dual mandate to evolve. Today, the Fed is tasked to promote full employment as well as contain inflation. This should be updated to include eliminating the racial and gender wealth gaps.Our president-elect seems to genuinely see racism and racial inequality as the moral and economic threat it is. As we rebuild our economy and national sense of trust, he must continue to face that threat head-on."
minnpost_2020_159,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the nation still awaits the final vote tally, and social media, talking heads and newspaper columnists scramble to read the tea leaves and what the election means, one thing is certain: Minnesotans want leaders to fight for the environment.In recent years, major environmental controversies — notably the dangers from two proposed copper-sulfide mines, PolyMet and Twin Metals — have galvanized Minnesotans. Nearly 70% of the 54 candidates Friends of the Boundary Waters Action Network endorsed because of their unwavering support for the Boundary Waters and clean water won.This is a winning issue.The environmental movement has always been strong in Minnesota, but electorally, the bellwether really came in the August DFL primaries, when Jen McEwen, who was unabashedly pro-clean water and opposed both the PolyMet and Twin Metals projects — beat out a staunch supporter of the copper-sulfide mining industry, Erik Simonson.While Republicans have largely avoided grappling with environmental issues, the DFL has faced internal divisions between those who support and those who oppose copper-sulfide mining. This has led many statewide politicians to waffle on the issue. Indeed, it’s an issue many would rather avoid.That has changed.Following McEwen’s primary win, the DFL Central Committee adopted a resolution, calling for a moratorium on sulfide mining. This stance reflected the will of the majority of Minnesotans. Polling by Minnesota Public Radio and the Star Tribune show that 60% of all Minnesotans, and 57% of northern Minnesotans, and 80% of DFLers oppose copper-sulfide mining near the BWCA.There were those within the DFL who believed adopting such a strong stance was a political liability. Those fears ought to be put to rest. This election confirms that protecting the Boundary Waters from copper-sulfide mining is a winning issue.It wasn’t just McEwen’s victory.In the run-up to November, Friends of the Boundary Waters Action Network screened and interviewed numerous candidates for state office, ultimately endorsing 54 candidates who were unabashedly pro-clean water, pro-Boundary Waters and willing to take a strong stance on the issue. Of those 54 endorsements, 37 won their races.What’s more, of the 10 candidates we signaled out as key and tight races, eight won.Voters have shown they are deeply concerned about the future of the Boundary Waters and about protecting our clean water from the threat of copper-sulfide mining.They have rejected the political bombast and limited economic vision tied to opening these toxic mines. They have rejected the tired falsehoods and hollow promises of foreign mining conglomerates with track records of environmental degradation and labor abuse.For over a decade, there has been no significant environmental initiative passed in Minnesota since voters passed the Clean Water, Land & Legacy Amendment in 2008. At a time when clean, fresh water is becoming a global scarcity, and after four years of the Trump administration waging an all-out assault on public lands and wild spaces, Minnesotans are hungry for action.They are ready for those they elected to pass legislation that protects our natural heritage, embraces that jewel of wilderness, the Boundary Waters, and provides legal protection against the dangers of copper-sulfide mining.Chris Knopf is the executive directorof Friends of the Boundary Waters Action Network, the political wing of the nonprofit Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness."
minnpost_2020_86,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There is much controversy as to whether someone can “discover” a country already inhabited by indigenous peoples. Likewise, not only did Columbus not set foot in America, but also a great deal of explorers reached here first. Columbus brought with him disease, starvation, and conquest. While his valiance and perseverance are to be applauded, out of respect for our sailors who are descendent of Native Americans, it would probably not be in good taste to celebrate Christopher Columbus as a ship. Further, it would be in poor taste in light of the tragedies that surrounded Columbus’ expeditions, i.e. the slave trades and the genocides, to go ahead with this ceremony. That said, we would be happy to provide more context and research upon request, and would still recommend the “vacation day” for good measure.Our presentation led to much debate among my shipmates and colleagues — and it was a poignant moment for me about positive conflict and dialogue. We each committed thereafter to learn about loaded symbols and implicit bias.Sixteen years later, protesters here in Minnesota toppled our state Capitol’s statue of Christopher Columbus.Protests in George Floyd’s name, propelled by a desire for societal change, invoked an end to all forms of injustice. Among the protesters were Dakota and Ojibwe Indians who have been crying out for years that Columbus is the ultimate representation of genocide against Native Americans.And yet, there is another layer that should not be ignored. Ironically, our country once used Columbus to quiet civil unrest, bridge peoples, and pursue social justice. In 1892, 11 Italian-Americans were murdered in a public lynching — a time when Italian immigrants to the United States were not considered “white.” The bloodshed led to saber-rattling between the United States and Italy, not to mention riotous demonstrations among Italian Americans. President Benjamin Harrison brought about a détente by declaring Columbus Day a national holiday, giving pride to Italian-Americans and leading to school curricula of patriotism, loyalty, and citizenship.Indeed, it is not. Still, it is too easy to resign our efforts, believing that every action will disturb at least one group or person. Instead, with our best intentions, we should each dedicate time regularly to learning about the history of bias in our country, challenging prejudices, working toward developing and deepening a culture of inclusivity and diversity, and eradicating intolerance. We should live a life in the perpetual pursuit of justice. This means agonizing soulful reflection – examining the missteps of our places of business, our houses of worship, our institutions of education, our societal totems.Our discoveries will compel us subsequently to tear down and rebuild structures without the guilt of former injustices. On our path to righting our nation’s wrongs, we need to be careful to explore every nuance — and when we open up the deep wounds of history, we need to navigate the path of healing together.Rabbi Avi S. Olitzky is a senior rabbi of Beth El Synagogue in St. Louis Park."
philinquirer_2020_51,"Everyone now wants to say Black journalists matter. But what does it look like to show that you mean it?Earlier this month, I became theonly Black female writerat a publication I work for. My former editor and another Black female writer recently left because they were unhappy. That brought the total number of Black people in the newsroom from eight to six. This, while people were taking to the streets nationwide to protest for equality for Black lives. The timing couldn’t have been worse — but it was no coincidence.You don’t get down to one Black female writer, nor lack diversity, by accident. It happens from conscious decisions by white executives and editors who exercise the privilege of only hiring and promoting people who look like them. I’ve seen the scenario play out many times.I once interned for a TV station where, despite my solid performance, I was told there was no budget to hire me. I begged to stay as a contractor, figuring I just needed to prove myself to earn a permanent place. I continued earning slightly more than minimum wage for strong work, taking shifts no one else wanted. A month later, my white male editor hired a young white woman in the role he’d claimed he had no budget for. The editor said she reminded him of himself when he was a young reporter, and wanted to groom her. To add insult to injury, while I continued as an underpaid contractor, I had to listen to her complain about my dream job. I was so scarred by the experience I took a corporate job and stopped writing altogether.Only by chance did I find myself back in a newsroom six years later. So many other Black journalists never do. They give up dreams of writing stories that matter because conditions in many newsrooms are too oppressive to overcome. I mourn for Black reporters and editors who’vehad it much worsethan I did.Leaving is no saving grace. Those of us who leave get to look out at a media landscape of publications equally fraught with racism. Where shall we go? To a place wherebuildings matter, too? WhereTom Cotton’s perspective is thought valuable enough to endanger Black lives?Then when we stay, Black reporters often carry survivor’s guilt. We reason that the conditions don’t need to be perfect; at least we have a paycheck, a platform. But that’s no longer enough.Too often, publications that do hire Black journalists only hire a few, who get propped up to signal representation when, in reality, we account for a tiny fraction of the organization. Being among those chosen few is a privilege and a prison. I feel at once honored to have a platform, and guilty I was chosen while so many others were not. I feel annoyed when issues about my community arise and I am not asked to help cover them, yet tokenized if I am singled out for that coverage. This is only true because there aren’t enough Black journalists in the room. If there were, I wouldn’t have to fret over every assignment.“Everybody supports a cause until it’s their turn to step up.”For media outlets with some diverse representation, it probably hurts to know their version of doing good is still not good enough. It probably feels daunting to imagine letting go of some white staff to build more diverse newsrooms. But when you’re privileged, equality feels like oppression.Many white leaders in media have been quick to issue statements of solidarity with the Black journalists speaking out. Everyone now wants to say Black journalists matter. But what does it look like to show that you mean it? Everybody supports a cause until it’s their turn to step up.I ask newsroom leaders: What are you willing to personally sacrifice to diversify? Are you willing to give up your spot to let a Black editor or reporter in? Would you sacrifice a portion of your salary to fund a Black reporter’s job?I, for one, would love to see some well-meaning white executives and editors put their words to action. Systemic racism in America’s newsrooms is not a problem Black people created. It’s not a problem we should have to fix.QueenMuse is a freelance writer with an MA in strategic communication from La Salle University, where she is a visiting assistant professor of communication.thequeenmuse.com"
minnpost_2020_227,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .President Trump didn’t create the coronavirus. But he did create the confusion and the chaos that has been the hallmark of the White House response or lack of response to it. He has never taken it seriously and has done nearly everything he could to abdicate leadership in responding to this deadly virus.The president told the American people the “coronavirus is a hoax.” He said, “it will disappear in warm weather.” “It’s like the flu,” he said. “It’s not going to have much impact in our country,” he said. Those comments alone are uninformed and dangerous. Add to that his thoughtless nonsense that maybe injecting bleach could cure the virus. Unfortunately, this is a leaderless White House at a time when leadership is most needed.The COVID-19 pandemic has now cost over 190,000 American lives, and the president still chooses to be merely a spectator, a critic and an accuser.Real leadership would have immediately initiated an aggressive and successful national testing program when this virus began to work its way through our country. And it would have created a national program for the production of protective equipment including gowns, masks, gloves and other equipment enlisting American companies and their workers to produce it.Instead the president denies those responsibilities and blames others.He and his confused assistant, Peter Navarro, have spent their time trying to blame U.S. corporations including GM, Ford and 3M with a blizzard of inaccuracies about the production of personal protection equipment (PPE and other products. The 3M criticism is especially bizarre.This century-old company, located in Minnesota, invented the N95 masks in 1992 and this year will produce 2 billion masks. They will do that with new production lines, vast amounts of overtime for their workers, and a company commitment to respond to this pandemic. 3M and other American companies and their employees are demonstrating an impressive effort to produce more life-saving products during the pandemic.When the president and Navarro stop unfairly complaining about American companies, they turn to blaming governors, mayors and even hospitals.As is usually the case, this president can’t seem to tell the truth about the hole he himself continues to dig.Not having a national program for PPE and testing equipment has resulted in an unbridled marketplace for masks, gloves, gowns and other items resembling a “hogs at the trough” visual. Middlemen sprung up overnight to rake in billions in profits. Often, they were a mailbox rental as opposed to a company that produced anything.Some hospitals reported paying $7 for masks that previously cost 50 cents and paying $25 for shields that previously sold for $1.25. The president should have created a national market and invented national production opportunities for the items that were needed by the medical and first-responder heroes.Trump and Navarro have also blamed former President Obama for depleting the national stockpile of equipment. But Trump has been in office for three years and it was his administration’s responsibility to replenish the stockpile.There is no joy in pointing out where the president has failed. But real leadership is critical during a crisis like this.The spirit of cooperation during World War II turned our economy into a powerful machine with workers and companies working around the clock to produce all of guns, planes, ships, trucks, tanks and more to put the best equipment in our soldiers’ hands to defeat the Nazis. Lingerie factories were converted to make camouflage netting. Factories making beer cans were converted to make hand grenades. A company making lipstick cases was converted to making bomb casings. Strong national leadership mobilized the country to produce what was needed to win a war.Roosevelt didn’t “nationalize” businesses. Nationalizing businesses is not the right thing to do. Instead, FDR enlisted businesses with new public and private investment and an ability to profit from the production to produce the equipment that American soldiers needed.Russia’s Stalin observed after the war, “it was U.S. production that won the war.”This crisis can call on the same spirit of patriotism and American commitment to U.S. invention and production of vaccines, PPEs, testing and all that we need to win this war against the virus.But that will still require real leadership that I’ve not seen from the White House.Byron Dorgan served 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and 18 years in the U.S. Senate, representing North Dakota.

The choice is ours to make.Opportunities abound this holiday season — help someone that is less fortunate by donating to one of the many food drives, coat drives, churches or organizations that help those in need.When considering gifts, take the very real opportunity to help your community by shopping local. Small businesses, the backbone of our community, have been hit especially hard this year. We have the opportunity to help a small business and our community at the same time by shopping here at home.When we spend money at the local bakery or dress shop a lot of that money is used to purchase from other local businesses and so on and so on. Shopping local creates a domino effect that helps to support our community.

In this case, we’re thinking of the generosity of the Obici Healthcare Foundation, which recently announced it’s providing more than $1.2 million to fund some needs in our community.Normally, the Obici group’s largesse is directed toward efforts that frequently promote health of individuals or communities. Clinics, shelters and classes come immediately to mind. Disaster relief is not a usual motive. But as the foundation’s president Annette Beuchler has explained, “… We all recognize we are living in non-traditional circumstances and need to adapt to meet the community needs during this public health pandemic.”Those “non-traditional circumstances” to which she refers are of course, directly connected to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little, if anything, that has not been affected by the novel coronavirus’ presence in the world.Some examples of recipients and their intended use of money include:We’re encouraged that the board will consider a second set of COVID-19 fundings next month.Further, we commend the foundation for generously responding in this case, and feel confident that the recipients will make the best use of money possible.To learn more about the COVID-19 Response Funds available in October, visit www.obicihcf.org and click on the COVID-19 Response Fund in the website banner.

eugeneweekly_2020_14,"We ve got issues. Our vulnerable citizens residing in long-term care and skilled nursing facilities, often physically and/or mentally disabled, are in dire need of our support and help. In this time of isolation and loneliness, they are suffering. State and local officials and state ombudsman volunteers have limited access to residents and can no longer monitor what is going on behind closed doors. People are dying. Oregon state statistics show that 43 percent of deaths from COVID-19 occur in long-term facilities. However, statistics cannot show how many have died from neglect due to isolation and poorly trained staff, commonly paired with understaffing. Residents often do not get basic care, like bathing or oral hygiene. It has been reported that some residents have not been bathed since restrictions began, more than three months ago. Some, who cannot move by themselves, are left in bed to develop bedsores and other skin problems. Those who try to get out of bed without help often fall because the staffing is inadequate, and they can no longer wait to get their needs met. Imagine falling, possibly causing great bodily harm or death, because you need the bathroom, and no one answers your call. Imagine lying in pain on the floor until someone comes. It is happening all over the state and nation. Community members are left to shelter in their room, and in doing so, cannot get the exercise or companionship that they typically have and still need. The longer these basic needs are unmet, memory issues increase and health declines, especially with the most marginalized and disempowered residents. Without social interaction, many will slowly decline in health and some will prematurely die. It is our responsibility as concerned citizens to ensure that the Oregon Legislature places more control over the number and quality of care-staff, so there is at least adequate, preferably good, quality care. When underpaid, under-trained and overworked staff fail to support these residents, our entire society loses. Our society is only as good as the care we give to the most vulnerable among us. We are showing that we care about our vulnerable citizens by the responses we are making toward societal injustices. This is one more injustice to change. Proper COVID-19 testing and proper preventative measures need to be enforced to make sure everybody is safe. We need to contact our legislators to ensure they know we are watching how they respond to the crisis facing our vulnerable citizens. Most long-term care facilities are run by large multi-state companies who are very often more concerned about profit than the welfare of residents and staff. Community advocates need to ensure that all types of facilities are held fully accountable for their actions and/or inactions during this COVID-19 emergency health situation — with no exceptions. All workers and residents need full support from both federal and state with testing and PPE supplies. All endangered residents deserve protection. All endangered residents deserve your caring and actions on their behalf. Please advocate for them with your state and federal officials. Write or call your state representatives and senators. Demand actions that protect some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Lee Bliven writes on behalf of CareWorks of Lane County and as a concerned husband and family caregiver.

minnpost_2020_175,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .It’s days before the 2020 presidential election, but we don’t talk about it. It is too divisive. We don’t agree and no one’s minds will change. Yet four generations gather around the table nearly every Sunday “after church.”My parents are evangelical farmers, and they faithfully vote to preserve their conservative way of life. “I vote for the person, not the party,” my mom said years ago in a rare comment on politics. Whatever person is anti-abortion, that is. I wonder if she is still voting for the “person” this election cycle, but I don’t dare ask.Agriculture is all my dad has ever known, and he still believes that President Trump and the Republican Party have the best economic interests at heart for the small family farmer. That or he just can’t muster the courage to vote for a Democrat.I know what it’s like to vote in the interests of your own livelihood. I am an immigration attorney, and my career as I know it will only exist if the legal immigration system remains intact. The Trump administration has chiseled away at the pathway for immigrants to live in this country legally, and I dread what my law practice will look like if we have another four years of restricted immigration policy.Maybe this is how my dad felt about tightened environmental regulations, higher estate taxes, and more expensive health care for the self-employed — all making a hard job harder during the Obama years.But love is love, at least according to my lesbian aunts. They’re the only “out” lesbians I know in our small town. The boisterous, tattooed woman my mom’s sister married always sits at the table next to my 85-year-old grandma, my dad’s mom. Why, I don’t know. They couldn’t be more opposite and I’m not sure which one needed more courage to open her mind and tolerate the other. But they like my cooking, so neither turns down the invitation.A few years ago my maternal grandpa caught whiff of my progressive leanings, and he whispered to me that he was a “secret Democrat.”Sshhhh. Welcome to the club, grandpa. I’m not sure how that is possible for a Fox News addict like he is, but I’m guessing it is a nod of respect to his middle-aged daughter who only a few years ago got to legally marry the love of her life.As much as I would love a rational, informative, convincing lecture on politics to change the hearts and minds of some of my closest family members, telling them that they are wrong will do no good. Being confrontational about politics will only sow seeds of hate amongst my family members. Part of me feels that I am a coward for not speaking up. Another part feels restrained and inauthentic for not rebuking some of my loved ones for being, what I believe is, on the wrong side of history.I’ve decided to let my actions demonstrate my values and my family undoubtedly notices. I work day in and day out to give a voice to our nation’s most marginalized populations. Owning my own business, I show young women that they too can be leaders and entrepreneurs. I am raising my daughter to believe that she can be anyone and do anything.Is this enough Never. I refuse to turn a blind eye to the injustices of our world, and I recognize that unity blossoms only through mutual respect and love for one another. But during this season of polarization, it is my intent to treat those with a different political opinion in the same way as I treat my ultra-conservative grandma. Or my mom. Or my dad. I choose love over hate. Unity over division.Only then do we all choose to come together around the table.Erin Schutte Wadzinski is an attorney and owner ofKivu Immigration Law PLLCin her hometown of Worthington.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_65,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The Extreme CourtThe Extreme CourtThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled that religious institutions don’t need to follow COVID rules. Mask mandates? Not in church. Limits on indoor gatherings? Not for church services. Do they think divine intervention will stop the coronavirus from spreading in church? Or are they just such fanatics when it comes to religious rights that they are willing to ignore the dangers?I have to hand it to religious conservatives. Through decades of hard work and determination, they have managed to pack the Supreme Court so successfully that these kinds of rulings look like they will be the norm for the next couple of decades. Overturning Roe vs. Wade looks all but certain. And all they had to sacrifice was their souls.Four years of supporting an uncaring and prideful president — the exact opposite of Jesus. Four years of making excuses for a man who breaks most of the Ten Commandments on a regular basis. Four years of supporting tax cuts for the rich and doing nothing for the poor, of separating refugee children from their parents, of making up lies almost every day to glorify himself.As Jesus is quoted by Mark in the Bible: “What profiteth a man to gain the whole world and lose his Soul?” Now that they have their Extreme Court, will the religious right turn away from their addiction to political power and look again to Jesus’ teachings? Will they begin to understand that selling their souls to the Republican Party may have helped them win the battle over abortion but at far too high a cost?Many young people today see Christianity as a negative force in society, and they see most Christians as unthinking, unprincipled political pawns. Unsurprisingly, according to the Pew Survey on religion and public life, the young are staying away from church in droves.Sadly, this religious Extreme Court will be making the law of the land for decades to come. If you think denying services to a consumer who has a different religion than you is going to help our country — this is the court for you. If you think you shouldn’t ever have to hire someone of another faith — this is the court for you. If you think accidentally pregnant teenaged girls should be forced to have babies — this court is for you. If you want to go back to the 1950s and open all these wounds and fight these same battles all over again — then this court is for you. But I think it is an Extreme Shame.Matt BinderWaimea‘We had a choice’So, we have a clear headline on Sunday (Tribune-Herald, Nov. 29 regarding criticism of the mayor-elect’s cabinet picks.Uh, hello citizens, did you happen to really believe that voting in Mitch Roth would result in any thing different?I respect and thank him for his service to the county, but the writing was clearly on the wall, and I only read the Sunday Trib!

minnpost_2020_45,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In late July, Tesla’s Elon Muskmade a global plea for responsibly mined nickel, citing the growing need for nickel to keep up with the worldwide rise in demand for electric cars, trucks, and other vehicles. One of our northern neighbors, Canada Nickel,responded immediately, saying it was prepared to meet Musk’s challenge.As a company totally dependent on the mining of a number of precious metals, including nickel, cobalt and lithium, Tesla knows that nearly all of these metals are being produced in violation of international environmental and labor standards, including the horrific exploitation of young children. Musk’s call for “responsible mining” reflects his understanding of the need to find a new approach, and we laud him for this willingness to turn his company’s supply chain in a more ethical and legal direction. Perhaps part of this is motivated by the fact that Tesla and other American tech giants arebeing sued for human rights violationson behalf of surviving families of cobalt miners.Minnesota,one of the top five mining states in our nation, has the opportunity to step up to the challenge made by Musk and assume a global leadership role. We have done this in agriculture, health care, drinking water protection and other economic sectors and we have been financially successful as a region for choosing the ethical and responsible path. As a state we have been on the leading edge in efforts to address the climate crisis, and we know that our key solutions – solar energy, electrification of transportation, wind and other clean energy options — rely on minerals and precious metals. Earth needs a responsible mining leader. Minnesota should provide that leadership.Minnesota’s responsible mining leadership should be built on the same principles that have made us successful in other fields, including transparency, adherence to global labor and environmental standards, and consistently fair enforcement. We should work with mining companies around the world to expand the availability of responsibly mined raw materials and adopt policies that ensure that cars built in the United States for U.S. buyers are no longer contributing to the exploitation of children or ecological destruction. Mining is a global industry, so our standards need to be linked to policies that consumers can rely on.The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, (IRMA , is already actively certifying mining company compliance with these principles. It has strong support from North America’s principal mining union, the United Steelworkers, as well as the world’s largest steel producer and iron ore mining company, ArcelorMittal. Both the Steelworkers Union and ArcelorMittal are major stakeholders in Minnesota’s mining sector and in our Iron Range communities. ArcelorMittal, for example, operates both the Hibbing Taconite and Minorca mines in northern Minnesota.Other company participantsin IRMA include BMW Group, Tiffany’s and global mining giant, Anglo-American.To respond to the growing need for responsible mining to achieve our clean energy future, our state should establish a Minnesota Global Center for Responsible Mining. This Center could function as a publicly supported nonprofit – perhaps affiliated with one or more colleges or universities — to provide a holistic approach to meet the technological, social, and economic challenges to mine responsibly.Our state has a long tradition of stepping up to meet our own challenges in ways that better the world. Gov. Rudy Perpich, for instance, established the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT after Minnesota opened its doors to refugees from many war-ravaged countries. Today, CVT has become animportant and expert voice in both our state and the global communityin post-conflict training and resolution.Some of the earliest torture survivors who came to CVT were from Ethiopia; they founded a community that now exceeds 50,000 and is an economic driver of many parts of our economy. Ethiopia recently adopted a new Responsible Mining Law and its government is looking for mining partners from Minnesota and other places to help implement new environmentally and socially responsible standards. We are a logical partner, and this is an opportunity that we should pursue.We can be the place the world looks to when it comes to responsible mining, much as we are the world’s reference point for health care and medical technology. We can become the global champion for creating technological solutions, teaching social contract processes, and developing monitoring protocols, labor and safety standards, and enforcement mechanisms. When complex problems confront Minnesotans, we don’t look the other way or hope for the best. Together, we find solutions.David Fosteris a distinguished associate with theEnergy Futures Initiative, and retired USW District #11 director.

The federal government has now concluded both companies are monopolies and is suing to pull them apart.The Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust suit against Facebook filed last week, along with a similar suit filed by 48 states, represents the serious possibility that Facebook will be broken up and that its “buy or bury” approach to competition will no longer be permitted.When the government filed an antitrust suit against Google, we warned that it will be a high bar to prove the case. That is true here, too, although the government’s allegations that Facebook stifled potential competitors’ access to its platform raises troubling questions that Facebook will have to answer.Whatever the outcome, it will take years of hard-fought litigation to decide.In the meantime, Congress cannot let the antitrust suits turn its attention from more urgent reforms that are needed for social media.It’s been interesting to watch others come around at last to the desperate need for reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This clause — often called the 26 words that created the internet — is really at the heart of why we have an anti-competitive internet environment.Companies like Facebook and Twitter dominate social media because Section 230 almost totally insulates them from liability for third-party posts. Why are fake news and grossly libelous hate speech rampant on these platforms? Because the companies have little to worry about from a legal perspective. Only the court of public opinion can hold them responsible.It’s heartening that every side of the political aisle is now howling for reform. But such reform must be thoughtful and drafted to ensure that platforms are not permitted to remain a free-for-all of libel and illegal content. Nor can they be permitted to selectively edit content while enjoying freedom from the liability standards that publishers like this newspaper are held to every day.This is not a partisan issue. President Donald Trump has called for the repeal of Section 230 — albeit in an unproductive way — by threatening to hold up the Defense Authorization bill. President-elect Joe Biden has also called for 230 to be revoked.So it now appears to be a matter of when, not if, Section 230 is revised.Such reform must offer a path forward for a fairer internet where people can still interact in the best ways social media offers but without empowering massive social media firms that distort the public conversation without consequence.A corollary to this reform will be stricter data privacy regulations that prevent internet companies from harvesting data, building user profiles and selling deeply personal material about its own consumers on the open market. That should have been unacceptable from the get go.Antitrust law is complex and hard to prove. Consumer harm — at least in the traditional sense of harm to our pocketbook — is hard to see in these cases.Reforming the internet can’t wait for these cases to be concluded. Congress must act as soon as possible.— The Dallas Morning NewsThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

Health care policies are lapsing. Kids are hurting.Yet, Democrats and Republican leaders in Congress appear unable to come to a compromise stimulus/relief bill for reasons that are hard to imagine in light of overwhelming support from Wall Street, Main Street and even President Donald Trump.Now, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate has taken the initiative by proposinga $908 billion COVID aid billas a transition package until President-elect Joe Biden takes office. The bill would extend expiring programs past the Dec. 31 deadline for the initial CARES Act money.That’s a wise and necessary move given the nationwide spike in COVID cases and re-shuttering of some businesses.The plan would extend unemployment payments by an additional $300 a week through March and fund the Payroll Protection Program with $288 billion. It would also provide state and local governments with $160 billion. Another $16 billion would go toward vaccine distribution, $82 billion to education and $45 billion to transportation, childcare, rental assistance and broadband.Although Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have not signaled their approval, the bipartisan group of lawmakers deserve their support for the plan.It’s important to pass this in the next two weeks. The needs are urgent.And while it’s not as big as Pelosi’s earlier proposal for a $2 trillion plan, it also doesn’t give Republicans the blanket protection of business from COVID –related lawsuits. It does give them temporary protection. And that’s reasonable.Now that the election is over, McConnell and Pelosi have no reason to return to the respective corners of political posturing.The bipartisan bill is a solid start.

Try conjuring the faces of thousands of virus victims. I can’t. I’m also unscientific enough to conclude the virus is Nature’s way of asking us all to try Business as Unusual.

Learning is “distanced.” No one says “less humanized.”I see silent liberal arts heads rolling off the chopping block, wide-eyed with backward gazes at college campuses that once upon a time were actual places where young people performed rites of passage with a few new good ideas turning in their minds. I recall smallish classrooms full of the energy of those ideas. I have dimming memories of honest, hard-earned research, grounded in humane debate, contributing to a cumulative body of knowledge. Campus life — especially the liberal arts and humanities that have been its heart, soul and mind — is an endangered species now, slyly being eased out, privatized. I see science, civics, civility, critical thinking and knowledge losing institutional presence and authority, devolving into distracting ads and info-bits that disappear into a black hole internet dominated by business and entertainment profiteers, political operatives, and whackos. I see us rushing wildly into that black hole, unhappily.Meanwhile, I feel very lucky. I’m a material beneficiary of all the terrible wars politicians and business leaders failed to prevent.

minnpost_2020_134,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .How many people know that in 1917, as part of the St. Paul Winter Carnival, hundreds of men and women wearing the robes of the KKK and representing a Minneapolis auto dealer’s association rode triumphantly over the mighty Mississippi from Minneapolis through St. Paul in decorated vehicles as part of a much-celebrated car parade Did you know that they then parked the cars and went to join in the revelries while the police force protected the vehicles No Neither did I when I began researching my last book. But it happened. In plain sight. It was photographed. It was discussed and championed in the local white press. It was advertised. It was celebrated. It was a success.The winter carnival gained revenue. The auto dealers gained customers. The Klan robes were referred to in ways intended to suggest this was a playful appropriation for an economy-boosting “fun” event. It appears in the historical record as part of the fabric of everyday life in the Twin Cities. Itwaspart of the fabric of everyday life. It was part of the fabric of everyday life so much that the African-American press at the time in St. Paul did not cover it. At all.It was part of the fabric of everyday life. This. The cavalier terrorizing of black residents of the Twin Cities. This. An absence of care or concern for what that terror (on top of the crushing economic and social inequities would inflict on the black residents. And, in service to what To the market. What was protected The private property of the white “night riders” in their “costumes.” What was privileged The coffers and the peace of the white establishment.And this week, in Minneapolis and the broader Twin Cities the discussion continues: Why are black residents “rioting” Why are black residents not letting “justice be served” And the care and concern for property over people is on display. Brilliant observers and activists have made clear that what we are witnessing in the nation this week, and in so many past weeks, is the perpetuation of a centuries-long practice of appropriating black bodies as fuel for a nation that discards them at whim.This is true for the nation as a whole and yet neither Minnesota nor the Twin Cities are usually the focus of the national debate. They should be. They should be because of Philando Castile. It should be because of Jamar Clark. It should be for every one of my former neighbors and friends in the Twin Cities who are not safe because of the skin they live in. It should be because the black community in the Twin Cities is deeply rooted and critically important to the histories of civil rights over two centuries, and also subject to generations of terror despite laws and statutes that might suggest otherwise.And yet, the ever-present threat of terror silences people. In 1917The Appeal(one of the leading African-American newspapers in the U.S. and located in the Twin Cities did not make one mention of the “car parade” populated by “the Mill City auto fraternity who made a conspicuous showing with their ghostly-costumed Ku Klux Klan.” None. This might seem curious. After all, didn’t the black residents of St. Paul or Minneapolis see or hear about it Didn’t they care No doubt they did. No doubt they were scared. But the public record is silent. Their experiences lost to us today. But the public silence is curious only until we remember that this was part of the fabric of everyday life. This specter of race-based violence (even when presented as “costume” was part of a legacy that included the attempted lynchings of two black men in St. Paul in 1896, and the conspicuous rise of a new incarnation of the KKK in Minnesota in the 1910s. In 1920 three black men were lynched in Duluth and in the 1920s the Klan began publishing its newspaper from a St. Paul office.And so, hundreds of people dressed in the ensembles of a terror group were part of a grand carnival designed to serve the needs of business and political establishments that welcomed white revelers from across the nation and the world, while African-Americans were conspicuously absent in any public way except four unnamed black men depicted as the “attendants” to the King of the Carnival that year. The 1917 car parade was recorded in the day’s papers with a large photo of three hooded men, their faces showing, under the headline “Minneapolis Ku Klux Clansmen Coming in Force” and an accompanying subtitle “’Night Riders’ Will Attack Carnival.” In the days that followed, much was made in many articles about the linked economic interests of the cities’ leadership and the boost that the parade had offered. The deployment of a terror-inducing spectacle was not just a mere byproduct, it was the main feature.And in 2020 we are witnessing an eerie reminder that 1917 is not that long ago. The expectation of black silence in the face of terror persists. After generations and generations of state-sanctioned terror and the systematic weakening of black bodies, black lives and black communities by silent and insipid housing policies, educational policies, employment policies and the growth of the carceral state, among others, in the last few days black Twin City residents have been outraged and called for justice, and engaged in public displays of generational grief and righteous anger. And in this moment there are concerns and questions about “rioting” and property damage.The outrage and the anger is more than 100 years in the making. And peaceful protests for generations have led us where To ask that black residents be silent now, be patient now, be calm now, is asking for the victims of violence and terror to protect the systems that inflict that upon them. If we are shocked that Twin City residents of a century ago put white supremacy on public display and celebrated it withnopublic outcry from black residents, how is it possible that we can also be outraged in 2020 that there is public outcry and outrage from black residents. White supremacist history seems to be repeating itself frequently. We should all be concerned about that.Elizabeth Duclos-Orsello, Ph.D. is a professor of American studies at Salem State University in Salem, Massachusetts.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_24,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The state of marijuana research law defies common sense.The state of marijuana research law defies common sense.Although people in several states, including Washington, are free to purchase an astonishing array of cannabis products for recreational or medical use, many of the finest researchers are handcuffed in their ability to examine the good — or harm — of those same products.Federal law requires all research in federally funded laboratories to use only marijuana from a single facility — in Oxford, Miss., thousands of miles away from Washington’s hundreds of marijuana retailers, just as an example.This absurd restriction needs to end.A bill now before the U.S. Senate would improve matters dramatically and deserves approval. The Medical Marijuana Research Act, which passed the House with resounding bipartisan approval, would untie researchers’ hands nationwide.Under the bill, qualified researchers in states that have legalized marijuana would be able to perform lab analysis of the cannabis available in those states.That would mean the University of Washington’s laboratories could research the same products Washingtonians of legal age can already buy and consume. Privately funded labs can study the street-legal products, but the top-flight research institutions funded by the National Institutes of Health cannot collaborate.“There’s currently these two (types of entities where you can perform research, and there’s no bridge between the two,” said UW pharmacology professor Dr. Nephi Stella.For Stella and other medical-marijuana researchers, this restriction hinders their ability to learn more about potentially transformative uses for cannabis products in medicine — such as the recent discovery that cannabidiol might be a useful treatment for epilepsy.“Having one source of old-school cannabis product does not satisfy our needs for research,” he said.Although the University of Mississippi’s marijuana-growing operation has worked to diversify its offerings in recent years, its selection is still limited to 11 marijuana varietals.Congress must end this federal choke point in drug research.Medical marijuana is now legal in 36 states, and 15 states allow recreational marijuana. Researchers in each one of them should be free to analyze the local products citizens can buy and consume for themselves.The goals aren’t limited to the medical world.States have not found a consensus definition for chemical thresholds for impaired driving after marijuana consumption. Washington voters set an arbitrary THC blood limit for drivers as part of Initiative 502 in 2012. California and Oregon do not have a set standard.“We don’t have a good test for impairment because we can’t study it,” said U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., one of the bill’s authors.Science ought to inform this national conversation better. The Senate should pass HR 3797 to remove the barriers to cannabis research as marijuana legalization continues to proliferate throughout the country.— The Seattle TimesRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

Someone who has suffered a trauma such as a car crash may need blood, but often, people who are fighting cancer need blood transfusions, and many people with chronic illnesses need blood transfusions periodically over the course of their lifetimes.Blood of all types, from all people, is needed all year long. But this September, the American Red Cross is making a special effort to attract Black blood donors to help fight sickle cell disease. September is Sickle Cell Awareness Month; sickle cell disease is a chronic illness that mainly affects people of African or Latino descent. About 100,000 people in the United States, including some right here in Suffolk, are fighting it. The most common genetic blood disease in the country, sickle cell disease causes red blood cells to be sticky, hard and crescent-shaped instead of soft and round. This makes it difficult for blood to flow smoothly and carry oxygen to the rest of the body, leading to severe pain, tissue and organ damage, acute anemia, strokes and other health effects.Blood transfusion helps sickle cell patients, but blood for them must be matched very closely to reduce the risk of complications. Some rare blood types are unique to specific racial and ethnic groups, and because of this, sickle cell disease patients are more likely to get a compatible match from a donor who is Black.Everyone, especially Black people, are encouraged to give this fall if you can. As an extra benefit, the Red Cross is testing donations for COVID-19 antibodies, and you’ll be notified of the results of the test. Everyone who is at least 17 years old, weighs at least 110 pounds and is in generally good health may be eligible.

minnpost_2020_163,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The eyes of the world are on the United States for a few reasons these days, but for 3½ hours today, the eyes of the international community will be focusing not on election results, recounts, or infection rates, but on our country’s human rights record. From 7:30 to 11:00 a.m. (CST , the United Nations’ Human Rights Council will meet in Geneva to hold its thirdUniversal Periodic Review (UPR of the United States.Although the Trump administration withdrew from the Human Rights Council in 2018, the Council nevertheless reviews every member country of the U.N., so the U.S. Government issending a delegation to Genevaheaded up by Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and LaborRobert A. Destro. The delegation will describe the administration’s position on the status of human rights in the U.S. and any progress the country has made in implementing recommendations it accepted from the last UPR in 2015.For this UPR of the United States, The Advocates for Human Rights submitted reports to the Human Rights Council addressing three critical human rights issues –asylum,labor trafficking, andthe death penalty. Separately, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, The Advocates also made adetailed statementto the council about the urgent need to dismantle the systemic racism that both fuels police violence in the U.S. and leads to impunity for law enforcement officers who commit such violence. In lieu of our typical in-person engagement with U.N, delegations, we have been busy engaging in electronic lobbying and holdingonlineeventsto encourage countries to take up our issues during their brief statements.“Each of these recommendations assumes – wrongly in our view – that the United States and federal, state and local governments engage in ‘systemic’ racial discrimination, racial profiling, and that federal, state and local law enforcement officers are regularly engaged in excessive uses of force. We reject the notion that law enforcement in the United States is ‘systemically’ racist.”Sadly, this assertion both reflects the lack of progress on police violence since the last review and bodes poorly for any future progress under the current administration. Indeed, there have been significant adverse developments in all of the areas addressed by our submissions sincethe last UPR of the United States in 2015, and it is more important than ever for the international community to use its influence to pressure the U.S. for real change.The UPR is a peer review process, and 120 countries have signed up to take the floor and offer their recommendations for how the United States can better uphold its obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights. With so many countries lining up to address the U.S., each will have only 55 seconds to provide its input. Ten countries also submittedadvance questionsfor the U.S. delegation on topics ranging from LGBTI rights to the controversialCommission on Unalienable Rightsto immigration detention and police violence.The federal government will have until March 2021 to decide whether to accept each recommendation it receives. An anticipated Biden administration is likely to take a very different approach to all of these issues (and to rejoin the Human Rights Council . Accepted recommendations set the stage for civil society organizations like ours to pressure the government toward implementation before the next UPR in 2025.Readers who want to follow the UPR of the United States this morning and get involved can watch the review live onUN Web TV, orwhen it appears in the archiveslater in the day. We will also be livetweeting the review, and readers can follow our Twitter feed at@The_Advocatesto see the recommendations that are made and even engage with the governments making important recommendations by retweeting our tweets and adding your thanks for their strong input.We will also be offering two thematic debriefings viaFacebookLive on Tuesday, Nov. 10:After this interactive dialogue is completed, we will be collaborating with other civil society actors and organizations on strategies to encourage the new administration to accept recommendations before the Human Rights Council meets in March 2021 to conclude its review of the United States.

minnpost_2020_53,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .We know Minnesotans have conflicting feelings about the upcoming school year. Some families are afraid for the safety of our students and the families they go home to. Others are eager to get children back into the classroom, where our kids learn best. Many more feel a mixture of both and we all worry for the health of our teachers and school staff. As both a former teacher and the parent of a child in public school, I am committed to providing the best education to our students while keeping them and their educators safe.I followed three principles as I worked with the Departments of Health and Education on a plan for the 2020-21 school year. First, our top priority was the safety, health, and well-being of students, staff, and families. Second, we continue to make data-driven decisions, leaning on science and research to make the best decisions for our state. And finally, we would respect the importance of local school districts, their expertise of their unique communities, and their commitment to making the best decisions for their students.That is why we are taking a localized, data-driven approach to the 2020-21 school year that will put student and staff safety first. By bringing together the local education leaders who know their students, staff, and communities the best with the public health experts who know the virus the best, this plan will help determine a learning model that makes the most sense for each community.School districts and charter schools will begin in one of three models: in-person, distance learning, or a hybrid model. Experts at the Departments of Health and Education will partner with local school districts and charter schools to help determine which learning model they should use to start the school year. While there are many factors to consider, the decision-making process will center on local data indicating the prevalence of COVID-19 in the surrounding county.Throughout the school year, we will need to be flexible and adapt with the fluid nature of this pandemic. The Departments of Education and Health will work with school districts and local health professionals to consistently track the virus to determine if and when a school may need to adjust their learning plan.School districts and charter schools will be required to ensure all families have the option to choose distance learning for their student. Teachers and staff will be given similar flexibility to the extent possible. As we switch between models, the plan prioritizes keeping younger children in the classroom because transmission is less likely for younger children and in-person learning is particularly critical at their developmental stage.With an investment of more than $430 million, we will support our schools, educators, students, and families through this uncertain time. We will provide face coverings for every student, educator, and staff member. We will deploy a comprehensive testing plan for educators and staff. We will help cover costs for cleaning supplies and technology needs, and we will create strategies for child care throughout the state.School districts and public health officials have a lot of important work to do, but the ultimate success of this process isn’t just up to them. It’s also in the hands of each and every Minnesotan. Our schools reflect their surrounding communities. For this to work, we need Minnesotans to come together to slow the spread of COVID-19. We need everyone to do their part to help get our kids and our teachers back in the classroom safely.Tim Walzis the governor of Minnesota."
suffolknewsherald_2020_58,"Published 7:35 pm Friday, July 3, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieIndependence Day is approaching. I am thinking of another I-Day that is happening this week. Due to COVID-19, the incoming plebe class of the United States Naval Academy will be inducted over a four-day period from June 29 through July 2, 2020. As I view the old pictures of my USNA classmates in recognition of Induction Day or I-Day, I am reminded of Lee Greenwood’s song, “God Bless the USA,” released in 1984.The song was still very popular when I graduated high school. I was a member of our school show choir. We sang this song. I remember being so moved during one of our performances because I realized that I would soon be serving our country as a naval officer. The meaning of the song became personal to me.Fast forward to my Induction Day on June 30, 1995. Every incoming plebe will tell you that you go through a whirlwind of emotions that day. You leave your civilian life behind when the Bancroft Hall doors close on I-Day. As a prior enlisted graduate of the United States Naval Academy Preparatory School (NAPS , I was already familiar with the pomp and circumstance of the enlistment process. Those who graduate from NAPS are required to report to the yard well ahead of our unassuming freshman classmates, who will enter days later. Our responsibility is to help indoctrinate them into military life.On I-Day, it is important that the NAPSters teach our classmates how to quickly establish military bearing. We represent a “do as I do” model. We cannot fail them.I don’t remember everything that happened that day, but I do remember that the song “God Bless The USA” was played as a tribute to the Class of 1999. I remember standing there looking pretty sharp, trying to maintain my military bearing when tears began to roll down my cheeks. I thought it was the most wicked trick that USNA could have played on us. Tears are certainly not a display of military bearing.Every time I hear that song, the lyrics that tug at my heartstrings the most are: “I proudly stand up next to you and defend her still today, because there ain’t no doubt I love this land. God Bless the USA.” Even today, I get choked up just thinking about its meaning. The meaning of freedom. The meaning of my service to this country. The meaning of standing shoulder to shoulder with my sisters and brothers.There are many debates going on as to whether this year’s Independence Day should be any less important to brown and black bodies due to the racial injustice and widespread unrest in the United States. According to an article published on theBoot.com that shares the story behind the song, “God Bless the USA” has become a rallying cry in the United States during times of crisis. If I were Lee Greenwood, I would change these lyrics to say, “I won’t forget the people (vice men who died, who gave that right to me.” People, many people have died for my rights and yours. Many of those people have been black lives. Yet it is that very truth that breaks my heart for the injustices we still must stand against today. It will be an emotional I-Day, Independence Day. I still have no doubts, I love this land. The United States is my home, and I will proudly stand up next to truth and defend freedom and justice today.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

eugeneweekly_2020_5,"We ve got issues. The horrific wildfire in the McKenzie Valley has caused injuries and deaths, destroyed homes and personal valuables, killed domestic and wild animals and damaged businesses. Its suffocating smoke has generated physical health risks countywide. And many people are heartbroken about the devastation to the beautiful area and small towns they love to visit and recreate in. Until now, our region has mostly avoided this type of major disaster. But it was only a matter of time before it happened. A disrupted global climate system has raised temperatures, altered regional weather patterns and generated droughts that dried out forests and soils, severely stressed and killed trees and created conditions ripe for catastrophic wildfires. Lane County is now a frontline territory for climate impacts. Food, water, shelter and other basic necessities must be provided to those directly impacted by the wildfires. It is also important to offer psychological first aid to people who have been so traumatized that they cannot function or are at risk of harming themselves or others. However, the most serious psychological, emotional and behavioral problems resulting from a disaster like the wildfire typically occur months or years after it ends. As the tremendous outpouring of help offered by community members shows, strangers typically come together during a disaster like the wildfire to provide resources and support. This is called the “honeymoon phase” of an emergency, and it can last for weeks or a month or so. The outpouring of assistance helps to minimize post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD and other mental health problems as well as psychosocial problems such as alcohol and drug abuse. After the wildfire is controlled and the public returns to their everyday lives, some people directly impacted by the fire will undoubtedly experience serious psychological, emotional or behavioral problems as they struggle, on their own, to put their lives back together. This is called the “disillusionment phase” of a disaster, and can last for three to six months, or even years. The result can be severe anxiety, depression, PTSD, complicated grief, hopelessness and other mental health problems. It can also cause parents to neglect or abuse their children and produce adverse childhood experiences, crime, violence and other psychosocial problems. So in addition to providing immediate assistance to those impacted by the wildfire, long term psychosocial supports will be needed. While important, individually-focused therapy will likely not be sufficient to address the scale of the mental health and psychosocial problems that emerge during the disillusionment phase of the wildfire. That’s because the impacts are occurring in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social isolation and economic strains that, on their own, are very distressing. Further, numerous recent assessments have pointed out that the unprecedented wildfires are just one of many harmful impacts speeding our way due to the climate emergency. And, to reduce the effects to manageable levels, rapid and often stressful changes will be needed in numerous individual, community, economic and societal practices and policies. So in addition to providing immediate and long-term support to those directly impacted by the wildfires, it is also essential to begin now to prepare all Lane County residents for the individual and collective traumas to come that result from accelerating climate impacts as well as the stress pileups associated with the changes required to minimize the climate emergency. Our region should get out front of these looming problems now. Extensive review of initiatives in the U.S. and the world that prevent and heal individual and collective traumas shows that the most effective approach is to organize community leaders into what can be called a “resilience coordinating council” (RCC . The goal of an RCC is to “bring the entire system together” — people representing every population and sector of a community or region — to collaboratively plan and implement age, gender and culturally appropriate activities to enhance the capacity of every resident to prevent and heal mental health and psychosocial problems. This is not a mental health treatment program. Rather than pathologizing people and treating symptoms with single-person therapy, an RCC would teach everyone important information and skills, build individual and group strengths and promote social norms that establish a local culture of mental wellness and resilience for all types of disasters and emergencies. To accomplish this, members of a RCC should include grassroots leaders from marginalized groups, as well as neighborhood, faith and spirituality and K-12 and higher education professionals. Leaders of volunteer and civic organizations, social justice, public health, emergency response, food, water and shelter providers; police and government should also be actively involved. All of the activities offered by the RCC should be delivered in just and equitable ways, and should focus on both “presencing” and “purposing” information and skills. Presencing skills are simple ways for people to calm their body, mind and emotions when distressed to enable wise and skillful decision-making. This includes helping everyone become trauma informed by explaining how their body and mind naturally activates fight, flight or freeze reactions when they sense a threat. Presencing also includes self-administrable body-based, breath-based and thought-based skills as well as enhanced social connections that enable people to self-regulate their nervous system. Teaching people six-second breathing, for example, can strengthen their capacity for self-regulation. Purposing skills are simple methods to find meaning, direction and hope in the midst of ongoing emergencies. They include methods to turn toward and learn from the adversities, clarify the core values one wants to live by and finding a purpose to engage in. Helping other people, caring for pets and animals and restoring the natural environment are some of the most powerful ways to accomplish this. Local residents will benefit, for example, by learning how they can increase their own sense of wellbeing by rising above their own personal needs to engage in a pro-social activity. The individual and collective traumas generated by the McKenzie wildfire, pandemic and coming future emergencies underscore that now is the time to organize RCCs countywide. Not only will they protect everyone’s health, safety and security, they will also help people engage more effectively in activities that can reduce climate impacts to manageable levels. Bob Doppelt coordinates the International Transformational Resilience Coalition (ITRC a global network of mental health and other professionals working to build universal capacity to use climate and other disasters as transformational catalysts to learn, grow and find new sources of meaning, purpose, and hope in life."
philinquirer_2020_37,"Horrifying body-cam footage shows, yet again, why Wallace’s death spurred an immediate call to action.On Oct. 26, police unloadedat least 14 roundson Walter Wallace Jr. while his mother begged in anguish for them not to shoot. This was caught on camera — on cell phone video that went viral after the shooting, and on body-cam footage the Philadelphia police released over a week later, on Wednesday night. That horrifying footage shows, yet again, why Wallace’s death spurred an immediate call to action to confront a culture that continues to allow the state-sanctioned murder of Black people.All this followed the summer uprisings, precipitated by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The city joined nationwide protests, and some looting ensued. Philadelphia has long been reeling from the teargassing of assembled protesters on I-95 and along52nd Street in West Philadelphia. Walter Wallace Jr. was 27 years old and experiencing a mental health emergency.» READ MORE:Police video of Walter Wallace Jr. killing raises more questions than answers for Philly | EditorialWest Philadelphia, still with tender wounds from the summer, has been retraumatized by this killing. I’m a lifelong West Philly resident, and the shooting happened on my 37th birthday. Our community will have to begin another healing process. The city at large needs to galvanize to finally abolish the police.The expected rhetoric followed Wallace’s death, with some highlighting his criminal record, saying the cops were doing their job, and dismissing the already denied humanity of a Black person. This isn’t new — this is how a white supremacist culture reacts to violence enacted on Black bodies. Nothing about this is coincidental nor a mistake, especially not in the context of the overcriminalization of our communities in Philadelphia and nationwide. There isn’t any reform that can confront how brutal this system is at the root. Despite body cams and independent investigations, progressive district attorneys, and recurrent, as of yet unheeded demands to defund the police, the culture of policing continues to harm the most vulnerable among us.Philadelphia City Council President Darrell L. Clarke, in an effort to provide the police withnonlethal weapons, committed last week to immediately transferring up to$9.5 million for their purchase— as Black organizers continue pressing the city to take money away from the police budget. It is reductive and problematic to believe the answer to curtailing police violence is pouring more money into its organization. Walter Wallace Jr. isn’t dead because a Taser wasn’t available. Shooting someone 10-plus times is a decision to end a life. Continuing to fund police and ignoring community demands is angering communities who are stripped of resources and pushed out from neighborhoods that don’t need cops to have Tasers. They need and deserve care and concern that doesn’t criminalize them.» READ MORE:Police departments are broken. Is it time to abolish them all together? | Pro/ConThis is why I adamantly decry the continued investment into any measure that suggests “shifts” to a system that doesn’t act accountable to Black communities. Abolition — ending policing without equivocation — is the only response that makes sense. Anything short of moving to completely disarm and disband the police doesn’t align with the refrain that Black Lives Matter. Last week’s shooting is another addition to our unending proof: The police state doles out an absolute end to Black futures, often leading to the death of Black people or their lifelong criminalization. Abolition, however, would secure Black futures.In a city with deep poverty and displacement, which is happening right now amid a pandemic inflicting the most loss and economic devastation on Black and Latinx communities, the impact of police violence increases with community vulnerability. The need to press upon ourselves and each other a different way couldn’t be more evident. I will continue to push for the demands to defund and abolish the police because our lives depend on this racist system being dismantled. Otherwise, our birthdays will be constant reminders of how easily Black lives can be stolen away.Abdul-Aliy Muhammad is an organizer and writer born and raised in West Philadelphia.@MxAbdulAliy"
minnpost_2020_168,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .2020 is unlike any year before, and this Election Day will be unlike any previous one. As responsible citizens, we have a duty to be patient, verify any claims about victory/defeat, and trust in the democratic process. Here’s what will change – and one key thing that will stay the same – this year.The COVID-19 pandemic led many voters to vote early by mail or in-person. Some states proactively sent ballots to registered voters and applications to unregistered ones.This will not affect the sanctity of the vote. Voter fraud is extremely rare in the U.S. Oregon, for example, established universal voting by mail in 2000. A recentnonpartisan reportfound only 38 convictions for fraud out of 60.9 million ballots cast over 19 years.Here in Minnesota, the conservative Heritage Foundation identifiedonly 131 instancesof voter fraud in Minnesota since 1979, out of millions of ballots cast and thousands of offices. The Washington Post foundjust fourexamples of illegal voting in the 2016 election nationwide.But early voting and heightened turnout mean we may not know the winners on election night. More than 30 states, including neighboring Wisconsin, cannot begin tabulating mailed ballots until Election Day. Early turnout has alreadybroken records. In-person voting is also expected to be high.Simply sorting the 150 million ballots expected to be cast this year is a gargantuan task. It will take even longer to count them and determine winners. But delayed results have happened before. The 2000 presidential race only ended on Dec. 13. Congressional races occasionally, but regularly, take days or even weeks to resolve. In the 2008 election, Al Franken took his Senate seat after seven months of litigation and additional ballot counting.This will not be a normal election, but as responsible citizens, we can do three things to support the electoral process.First, be patient: Vote counting will take time much longer than normal this year.Second, be cautious: Disregard claims about “stolen ballots” or cheating. It is extremely hard to commit voter fraud, and it has never swung a federal election.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_78,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°President Donald Trump waves as he departs on the South Lawn of the White House, on December 12, 2020, in Washington, D.C. (Al Drago/Getty Images/TNS We are witnessing something extraordinary in American history: a president, defeated at the polls, is bent on wreaking as much damage to our republic as possible as he leaves office. By the time you read this, he still has about three weeks to discover new targets for attack.We are witnessing something extraordinary in American history: a president, defeated at the polls, is bent on wreaking as much damage to our republic as possible as he leaves office. By the time you read this, he still has about three weeks to discover new targets for attack.What is happening appears to have little to do with policy or politics. In fact, the effort to detect organizing patterns in Donald Trump’s actions has always fallen somewhere on the usefulness spectrum between challenging and a fool’s errand.It’s tempting to imagine that Trump is planning a four-year campaign to contend for the presidency in 2024. That would help explain the $200 million that he raised from his supporters who thought they were backing his effort to reverse the outcome of what he claims is a stolen election.But we needn’t look to 2024 to explain why Trump might resort to deception to separate the gullible from their money. For Trump, it’s instinctual. It doesn’t require a long-term strategic goal. Self-enrichment and the pacification of his psychic needs—which are considerable—are probably enough to explain his current actions, which otherwise don’t make much sense.Consider the rash of pardons issued recently by Trump to an unseemly set of duly convicted criminals. None of the pardons involved miscarriages of justice or extenuating circumstances that call for special consideration. Mostly the pardons were for friends, family members and political allies. Thus they reflect the vulgar logic always used by unscrupulous politicians who use their power to protect and reward their friends.But the most despicable pardons went to four Blackwater mercenaries who killed 17 Iraqi civilians in 2007, leading F.B.I. investigator John Patarini to remark, “This is the My Lai massacre of Iraq.”Trump doesn’t know the four murderers. He isn’t concerned with the integrity of the judicial process that culminated in their long prison sentences. He isn’t interested in the impact that these four pardons will have on America’s standing in the world as a place where justice is carried out equitably under the rule of law.Trump probably is not even heeding his instinctual, visceral attraction to the rough justice of violence being committed by manly warriors against the weak losers of the world who live in woebegone countries like Iraq.No, for Donald Trump disruption is a goal in itself. With these four pardons he indulges his power to disrupt the processes of justice that apply to ordinary people. He will use it, for his own satisfaction, just because he can, as well as to “own the liberals.”And that’s why these next three weeks are so perilous. The disconnect in Trump’s mind between reasonable strategic objectives and the rewards that he receives from exercising presidential power is particularly dangerous as Trump considers the power that he is about to lose.The elemental presidential power is military, and some of Trump’s most rewarding experiences in office have stemmed from its use, with the assassinations of ISIS founder al-Baghdadi in 2019 and Gen. Qassim Suleimani, commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, in January.Conditions are ripe for another confrontation with Iran. The anniversary of the death of Suleimani is next week, and by many accounts Iran doesn’t consider his death to have been sufficiently avenged.On Dec. 20, at least eight rockets were fired into the Green Zone in Baghdad, probably by Iranian-backed militias. A few days later Trump ominously tweeted “friendly health advice” for Iran: “if one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over.”Trump is not above idle threats. But too many dangerous conditions are converging: legitimate points of conflict with an increasingly desperate Iran; the distinct possibility of American casualties from an attack by an Iranian-backed militia; an American president who feels that power is being wrested away from him illegitimately.And then there’s Trump’s failure to connect policy and action; his implacable hunger for attention, his abhorrence for “losing”; and his opportunity to spite President Obama, president-elect Biden and Iran, all at the same time.Three dangerous weeks to go.John M.

minnpost_2020_58,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Excitement accompanies the start of a new school year. This year the anticipation is especially great. How many classes will be in person How can online learning be engaging Will the technology work What will the sports scene look like on campus What will it be like to have cross country in the springWill everyone keep a safe distanceThese are just a few questions students and my colleagues are asking at Hamline University and other colleges. The atmosphere is the same at campuses throughout the state.As Hamline students arrive on campus, signs of the George Floyd summer will be evident. Lloyd’s, the corner pharmacy on Minnehaha and Snelling,is a pile of rubble. Boarded storefronts continue to dot University Avenue. Scars from the summer are not hidden.Wearing masks will be a shared expectation. Fear of COVID-19 will continue. Keeping safe distances will be the new normal. Politics and the upcoming election will be the talk of the campus. Who will best represent and lead us in the futureThis coming school year, although we are living through troubled times, is ripe for civic learning and practicing our democracy.Rep.John Lewis called education the cornerstoneof our democracy. On the day before he passed away, Lewis and Rep. Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to the secretary of education championing civic education for students.COVID-19, the murder of George Floyd, the civic unrest that followed, and this fall’s election are significant opportunities for everyone — students, teachers, and staff — to have serious conversations, and act to create better universities.The coronavirus requires us to act not selfishly but for the good of all. Since March, we have recognized “we are in this together.”Until a vaccine is discovered, we will wear our face masks, keep safe distances, and demonstrate we can teach and learn with different modalities. Our public health program will help us understand the role of public health. The School of Business can help us understand the impact COVID-19 has had on the economy, and what strategies will bring people back to work.The Hamline community, with the encouragement and leadership of President Faynese Miller, is ready to dig deep to explore the issues of race and equity. We will continue to seek truth, racial healing and transformation. The memorial to George Floyd at 38th and Chicago and site of the killing of Philando Castile are constant reminders of the work we must do. The unity and collaboration of students, faculty and staff are essential. Our varied disciplines will help us explore what defunding police means.Our goal for voting participation by students in the fall is 90 percent, 90 in ’20. Hamline has previously been a leader in voter turnout. The divisiveness that has characterized the campaign thus far does not have to be that way. The rancor does not have to be there. We will listen to people’s stories, especially people who come from different backgrounds, and respect cultures.2020 is a year to remember. It can be a time of tremendous learning and building communities.Jim Scheibel, a former mayor of St. Paul, is Professor of Practice in the Management, Marketing and Public Administration Department,Hamline University.He is a former director of both AmeriCorps VISTA and the Senior Corps."
suffolknewsherald_2020_107,"Published 9:56 pm Friday, May 29, 2020ByTracy AgnewLet’s call it what it was: murder.What everybody saw when they watched the video of George Floyd dying was plain murder.It was not restraining him to gain control, even if he was resisting arrest at first.It was not a split-second decision made as an officer was in fear of his life or the lives of others, as the justification often goes in many officer-involved shootings.No. That officer never needed to fire his weapon to kill George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. He simply put a knee on his neck and remained there for nearly nine minutes until the life drained out of the human body beneath him.Two other officers held other parts of Floyd’s body down while a fourth kept watch and defended their actions to concerned bystanders.It was depraved, it was wicked, and it was sinful. Everybody who watched the bystander’s video and listened to Mr. Floyd plead for his life should be sickened at the inhumanity.What’s in that video is undeniable. It’s unjustifiable. Unlike in a shooting incident, the officer on Mr. Floyd’s neck had approximately 480 seconds to rethink his horrific crime. And he chose to steal another person’s life every second along the way.This particular murder is remarkable for the amount of civilian video footage available that made all the horrific details available to the public so soon. But unfortunately, it is unremarkable in that it is yet another black man who died senselessly at the hands of a white person.Everybody in America should be outraged about this. And all of us white people need to start speaking up on behalf of our brothers and sisters who look different from us. It is the fear of people who look different, and what we’ve been taught — either explicitly or implicitly — that means, that leads to incidents like George Floyd’s death.I know the term “white privilege” can be a tinderbox, but I’ve come to understand it in recent years, and I want all of my fellow white folks to take note. It doesn’t mean you did anything to earn it or deserve it. It doesn’t mean your life hasn’t been hard in other ways. But it does mean that you’ll never be treated differently because of the color of your skin. And it also means that people may listen if you speak up.There are many things you can do, but if you listen to and amplify the voices of people of color, that is a good first start. We shouldn’t place the burden on them to tell us how they feel or what they’ve experienced, but many of them are doing so already. Share their Facebook posts and blogs. Read books by them and share your recommendations with your white friends, particularly those who may not be as inclined to listen otherwise. Speak up against those racist statements or jokes your family and friends make. When you find yourself thinking something about someone just because of the color of their skin, stop and examine that falsehood and pledge to do better.There is lots more that you can do, but there’s not a lot of room here.

minnpost_2020_187,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I just finished F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby.” It was the seventh or eighth time I’ve read it since my first time while in college. In fact, Raymond Chandler and Walter Mosley mysteries aside, “Gatsby” is the only novel I intentionally reread every now and then.For the uninitiated, “Gatsby” is the story of Jay Gatsby, a 30ish self-made millionaire and his tragic pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, a wealthy young woman with whom he had a love affair five years before but who has since married another man, Tom Buchanan, heir to a huge fortune. Though the story is told several years later, the events occur in 1922. It’s narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate who moves to New York from the Midwest “for a career in bonds,” after serving in World War I.For good reason the book is considered Fitzgerald’s masterpiece. Here is a paragraph I recall from my first reading more than 50 years ago. It’s Nick Carraway’s reaction when he’s introduced to the gambler who fixed the 1919, “Black Sox,” World Series. “The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merelyhappened, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people — with the single mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.”In three sentences, Fitzgerald gives us readers a common reference point, the 1919 Series; informs us that real people, not vague social forces, cause historical events; and reminds us of the shallow things, like baseball games, that focus the attention of we moderns and inspire our loyalty and faith. “Gatsby” is full of similar tight and shiny compositional gems.The novel has an expansive quality, so over the years each reading has provided me a fresh tutorial on ambition, wealth, love, character, and life in America generally.Inevitably because of our current electoral season, my most recent rereading of the book conjured up similarities between the story and Donald Trump and his America. For example, Gatsby’s focus on recovering his relationship with Daisy despite the passage of time is an apt metaphor for the desire of some to recover a romanticized time of American greatness. In fact, those aspirations remind us of this exchange between Nick Carraway and Gatsby regarding him winning back Daisy.“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the past.”“Can’t repeat the past” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”He looked around wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of the reach of his hand.“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said, nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”Not surprisingly, like every effort to recapture a make-believe past Gatsby’s attempt to do so with Daisy fails and he is shot and killed atop an air mattress in his swimming pool, the wrongful victim of a husband’s vengeful rage.Even more telling is the resemblance of the narcissistic actions of our president, and maybe our nation, to Nick Carraway’s characterization of Tom and Daisy Buchanan after they falsely identified Gatsby as the hit and run driver who killed the angry husband’s wife.‘They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”Ken Peterson is an attorney and served as the state’s commissioner of labor and industry under Govs. Rudy Perpich and Mark Dayton. A good St. Paulite, he is an unrepentant Fitzgerald fan."

That’s a very telling statistic that underscores just how much this library needs to be updated.So virtually everyone agrees that a new library for downtown Suffolk is needed. However, what that new building will eventually look like and what amenities and services it should include is a more nuanced discussion.After many years in the plans, work is finally beginning on creating a new downtown library in Suffolk, and one of the first items on the agenda is that survey. We encourage everyone to fill it out. There’s also a virtual meeting later this month.The library of the 21st century is no longer just a room full of books, although it’s definitely still that, too. It’s a place to research your genealogy; take your children to storytime; learn about, use and even borrow new technology; use the computers to type papers or apply for a job; discover a new hobby; get digital books and magazines without ever leaving home; and so much more. Libraries these days offer meeting spaces, a community gathering spot and more.It will be active through July 15, and you can take it by going to suffolkpubliclibrary.com/291/New-Central-Library.

minnpost_2020_216,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .First, consider the brilliant litigation career of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.InFrontiero v. Richardson(1973 , she persuaded the Supreme Court that it was unconstitutional for the military to provide living quarters and medical benefits for the families of servicemen, but not for the families of servicewomen.InKahn v. Shevin(1974 , she challenged a Florida law that granted widows an annual $500 property tax exemption, while denying the same exemption to widowers. She ran aground on Justice Douglas’ opinion that “there can be no dispute that the financial difficulties confronting the lone woman in Florida or in any other State exceed those facing the man. Whether from overt discrimination or from the socialization process of a male-dominated culture, the job market is inhospitable to the woman seeking any but the lowest paid jobs.” Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Byron White dissented. Eleven years later, one conservative appeals court judge questioned whether the majority opinion retained any vitality.InEdwards v. Healey, she had successfully challenged Louisiana’s practice of allowing women to opt out of jury duty. It was unfair to her clients, who included women who were parties to litigation in Louisiana, to tip the jury pool toward men who could not opt out. Louisiana changed its practices, and in 1975 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the case as moot. But four years later, inDuren v. Missouri, she successfully challenged the opt-out rule in a criminal prosecution.InWeinberger v. Wiesenfeld(1975 , she successfully challenged a Social Security law that granted survivors of a man both widow’s and children’s benefits, while the survivors of a woman only received children’s benefits. She also successfully challenged Social Security discrimination against a widower inCalifano v. Goldfarb(1977 . That law required a widower to prove that he had actually relied on his deceased wife for support, while a widow would not have to prove that she had relied on her deceased husband for support.The cases attorney Ginsburg selected, to pursue all the way to the Supreme Court, reflected her prudent belief that the high court is more likely to decide a case than a cause. To this day, the Supreme Court has not agreed that sex stands alongside race as a suspect classification. But it places a heavy burden on any unit of government that wants to discriminate on the basis of sex. This law developed incrementally, reflecting what the New York Times called Ginsburg’s “slow and steady” pursuit of justice.Now, consider Ruth Bader Ginsburg as an associate justice of that court.She came to the Supreme Court with a deep skepticism about the all-time feminist landmark decision,Roe v. Wade. Her sharp litigation instincts told her it was too great a leap forward in one case. Quoted in the Times, she remarked that, “Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped may prove unstable.” In that regard she was more prescient than distant observers, including me, who thought that the oceanic disturbance caused byRoemight settle down into calm waters. A half century later, that obviously has not happened.Claiming the benefit of hindsight, the reason becomes clear. The balance between majoritarian democracy and individual rights is not a mere matter of litigation strategy. When the court struck down not just one highly restrictive Texas statute, but literally every abortion law in the nation, “a decent respect to the opinions of people ” required that they should “declare the causes” which impelled them to it. The general principle is stated at the very beginning of our Declaration of Independence. That Declaration did not have four concurring opinions and a dissent.By viewingRoeas a mere matter of litigation strategy, Justice Ginsberg – and many of the rest of us – failed to comprehend the great skepticism and bitterness it engendered among the disenfranchised opponents of elective abortions. We also failed to appreciate the logical departure it represented. As Justice Potter Stewart indicated in his concurrence, the decision demonstrated that “the doctrine of substantive due process” was not dead.What is “substantive due process” To a semanticist, it is an oxymoron. There are substantive issues and there are process issues, and the first word cannot modify the second. To legal historians, it recalls the era between the Civil War and the New Deal in which the Supreme Court struck down child labor laws and other legislation intended to provide some relief for ordinary citizens, during the Gilded Age and the robber baron era. To me, no scholar but one who has taken his own share of cases to appellate courts, it means that the judges can just make it up.It is unfortunate that as an associate justice, Ginsburg did not act upon her litigator’s instincts and look for ways to minimize the tension thatRoeproduced. It is even more unfortunate that she seemed unfazed by the institutional damage cascading right before her eyes. Outrage over the decision made Ronald Reagan a serious presidential candidate and ushered in decades of conservative political dominance. Support for the Equal Rights Amendment melted like a Minnesota icicle in March. To their everlasting credit, in 2000 two conservative appointees crossed the ideological divide to oppose the hijacking of a presidential vote count. Ginsburg and another liberal appointee joined them in dissent and could have entered the pantheon as guarantors of democracy. But 13 and 15 years later the temptation to overturn another 40-plus state and federal laws, this time on the subject of marriage, proved overpowering.

philinquirer_2020_60,"With a full third of the school board in need of replacing, some educators and activists are wondering if it’s time to reconsider how members get a seat at the table.In early November,Lee Huang announced his resignationfrom the Philadelphia Board of Education, making him the third board member to vacate a seat this year. Based on guidelines set forth in Philadelphia’s City Charter, board members are appointed by the mayor, but with a full third of the school board in need of replacing, some educators and activists are wondering if it’s time to reconsider how members get a seat at the table.The Inquirer tapped an educator and parent to debate the city’s chief education officer:Should the Philly school board be elected instead of appointed?By Zoe RooneyOver the last few weeks, we’ve watched threats of voter disenfranchisement play out on a national scale. As we’ve seen Philadelphians step up to ensure every vote is counted, we have simultaneously been confronted with our own disenfranchisement when it comes to our Board of Education.We recently learned thatanother member of our appointed board is resigning, and the mayor is in the process of filling the vacancies. Philadelphia’s students, families, and educators are locked out of the process, afforded neither a vote nor a voice.» READ MORE:Another Philly school board member is resigning; mayor must now replace a third of the boardWith the recent resignations ofAmeen Akbar and Lee Huang, following that of Chris McGinley last April, the Philadelphia Board of Education has three open seats. These vacancies come just as the district faces many extraordinary challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, looming budget deficits, district systems that perpetuate anti-Black racism, and ongoing issues with toxic school buildings.The nominating panel, selected by Mayor Jim Kenney, convened on Nov. 17 to begin the process of selecting candidates. The mayor’s chosen nominees will then be passed to City Council for confirmation in December. Since the panel first convened in 2018, there has been little opportunity for public comment or involvement. Instead, they have met almost entirely behind closed doors, locking out the residents of the only Pennsylvania district withoutan elected school board. This round was no different — the first remote meeting only allows citizens to submit written comments in advance, with no public participation during the meeting.Members of the Our City Our Schools coalition, who worked to abolish the School Reform Commission, looked forward to a return to local control that would give Philadelphians a voice in the decisions made about our public schools. We wanted local control to mean community control, accountability, and board members who listened and responded to the needs and concerns of students, families, and educators.Instead, we have seen the mayor’s Board of Education continue the legacy of the SRC, acting as a rubber stamp for district leadership, and ignoring community members who testify and write in with concerns. Even worse, they do this while giving lip service to transparency, community engagement, and communication. Philadelphians will continue the fight for a transparent, representative, and accountable elected school board. Until then, we demand that the mayor open up the current selection process so that it is fully public and transparent.“We wanted local control to mean community control, accountability, and board members who listened and responded to the needs and concerns of students, families, and educators.”The nominating panel should conduct its business in public, not in executive sessions out of the view of most Philadelphians. Public hearings must be held at multiple points throughout the process, before backroom decisions are codified by handshake deals. The public must be able to review the full list of candidates with sufficient time to learn about them and must have the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns in front of the nominating panel and City Council.While members of the Our City Our Schools coalition believe that community voice and a more transparent process are important steps forward, we know these steps alone will not fix our Board of Education. We need more.We need our board to include public school educators, activists, and parents of students who attend schools other than those in expensive, gentrified neighborhoods or with special admissions criteria. We need students to have a real voice as voting members of our board. While the two nonvoting student representative seats are a step in the right direction, the role functions more as a token than an opportunity for actual student power in decision-making. The student members lack a vote, autonomy, preparation, and training, and two students cannot effectively represent a district of more than 200,000.We need board members who understand the necessity of undoing years of SRC-imposed “reforms” on the district, such as the large-scale expansion of charter schools, rampant outsourcing of district jobs and services to contractors, a revolving door of standardized tests, curricula, and mandates imposed on educators, and the traumatic closures of numerous neighborhood schools.Philadelphians must have the right to vote on their board members just like every other Pennsylvanian. While we keep organizing toward that reality, we deserve real transparency and a voice.Zoe Rooney is an educator, parent, and member of Parents United for Public Education, a citywide organization focused on engaging families on issues of quality and equity in public schools. It is part of the Our City Our Schools coalition.By Otis HackneyIn 2017, when Mayor Jim Kenney announced that Philadelphia had secured local control of our public schools, he was adamant that members of the school board should be mayoral appointees. “You can hold me, and future mayors, accountable for the success or failure of our schools,” he vowed at the time.Three years later, it’s clear this is still the best choice for the School District of Philadelphia, which educates almost 200,000 students each year.This structure was not decided in a vacuum: prior to that change, we had examined different board structures, including the idea of elected board members. But the mayor and I believed that a mayoral-appointed school board, with Council confirmation, was the best type for Philadelphia.Remember that this came after years of finger-pointing during which students and families were told that the state of their schools is someone else’s responsibility. We knew that accountability rests with the mayor who makes the appointment, and with the City Council who approves the members. The buck truly does stop with us.This month, the mayor will select three new board members for approval by Philadelphia City Council. Once approved, they will join a committed group of six other leaders who volunteer their time, expertise, and energy to set the vision and goals for the School District. The board also hires, supervises, and evaluates the superintendent and authorizes and renews charter schools.“To transition to an elected school board would require significant changes to the charter and state law.”Through this governance, we have stepped up as a city, increasing our investment in and accountability to our students. Between 2018 and 2021, the city’s contribution to the district more than doubled. This effort, combined with the oversight of our Board of Education and leadership of Superintendent William R. Hite Jr., led to a stable two years of operations and education for the district.» READ MORE:As COVID-19 cases surge, should schools stay open? Around the Philly region, approaches vary wildly.The COVID-19 pandemic has also shown why true alignment between the School District and the City of Philadelphia is vital.

To transition to an elected school board would require significant changes to the charter and state law.And elections for the Board of Education in Philadelphia would set up regular, deeply ideological battles that would be costly, painful, and not necessarily focused on student success. As we have seen over the past decade, there is significant monetary support of different ideologies. A school board election would open a fierce process with the potential for other interest groups — besides education experts — to shape the future of public education. By placing the appointment with the mayor, who has responsibility for the success of the city as a whole, there are opportunities for all voices to be heard and moderated.» READ MORE:Citing surge in COVID-19, Philly schools reverse reopening plan; will continue virtual instruction until further noticeResearch has shown that urban districts under mayoral control have performed better than their peers. The Center for American Progress (CAP reviewed peer cities Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C., and noted these systems have seen substantial improvement in student performance. CAP also found that mayor-led districts use resources strategically, leading to lower administrative costs, and resources getting directly into classrooms through lower teacher-student ratios.Now, as we look to the day when students can return safely to the classroom, we build on three years of local control and accountability. We have made tremendous progress for our children and cannot reverse course. This administration looks forward to advancing three new leaders to the school board next month.

Neither has a Florida company, Consulate Health Care, which owns the nursing home believed to be the source of a spike in Isle of Wight County’s coronavirus cases.Florida’s governor on Saturday became the latest advocate for transparency surrounding long-term care facilities, which are hotbeds for COVID-19 outbreaks.At Gov. Ron DeSantis’ directive, Florida began releasing the names of nursing homes and assisted living facilities where there are confirmed cases of COVID-19.In that state as of Saturday, there were 303 long-term care facilities with positive COVID-19 cases totaling 1,694. At least 169 of Florida’s 748 deaths from COVID-19 were related to infections at these facilities.The decision to release the names of the facilities was based on concerns for public health, DeSantis said.“I told the surgeon general from the beginning that we want to put as much information out as we can,” the governor said. “I have now directed him to determine that it is necessary for public health to release the names of facilities.”In Virginia, meanwhile, public health officials have doubled down on their assertion that facilities themselves have a right to privacy. The Western Tidewater Health District has revealed that unnamed long-term care facilities are the source of outbreaks but refused to provide any information that would be helpful to a jittery citizenry. The reputations of facilities with no active COVID-19 cases have been tainted by the health district’s vagueness.In many places, facilities themselves are doing the right thing and making public their outbreaks.In rural northern Virginia, a Luray nursing home last week confirmed it had 59 positive cases of COVID-19.The facility, of course, didn’t release the names of infected residents or staff or any other information that would come close to identifying those victims.Skyview Springs Rehab and Nursing Center’s transparency was rewarded with an outpouring of public and private support. Page County Fire and Rescue organized a community response that included donations of personal protective equipment and a drive-by parade over the weekend.“The community’s backing for our residents and staff is among the most valuable forms of support available right now,” the facility’s administrator said in a news release.According to the Virginia Department of Health, Page County had 84 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday, along with nine hospitalizations and no deaths. That means the Luray nursing home was the source of more than half of the county’s cases.Similar transparency is needed from Consulate Health Care regarding its Windsor nursing home. Even if the state doesn’t require it, such candor will build consumer confidence in management’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and fully inform the citizens of Isle of Wight County, which continues to rank among Virginia’s hardest-hit localities per capita.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_200,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .If you do not agree this is a compromising situation for our nation that was likely avoidable, I think you will agree it has disrupted the functioning of government in a time when America needs a highly functioning government to help us through the biggest economic and public health crisis in a century. Therefore, no matter which political party we identify with, we should all want to ensure that this sort of scenario never occurs again.I believe Congress needs to act immediately to establish a nonpartisan commission to investigate how President Donald Trump became infected with the coronavirus. The commission needs to begin an immediate investigation that will determine the origin of the infection and the route of transmission into the inner circle of our nation’s leadership. This commission needs to rule out a targeted bioterrorism/slow-assassination attempt in which the president and his close associates were targeted for infection by nefarious actors. This must be done to ensure the continued integrity and safety of the office of the president. This work needs to move beyond rapid tests to include viral whole genome sequencing (WGS for all those infected in this cluster along with contact tracing and viral WGS (if still possible for individuals who potentially spread this infection to the president and this cluster.To create a clear picture of this cluster outbreak, state health departments must work with the federal government to perform contact tracing and sample collection for WGS from individuals who have tested positive. Currently, I suspect no samples are being archived for WGS. This commission and study will not quell all the conspiracy theories, but hard data and facts will go some distance toward convincing many people of the nature of this infectious disease outbreak.Some astute readers may observe that it is obvious that not wearing masks, not adhering to physical distancing and spending extended periods of time in confined spaces has resulted in these infections. I agree, but that does not directly answer the key question of how our president has been compromised by being infected with the coronavirus. Whom did it come from and when Who had they been in contact with And so on.This whole scenario I have outlined sounds like something out of a Ludlum, le Carré or Clancy novel. Honestly, the most parsimonious explanation is that those infected did not wear masks or physically distance and gathered in crowded groups that included infected individuals with no ill intentions but who were shedding virus. The current response by the White House and Congress is simply disappointing. What this whole situation illuminates for all Americans to see is how unwilling our nation’s top leaders have been to perform the most basic infectious disease mitigation steps — wearing masks, physically distancing and avoiding gatherings in confined spaces. Importantly, it also reveals how ill-prepared even our nation’s top leaders are to deal with such a crisis — they have no concrete plan.Here in Minnesota, we have many people who were potentially exposed, including three members of Congress, state political leaders and regular citizens who have attended Trump events recently. But even in Minnesota, home of the Mayo Clinic, the University of Minnesota and a highly competent state Department of Health, there isn’t a plan to systematically perform viral WGS on all potential positive individuals who attended Trump events or were in contact with him. Instead, some of those potentially exposed are quarantining and maybe getting tested. Some have tested negative once and may or may not get tested again. There does not seem to be a coordinated plan between the Minnesota Department of Health and the White House or other federal agencies that we know of. In fact, the White House announced it will not contact trace those potentially infected.One might argue that this will all sort itself out. OK, fair enough, but shouldn’t there at least be some thought given to establishing a protocol to address this sort of thing in the future Shouldn’t there be a science-based plan, with discrete protocols, that creates a greater level of security for the office of the president, thus ensuring our national security is not compromisedCongress must act immediately to establish a commission to study this crisis and formulate appropriate future responses to similar situations. Further, these recommendations must be rooted in the best available science. Sadly, I am not optimistic this will happen because it would require a bipartisan effort and both sides are currently unwilling to work together. Still, I hope the Minnesota congressional delegation will consider proposing that a commission be established to study this matter.Matt Beckman, Ph.D., is an associate professor of biology at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, where he teaches genetics.

minnpost_2020_129,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Unlike many Minnesotans, I was not surprised when I saw a Minneapolis police officer acting with violence that resulted in an intentional homicide. Two decades of service as a Minnesota appellate judge has taught me that the Minneapolis Police Department harbors one of Minnesota’s most dysfunctional police forces. I observed this type of behavior in several Minneapolis criminal cases that came before our court. I anticipated I would see it again.I reviewed Minneapolis criminal cases with a heightened level of scrutiny in an effort to sort out improper conduct. I found that many Minneapolis police officers routinely acted unprofessionally and with impunity. They often used their power and authority in an arbitrary and capricious manner and exhibited racial bias. Excessive force was used with little fear of any consequence. This statement may seem unduly harsh. It is not. There is much evidence to support this judgment. Some of this evidence can be found in Supreme Court opinions I have written.Minneapolis police have a history of bad behavior, especially when they interact with persons of color. They inordinately focus on communities of color, often with respect to status offenses and low-level drug offenses. When interacting with persons of color there is a pattern of elevated levels of engagement and violence that lead to an arrest and enhanced criminal charges. Excessive force is used when it lacks justification. Police reports I read indicate officers have been schooled on how to write reports to cover up or justify bad behavior.These policies and practices foster unwarranted assumptions and a policy of making quick arrests, putting persons in custody and taking them “downtown” with the premise that others will sort things out at the courthouse. A large number of arrests of persons of color, especially young males, results in a dismissal without any charge. This policy has a devastating impact. Having an arrest on one’s record can have collateral consequences for employment, housing, and educational opportunities. This problem and other problems are not problems caused by just a few bad apples; parts of the whole tree are diseased. Systemic reform is long overdue.Unfortunately, many reports of bad police behavior are ignored, dismissed or suppressed. Some persons, including myself, have spoken out on this issue, but we have not done so with enough force and volume to overcome the forces and culture surrounding a police community that has stymied efforts to address this issue. The police want their transgressions kept quiet or minimized. For the most part they have succeeded.The good news is there are leaders in the city and the police department who see the need for reform and are committed to seeing that it happens. The tough question is how it will get done. The bad news is that past efforts to reform have been stymied by an embedded culture that defends the status quo. This culture gets much support from a union that is adept at using existing laws, policies and practices to protect current policies and practices. Some citizens and “civic groups” have been nurtured by the police and the union to assist them in this effort. These forces still exist and are robust. They will need to be dealt with in a forthright and firm manner.Among the reforms that are needed are the arbitration of police misconduct, police union leadership and residency. Too few Minneapolis police officers live in the city. The vast majority of officers come to the city to work and retreat to the suburbs when their shift ends. There is a need for officers who are more directly invested in the city; otherwise it can easily be viewed as an alien occupying force similar to the police in Ferguson, Missouri, or our troops charged with keeping the peace in Iraq and Afghanistan.Under the current system of arbitration, it is almost impossible to discipline or terminate an officer for bad behavior. The police union and its minions have gained control over this system and have manipulated it to protect police officers who should be disciplined or terminated. One of my greatest frustrations on the court was an inability to properly review and reverse arbitration cases when they were clearly wrong. Astute observers have for many years written about this problem. The Legislature must address the arbitration issue.The police union is a major part of the police accountability problem. The union is good at protecting the worst of the worst. Many parties have pointed out the union’s dysfunctional role. At least two former chiefs of police have told the current chief he has lost control to the union. The chief, elected officials and citizens need to be empowered to regain control of the department. For this to happen, the power of the union must be curtailed. Much of the union reform must come from the current members of the police force, the majority of whom are good, conscientious officers who want to do the right thing. These good officers must come to understand that current union policies and practices protect a systemic culture of bad behavior, hurt them, and put their best interests at risk. Job protection and an attitude ofbut for the grace of our God go Iare part of the rationale lying behind support for the union. This view is flawed.Gov. Tim Walz has shown leadership by initiating a review of the Minneapolis police activity. This review will find that much needs to be changed. The courts also need to be more involved. We have a good Minnesota Supreme Court. Yet, as a former member of that court, I know it can do much better. The court’s 1993 Racial Bias Task Force report identified many problems, some of which have been addressed, like bail reform, better court interpreters and better education of judges. But the report is woefully out of date. Former Justice Alan Page and I worked very hard to get a follow-up report off the ground, but for reasons I will not get into here, it was not done. Current efforts are diluted and lack sufficient resources to do the job. The court needs to create a new task force with an expanded mandate that includes review of police practices. The court needs to act quickly to design an action plan and implement it.Being a peace officer is a tough job, made all the more difficult by our lax attitude toward guns and a willingness to ignore mental health problems that cause many people to act erratically and unpredictably when they interact with the police. The police are on the front lines when dealing with these social problems. Our society must act to reduce these aggravating circumstances. In the near term, this is the environment we must live with. It does not make a tough situation any better when we protect police misconduct.A larger issue has been much on my mind of late, an issue that needs to be addressed by those of us who are members of the current majority class of Americans — white America. People like me are an essential part of any solution. We must work to level the playing field in America so that all citizens are treated equally, irrespective of the color of their skin, national origin or gender. Our founders believed thatthe pursuit of happinessrequires our government to provide the maximum opportunity for the maximum number of our citizens to achieve happiness. Recent events have shown that we have failed to fulfill this mandate.Currently we are not a happy society. Many of us have done too little to find remedies that work. But there is hope and optimism that given the current dynamic, especially among our younger citizens, change will happen.We need to engage in the type of introspection that looks into the depths of our souls and the soul of our country. We need to seek a better understanding and appreciation of who we are as a people and a country and that we share a common humanity irrespective of skin color, creed or ethnic origin. We must commit ourselves to making a more just society, a safer society where we have trust and confidence in those we empower to keep us safe. Topursue happiness,we need a society where every mother and father can go to bed at night without worrying about the safety of their children at the hands of the police.That society does not exist today, but the potential for real change is in the air. If we commit ourselves to work together to make it happen, it will happen.Paul H. Anderson is a retired justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court."
hawaiitribune_herald_2020_39,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Americans should feel no more gratitude for President Donald Trump’s eleventh hour decision to sign the $900 billion pandemic relief measure than they might have for a vandal’s choice not to spray paint graffiti on their walls. The president’s behavior merely conforms to what might pass as normalcy.Americans should feel no more gratitude for President Donald Trump’s eleventh hour decision to sign the $900 billion pandemic relief measure than they might have for a vandal’s choice not to spray paint graffiti on their walls. The president’s behavior merely conforms to what might pass as normalcy.To not sign it would have been not only catastrophic for the most vulnerable among us who depend on $600 stimulus checks, the extension of unemployment benefits and the federal ban on evictions, but would have set back the distribution of vaccines and the goal of keeping open schools and public transit systems, and preserving small businesses.But threatening to walk away from it after Congress already passed it. This was not the conduct of a president seeking to change public policy, it was the sort of thing one finds on reality TV shows. That he spent recent days not on the phone urging members of Congress to change course but playing golf at his Florida resort reveals all one needs to know about the seriousness of purpose here.We know the counterclaims made by supporters. They’ll point to the “pork” in the pandemic relief bill which doesn’t actually exist (the $1.4 billion government funding measure is the one with that and the two were merged for purposes of legislative action , or the president’s desire for $2,000 checks instead of $600 checks in direct aid. But even allowing for that, the chief complaint about foreign aid conforms to Trump administration budget requests.Quite often, aid to other countries isn’t a denial of U.S. interests, it’s a cost-effective way to protect them. How much cheaper to protect human rights, spare allies from invasion or preserve trade partnerships than to withdraw support and risk a cataclysm that might require far more costly military intervention? Foreign aid isn’t counter to the administration’s “America First” approach; often, it’s a fulfillment of it. But then any opportunity to perceive people living outside U.S. borders as “other” or something not quite human is rarely a problem for Trump supporters.As for the larger stimulus checks, Trump’s beef is with members of his own political party. Again, why wasn’t he working them hard weeks or even months ago when the House Democrats passed a more generous level of aid and Senate Republicans balked? His last-minute desire to mail out four-figure benefits reeks of Trump attention-seeking, not leadership, not even discernible political strategy.Once Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, one imagines GOP senators will have even less reason to give ground. Whether something can happen between now and the Georgia U.S. Senate runoff election on Jan. 5 seems unlikely. And while it’s certainly been entertaining watching the two incumbent Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, support Trump’s every relief bill move like hostages suffering from Stockholm syndrome now smitten by their captor, it’s still hard to believe that, if re-elected, they’ll challenge Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on this issue.If Americans have any gratitude to give, it ought to be for the fact that these days of turmoil for turmoil’s sake are thankfully coming to a close.— The Baltimore Sun"
minnpost_2020_19,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .During this Life in a Time of Pandemic, with many staying home because of lost jobs, fearfully going to jobs deemed essential because of the essential need to earn money, worrying about whether to send kids to school, or frantically hoping hospitals might allow goodbyes to dying relatives, I’ve wondered if people have thought of the Joni Mitchell song “Big Yellow Taxi.” Specifically, the verses of “Don’t it always seem to go. That you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.”I’ve thought about these words quite a bit these past six months, as I’ve been dang lucky enough thus far to not have many worries and to be able to dream about pleasant things like going to movie theaters. And maybe even watching national political conventions. Maybe.As one who served as a political appointee in the Clinton administration, I’ve always watched the balloon-soaked blowouts that dominate television every four years. Even though I wasn’t alivewhen a convention last provided real candidate selection suspense,I still watch conventions, if only to see how stupid or intelligent each major party thinks their base, or the whole of the American populace, is.This year’s conventions, with their reliance on virus prevention distance, no costumed delegates and little awkward live applause for speakers who can’t command a crowd despite other skills/resources, have actually shown me that I didn’t know what I had regarding these events until the old way of doing them went away. Of course,a virtual event doesn’t deliver most of the economic benefits a city can derive from hosting a convention. And that’s an enormous loss. Although it still delivers speakers who don’t belong anywhere near television cameras. But without the deafening arena noise and that really awkward applause, I found I’ve been learning more this year about what each party might be trying to achieve, in scripted television land and in the ballot count. I don’t think I was alone in thinking this way. And I’m adding my name to the list of Republicans and Democrats who thoughtthe way the Democrats did the nominating roll call, with its Flight Across America and its Mostly Ordinary Citizens,should become the norm for every party. No matter how much bigwigs from West Something or New Other want to pack a microphone to scream the counts and the state’s agricultural prowess.Still, though I have liked this year’s distanced, recorded conventions, I couldn’t help but think about so many other facets of our lives in which we might not have known what we had (much less appreciated until a deadly virus sent them gone. Or vastly changed. Things we might want back and others we can leave behind or modify, as we did the conventions. For instance, things that might be better done for some in pandemic-influenced style, such as working from home for those who can, far from cities with high living costs. Things such as the aforementioned movie theaters when a must-see alien invasion film hits, even though movies-on-demand with homemade popcorn may be cheaper and more suited to the wearing of pajamas.Then there are things like bustling restaurants, where people such as my 88-year-old mother (who already didn’t get out too much pre-pandemic could chat with favorite servers and fellow diners about blueberry pancakes and overly strict adult children. I think about people who, Before Coronavirus, were best kept as acquaintances or even frenemies. Distanced times have nixed those forced lunches and may just keep such encounters confined to Facebook. But then there are the people we really want to see, in cyberspace if we must, but in person if we can manage it. As my mother’s overly strict full-time caregiver, I counted the days these past several years until my brother arrived to provide one week of what my mother called “vacation” care so I could go to Ottawa to see honorary nieces and their parents who are generous hosts providing ample supplies of fine Canadian food and drink and bemusement of my American peculiarities.And on the matter of missing personal contact, this Milwaukee native who likes a virtual convention was nevertheless heartbroken to see my hometown lose an opportunity during the Democratic National Convention to show the nation it offers much more than the Fonz orthe Kuh-Napp Street of “Laverne and Shirley” fame. When you feel safe to travel again and indulge in real personal contact, go to Milwaukee’sMazos’ Hamburgers, owned by a high school classmate of mine. It’s nearly as famous as Milwaukee’s beer, motorcycles, or even itsrenowned Milwaukee Public MuseumandMilwaukee County Zoo.May all of us soon get back much of what is now gone and which we miss. Whether we knew it gone or not. Whether we will appreciate it once we have it back or not.That includes traditional political conventions.Mary Stanik, a writer and public-relations professional, recently moved from St. Paul to Arizona.She is the author of the novel “Life Erupted.”"
suffolknewsherald_2020_12,"Published 4:38 pm Tuesday, August 18, 2020ByStaff ReportsOne of the most Christ-like things the American church can do is step up when people are hurting.And hurting they are these days. By now, everyone has had their lives upended by the COVID-19 pandemic for more than five months. Many people know someone who has been sickened or who has died from the new illness. Many have lost their jobs or had their income reduced through temporary furloughs, fewer tips and commissions and the like. People are worried and anxious about so many things — what school will look like this year, what they would do if they were to become ill, perhaps even how they can go about getting back into the workforce at this unprecedented time.However, a couple of local churches stepped up this weekend to provide help in their own unique ways, and we want to use this space to give them special recognition for their obedience to work in the community the way they have been called to do.The Mount Suffolk held a gas giveaway at three gas stations on Godwin Boulevard. The first 40 cars in line got $20 worth of gas as well as a ticket for a free meal at nearby fast-food restaurants. The occupants of additional vehicles received just the free meals, and everyone got a goody bag with encouraging items. Children also received backpacks.Also Saturday, Open Door Church held a clothing giveaway for local families. Even though Suffolk’s public schools won’t be returning to in-person learning this September, local children are still growing and in need of new clothes, and as the giveaway includes clothing for adults as well, it could help those who need new items to wear to work or to interviews.Both churches have done these events pre-pandemic. The Mount held a scaled-down gas giveaway last year. Open Door Church has been doing the clothing giveaway for eight years now. But the fact that they maintained and even improved upon these events in the midst of the pandemic because they felt it was important that they continue is to be lauded.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

Dornstein, who went on to become a documentarian, plunged himself into the facts of the case — zeroing in on Mas’ud and discovering that he was being detained in a Libyan prison.The urgent imperative now is extraditing Mas’ud here to face swift and sure justice. The two men who earlier stood trial for the murders — in the Netherlands, under Scottish law — escaped full punishment. One was acquitted. The other, Abdelbasset Al-Megrahi, was convicted in 2001, then in 2009 shamefully granted compassionate release before his death in 2012.Last week marked the end of Barr’s second act leading the DOJ. To say the least, he has not always behaved honorably in the position.

The deadline is Sept. 30, and it’s not too late to self-respond if you haven’t already.Getting an accurate census count is of great urgency, even — and perhaps especially — during a time when we are dealing with numerous other issues as a nation.

That’s a good number, but we have one month to get that number to 100%. Your self-response can help.According to the Census Bureau, data from the census informs federal funding for more than 100 programs, including school lunches, highway construction, housing and lots more.There are lots of state- and local-level decisions made using census data, as well. The results show where communities need new schools, new clinics, new roads, and more services for families, older adults and children, the Census Bureau website states. For example, an area composed mostly of older adults may not need a playground but could use a senior center.Many people know data from the census is used to determine how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives, and where those districts are drawn.

All three bills take effect on Jan. 1, 2022.The combined approach of giving an extension to residential developers for the time lost during this pandemic before implementing a tax on their projects, while also slightly reducing the property tax benefit for commercial developers, is a fair and balanced policy decision.» READ MORE:City Council approves Philly construction tax and changes to property tax abatement in busy year-end sessionThe Building Industry Association of Philadelphia (BIA — an 80-plus-year-old association of mostly residential developers of which I am president — did not come to support the 1% DIT without careful analysis. Opponents suggest the tax will reduce the amount of new housing built, and therefore increase the cost of housing, which they contend will outweigh its intended benefit to fund the development of more affordable housing. By our math, for a typical residential development project, the 1% DIT will represent closer to a half-percent increase in total project cost, which we believe will be offset by a needed adjustment to the cost of land that the market will provide. Land values have risen in Philadelphia far beyond any economic equilibrium, and a meager 3% reduction would offset the cost of the tax.The 10-year tax abatement, however, remains a critical incentive for residential and commercial real estate developers to shoulder the risks associated with real estate development and to continue to generate city revenue and jobs, as wells as housing — both market-rate and affordable. While many have called for its repeal, no credible analysis can refute the very positive net economic benefit that the tax abatement has brought to Philadelphia over the past 20 years. Even after the abatement is curtailed starting in January 2022, it will provide a meaningful and needed tax incentive benefiting residents citywide.» READ MORE:Philly’s failure to end the 10-year tax abatement is no victory to fight poverty | Solomon JonesAlthough it is generally not viewed as good tax policy to implement a new tax during severe economic downturns such as the one currently upon us, the deficit of quality affordable housing in Philadelphia is extreme. The Philadelphia Housing Authority alone has more than 60,000 people on its waiting list, which is not surprising in a city that suffers from a persistently high poverty rate of around 25%. Other previously proposed policy interventions that are meant to help solve this shortage, such as mandatory inclusionary zoning that would require a percentage of affordable units in every development proposal, would make many projects unfeasible and generate less housing for those in greatest need.We acknowledge it is unusual for developers to step forward and ask to pay more, and we do not do so with enthusiasm. But it is only through thoughtful and balanced policies that the power of the free market can be paired up with government intervention to try and tackle the housing problem in Philadelphia. The BIA is sincere in its desire to be part of the solution. The DIT, along with the continuance of the tax abatement for residential construction, is a better option than other alternatives and will have a huge impact where it is needed the most.Leo Addimando is the president of the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia."
minnpost_2020_191,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The case incidence of the deadly COVID-19 virus among white people is 746 per 100,000 residents, according to State of Minnesota data. Among Black Minnesotans, the rate is more than five times higher – or 4,016 per 100,000 residents. Unfortunately, these kinds of racial disparities in health outcomes exist throughout the continuum of health care.We must do better. That means health care organizations need to build deep, meaningful partnerships with communities of color to truly understand the issues and needs facing these communities. They need to expand access to health education, disease prevention measures, and health care.The idea of “doing with, not to” – in other words, acting in partnership with local groups to better serve our communities – is at the heart of M Health Fairview’s community advancement effort. M Health Fairview has a longstanding partnership with Minnesota’s East African community, particularly in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. We continually collaborate with community members and groups.More good news is happening. M Health Fairview and its Health Commons partners, Augsburg University, East Africa Health Project and People’s Center Clinics & Services, are opening an expanded and enhanced “Health Commons” space in the Riverside Plaza complex. The Health Commons has been a valued community asset for many years, and the new space will provide further opportunities to partner with community members to improve health and well-being. The Health Commons will include clinical space and feature a full-time Somali-speaking community nurse to coordinate care and make health-improving referrals to various community organizations. Sherman Associates owns and manages the Riverside Plaza and is generously donating the space for this important community use.The space will also feature mental health and addiction services, in the form of a peer support specialist and care coordinator. Additionally, it will provide access to telehealth resources, where members of the community can get many medical needs served via an online computer-enabled “virtual visit” with a doctor or nurse.After the COVID-19 pandemic ends and gathering in larger groups subsequently becomes safe again, the Health Commons also will continue to offer its health-related classes and other programs, as well as an outdoor gathering space for the community to use. Many of these programs have transitioned to a virtual format over the last few months. The main Health Commons space is not yet completed and will be co-designed with Health Commons participants and community members.There is always more work that we can and must do to improve the health of the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and many of the communities we serve. We know that the pandemic has been a particularly difficult time for all COVID-19 patients. Because of the extremely high risk of spreading the deadly virus to other vulnerable people, these patients haven’t been able to have their families present with them during treatments in our hospitals and clinics. We understand that approach, while necessary for the health of our communities, has been extremely confusing and frustrating to many.Though protecting patients, families, and caregivers from infection is a medical must, we have received many constructive suggestions from the community about how we can better work with families during the pandemic. This includes making video calls more frequently available to families, and regularly updating families on their loved ones’ health status. As a health care organization, M Health Fairview is dedicated to emerging from this pandemic a truly better organization. To help us get there, we welcome your input.M Health Fairview is continually seeking to improve our patient experience and provide accessible, affordable health care for everyone in our communities. We’re proud of our efforts to provide culturally sensitive care to Minnesota’s immigrant communities, particularly those who we recognize have been disproportionately affected by lack of access to the care they need. With community input, we’re dedicated to doing better to eliminate health disparities once and for all.Nawal Hirsi is the engagement manager of Community Advancement, M Health Fairview."
suffolknewsherald_2020_45,"Published 9:24 pm Friday, July 17, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Geoff PayneSuffolk is rapidly growing, and this has many positive and negative effects on our quality of life. One casualty that you may not be aware of is the deteriorating health of the Nansemond River and its tributaries.It may alarm you to know that the bacteria count in much of the river after a major rainfall is well in excess of federal standards for safe recreational use. How many of your family members or friends swim or fish or boat in the river?The Nansemond River runs 20 miles from downtown Suffolk to where it meets the James River. Major tributaries include Bennett’s Creek and Chuckatuck Creek. A hundred years ago, the river was not much more than an open sewer. Direct sewage disposal, poor septic tanks, slaughterhouses and meat packing plants, and poor farming practices all contributed to dangerous bacteria levels.The river was first closed for oyster harvesting in 1929. For the next 80 years, the water quality in the river slowly improved as public health policies along with city enforcement addressed each of these problems. The oyster beds were largely reopened.However, in the last 20 years, the city has grown rapidly, and as a result we have seen river conditions begin to deteriorate again.Increasing bacteria levels caused the State to impose new shellfish harvesting restrictions in 2014, 2017 and 2019. The full closures and conditional closures are impacting Suffolk’s oyster harvesting industry. Citizens can view the closed areas at www.vdh.virginia.gov/ENVIRONMENTAL-HEALTH/SHELLFISH-CLOSURE-AND-SHORELINE-SURVEY-DOCUMENTS.The Nansemond River Preservation Alliance, using standards accepted throughout the Chesapeake Bay, gives the Nansemond River an F grade for water quality based on bacterial counts. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and Virginia Department of Health Division of Shellfish Safety report the bacterial source as non-point source — not from one specific source. This means we all contribute to the problem to a larger or lesser extent.Suspended solids do a couple of harmful things. First, they provide bacteria with a surface on which to live and breed. Second, they prevent sunlight penetrating the water. Less sunlight means less growth of aquatic vegetation, essential for the health of a river. NRPA asked a Suffolk waterman who has been harvesting crabs in the Nansemond for more than 40 years to survey the river for any weed growth on the River bottom. He found none. This is not a sign of a healthy river.The suspended solids settle to the River bottom and add to the suffocating mud we are all familiar with. If you dig down into the mud you should find all sorts of critters: worms, mollusks, larvae. Last September, NRPA sampled the river bottom in five different locations, but did not find anything living in the sediment. There are still plenty of fish, shrimp and crabs above the mud, but nothing in it. NRPA contacted a local professor who conducts scientific studies in this area. He reported that 70% of the samples they have taken in the river have depleted levels of the “critters” in the mud.The Nansemond River watershed is almost entirely with the Suffolk city limits, so we cannot blame anyone else for the condition of the river. There are not any obvious major polluters that we can go after. The problem is every one of us. Everyone contributes to a greater or lesser extent to the pollution in the river.NRPA asks everyone to avoid using excess fertilizer and to take steps to avoid any run off. Respect the riparian buffer and replant with native trees and shrubs to minimize stormwater runoff from your land into the storm drains, ditches or waterways. This applies to all property owners, not just those with waterfront property.Please join NRPA and other environmental organizations that are leading the effort to educate citizens to be environmental stewards and also change the status quo on regulations. All of these factors make the NRPA’s work crucial to the health of the Nansemond River watershed.Information about our local waterways, NRPA’s projects and activities, and ways for you to Make A Difference can be found at:www.NansemondRiverPreservationAlliance.orgor CleanMyRiver.com.Geoff Payne is chair of the Water Quality Committee and a board member of the Nansemond River Preservation Alliance.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_111,"Published 9:53 pm Friday, May 29, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Elizabeth TaraskiAt Ruritan and Rotary fundraising events, they are steamed and then poured on the table. At restaurants, they are often displayed on a crushed bed of ice. Whatever the preparation, the amazing oyster may have been from the Nansemond River.These plump, sumptuous mollusks have been harvested from the river for hundreds of years. You probably consume them because they are low in calories and high in protein, vitamins and minerals. Mother Nature has another purpose for the Virginia native eastern oyster, known by its scientific name, Crassostrea virginica.These flavorful menu items are a vital part of the ecosystem, filtering excess nutrients and pollutants out of the water. They live in reefs that protect shorelines and provide habitats for hundreds of marine species such as blue crabs, barnacles, mussels, spot and striped bass.An adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water per day when water temperatures are above 50 degrees Fahrenheit. They work earnestly removing particulate algae and sediment from the water at a rate of 2-3 gallons per hour. No wonder it takes a pull of more than 20 pounds to open the shell of a 3- to 4-inch oyster in good condition — they have an important job!Baby oysters are spat and usually mature in one year. There is no way of telling male oysters from females by simply looking at them. While oysters have separate sexes, they may change sex one or more times during their life span. They are protandric, which means that in the first year they spawn as males, but as they grow larger and develop more energy reserves in the next two to three years, they spawn as females. An increase in water temperature triggers male oysters to release sperm and females to release eggs into the water. This begins a chain reaction of spawning which clouds the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster produces 10 to 100 million eggs annually. When water temperatures fall over the winter, oysters cease to feed. The oysters stop filtering and seldom open their shells.Oysters are divas and only thrive if the conditions are just right — correct water salinity range, a minimum water depth, adequate amounts of dissolved oxygen and adequate amounts of plankton. The salinity of the water will influence the growth rate of your oysters and whether they may become exposed to oyster-specific diseases. Salinity is measured in grams of salt per liter of water, or parts per thousand. Oysters require a salinity of at least 8 ppt to grow, and oyster growth increases with increased salinity. Below 10 ppt salinity, oyster growth rates are generally reduced; some oysters show intermediate growth rates at salinities between 10-20 ppt and highest growth rates at high salinities more than 20 ppt. Oyster leased grounds along the Nansemond River are regulated by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Oysters are most prevalent from the Route 125 up to the James River. Oysters are not found near Constant’s Wharf, where the salinity levels are negligible.So the next time you attend an oyster roast or prepare an oyster dinner at home, take three seconds to acknowledge the significant role the delectable meaty critter has in helping our river.Nansemond River Preservation Alliance has been serving the city of Suffolk since 2010 by educating and encouraging all citizens to be environmental stewards and work to protect the river, creeks and their tributaries.

minnpost_2020_35,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As I look back on this year, I recognize that our city hasn’t stopped hurting. Minneapolis has experienced an unprecedented amount of trauma. We started the year trying to survive through a historic and global pandemic. Later, we suffered the inhumane loss of the life of George Floyd. The deep pain and grief caused by the killing of Floyd, tugging on centuries old patterns of state violence, remains an open wound in our city today. After this loss, came the burning. On its own, the swift destruction ofla Calle Lakeis worth a sea of tears. Now, imagine how the people of Lake Street feel when this incident goes unnamed in over 14 hours of a public hearing.As a city leader, I’m aware that City Council members are treated as the layer of government that is expected to hold this collective trauma. I believe that our position also calls on us to register the different ways that this trauma plays out in the daily lives of the diverse people who call Minneapolis home. I don’t seek to judge these diverse experiences; I do find myself pulled in to understand them.I believe that seeking to understand how these injustices and inequalities are being lived out in myriad ways in the lives of every Minneapolitan is important because, as an organizer, I understand the value of meeting each other where we are. When I can better understand how an issue that I care about impacts you, it allows me to learn how to build a more inclusive path toward repairing the systemic harms that have been done. Through the process of repairing we can begin to heal. In healing, our community can find more moments of strength and togetherness. We will need this resilience to survive the next set of challenges.I trust the healing power of being heard and coming together. One way that I as a council member can demonstrate that I am aware, listening, and working to help bring people together is by integrating our city’s diverse voices into our budget. On Wednesday night, working together through the night and through the differences being echoed throughout our city, the council approved a $1.5 billion budget that meets residents where they are and advances us toward healing and racial justice. The Minneapolis budget has series of key racial equity investments proposed by Mayor Jacob Frey such as $5.5 million dollars for the Commercial Property Redevelopment fund and a $300,000 fund to work toward reconciliation, economic inclusion, and transformational racial healing which will help the area where the Third Precinct burned down and support 38th and Chicago. We also approved the mayor’s proposed $375,000 in capital improvements for the 38th and Chicago intersection and supported a projected $4.75 million from 2021 to 2023 for establishing a memorial for George Floyd.Yet this public safety budget vote is dwarfed by the momentous task ahead of us – how do we bring our city together outside of the mechanics of a single budget vote Representing the city’s most racially integrated ward means that I am invited to see, hear, and feel the different ways this year’s trauma and violence is showing up in diverse spaces. The dissonance is too much to pretend that there’s a one-size-fits-all solution, and normalizing or ignoring the rise in gun violence in our city is unhealthy. While we continue to move forward to reimagine and rebuild our public safety systems, I think it’s important that we step out of press conferences and protests to ensure that we’re taking the time to meet each other where we are. When we do this, we can better understand how to build a more inclusive and resilient movement.It is through this reaching out that we can demonstrate the end doesn’t justify the means. In this deeply complex moment where violence and safety are in a daily dual and communities of color pay the price, what should not matter most is how fast you can make it to the finish line. What matters most is that we give enough care and attention to ensure the diverse communities of our city make it there together.Alondra Canorepresents the Ninth Ward on the Minneapolis City Council."

President Donald Trump says it wasn’t, certifying that it was.Trump hasn’t seen it all as a terribly big deal despite worries about possibly disastrous results for the military, the economy and hundreds of other matters, not the least of it being exactly how our government goes about functioning with Russia tuned in to everything.The FBI is investigating and President-elect Joe Biden is planning to strike back. Although some say it could take years to set things right, he is getting set for sensitive negotiations on various topics and Russia has so far not done anything destructive to the computers.The federal government, which has fruitlessly spent billions to prevent this kind of thing, has itself engaged in cyberattacks to do some spying; in Iran, a cyberattack helped halt weapons development. The government finally learned what was happening through private high-tech outfits that serve us and learned themselves through Russia hitting them.This cyberattack was not new except in magnitude. We all know about Russians hacking Democratic emails, of course, and, in 2015, the Chinese were able to capture personal information, including Social Security card numbers, on 21.5 million federal employees. President Barack Obama didn’t want to get into a big fuss over this, but did say he was going to quit staying at the New York Waldorf Astoria, which was purchased by the Chinese a year earlier.It’s not necessarily governments that pull off these shenanigans. Sometimes its independent criminals. But it appears to have been the Chinese government that hacked 500 million guests at Marriott hotels around the world a couple of years ago for whatever reason. And also during the Obama administration, Russia actually hacked White House emails, including some sent and received by Obama.The Center for Strategic & International Studies lists more than 100 significant cyberattacks around the world in just this year alone. They involved such countries as Iran, Vietnam, Israel, North Korea, Bahrain, Austria, Turkey, Japan, Italy, Germany, Australia, India, Pakistan, Taiwan, Ukraine, New Zealand and Norway.By the word “significant,” the center means such incidents as six-months of spying on the German Parliament.I used the word “war” in the first paragraph, and yes, what we have here is cyber combat in which a nation in some way binds up, hurts and conceivably even destroys a perceived enemy. While there’s an international agreement that no one will respond to a cyberattack with a military attack, cyberattacks or other ways of interfering seriously with computer networks can be as serious as military attacks.Consider for a moment how China has been developing its space capacities, recently landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. Suppose that someday it destroyed all of our satellites, not that hard. Our society is hugely dependent on satellite communications and the consequences could amount to a kind of shutdown with no quick fix.We need to have a quick fix just as we need vastly improved cyberattack defenses and effective cyberattack offenses.Jay Ambrose is an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service.

minnpost_2020_105,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The use of tear gases for crowd control is rampant, but there exists a significant gap in our knowledge about the effects of these chemicals on an individual’s health, particularly in the long-term. The unknown long-term effects of tear gas exposure warrant cessation of their use until thorough and extensive safety studies have been completed. The use of these agents during the COVID-19 pandemic makes them especially dangerous.Despite the prevalence of their use,little researchhas been done on their long-term effects, and what research has been done does not unequivocally demonstrate that tear gases are safe. Inone studyof 93 individuals exposed to tear gas, 24.7% experienced coughing and phlegm for more than three months afterward. More than a third experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath in the year following their exposure. Ina 2012 study, military recruits were briefly exposed to tear gas during a training on the proper use of gas masks. Even in that controlled setting, recruits were 2.44 times more likely to contract a respiratory illness in the week following the training than they were in the week leading up to the drill. Another study from Turkey found that men exposed to tear gas were atgreater riskfor chronic bronchitis.Even the reported data is not widely generalizable. Only a few studies examine real exposures (i.e. protestors in a crowd rather than volunteers in a controlled research setting. Additionally, most of the research looks at young, healthy volunteers. Other more at-risk populations have beenlargelyignored. There is no research at all studying the effects of pepper spray exposure onpregnant womenand fetuses. A 2003 Department of Justice report concluded that pepper spray contributed to twoin-custody deaths, both involving people with asthma. COVID-19 patients often reporttrouble breathing, and COVID-19 deaths are often due to respiratory complications. In the middle of a respiratory pandemic, it should be assumed that all individuals have compromised respiratory systems, and deploying aerosolized riot control agents whose long-term effects have not been studied is irresponsible.Using chemicals with uncertain long-term effects on crowds would not be advisable in the best of times, but is especially risky during a pandemic that affects the respiratory system. It is past time to investigate the possible long-lasting effects of tear gas exposure and prohibit its use domestically until research demonstrates unequivocally that it is safe.Jennifer Brown, Carey Lyons and Roman Tyshynsky are three graduate students at the University of Minnesota. The turmoil of recent weeks prompted them to use their researching skills on a topic with direct community impact. They hope this piece will be a launching point for larger discussions about the ethics of tear gas use and potential policy changes."

Timothy sat next to me, moving a small, plastic, bendable snake across his lap.The snake made its way up one leg, down the other, and curled into a spiral before reversing course. Soon he held the snake above his head, zooming it across the sky. I did not want him to distract those around him, so I guided his arms gently downwards as I whispered to him, telling him to keep the snake below the top of the seat. He did well during the speech, and he understood a lot of what the speaker was trying to convey.It can be difficult for children to sit through a speech or event that is geared toward adults. It can also be difficult for adults to know how active they should allow children to be during these times. I’ve seen many adults handle children in situations like this in many different ways.Some adults use children’s ages, as well as the possibility of ADD or ADHD, as an excuse to allow children to disrupt anything or to misbehave continually. They allow kids to get away with all sorts of behavior in the names of understanding and enlightenment.Others take the exact opposite approach, being extremely stern, declaring that kids of all ages “should know better.” They believe that kids should be able to sit quietly for long periods. They make no allowance for the biological makeup of children or consider the difficulties that come with legitimate cases of ADD or ADHD.I’ve learned that neither of these approaches is great. These all-or-nothing attitudes almost always lead to frustration for adults and kids alike.Adults must understand that children, especially younger ones, are not biologically meant to sit still for long periods of time. It’s just not the way they are programmed! Children not sitting still for an extended period isn’t always due to bad behavior. It’s simply the way their minds and bodies work. Adults must consider a child’s nature when children are asked to sit still and be quiet for extended periods.On the other hand, children should not be allowed to disrupt continually or be disrespectful to those around them. It is important that they learn how to remain quiet or relatively still when it is needed.Adults must be willing to learn the difference between children being children and children being disrespectful or disobedient. This can take some discernment and the willingness to learn a child’s nature as well as their ability to remain quiet, listen or sit still. It’s the responsibility of the adult to learn the difference. As you learn, you will be able to tell the difference between restlessness and misbehavior.There are many tricks to help children who need to remain seated or quiet for a while, such as allowing them to bring small toys, a coloring book or activity sheets that can help them stay active but quiet.All the tricks in the book, however, will not help if we take an all or nothing approach. We must understand the nature of children while still holding them accountable for their behavior.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_62,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial from theMankato Free Press.This was where he came in.John Lewis rose to prominence almost 60 years ago as one of the youngest leaders of the civil rights movement. He was an original Freedom Rider. He founded the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee. He was the youngest of the “Big Six” civil rights leaders who organized the touchstone 1963 March on Washington.And he was the leader of the “Bloody Sunday” march on Selma, Alabama, in 1965. The savage beating Lewis took from the state police that day in March fractured his skull and left physical scars still visible a half-century later. It also galvanized public opinion nationally and helped push the Voting Rights Act into law.Lewis, 80, died July 17 during another period of unrest over racism, on a weekend in which militarized federal agents sought to suppress Black Lives Matter protesters in Oregon. The shift in public opinion on systemic racism in weeks since the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police mimics the shift that followed Lewis’ beating by the Alabama troopers.History repeats itself. A battle once won may still have to be refought.And that is certainly the case with the Voting Rights Act. Lewis, who served more than 30 years in Congress, shepherded the most recent reauthorization of that landmark law through Congress in 2006 only to see it gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. In a majority opinion that was either naive or malevolent, Chief Justice John Roberts held that electoral racism was a relic of the past.Virtually as soon as the preclearance section of the act was struck down, jurisdictions that had been required to clear voting law changes with the Justice Department predictably began imposing restrictions designed to suppress minority voters and turnout: photo ID requirements, closed polling places, purged registrations. Voters in Lewis’ home state of Georgia this year endured 6-hour waits to vote.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement upon Lewis’ death: “He endured hatred and violence. But he kept working, because he was convinced that our nation had to be better.”That sentiment is 14-karat nothing. McConnell and his Republican majority have buried a reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, passed by the House in December, for months. Passing that reauthorization is the tribute Lewis deserves.Republished with permission."

Just days before the lockdown, I thought of asking if our Wednesday night church supper crowd could begin staying for prayer.I don’t know of many others calling a community together specifically for prayer, but Mr. Epps sent my thoughts traveling back to the 1940s, when prayer was the most important thing on the minds of almost everyone. There were enormous world problems that needed to be solved. People were praying. Church doors remained open 24/7 for prayer. We knew our country was in trouble and needed Someone greater than ourselves to help us. Mr. Epps having “only about 12” with him to stand and pray reminded me Jesus had only 12, and they accomplished great things.Many great works have gotten a start with the ideas of one person or a small group. I hope Mr. Epps’ idea will open the hearts and minds of others who understand our complex problems are too great to solve by ourselves. We need the Creator God and His wisdom. He will supply if we ask. I hope this inspired idea will create the desire for a designated prayer time in which communities stop everything and pray. If we do not ask God’s help we may find ourselves desperate, only to hear His voice at the end, “You didn’t ask for My help.” He is the only One Who can heal and completely change us. He can give us a new purpose for living.A study of what Paul the apostle wrote to the Roman Christians is a good reminder. He wrote there is none righteous, not a single person. “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (3:23 . He said there is a price that must be paid for that, “The wages of sin is death…” (6:23 . Thankfully, after reminding us how helpless we really are, he wrote 8:28, an oft-quoted message of hope, “All things work together for good to them who love God…” We don’t love God unless we are willing to get our lives on the right track. Confession for sin always begins the process of finding what God desires of us. Mr. Epps understood prayer and sharing a fast will prepare our hearts for how God can help us work out our problems for unity.I pray God’s special blessing on Mr. Epps’ life and ministry. We need godly leadership. He has lit the lamp. I hope it will not go out but be the torch for hundreds of others to follow his leading. There is a God Who rules on earth as well as in Heaven. When He hears our prayers of confession, He will answer.Myrtle Virginia Thompson is a retired missionary, educator, Bible teacher and writer.

I was able to continue working abroad for a few more years, but a 2017 trip to the hospital showed me it was time to move back home.Since then, I’ve noticed that a better, more coordinated system is needed to help dialysis patients. Even when I had a care coordinator, I found the system never really worked for me. Whether it was managing medications, doctors’ appointments or even my attempts to get a kidney transplant, I always had to control the process myself.That’s why dialysis patients in Virginia need Representative Elaine Luria and our other members of Congress to support a new bill called the BETTER Kidney Care Act. It would improve coordinated care for patients and make it easier for doctors to work together, taking a lot of the burden off of us.Having to do as much legwork on care coordination as I have can leave dialysis patients, who often cannot speak up for themselves, feeling helpless and prevent them from getting the level of attention and care they need.

minnpost_2020_152,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .If it seems like extreme weather disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires are becoming more frequent, severe and costly, it’s because they are. And that trend is influencing people’s movements.Since 1980, the United States has experienced 258 “billion-dollar weather and climate disasters” – defined as disasters resulting in $1 billion or more in economic losses – totaling $1.75 trillion in losses, according to theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About two-thirds of these disasters and three-quarters of these losses have occurred since the early to mid-2000s.Natural disasters forcemillions of people to move every year, a trend which isexpected to acceleratearound the worlddue to a changing climate. This is true in the United States as well.Social scientists like me have seen thisalready occurringin the U.S.Using a combination of data sources, research shows that, while there are many factors at play, extreme weather disasters are one of the reasons that people migrate to other parts of the United States. An increase in extreme weather events could mean that disaster-driven migration will become more frequent. One early example is“Dust Bowl migration”from the U.S. Great Plains during the mid-1930s. Due to a combination of factors including, but not limited to, severe multi-year drought, social erosion and economic hardship,an estimated 2.5 million people migrated from Great Plains states to Californiaand elsewhere in search of economic opportunities.More recent was the fallout from Hurricane Maria. In astudy my colleagues and I published earlier this year, we found that migration from Puerto Rico increased considerably following Hurricane Maria in 2017 and that only about 12% to 13% of people who left the island had returned some two years later.There are many limitations to the data available from theU.S. Census and other commonly used administrative and survey sourcesfor studying migration, includingduring and after extreme weather disasters. In our case, we were able to overlay migration data from theFederal Reserve Bank of New York/Equifax Consumer Credit PanelonU.S. census tracts, which crudely approximate neighborhoods, to track the movements of people after Hurricane Maria.Apart from specific examples, what does the research show about how hurricanes and other extreme weather disasters are affecting whether and where people move Past and current research on extreme weather disasters and migration points to three key points.First, there is no automatic relationship between extreme weather disasters and migration. The reason that extreme weather disasters lead and will increasingly lead to migration is that the people, populations and places involved arevulnerableto the hazards associated with these disasters – high winds, storm surge and flooding – in the first place.Second, people of lower socioeconomic means are more vulnerable to extreme weather events. The resources required to cope with and adapt to extreme weather disasters are not evenly distributed. This means that people, populations and places are differentially vulnerable to the hazards associated with extreme weather disasters depending on their socioeconomic status.For example, one of themany lessons learned from Hurricane Katrinain 2005 was that the capacity of residents in New Orleans and other affected areas to cope with and adapt to this disaster strongly differed byrace, socioeconomic status and other factors. Another and more general way to say this is thatinequalitytoday matters a great deal for the ability to cope with and adapt to extreme weather disasters tomorrow.Third, those most vulnerable to extreme weather disasters are in a double bind. People and populations at the very bottom rungs of society are the most vulnerable to extreme weather disasters; they also have the least capacity to adapt by migrating out of disaster-prone or disaster-affected areas.The research literature refers to these people and populations as effectivelytrapped in place, a predicament which raises a number of serious concerns about thepotential for large-scale humanitarian emergencies.A recentWorld Bank reportforecasts that by 2050 some 143 million people worldwide could be forced to migrate within their countries due to extreme weather disasters and climate change. Adding the number of people who will potentiallycross international bordersmeans this figure is likely to be far higher.The increasing frequency, severity and costs of extreme weather disasters, as well as theirinherently social character, suggest a number of continued and important steps going forward to better understand how extreme weather disasters are affecting and will continue to affect people’s movements.First, researchers from different disciplines, includingboth the natural and social sciences, need to collaborate to better understand the scope of and solutions to the problem.Second, as a migration scholar, I share the concerns of my colleagues about theavailability, quality and comparability of migration data, particularly data on migration during and after extreme weather disasters and on highly vulnerable people and populations. Perhaps as it has with the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Census Bureau might experiment withnew data collection strategiesin this area.Finally, having attended theParis climate talksas an official observer in 2015, I see a strong need to “embed the social sciences” in discussions and debates, policies and interventions pertaining to extreme weather disasters and climate change more broadly.Jack DeWaard, Ph.D., is an associate professor of sociology at theUniversity of Minnesota.This articleis republished fromThe Conversation."
hawaiitribune_herald_2020_42,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Rebekah Jones in her office at the Florida Department of Health. (Courtesy Rebekah Jones/TNS If Gov. Ron DeSantis’ minions had meant to dramatize how badly he has failed the people of Florida in the face of COVID-19, they couldn’t have done it more effectively than by their Tuesday morning raid on the home of whistleblower Rebekah Jones in Tallahassee.If Gov. Ron DeSantis’ minions had meant to dramatize how badly he has failed the people of Florida in the face of COVID-19, they couldn’t have done it more effectively than by their Tuesday morning raid on the home of whistleblower Rebekah Jones in Tallahassee.They flashed their sidearms at her, her husband and two small children.A holstered weapon can’t harm anyone. The risk soars when it is drawn. That was a disgrace to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where someone apparently deserves to be fired.FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen’s explanation asserted that Jones refused for 20 minutes to answer the door and hung up on agents when they called.No matter. The guns are what matter. The crime at issue, if there was one, was a nonviolent unauthorized posting on a state messaging computer.Nitpicking at the facts, Swearingen says guns weren’t pointed at anybody. But they were out of their holsters and, in one scene captured on Jones’ home video system, a weapon was pointed up the staircase while an agent ordered her husband and children to come down.As Ron Filipkowski, a Sarasota attorney and former prosecutor, aptly denounced it, “That’s Gestapo. That’s authoritarian tactics. That’s not America.”Considering the source, it’s criticism the governor would be foolish to ignore. Filipkowski is a lifelong Republican and former state and federal prosecutor whom DeSantis reappointed to the Judicial Nominating Commission for the 12th Circuit last year. On hearing of the armed raid, he resigned the post, writing to the governor’s general counsel that he had been “increasingly alarmed” by DeSantis’ passive response to COVID-19, and “no longer wish to serve the current government of Florida in any capacity.”The alleged third-degree felony for which agents had a warrant to seize Jones’ computer was a hack into a Department of Health messaging website.She was a data scientist at the department before being fired this summer for what DeSantis claimed was insubordination. Jones said it was because she refused to manipulate COVID-19 data in order to minimize the danger. She then set up her own dashboard to give the public contrasting, if unofficial, data on the epidemic.Officially, Florida has reported nearly 20,000 deaths. Jones says that seriously undercounts fatalities probably caused by COVID-19 but not confirmed.By seizing her computer, smartphone and flash drives, the raid put her dashboard out of action and potentially exposed the identity of every state employee who ever contacted her.What was the “crime” to justify that?According to the FDLE’s search warrant affidavit, a hack into the Health Department’s messaging system last month posted this message: “It’s time to speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it’s too late.”Jones denies she posted that. The governor’s spokesman denies that DeSantis knew in advance about the warrant or the raid. The courts will have to sort out all the denials.But the raid could hardly have done more to spotlight the DeSantis administration’s mishandling of the epidemic, or to validate the investigative report that the Sun Sentinel published just five days earlier under the headline “Secrecy and Spin.”Reporters Mario Ariza, David Fleshler and Cindy Krischer Goodman disclosed that DeSantis’ Department of Health ordered county-level spokespersons to stop issuing public statements about COVID-19 until after the election. The administration withheld details about Florida’s first cases and then denied the reality of community spread. It took the threat of legal action to disgorge data about cases in schools, prisons, hospitals and nursing homes.To this day, DeSantis refuses to let Broward County and other local governments levy fines against people who violate their local face-masking mandates.The governor’s minimalist approach to the deadliest health threat in a hundred years mirrors that of President Donald Trump, whose endorsement transformed a little-known congressman into the governor of the nation’s third-largest state.Among the many details in “Secrecy and Spin,” perhaps the most disconcerting is how the DeSantis administration manipulated and muzzled Florida’s decentralized health system. The state employees working as county-level spokespersons were told to issue no news releases or social media posts about COVID-19. The order was attributed to Alberto Moscoso, who was the department’s communications director before resigning on Nov. 6. He won’t talk about it.Another conspicuous failure was the governor’s indifference to the University of Florida’s Emerging Pathogens Institute, which the Legislature established 14 years ago precisely for such contingencies as COVID-19.One of the unwritten rules of politics is to not make a whistleblower the issue. Another is to deal candidly with health emergencies. The DeSantis administration has ignored both.Even if Jones did hack the website, Filipkowski wrote to the governor’s office, “I would still call her a hero.”In a newspaper interview, he accused the administration of “using police to silence a truth teller.”Whether DeSantis knew of the raid is irrelevant to the fact that he is ultimately responsible for it, not to mention the entire issue of his having acted like Trump’s puppet in playing down the coronavirus. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., reacted Wednesday with a statement saying she is “exploring various federal-level investigative options.” A congressional hearing ought to be one of them.By coincidence, FDLE Commissioner Swearingen is on the agenda this Tuesday, Dec. 15, for a routine report to the governor and Cabinet, who comprise his governing board. DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody and Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis will probably not want to talk about the raid. Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only Democrat, mustn’t let them ignore it.— South Florida Sun Sentinel"
eugeneweekly_2020_33,"We ve got issues. Isat on the top bunk of my 8-by-10 cell, a 62-year-old man with heart disease, anemia, worried of possibly having cancer and with COVID-19 in the air. I was the definition of “vulnerable population.” Yes, I am serving a life sentence here, but I don’t want to die. The prison still wasn’t handing out masks or sanitizer. There was no social distancing. I ripped off some disinfectant from my jobsite in the metal shop and used it to wipe down my cell twice a day. I made my own mask out of material found in respirators used in the grinding room, until my brother told me the carbon fibers in it could cause lung damage. I made one out of cloth material. I did my best to avoid people. I stopped going to the chow hall, instead subsisting on canteen food I had in my cell: dehydrated beans and rice, potato chips and cheese, peanuts, oatmeal and raisins. When the prison finally started to take the virus seriously, they shut down the visiting room, club activities, chapel services and all programs run by outside volunteers. They started providing masks but didn’t make wearing them mandatory. Most inmates didn’t wear them. Neither did most of the staff. They put spray bottles of disinfectant by the phones in the buildings but not yard phones. The rags provided were used again and again. The phones were elbows apart from each other, with few inmates wearing masks. Whenever I got off, I headed straight back to the cell, scrubbed my hands and face and climbed back on the bunk. The first reported case at Oregon State Penitentiary was in April, an employee. He worked in the housing unit, so everyone was put under quarantine. The men in the unit were kept separate from the rest of the general population. They could not work, ate last and had separate yard periods. Although we were kept separated from the rest of the population, we were still allowed to mingle in the unit at the card tables, TV room, exercise area and crowd the phone booths. I still had to worry about my cellmate who didn’t take the virus seriously. After the unit went into quarantine, the nurses began coming around asking people if they wanted to be tested for the virus. Everyone knew that if they were found positive, they would be sent to the segregation unit where all COVID cases from other institutions were being housed. I didn’t want to be tested for fear of the outcome but chose to because of my being one of the vulnerable population. Ten of us took the test. We were told it would take three days for the results to return. For three days, I sweated the outcome. On the third day, the nurses came back into the unit and had individuals roll up their property. They were heading to the segregation unit. I was not one of them. But the virus was in the unit. The nurses came around asking people how they felt and if they wanted their temperature checked. At first, I had mine checked until I realized that if I were found with a temperature, I would be sent to the segregation unit. So I told them I was fine and didn’t need it checked and not to bother me anymore. On Memorial Day, I started feeling sick. My chest hurt like I was having a heart attack. I had a pounding headache. My eyes burned, and I had a runny nose. I was worn out. I did not want to self-report, knowing the possible outcome. But the symptoms grew worse. I informed the block officer and was sent to medical. The nurse checked my vitals, which were normal. I figured I would be sent back to the unit. But instead I was put in isolation to be tested for the virus, where I would stay until the results came back. I asked if I could go back to my cell to get some of my property: toothbrush, toothpaste, coffee, canteen, a cup, address book and envelopes, TV to name a few. The watch commander said “no.” In the isolation cell, the lights were already off, but I could make out the wool blankets, and a one-inch plastic mattress on the concrete sleeping slab. The officer said there weren’t any pillows, so he gave me an extra blanket. I was so physically exhausted from months of trying to avoid the virus that I crawled on top of the plastic mattress, covered my head with the blankets and went to sleep. At 5:30 am, the light above the concrete sleeping slab startled me awake. It was bright; I had no way to turn it off. I sat up on the edge of the slab and looked around the cell. The walls were covered with graffiti and dried food. There was a stainless steel toilet and sink encased in concrete and a roll of toilet paper and a paper cup. The food slot tray opened. It contained a plastic bag with a bowl of cereal, hard boiled egg, a piece of coffee cake, two packets of sugar and coffee. Passing out the bags was Officer Ruby. I asked her if I could get the property from my cell and make a telephone call. She said she’d check into it. A few hours later, she was back passing out lunches. I asked again about my personal property and a phone call. She said she was working on the property, but there was only one phone in the unit. It was being used upstairs for those who tested positive for the virus, and they didn’t want to cross-contaminate it. Wipe the damn thing down, I replied. A few minutes later, the captain showed up at my cell. “I hear you are giving my staff grief,” he said. “Am I being punished? I asked. “No you’re not,” he said. “Then why can’t I get my personal property or make a phone call?” He wanted to know if I had sent him an inmate communication requesting one. I laughed and said, “Do you see anything in here to write with?” That evening I got a couple of books in the mail. Officer Ruby brought me a plastic cup, a toothbrush and baking soda. I distracted myself with reading until the lights went out. The next day a cordless phone was brought to me and I was able to call my wife, Donna. That afternoon, an officer delivered five bags of property: food, a TV, books, clothes, a guitar, soap, shampoo and toothpaste. The first morning in isolation, the COVID-19 test was administered. Every day afterward the nurse checked my temperature and asked how I was feeling. I was still sick, but refused to admit it. I just wanted out of isolation. On the third day, a nurse and officer came on the tier with the results. They walked past my cell and told someone down the tier they were negative to roll up their property. They were being sent back to general population. A few hours later they were back. Again, they walked past my cell. Again they told someone else down the tier to roll up. Now I was sure I had the virus. A few minutes later, the officer came back by himself and said, “Jimmie, roll up.” “Where am I going?” I asked. “You’re going back to general population.” I walked back to my unit determined to not go through this experience again. I am a 62-year-old man with heart disease, anemia, and a fear of cancer who is living in a COVID-19 petri dish. But I am in my cell. I am home. Jimmie, a lifer at Oregon State Penitentiary and a member of Lauren Kessler’s Lifers Writing Group, has been in prison for 40 years."

minnpost_2020_74,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the owner and operator of 36 Lyn Refuel Station in Minneapolis, I have made supporting my local neighborhood a priority. This unprecedented pandemic has only strengthened our resolve to remain a resource for our community, particularly for emergency workers, who need access to fuel and food often during non-traditional hours. Unfortunately, despite following national and state orders, and putting in place extra precautions to ensure the safety of our employees and customers, we, like other essential businesses, are now at additional risk of being sued.Over the past 15 years, 36 Lyn Refuel Station has made it a priority to provide healthy food options to our customers, and the cheapest gas in town. We also spend a lot of time and resources to find and train outstanding employees who care about the customers we serve. Through our consistent efforts and quality of service, we have established ourselves as the go-to place for those in the neighborhood.Once the pandemic struck, the Department of Homeland Security designated convenience stores as a part of thecritical infrastructure workforce, encouraging us to maintain our work schedule and remain open.And we were ready to rise to the challenge and remained committed to staying open during this crisis. We knew our community still needed us to provide food, medical supplies and other services like fuel or access to an ATM. So we took the needed steps to protect the health of our employees and customers, including conducting extra cleanings, sanitizing our store, and putting in place other safety measures like requiring our employees to wear gloves and face masks.I appreciate that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walzrecognizedthe honorable sacrifices of our front-line retail employees, issuing an executive order classifying these workers as emergency employees, which means they qualify for child care for school-age children.We, like many other essential businesses, have faced financial as well as logistical challenges during this pandemic. Fewer people on the road means fewer customers stopping by for fuel, leading to a decrease in revenue. Despite these challenges, we have remained open and ready to serve our community.But now, like other essential businesses, we may face unfounded civil lawsuits because of the coronavirus pandemic. This is despite all the precautions we have taken to protect workers and customers, and after being encouraged to stay open as a part of the critical infrastructure workforce. This threat is especially disappointing because many businesses have remained open more to provide a public good than for economic reasons and are now being unfairly targeted during this crisis.For any business that has acted irresponsibly, victims should have recourse to pursue legal actions. But it is unfair for businesses that have made every effort to implement safety protocols and provide necessary protections during this crisis to face unwarranted litigation.Essential businesses that have done the right thing during this pandemic deserve reasonable protections from frivolous lawsuits. Because if not, businesses like mine risk having to close our doors for good, adding to the already ballooning unemployment figures and depriving our community of access to critical goods, fuel and other services.Thankfully, Congress can take action to provide reasonable liability protection for essential businesses. And my home-state Sen. Amy Klobuchar is in a unique position to help provide these protections given her role on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I hope Klobuchar and her colleagues on the committee will show their support for essential businesses and pass common-sense liability protections.My business provides a safe space for the neighborhood — clean bathrooms and a place where people can stop by and ask for directions, in addition to accessing critical supplies. If Congress does not take action, we might not be able to continue providing the same support our community has come to rely on.Lonnie McQuirter is the owner and operator of 36 Lyn Refuel Station in Minneapolis."
minnpost_2020_6,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Over the past few months, since George Floyd’s homicide, there has been debate around defunding the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD . While I now reside in Minneapolis, my roots are in small town, rural Minnesota, where I was born and raised. Over the past few months, I have noticed many folks from Greater Minnesota decrying the notion of defunding the police on social media. They are suggesting that folks from the Twin Cities who support this idea are anti-American or hate the police. I find these claims to be specious and not based in fact. A recent poll of Minneapolis voters conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling indicates there is broad support in Minneapolis for police reform, including some level of reallocation of funding of the MPD; yet thereis not majority support for abolishing the police.Given the controversy that calls to defund the MPD has elicited, we owe it to ourselves as Minnesotans to look more broadly at state funding of police departments in metropolitan areas and Greater Minnesota over the past 20 years.In the early 2000s, during the governorship of Tim Pawlenty,local government aid (LGA was drastically reduced(state aid was reduced by 47% from 2002 to 2008 . This led to lower levels of funding for community resources in large cities and small towns in Greater Minnesota. While many towns spent more to staff their fire, rescue and police forces, less money was allocated to many municipalities by the state. Mayors and city officials in small towns and major cities wereblamed for their overspending by GOP leaders.Towns were further hampered in their revenue raising efforts byGov Pawlenty-led “levy limits”which prevented tax increases sufficient to offset cuts in LGA, though there were “exceptions” for police and fire.Nevertheless, the impact of deep LGA cuts ran deep into city budgets and ultimately affected essential services.Today, at least 17 small towns (probably more in Greater Minnesota do not have their own police department. Who really initiated this decrease in LGA that contributed to the defunding of Police Departments in many towns in Greater Minnesota The Republican senators, representatives and governor led the cuts to LGA under the guise of small government. Unfortunately, the GOP-led cuts in LGAhave had a lasting and negative impact, but perhaps therecent DFL-led efforts to restore LGAwill provide a needed boost for police departments and fire and rescue services in Greater Minnesota.So the next time you hear someone vilifying the “evil, liberal Twin Cities residents” for their supposed anti-American police defunding (when we are really just calling for long overdue and necessary police reforms let them know that the Minnesota GOP initiated and carried out a systematic defunding of police departments in Greater Minnesota in the early 2000s.I will be frank, I am sick of hearing Minnesota GOP politicians vilify us in Minneapolis for wanting police reform while they say they “Back the Blue” and claim to stand for “law and order.” Their past actions to defund the police through a systematic reduction in LGA and the lasting impact of these actions tell a different story. We know Minnesota GOP politicians are the original defunders of the police.Matt Beckman is a resident of Minneapolis. The views expressed here are his own."
eugeneweekly_2020_25,"We ve got issues. Ididn’t go to the recent Black Lives Matter protests because it’s hard to march against police brutality with the same people who have said I look like a slave. While this might be a shock to some, I’ve become unfazed by the weaponization of my own race against me, and even more so with the good intentions of white people who ignore their culpability. The earliest memory I have of being racially targeted was on my first day of preschool, when a white boy told me something along the lines of, “You don’t belong here and you should go back to Africa.” Two months earlier, we moved houses because in the southern Oregon town we had lived in, a parent at my sister’s kindergarten threatened to lynch her. I share all of this to show that although it is more common to hear about “microaggressions,” which aren’t always as micro as they’re often described, more conspicuous versions of racism are still pervasive throughout Eugene. What I’ve observed, and to our detriment, is that these cases are almost always excused from our conversations on race because people here are so “chill.” That being said, the greatest attack I’ve felt on my Blackness has come in the form of well-intentioned allies. As a Black person trying to avoid racial harassment here in Oregon, you learn quickly what conversations to avoid with people. You learn the right amount of humor and elusiveness to employ when your skin color is uncomfortably called out. You learn to try a little harder at everything in an attempt to avoid stereotypes. You learn how to contort your identity to fit into a place that so ignorantly refuses to hold space for us. And for me it’s worked. I found that if I was just the right amount of reserved, polite and funny, more often than not, white people were nice to me. All of a sudden, they’d stop seeing my race, they’d assume my perspective on issues would be the same as theirs, and they’d start telling me I wasn’t likethoseBlack people — which, to be clear, are all subtle ways in which my Blackness would be painfully eroded away until I was palatable for Eugene’s public audience. This is what happens in spaces where one’s identity is the overwhelming minority, such as Eugene, which has a Black population of 1.6 percent and a white population of 83.3 percent as of 2019, according to the Census Bureau. Many Black people here, in socializing with the majority, risk having their identities contorted to fit into a rigid, limiting and often stereotypical box. This is not to say that minority identities can never be preserved, but rather that a prolonged effort from our white community members would be required to create space for others to show up with their whole selves. In other words, attending rallies is important but not enough to address the unique issues on race which exist here in Eugene. In addition to the protests, I encourage those who want to be a part of the solution to stop trying to force Black people to become what you think they should be by either distilling their Blackness or by projecting your preconceptions onto them. More tangibly, this looks like dismantling our internalized stereotypes through reading and self-education (and certainly not depending on the labor of Black people in educating you .

He got cases of liquor on that same card and even bought a surfboard and bicycle equipment.When asked why he did not use his personal credit card, he notoriously said he did not have a personal credit card.Kenoi destroyed my belief in honesty in county government. Dredging him up to give a speech as a new administration takes office does nothing to rehabilitate him, in my mind.What it does do is to cause me to wonder what I might expect from Henricks and the new administration.Gerry BaldwinHiloOff to a bad startI had to read it twice, because I couldn’t believe it.Ex-Mayor Billy Kenoi is giving the opening speech at the inauguration of Mayor-elect Mitch Roth (Tribune-Herald, Dec. 2 ?!What a terrible way to kick off a new administration.

I don’t have a problem with the latter, but I do have a problem with a singular county action that crossed the line.This was when county manpower and equipment, which is taxpayer funded, was used to lay and grade an aggregate material pad on the lava rock for the benefit of only the protesters.This not only broke state environmental laws, but also inappropriately used taxpayer funds for the sole benefit of one group.I strongly believe the focus of the ethics complaint should be narrowed to investigate who approved the use of county funds to do this work.These individuals should be held accountable for their actions.Aaron SteneKailua-KonaMahalo, policePer the Tribune-Herald’s Big Island Report arrest log, between June 2 and Dec. 2, within a six months period, there were approximately 2,281 persons arrested here on the Big Island, from warrants, to DUIs, to serious felony cases.What is also interesting to note, is many of the same names appear over and over for other crimes committed.Kudos to the men and women of the Hawaii Police Department and to other law enforcement agencies here for keeping us safe.And to those of you who complain about law enforcement officers not doing their jobs: 2,281 arrests in six months — not too shabby!Rick LaMontagneHilo"

It’syoung people, engaged in risky behavior and convinced of our infallibility. When did we become so comfortable living in this zone of moral hypocrisyThis summer, we saw a national uprising against racism begin here in Minnesota. We’ve lived through a mass reckoning with sexual violence against women and seen community power rethink andreclaim public safety. We’ve also witnessed an ever-widening chasm of economic inequality, seen the power of social media to both build and break communities, and fought endlessly with our parents and grandparents about the issues we desperately want them to care about.We are the generation that promises to bring change. We are the generation that wants healthcare that works for everyone. We want a justice system that lives up to its name. We demand fewer band-aids and more effective solutions.However, until this pandemic is controlled,educational gapswill continue to widen andbillionaireswill continue to profit.Food insecurity,homelessnessanddomestic violencewill continue to rise. The fight to end COVIDisa fight for justice.Ending COVID won’t be as straightforward as sharing an infographic about wealth inequality on Instagram or showing up to protest police brutality, as so many of us did this summer.It’s going to be hard, fatiguing,dailywork. We have to take it upon ourselves to ensure the safety of our community.No politicians are going to save us. The power to bring change and build a better world lies with the people.Young people must do better because we know that exemplifying COVID-safe behaviors has never just been about protecting ourselves. We do it because we understand that our communities’ most vulnerable members, especially those with no social protection, are most at risk for this deadly disease. We do it because we know that even with the exciting recent results from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca some people will havebetter accessto vaccines than others. We do it because we recognize that people who work in bars and restaurants are not doing so because they feel safe, but because that paycheck is their lifeline. Spare them a visit during their shift, and directly pay them instead. The$30 millionraised for the Minnesota Freedom Fund tells us that the money is there.Other cities told us what this moment would look like: ICU beds full and health professionals risking their lives to help more patients than they can manage. And yet, we continued our reckless behavior. Does our fight for justice end when it requires us to make personal sacrificesEven after the governor’s four-week mandate expires, we must continually ask ourselves if our behavior is in the interest of public health. Breweries and brunch will be there for us when this pandemic is finally over. But if we continue down this path, many of our community members may not.We’ve lost many of them already; let us not be responsible for any more harm. I still believe that our generation has the courage to not accept our circumstances as inevitable. We dare dream bigger. So let’s be the generation we say we are. Let’s be the generation to end COVID.Aditi Kulkarni is a first-year medical student at the University of Minnesota.

minnpost_2020_23,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On April 6, St. Therese of New Hope became one of the first long-term care facilities in Minnesota to have a positive COVID-19 case in our resident population. The following weeks were the most trying and devastating in our 52-year history as our dedicated staff worked as quickly as possible to protect more than 100 residents from the ravages of this disease. While many residents who contracted COVID-19 did recover, tragically, this unpredictable virus moved rapidly, and we did lose some of our residents.Once at the front end of the COVID-19 outbreak curve, St. Therese is now leading on the back end of the curve. We are encouraged to see the infection and mortality rates of long-term care residents declining significantly across Minnesota. There have been zero new cases of COVID-19 at St. Therese since the end of May.Recent studies and analysis by Harvard University, Brown University and the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care confirm that large scale, independent long-term care facilities with older populations, similar to St. Therese, are disproportionally more susceptible to a wide-scale COVID outbreak due to lack of private space and personal protection equipment and staffing resources. Their findings are in line with the challenges we faced in early April, with limited access to testing and supplies, and staffing and space restrictions.This new research also affirms that the actions St. Therese took in April and May effectively stopped the spread of the coronavirus across our population.First, we cohorted residents, creating a physical separation between those who had contracted the virus and those who had not. Thanks to the Minnesota National Guard, St. Therese was one of the first congregate care settings to start testing all residents and employees.Our campus’ physical space created a significant barrier to quickly responding to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our current residential model of two residents to a room and four residents sharing a bathroom is not an effective set-up to keep seniors safe from COVID-19 or any other airborne infectious disease. Several years prior to COVID-19, we applied for a moratorium from the State of Minnesota to rebuild our care center in a way that would offer more individual rooms and private spaces for residents to be better protected in a pandemic or widespread health outbreak. Our initial request was not approved by the state but we will continue to seek this moratorium so that our campus, and other older, larger nursing and assisted living facilities across our state, can more effectively and safely protect the hundreds of senior Minnesotans entrusted in our care.Our staff has truly been an Army of Angels over the past three months. Early on, we established three different levels of essential workers and rotated through these levels as staff themselves became ill. It was all-hands-on deck for our staff and they were all-in to care for our residents. Assistant nurses, rehab nurses working as nursing assistants, and then social workers all trained and worked on the floors.Now our attention turns to resuming normal activities as safely as possible. Our residents miss their families and loved ones, and the lack of regular visits and socializing can have a detrimental psychosocial effect. We are pleased that under the state’s new guidelines, we are able to welcome essential caregivers and visitors for longer appointment visits. With temperature screenings and PPE usage for visitors and residents, we are able to create a safe space that can allow family members and residents to enjoy each other’s company once again.We know that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, but through planning and implementing the right protections and safety measures, we can help stop the spread and continue to provide professional, compassionate and loving care to keep our beloved senior Minnesotans safe.BarbaraRode is the executive director of Saint Therese of New Hope."

We don’t think spiders fly, but this “web designer” seems to be able to fly across the landscape, somehow attaching a line from one side of the yard to the other.Scientists have studied those powerful strands but still know little about them. The Creator God must have had a purpose for spiders. Job, Solomon and Isaiah all mention them. We know them as predators of insects that become trapped in their web, unable to get out of their clutches, ready to be devoured.I admit to feeling something of a comparison with our present virus situation. We are experiencing the entanglement from an enzyme of infinitesimal size. It has changed our whole world. In contrast with the millions of people who live on planet earth, it has affected comparatively few, but it was able to bring down all of us. America, the land of the free and the home of the brave, is no longer the country we knew when we began this current decade. There is no turning back to what we were like just one year ago. We are not free today. Our lives may not have been static, but now we feel the ground under our feet is shaking.

I don’t recall any time in the past when the demand for adherence to a strict code of rules and conduct governed our every movement.

So how do we run the obstacle course and win the race when we are confronted with stormy winds and unsettled conditions? How do we conquer anxiety and find peace?In times like these, I go to the Psalms for guidance. There are so many in which we can find verses that speak to our need.Psalms 27, 33, 38, 60 are some of those. Psalm 44:22 speaks to me of our human condition. Perhaps we should be crying out to God like the psalmist did in verse 22: “Rise up and help us, save us because of Your unfailing Love.”One of my favorites is Psalm 37:25, “I have been young and now I am old, but never have I seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread.” I have lived by faith in God’s supply and found the God Who created this world and all that is in it was already present in my time of need.He will be there when we agree to living by His rules and acknowledge our need for His help.Myrtle Virginia Thompson, 92, is a retired missionary, educator, Bible teacher and writer.

I have many I will no longer be part of.My favorite party and politicians have changed in a bad way. The party increasingly supports later stages of abortion. I began voting in 1972. For years, my vote supporting abortion was for what was called “the removal of an unviable piece of tissue,” limited to the first trimester. This is no longer true.In New York and Virginia, full term abortion is now allowed. New York politicians gave a standing ovation when they changed the law to include full-term abortion. They stood up and cheered the destruction of a full-term baby. Democrat politicians have failed us. They need to learn this. Only the voting booth can change them to reflect us.Our governor, here in Virginia, refuses to even answer the letters I have written to him about his comment, “We will be sure to take the baby aside and make it comfortable while we discuss the situation with the mother,” referring to a fully developed live birth. I guess he feels he can ignore the choice he made about full term abortion. I will no longer raise my hand to God declaring my support.

minnpost_2020_113,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial fromThe Timberjayof Ely/Tower/Cook, Minnesota.What has long been an unspoken rule about how taconite funds are allocated on the Iron Range became explicit recently when the legislators on the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board blocked a funding request from the Fond du Lac Band for a project to make drinkable water available to residents of two small, rural communities within the reservation boundaries.Given the direct connection to public health, it was no surprise that the IRRR staff had ranked the project highly and agency staff deserve credit for their efforts to defend the project against the politically motivated criticism from members of the agency’s advisory board.At issue, as Sen. Tom Bakk made explicit, was that the Fond du Lac Band, in his view, was “anti-mining,” and that was the sole litmus test in his mind for whether the funding could be approved. It was inconsistent, he claimed, for a governmental body to be opposed to mining yet accept tax dollars received from the mining industry.Sen. Bakk should have thought a bit deeper. For one, while it’s true that taconite production tax dollars come from mining, they are in lieu of property taxes. We suspect most Minnesotans, probably even on the Iron Range, are unaware of the fact that mining companies don’t pay property taxes for the hundreds of thousands of acres of mine land that they own. Instead, the Legislature allows them to pay only a tax on actual ore production, so they don’t incur significant tax obligations during shutdowns or after closure of a mine. If the mining companies paid property taxes like the rest of us, the money would go into the same giant hopper as everyone else’s tax dollars, and Sen. Bakk’s argument would vanish into the ether since there would be no distinguishing between a dollar paid by a mining company versus a cabin owner, a local restaurant, or a wilderness outfitter.The arrangement has also given the mining industry tremendous political power in the region, which they have wielded willingly through the influence of Iron Range legislators and their longtime tenure on the IRRR board, where they’ve overseen the distribution of tens of millions of those mining tax dollars annually to area communities.Over the decades that we’ve covered the deliberations of local units of government, we have heard local politicians more than once cite the cudgel of IRRR dollars as reason they have to toe the Iron Range delegation’s line on various issues, but most particularly on the subject of mining and mining pollution. The delegation’s power has diminished in recent years as the board has been limited to an advisory role at the IRRR, but as they demonstrated recently, they can still throw a wrench in the gears when they feel the need.Without doubt, the board’s action is contrary to the principles of a government that operates fairly and with due process for all of its citizens. It’s a violation of the same overarching principle that has prompted millions of people to march in the streets in recent weeks to protest the lack of fairness or due process for African Americans in this country. That this most recent IRRR board action was targeted against Native Americans, another minority group that has suffered from bias and discrimination in America, only highlights the tone-deaf nature of Iron Range legislators. At a minimum, they have forgotten the very foundation of representative and constitutional government, which is the imperative to serve all the people equally, not just those who are willing to comply with the political views of those in power.Finally, the actions of the board reveal the degree to which Iron Range politicians are willing to brand anyone who expresses concern about the negative impacts of mining on the environment as “anti-mining.” That’s neither fair nor accurate. Many, if not most, people who oppose sulfide-based copper-nickel mining in northeastern Minnesota are not opposed to taconite mining. But that’s a distinction that Iron Range politicians refuse to acknowledge because it makes it easier to vilify those with concerns of any nature, about any mine. Even those who simply advocate for the clean-up of existing mine pollution or suggest that Minnesota should actually start enforcing its supposedly impressive environmental regulations on the Iron Range, is quickly branded an anti-mining heretic who must be shunned, boycotted, or denied equal access to government funding.The only question is: How much longer is the Iron Range willing to prostrate its political process before the altar of the mining industry Really. How much longerRepublished with permission."

Internally, State Department morale has been described as at an all-time low after the destructive tenures of Rex Tillerson and Mike Pompeo.Blinken also clearly has the confidence of Biden. World leaders will know he speaks for the president, which will help him act on the president-elect’s pledges to rejoin the Paris climate accord, the World Health Organization and, if the conditions are conducive, the Iran nuclear deal.Also joining Biden’s team will be Linda Thomas-Greenfield as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (her post will be rightfully restored to Cabinet status, so she’ll also sit on the National Security Council .Biden’s national security adviser will be Jake Sullivan, who served in various national security and diplomatic roles during the Obama administration.Alejandro Mayorkas will be the first person of Hispanic descent to lead Homeland Security, Avril Haines will be the first woman to be director of national intelligence and former Secretary of State John Kerry will serve as a special presidential envoy on climate, a top presidential priority.The seasoned team will soon realize the seasons have changed since they served in previous administrations, Tom Hanson, a former Foreign Service officer who is now diplomat-in-residence at the University of Minnesota Duluth, told an editorial writer.“It’s a balance of back to a familiar team in Washington, but knowing it is a different situation now,” Hanson said.Effectively addressing multiple global crises will require U.S. leadership The opportunity costs of the wrongly delayed transition, which is now finally beginning, should spur the Senate to act with dispatch and decency in the confirmation process.The stakes are too high for the election gridlock in 2020 to extend to governance in 2021.— Star Tribune (Minneapolis"
minnpost_2020_164,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Early in the lockdown, my 10-year-old daughter learned how to use a sewing machine by watching YouTube videos. Before her school began offering live virtual instruction in September, she spent a good deal of time in the basement making pillows, handbags and other articles of clothing. She was supposed to be completing worksheets and other assignments, but I took a hands-off approach because I saw how driven she was to learn in her own way.In the basement, away from parents and teachers, she figured out how much material she needed to produce what she wanted, how different materials fit together and what tools were necessary to create what she envisioned. She was remarkably adept at finding workarounds for problems. If she wanted to attach an object to one of her garments but couldn’t figure out how to sew it, she resorted to a hot glue gun, wire, a stapler or other fasteners. She now knows a heck of a lot more about clothing design and production than I do and is applying her newfound knowledge to other areas of design.We tend to infantilize our children. By doing so, we place them in ideological boxes. School has become a place where they go to be taught the skills we have determined to be important. But many schools limit what is possible by adhering to rigid and outdated frameworks like traditional subject and grade divisions. This impedes kids from understanding how systems work, how things fit together, how people of different ages interact and how ideas are generated and disseminated. Now, as we grapple all at once with a global pandemic, profound structural inequities, climate change and the rise of authoritarianism at home and abroad, we need to produce citizens who understand how it is all knitted together.Since the beginning of the pandemic, American education has experienced a seismic upheaval. For the first time in close to 100 years, many students are learning in environments apart from schools. They are therefore better able to apply academic content to the rhythms and challenges of their communities. We have a golden opportunity to reorient American education toward the passions of our students and the priorities of our communities, but the window is rapidly closing.Tech companies are circling like vultures, selling their quick fixes to exasperated school systems, and understandably the debates about school sanitization and safety are more impassioned than those about post-Covid pedagogy.To their profound credit, well-intentioned teachers have moved mountains to cultivate online learning platforms devoted to teaching the skills they otherwise would have taught in their classrooms. But are those skills and subject-segregated methods still the ones our students need to make sense of interdependent global systems and phenomena that evolve at lightning speed If we determine that they aren’t, can we chart a pedagogical future that is project-based, learner-driven and community-orientedIn his book “Deschooling Society,” Ivan Illich observed: “Most learning is not the result of instruction. It is rather the result of unhampered participation in a meaningful setting.” As educators, we should reflect on what meaningful settings look like in our current troubled environment. Instead of requiring students to gaze at computers for hours out of their day so that they can complete compartmentalized “assignments,” we can ask them what problems they would like to solve in their communities, then orient cross-disciplinary instruction toward those ends. In the process, we can press our students on the moral, ethical and environmental consequences of their work.If we allow student curiosity and community problem-solving to drive the process, we can nurture systemic knowledge in our students that they can apply to other problems as they encounter them. This approach will help them better understand cause and effect, how traditional subjects relate to one another, how systems operate and how people interact. It will also empower them to believe that they can produce both knowledge and its products, instead of consuming both. If we use this time wisely, we can fertilize the ground to produce the comprehensive thinkers and doers we so desperately need right now.Eric S. Singer is a high school and university educator.

eugeneweekly_2020_9,"We ve got issues. Thousands of events, gatherings and friendships have happened in the W.O.W. Hall since the Woodmen of the World built their new Woodcraft home in 1932. When the historic building’s future was threatened in 1975, hundreds of volunteers raised the funds to purchase, preserve and re-energize the WOW Hall through the creation of the nonprofit Community Center for the Performing Arts (CCPA . A diverse array of programs blossomed, including dance, theater, music, multicultural productions and meetings of ground-breaking organizations such as Hoedads and the Oregon Country Fair. Over the decades, the WOW Hall became our creative community’s focal point for cutting-edge art and entertainment. As the CCPA evolved, hundreds of youth and volunteers received valuable training and experience, in some cases leading to exemplary professional careers in the arts. Years of effort by volunteers and thinly stretched staff of the unique membership-based organization created a tax-exempt community treasure, free of secured payable debt with a substantial emergency reserve fund. In recent years, however, the WOW Hall’s strong organizational profile has been reversed. In early March, prior to the pandemic shutdown, the CCPA treasurer announced the organization could not make payroll with minus $13 cash on hand. For 10 years, theWOW Hall has lost thousands annually leading recent CCPA boards to spend down the organization’s reserves to make payroll. The emergency reserve account went from $70,169 in June 2018 to $1,559 by February 2020. Revenue projections were missed by large percentages. Monthly financial success began to be measured by reduction of loss rather than gain. Once the home of a vital, diverse and multifaceted array of cultural activities, the production of primarily commercial music shows has taken priority over most of the hall’s other activities, frequently at a financial loss. Recently the WOW Hall received a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan and a state grant designed to aid Oregon’s venues. While some may see these funds as rescuing the CCPA from financial disaster, it is important to recognize their short-term impact. Under its current operational model, with full staffing it costs approximately $34,000 per month to operate the facility. Approximately $20,000 of that figure represents payroll. If the emergency funds are employed on that basis, they will provide approximately 3.6 months of operation. What happens when the emergency funding ends? We believe that the democratic governance structure mandated in the CCPA’s bylaws provides the mechanisms needed for CCPA members to forge a more financially sustainable future for the WOW Hall and foster its renewal as an economically accessible platform for local artists and organizations. Friends of the WOW Hall believes the CCPA must once again operate as a performing arts-oriented community center, proactively serving all ages including youth, adults and seniors. It should serve as a meeting place for community organizations and groups, especially those engaged in fighting for social justice and equality. Its financial management should be modest, focused on the concept of “giving back” through a community service orientation in operations. The CCPA should manage the hall’s finances without incurring debt or encumbering the property. The WOW Hall’s historic status must be preserved through proper maintenance and restoration. The CCPA’s community-controlled governance model enables each of us to share in the stewardship and rebirth of this shared community institution. In the next two weeks, CCPA members can exercise their governance responsibilities by attending three important online meetings: 1. 3 pm Sunday, Aug. 2: Special General Membership Meeting addressing significant deviations from the CCPA’s member-approved annual budget and viable financial models going forward. 2. 7 pm Tuesday, Aug. 4: Candidates Forum in which candidates for the CCPA Board of Directors will tell why they should be elected and take questions from members. 3. 3 pm Sunday, Aug.9: Annual General Membership Meeting in which membership will approve a new CCPA policy statement, the FY 2020-21 budget and elect at least seven new members to the CCPA Board of Directors for two year terms. Instructions for linking to these meetings via Zoom will be posted on the CCPA Website,WowHall.org. Please visit FriendsofWOWHall.org for more information about upcoming membership meetings. If you love the WOW Hall, please join your neighbors at the meetings listed above to ensure continued community ownership of this treasured resource.

In order to participate in either of the absentee voting options, you had to give a reason why you would not be able to go to your polling place on Election Day.The allowed reasons were fairly numerous, so many people were able to take advantage of absentee voting at one point or another over the years. But still, if you didn’t fit into one of the categories, you were forced to brave the long lines on Election Day in order to cast your ballot.This year, the laws have changed. You can still cast your ballot early, but you don’t need to provide an excuse for being absent from your polling place in order to do so. Otherwise, it’s the same process as it’s always been. This change opens the door to a lot more people being able to cast their ballot early, and it comes at just the right time for the pandemic we are dealing with.This year’s presidential election is closely watched, as many people believe it will affect the direction of our country for the next four years and beyond. Here in Suffolk, we also have the mayor’s seat and a total of six other seats on the City Council and School Board on the ballot, and these elections are vital for our city and schools.No matter what names you’re marking on your ballot, it is important that you vote this year.We encourage everyone to take advantage of early voting this year to help avoid the crowds on Election Day.

minnpost_2020_133,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Polls consistently show that Americans are concerned about climate change –three out of four believe humans cause it, and half see it as a crisis. But few of us are drastically changing our carbon-intensive habits.On the campaign trail, Biden offered his own climate plan that he said was distinct from the Green New Deal. As his administration starts shaping its plans, there are three things everyone should know about the Green New Deal: It is actually a global phenomenon. Much of it is market-driven. And as proposed in Congress, it is a comprehensive policy outline that responds to climate change.The first use of the phrase “Green New Deal” comes from a New York Times column written by Thomas Friedman in 2007. In 2010, Edward Barbier published “A Global Green New Deal: Rethinking the Economic Recovery.”Barbier’s book proposed a global response to climate change aimed at reducing carbon dependency. From the start, it made clear that climate change cannot be separated from deteriorating ecosystems, stressed water supplies, energy insecurity, and worsening poverty.Since 2010, things have not gone as well as they could have. Many G20 nations announced their desire to remove subsidies from fossil fuels but failed to deliver. But there are bright spots: Germany produced more thanhalf of its electricity with renewable power during the first three months of 2020. Sadly, the economic downturn caused by COVID accounted for part of the slump in lower emissions.Just the same, renewable energy, both wind and solar, is gaining much ground in Europe. And many projects – in Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the U.K. – are unsubsidized. Market forces are shaping this new energy landscape.In the United States during 2019, renewable energy surpassed coal for the first time in more than 130 years. The U.S. Energy Information Administration announced that had not happenedsince 1885– when the nation was still dependent on burning wood for fuel.The Green New Deal (GND proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts is best articulated by Rhianna Gunn-Wright. Climate Policy Director at the Roosevelt Institute, Gunn-Wright is often cited as the author of the GND.Like Barbier, Gunn-Wright links climate change responses to social justice initiatives. The GND proposes a drastic reduction in the use of fossil fuels, creating millions of high-paying jobs, investing in infrastructure, and securing clean air while promoting justice and equity. We have not seen such visionary policy proposals since the 1930s. The GND calls for a mobilization comparable to our conversion to a war-time economy during WWII.The GND borrows from Keynesian economic theory: Keynes argued that government has a unique role and must do things other institutions cannot do.These ideas have congealed under the banner of “New Consensus” thinkers, including economists likeHa-Joon Chang,Mariana Mazzucato,Kate Raworth,Joseph Stiglitz, andAnn Pettifor. Their reorientation of economic theory is well-suited to an existential threat like climate change.These economists understand the need to build “green” infrastructure and the government’s role in fostering innovation. Most importantly, they advocate direct investment at the community level.That approach differs from the investments made after the near-collapse of the economy in 2008, when Washington saved the banks and investors. The New Consensus will have no part of that. Gunn-Wright and Ocasio-Cortez advocate for a GND that values proposals and ideas with demonstrated local support.The GND would provide a framework, but many of the actual programs would be implemented by nonprofit organizations and other community groups. The GND’s goal is to combine leadership at the federal level with local initiatives and local administration. Our housing must become more energy-efficient, workers must have access to more training, and transportation systems must be transformed and weaned off their dependence on fossil fuels. Programs to achieve these outcomes are best implemented with local knowledge and support.At the same time, there would be significant investments in research and development. Mazzucato reminds us that government “has historically served not just as an administrator and regulator of the wealth-creation process, but a key actor in it, and often a more daring one, willing to take the risks that businesses won’t.”Gunn-Wright and others are on a mission to invigorate policymaking with a new set of moral principles.“Policymaking is not a science,” Gunn-Wright says. “It is a fight over whose problems get addressed, how those problems are addressed, and how public power and resources are distributed. If politics is a fight to elect people who reflect and share our values, policy is a fight to actually enact those values—to mold the world, through the work of government, into what we think it should be.”Responses to climate changemust be global. How nations mix government sector, private sector, and nonprofit sector responses will vary. A Green New Deal is emerging and requires guidance and support from all sectors.Keith Luebke recently retired from teaching nonprofit leadership courses and has several decades of experience directing nonprofit organizations."

Lloyd Austin, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for secretary of defense, represents a laudable first: If confirmed he’d be the first African American to hold the post, sending a reassuring signal to Americans amid the racial reckoning sparked by George Floyd’s killing, and especially to those in uniform, of whom about 43% are people of color.Gen. Lloyd Austin, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for secretary of defense, represents a laudable first: If confirmed he’d be the first African American to hold the post, sending a reassuring signal to Americans amid the racial reckoning sparked by George Floyd’s killing, and especially to those in uniform, of whom about 43% are people of color.Austin, a West Point graduate who had a stellar 41-year U.S. Army career, broke barriers multiple times, including being the only Black officer to head U.S. Central Command, where among his responsibilities were conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Known primarily for his battlefield roles, Austin also understands bureaucratic infighting, as well as the importance of relationships with civilian leaders — including the incoming commander in chief, who worked closely with Austin while vice president.Along the way Austin also walked the talk on diversity, mentoring a highly competent cohort of Black officers. His military and management acumen will be crucial as the country faces enduring threats in some of the same nations that were under Austin’s purview at Central Command, as well as from the country many consider America’s most consequential challenge, China. And beyond nation-states there are stateless, asymmetric threats like terrorism. Yet a new defense secretary’s first mission will be stateside: helping coordinate coronavirus vaccinations to end the pandemic.While no candidate is without flaws, there should be no question on Austin’s qualifications. But there will, and should be, questions about confirming the general. That’s because in addition to his laudable “firsts” is this lamentable second: Austin’s nomination would require the second consecutive exception to the requirement that a defense secretary be retired from active duty for seven years (Austin left the military in 2016 .This justifiable law is meant to reinforce civilian control of the military and eliminate partisanship among the officer corps. Congress has waived this requirement only twice: for George Marshall during the Truman administration and when Jim Mattis was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump. There were understandable circumstances in both cases: Marshall’s stature and Trump’s lack of it, with the thought that Mattis might be able to curb Trump’s worst instincts and impulses.Those concerns don’t dog Biden; he’s as deeply steeped in foreign policy as any president-elect in decades. So he doesn’t “need” Austin. But based on an Atlantic magazine commentary Biden wrote explaining his choice, it’s clear why he wants him. Austin, Biden wrote, had “met every challenge with extraordinary skill and profound personal decency.” Biden bases his conclusions on the “countless hours” they spent in the White House Situation Room where Austin, among other accomplishments, “designed and executed the campaign that ultimately beat back ISIS.” Above all, Biden wrote, he chose Austin “because I know how he reacts under pressure, and I know that he will do whatever it takes to defend the American people.”There will be a lot of pressure in the next four years. Biden’s confidence in Austin should matter to the American people who need defending, and so it should matter to Congress, too. While it is not ideal to again make an exception, Austin’s exceptional credentials, his history-making appointment, and the trust from Biden, justifies it.— Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minn.

minnpost_2020_125,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Before George Floyd there were Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson, and Isaac McGhie. On June 15, 1920 – exactly 100 years ago today – a white mob in Minnesota hung the three African-American men from a lamppost in downtown Duluth.Employees of the visiting John Robinson Circus, they had been in the city only hours. It proved too long. A local man, the father of a young white teenager, accused a group of five or six African-American workers of raping his son’s 19-year-old girlfriend, Irene Tusken. A physician’s examination of the young woman revealed no evidence of rape or assault. Nevertheless, the police arrested six black circus workers and detained them in the city’s jail.As word circulated through Duluth of the alleged rape, a white mob of at least 1,000 people – some estimates run as high as 10,000 – quickly formed. They stormed the jail and removed Clayton, Jackson, and McGhie. The police, who had been ordered not to use their guns, offered only the feeblest of resistance. The three men were savagely beaten and murdered.Some of the perpetrators gleefully gathered around the lifeless victims, posing for a photograph that later became a postcard. Look what fun can be had in Minnesota, it seemed to say. Bob Dylan, Duluth’s most famous native son, referred to this gruesome history in his 1965 song “Desolation Row.” “They’re selling postcards of the hanging,” it begins.Today the United States largely remembers the lynchings of Clayton, Jackson, and McGhie because of their unusual location. For much of the 20th century, white northerners took comfort in their unfounded belief that racism, and especially racist violence, was a southern phenomenon. The ghastly horror of 1920, like the more recent case of George Floyd, demonstrated otherwise. Indeed, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who knew a thing or two about eliciting white rage, said in 1966 during the integration of Marquette Park in the Midwest’s largest city that he had“never seen – even in Mississippi and Alabama – mobs as hostile and as hate-filled as I’ve seen here in Chicago.”Duluth continues to suffer the legacies of its racist past. African-Americans and other people of color in the area earn less, reside in shabbier housing, and enjoy fewer educational opportunities than their white neighbors. There are problems with outright bigotry, too. A number of Duluthians have embraced the racist xenophobia of Donald Trump and railed against the potential resettlement of refugees in St. Louis County. One county commissioner, who in 2007 saidhe “would have voted for slavery” if the people in his district supported it, just last week walked out of a meeting as the board was set to observe 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence in honor of George Floyd. He claimed later thathe had to attend to a “personal matter.”But these more shameful legacies are only part of the story.Duluth’s current chief of police is, strangely enough, the great-nephew of the young woman whose claim of rape a century ago set the triple lynching in motion. Mike Tusken only learned about his great-aunt’s role in 2000. Since then he has worked to overcome the racist scar attached to his name. “When you see people who are being oppressed, when you see inequities, when you see prejudice, it’s our opportunity – not just for the audience but for everyone in the city – to stand up and to challenge that,”he told a crowd commemorating the lynchingsin 2016. Two years later, in 2018,Tusken accompanied dozens of other Minnesotansto the opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama. More recently, hecalled for the posthumous pardon of Max Mason, the only man ever convicted of the alleged rape, as a “family representative” of the “victim”; thatpardon was granted on Friday.And there are other positive legacies, too. Fifteen years before the Equal Justice Initiative opened the National Lynching Memorial in Alabama, Duluthians dedicated a memorial to the city’s most ignominious moment at the site of the killings downtown. Today the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial serves as ground zero for Duluth’s protests against the murder of George Floyd. Two weeks ago,over a thousand people marchedfrom the memorial to Duluth’s city hall to denounce police violence and Minnesota’s long and ugly history of racism, anddozens then gathered there nightlyto call for racial justice.Hope grows now at this once wretched place.Scott Ladermanteaches history at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.

Tim Walz wisely decided to continue the Department of Commerce appeal of the Line 3 pipeline in northern Minnesota, the state’s faith leaders stepped up to sound a cautionary note.

And it addresses individual state leaders about the potential use of force if protesters exercise their First Amendment rights:The letter references the law enforcement responses at Standing Rock in 2016 and at protests over George Floyd’s killing, showing that something else is needed rather than a full-blown military operation. And it warns of the strident and questionable law enforcement plansalready in placewithThe Northern Lights Task Force, which has consulted with Morton County in North Dakota about its tactics during the DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock.

minnpost_2020_172,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .What do you think of when you think of home More often than not, people will answer this question not by describing the physical structure itself, instead remarking on their emotional and cultural ideas of what theideaof home means to them. Shelter is one of our most basic human needs, but for the millions of Americans who were able to capitalize on the myriad government incentives for homeownership, like the GI Bill and the mortgage interest tax deduction, the idea of home evokes the emotions of safety, stability, and prosperity.With millions of Americans spending a large portion of their income on a basic necessity and themajority of low-income renters being racialminoritiesdue to theracist history of housing policy in the United States, it could be expected that the federal government would have some sort of policy intervention, just as it does for homeownership. Instead, it has the failing Section 8 housing voucher program, a rental assistance program for low-income households that is so underfunded and mis-designed that it only covers25%of eligible households.Section 8 vouchers havelimits on the amount of rentthey will cover so recipientsstill end up living in low-income neighborhoodsthat lack access to opportunity. The system traps users in the rental market, and does nothing to address America’s racial housing disparities. Our most economically vulnerable citizens are saddled withexponentially increasing rentsand are dealing withone of the worst financial crises since the Great Depression; ithas left millionsof renter households at risk ofevictionwith little to no opportunity for assistance from the federal government.Additionally, the current design of the program offers nothing to its users trying to achieve homeownership, the main way to build wealth in the United States that could enable class mobility and address racial wealth disparities. To protect its most vulnerable citizens, the federal government should assist all qualifying low-income renter households by fully funding the Section 8 program and making it an entitlement program likemost other socialwelfare programs. The program should also be amended so that Section 8 recipients —70% of whom identify as a racial minority andwho are experiencing the historical impact of American residential segregation policies — can choose to put the vouchers toward mortgage payments to create wealth in communities of color.Detractors of these reforms will point outthe $59 billion estimated price tagthat comes along with the expansion of the Section 8 program to cover all qualifying households. However, the U.S. government has supported homeownership through the GI Bill, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the mortgage interest deduction, which annually deducts over$77 billionin taxesowed by homeowning Americans — essentially making it the largest federal housing program. Based on the funding for homeownership programs, the affordability of fully funding Section 8 makes the question not “Is it fiscally possible” but rather “Is it politically possible”Especially in Minnesota, Section 8 vouchers are the main source of housing support for our most vulnerable residents,yet they only serve around 25% of eligible Minnesota families.The Minnesotans currently using Section 8 vouchers are disproportionately people of color, with59% of Minnesotan Section 8 users identifying as people of colorandonly 16.2% ofMinnesota’s general population identifying as people of color.Beyond that, Minnesota has the fifth largest homeownership disparitybetween white households and households of color in the country andhas not been exemptfrom the national trends of racism in housing policy. There are even geographic disparities in the administration of Section 8 in Minnesota, with Section 8 applicants outside of the seven-county metropolitan areawaiting longer on averageto receive a voucher than an applicant in the metro area. Withstrong disagreement at the Legislatureon how toaddress the Minnesotan affordable housing crisis, the best hope for Minnesota families in poverty is significant action at the federal level.Right now, after the police killing of George Floyd, lawmakers areunder more pressureto pass legislation that addresses systemic racism in the United States. Communities of color make upadisproportionate amount of low-income renterswho are unable to receive a Section 8 voucher. Yet the current structure of the program ignores the racist history of housing in the U.S. and its disparate impact on families of color.Reforming Section 8 has the potential to break down racial disparities, build wealth in communities historically excluded from wealth building through homeownership, and provide support to America’s renting families, who face an ever-mounting slog of issues that prevent members of these households from seeing their home as a place of stability and safety.Emily Anderson is a Master of Urban and Regional Planning student at the University of Minnesota studying housing policy and racial justice. Anderson completed her B.S. in urban studies and political science in 2020, also at the U of M.

I even gave a speech at work where I said I hoped my son would grow up to be like Bezos.Now I see more clearly how billionaire owners like Bezos can claim all the profits during the pandemic while frontline workers like me take all the risks.When the pandemic started, Amazon was slow to respond. When I clocked in on March 29, there weren’t any masks or social distancing protocols, even though we were selling masks by the pallet full. I could hear horror movie music in my head as I gazed at hundreds of unmasked workers.I walked out that day. Amazon says I took a voluntary unpaid leave.I’ve got a medical condition, and I’m caring for children and elders. I can’t afford to get sick. I stood up and spoke out. I kept my job.I returned to work in July. There were better systems in place: a temperature scan at the door, masks provided and required for everyone, and monitors to enforce safety rules. Amazon now staggers the beginning and end of shifts and breaks — but only by 15 minutes, so there’s still crowding, especially when a shift ends.On Oct. 1, Amazon announced that nearly 20,000 of its U.S. workers had been infected with COVID-19. That number is surely higher by now.I run a flat sorter on the shipping dock, two big machines with a conveyor belt. I have to scan 1,800 packages an hour. That’s thirty scans per minute and 18,000 per shift. The pace skyrocketed during the pandemic. I also must work alongside another person and it’s impossible to stay six feet apart.Many of my coworkers have gotten sick. One died from COVID-19. We get a text whenever someone in the plant tests positive, but we are not told who they are where they work. It’s a big plant, and it’s scary getting multiple texts each week. I’ve counted more than 200 texts since returning to work.Since the start of the pandemic, Amazon has been on a hiring spree, further crowding the plant and the buses to work without plans to improve commuting conditions for our growing workforce. The company’s fortunes are booming, as more people choose to shop without leaving their homes.A new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, titled “Billionaire Wealth vs. Community Health,” reveals that the combined wealth of 647 U.S. billionaires increased by almost $1 trillion since mid-March. Bezos’ wealth increased by 62%, totaling $188.3 billion as of mid-November.Amazon can afford to invest more to protect workers through measures like hazard pay, a dedicated express bus for commuting workers, sturdier masks, and a workplace council of frontline workers to advise the company on safety systems. And Amazon and other mega-corporations profiting from the pandemic should pay their fair share of taxes to fund public transportation and public health protections for employees.I like my job. We’re getting our customers the things they urgently need during the pandemic. But Amazon could do a lot better by its workers.Rina Cummings works at the JFK8 Amazon facility on Staten Island."
eugeneweekly_2020_13,"We ve got issues. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the racialized inequality that permeates Oregon’s food system. The conditions of slavery and genocide upon which the U.S. was founded have been neither reconciled nor repaired, leaving our state with a food system that increases vulnerability to the spread of viruses like COVID-19. As professors in Oregon State University’s Food in Culture and Social Justice program we have spent decades studying how social inequities are reproduced through every stage of the food system. The pandemic is exposing the brutal effects of these inequities. Now, more than ever, we must seek treatments that emphasize systemic change and social justice. Let’s begin with the production of food on Oregon farms, on lands stolen from Native Americans. The vast majority of farmland in our country is owned by white men, and the people who plant, care for and harvest the food are mostly people of color, many of whom were forced to leave their own land in other countries due to political situations beyond their control. Working conditions in the fields often lack sufficient handwashing stations and underpaid migrant workers are housed in substandard structures where social distancing is impossible. On some farms in the U.S., every single farmworker has tested positive for COVID-19 and Oregon farms could easily be next. Moving on to food processing, we find that many of the hotspots of COVID-19 outbreaks occur in factories where food is processed. With people working shoulder to shoulder to increase efficiency, the virus can spread quickly. The next stage of food processing occurs in restaurants or institutional cafeterias, where cooks, servers and dishwashers prepare, deliver and clean up after meals for the enjoyment of others. The work is precarious and usually without health care benefits, so workers are compelled to come to work, even when sick. Closing these businesses may protect potential customers, but it puts huge numbers of already vulnerable people out of work. Additionally, farmers who produce for that supply chain have no market and are left to destroy edible food — all while people go hungry. This brings us to the final phase of the food system, when food enters people’s mouths. Food workers are twice as likely to be food insecure as others, but during the pandemic, they find themselves in good company given the high rates of current unemployment. U.S. citizens can apply for SNAP benefits, but many food workers are not citizens. They are not banned from accessing food at pantries and free meal sites, but many fear that if they do make use of them they will be arrested and separated from their families. Today, the fact that COVID-19 is widespread in penitentiaries and deportation stations adds to their fear. Oregon relies on the cheap labor of Latin American migrant workers to grow and process food, and these farms and factories have become centers of infection in our state. Only 13 percent of the state identifies as Hispanic, but 36.6 percent of identified COVID-19 infections have occurred within this population. In light of the recent outbreak at Pacific Seafood, where more than 181 employees tested positive for the virus, news headlines reported that “language barriers” were delaying the ability to track and trace people with COVID-19, with many of the impacted workers speaking Latin American Indigenous languages. These language barriers must be understood within broader violations of human rights exemplified by an abusive immigration system that too quickly imprisons and deports — even when people have the legal right to stay. Testing and tracing will not be effective unless there are labor protections in place that make it safe for all people who worry they are sick to come forward. It’s tragic, not to mention dangerous, that agricultural workers and food processors are considered essential, and yet they are unprotected. As the world clamors for COVID-19 magic bullets — vaccines, antibodies, llamas, medications, face shields — the one thing that will make a significant and lasting difference is a large injection of social justice. We must work to increase land sovereignty among marginalized communities, support universal health care and guaranteed wages, and put an end to racist police brutality and extortionist farmworker immigration policies. A vaccine for COVID-19 may never eliminate coronavirus, but these structural changes are within our reach. They are fundamental to creating an equitable food system that feeds us all. Joan Gross, Ph.D., and Emily Yates-Doerr, Ph.D., are professors in Oregon State University’s Food in Culture and Social Justice program, which educates students about the food system and the complexities of foodways around the world. The program encourages students to actively strive to create a more equitable and environmentally sustainable food system, and many of our graduates are currently involved in that work."

But this is where we find ourselves — with plasticin our food supply;the air, rain, wind, and snow;the nooks and crannies of our national parks;and permeating ourgreat lakesandoceans. And this past week, new studies show that business as usual has uson track to tripleocean plastic in 20 years.Heeding immense pressure from customers and environmental groups, Target, Walmart, and CVS announced they areteaming upto find an alternative to the disposable plastic bag over the next three years. They joined with New York investment firm “Closed Loop Partners” and committed funds. According to Closed Loop Partners, Kroger and Walgreensalso joined. Given the gravity of the current situation, these retailers need to not only look for a potential innovative future solution but solve this problem today.Solving the problem today is simple. As many entire countries require and as stores likeCostcoalready do, these retailers can stop providing plastic bags. People can bring their own bags, or if they have a vehicle, cart their goods to bag or box there. Nearly everyone owns some type of carrier bag and, because they already exist, these bags have no additional environmental cost to make. Strong reusable bags can also be made of existing discarded materials. With these major retailers on board, this solution will bring the flow of more than300 billion plastic bags in the U.S.over a three-year period (the time period the group is giving to consider solutions to a trickle. Laid end-to-end, these 300 billion bags couldcircle the equator 4,000 times.In a search for other long-term solutions, much care is needed. Disposable solutions are fraught with environmental pitfalls. Biodegradable bags break down well in industrial compost facilities but give off potent greenhouse gases in a landfill, perpetuating climate change. Partially or wholly recycled plastic bags have an environmental cost of production and perpetuate plastic use. Paper bags are resource intensive to make and give off greenhouse gases as they decompose.At the expense of the planet, the plastic industry has worked hard to try to convince us that plastic is clean and healthy. It has promoted the “recyclability” of plastic, though there is little to no market for most recycled plastic (as virgin plastic is cheaper . To capitalize on fears surrounding COVID-19, the plastic industrylobbiedfor gains in public policy by making unfounded claims about the “health and safety benefits” of plastic (though the viruslasts longer on plastic by using studiesfunded by themselves. The motivation is easy to understand. Plastic is made of fossil fuels, which have seen shrinking markets in traditional spaces. With more efficient cars and progress in solar and other alternative forms of energy, plastic isthe growth areafor oil.Customers are calling for change now. The largest environmental petition onchange.orgover this past year is apetitionto Target asking it to drastically reduce plastic in stores, starting with plastic bags. More than 541,000 Target customers have signed it. Customers find it impossible to avoid plastic with plastic packaging covering nearly every product in stores. Coupled with the sea of plastic bags at checkout, they often feel no bit of personal effort can possibly matter.Target, Walmart and CVS have pledged to end their use of disposable plastic bags. Their leadership can bring monumental change. But, a three-year delay and any false solutions will set us back at a critical time. We need real change starting now with the simple decision to stop providing plastic bags.Theresa Carter, who lives in Minneapolis, is the founder of environmental organizationCustomers Who Care.

suffolknewsherald_2020_49,"Published 10:18 pm Tuesday, July 14, 2020ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:Contempt, when applied to the law, is such a strong word, perhaps stronger than when we apply it to everyday life. In law, it is usually used toward those who disobey or disrespect the law, but can it be used toward the makers and enforcers of the law? An example from my life may suggest that it can.Please note: more than complaining, I am rather hoping to inform and inspire anyone to research the Code of Virginia. Whether it helps you or someone else, it is well worth it. Copies of the code are available at a public library, the law library and online. They are there for you.Three years ago, I filed complaints against three health care professionals. I disagreed with the decisions of the boards. Somehow thinking I could not appeal their decisions, I decided to research the code and discovered that I indeed could appeal their decisions. Per the code, a petitioner need only be aggrieved and claim the illegality of the board’s decision. Both apply to my situation.I also learned that immunity from prosecution or disciplinary action is not automatic or absolute. Immunity is conditional and can be waived for one or more reasons. They include acting with gross negligence, willful misconduct, malicious intent and possibly bad faith. You should review the code to see which may apply to your situation.I found another item of interest. Chapter 54.1-2915(A (12 indicates that violations of a professional’s code of ethics may result in disciplinary action, including revocation of one’s professional certificate or license. Also, as this item is listed among other actionable behaviors which to me seem illegal, then it might be possible the professional’s violation of ethics may be illegal. You should review the code and other regulations governing their profession and the national agency Code of Ethics governing their profession.As to legal contempt of the law, it seems I have experienced roadblock after roadblock to prevent me from exercising my right to appeal. This includes delaying my divorce, which has been on file for nearly 14 months. As part of that, it seems like the issue of my permanent address has been decided without me being heard so that I can defend my claim to that address.To me, it seems like the parties involved do not care what the Code of Virginia says. Observations over the last several months may suggest they will go to whatever lengths necessary to keep us from knowing and then exercising all of our rights. Is there a milder, more appropriate word to describe these actions other than contempt? I was never good at vocabulary and distinguishing the finer nuances between words. Maybe you know of one. Anyway, I hope you will take time to research the code.Kevin SnashallSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_234,"Published 4:52 pm Tuesday, September 8, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceThe middle-school-aged girl sat across from me, wiping away tears from her face. “I couldn’t stop crying at school,” she said. “I didn’t even know why I was crying.” We started talking about the events of the day, and I asked questions to see if I could find a cause for her distress. I discovered through our conversation that she had not gotten any sleep the night before. She stayed up all night playing a new video game. It’s no wonder she was more emotional than usual, even for a teenage girl.I spoke with another student who was struggling with his grades in elementary school. “I always sleep through class,” he said. “It’s the best sleep I ever get.” I found out that he frequently stays up late, playing video games or watch videos. Therefore, it’s no surprise he sleeps in class.These aren’t the only two students who have experienced one issue or another due to not sleeping properly at night. It’s a theme that has been reoccurring for the past year with several of the kids with whom I work.The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that children get between 8 to 12 hours a sleep a day, depending on the age of the child. Not getting the proper amount of sleep can have mental and physical consequences, but it doesn’t take a doctor for us to know that fact.We have all experienced periods when we have not gotten enough sleep. We know how it affects our bodies and our brains. These effects are only amplified in children. Children need to sleep, but they would frequently rather do something else. This is why parents must ensure children are getting the proper amount of sleep.The first step is to set a bedtime for children based on age and schedule. This bedtime must then be enforced. The time can be flexible to an extent, but a set bedtime can help children get into a routine that can greatly assist in their sleep habits.The time can be changed based on the child’s schedule, such as a school schedule compared to a vacation schedule. It is important, however, to consider the child’s upcoming schedule. For example, you may wish to allow children to stay up a little later on a Friday or Saturday night during the school year, but allowing them to stay up too late will make a return to an earlier bedtime on Sunday night difficult. Be sure you are looking at the full schedule and not considering just one night or day at a time.When bedtimes are set, consider ways to prepare children for their slumber. There are many tips to helping ease children to sleep, such as limiting screen time and eliminating strenuous activities a few hours before it is time to sleep.I was saddened by the fact that the kids with whom I spoke were struggling due to something that is an easier fix than most problems that arise. A good night’s sleep each night would help calm the teenage girl’s emotions and help the elementary school-aged boy learn at school.They are kids, however, and the lure of video games is stronger than the desire to learn. It is up to the adults to ensure the kids are getting the sleep they need.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_39,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As we in Minnesota get ready to send our kids back to school — either in-person, virtually, or through some combination of the two — we should try not to let our hopes get the best of us. If history is any guide, we will eventually be forced to acknowledge what we already know: that pathogens do not respect school calendars. The experience of the Minneapolis public school system during the height of the 1918 “Spanish flu” provides a sobering reminder of how reality tends to stomp on our best intentions.(Minneapolis Public Schools is starting the 2020-21 school yearin distance learningbecause of concerns about the spread of COVID-19. The influenza pandemic that arrived in United States in the spring of 1918 did not hit Minneapolis until the fall of that year. But when it did arrive, it spread quickly, and it convinced public health officials to act. On Oct. 11, 1918, the city health department ordered all places of public gathering — churches, theaters, dance halls, pool halls, and schools — closed indefinitely, until the pandemic was under control. The shutdown put Minneapolis’ top health official, Dr. H.M. Guilford, in direct conflict with the city’s school board, whose members felt they knew what was best for children, teachers, and staff. And what was best, they insisted, was that kids keep going to school, the flu be damned.But as the schools remained closed, public sentiment against the shutdown grew. Guilford finally relented. Minneapolis’ public schools reopened on Nov. 18, five and half weeks after they were ordered to close. While celebrating the reopening, school superintendent B.B. Jackson sought to preemptively shift the blame for any influenza outbreak that might occur in the coming weeks. If the flu took hold in the schools, he said, it would be the fault of the “questionable activities” of the children themselves. Jackson also acknowledged that Guilford had warned the board that reopening “would not be wise.”And, as it turned out, Guilford was right.Two weeks later, schools throughout the district were reporting an alarming number of influenza absences. In one school alone, Fulton Elementary in North Minneapolis, 126 students were out with the disease. The latest spike seemed to confirm that the “Spanish flu” was not, as many people believed, an illness that skipped over children. Guilford responded by reclosing the schools until the end of the year. This time the school board raised hardly any objections. When the schools reopened at the start of the new year, the 1918 wave had effectively dissipated. Students resumed their education with few disruptions.Comparisons between the 1918 influenza and the COVID-19 pandemic are admittedly imperfect. The “Spanish flu” was deadlier than the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Minneapolis’ schools had to shut down suddenly, while classes were under way, and did not have a chance to institute the kind of safety measures that our schools will use this fall. But the events of the fall of 1918 still carry an important lesson for those of us hoping that this coming school year will move forward without major disruptions: Unfortunately, it probably won’t.Dave Kenney is a freelance writer specializing in Minnesota history."

Lisa Mulligan, Mike Dacey & Jordan AsherAs COVID-19 rates spike in our region, we must unite in our efforts to protect ourselves and one another from a virus for which there is no vaccine and no cure.At this time, the best possible weapons in stopping this invisible threat are wearing a mask, following social distancing guidelines and washing your hands.In Hampton Roads, the spike in positive COVID-19 cases is a cause for concern. The Commonwealth of Virginia is holding steady around a 7% positivity rate, while in Hampton Roads, cities are wrestling with positivity rates at or above the state’s average. While it is difficult to pinpoint specific events or sources leading to the latest spikes, we do know that masks are working to lower the percentage of positive cases in other parts of the country.Peer-reviewed studies in medical journals like The Lancet and Health Affairs have shown that wearing a mask significantly reduces the risk of spreading COVID-19. Results show that mask mandates contributed to a slowdown in the daily COVID-19 growth rate over time. Health Affairs data suggested the first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9% compared to the five days prior to the mandate, and at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2%. Internationally, countries that have embraced or mandated wearing masks have had a significantly lower death rate due to COVID-19.Here are some guidelines for wearing a mask:As clinical leaders of the major health care systems in Hampton Roads, and on behalf of all of our community’s essential medical workers, including the thousands of doctors, nurses and employees who’ve shown their commitment to our safety, health and well-being throughout our health systems — we urge you to wear a mask to help keep our communities safe and reduce the painful scenes we witness in our facilities each day due to this awful virus.Save a life and #MaskUp757.

suffolknewsherald_2020_32,"Published 9:26 pm Friday, July 31, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieSince Friday, July 17, 2020, our news and social media feeds have been sporadically reminding us of the lives of two great men who lived their lives fighting for civil rights and justice. Congressman John Lewis and the Rev. C.T. Vivian died that day.They are known as two of the “Saints of Selma” who were among the civil rights demonstrators that faced the notorious “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Ala., when state troopers, armed with clubs and tear gas, attacked them on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The experience on that bridge on March 7, 1965, created a fraternity of which their membership lasted their lifetime. That fraternity affirms a covenant relationship of men and women who have shed their own blood for the cause of peace. Lewis and Vivian risked their lives at that bridge.These flashbacks to their civil rights work, the mugshots after their arrests and video coverage of “Bloody Sunday” news footage cause chilling reflections on the similarities between injustices today and 1965. The nation responded with solidarity at the outrage of what happened on “Bloody Sunday.” Different groups of people joined with the cause of the voting rights.People have marveled at the fact that Lewis and Vivian died on the same day. Coincidence? I think not. God always knows what He is doing. He is intentional. At a time when calls for justice continue and unrest is at an all-time high in our nation, I truly believe we could benefit from more news coverage of the life journeys of both Congressman John Lewis and the Rev. C.T. Vivian.I know nothing of how close a relationship the two men had in their lives, but I imagine that being members of that fraternity that began on “Bloody Sunday” knit them together spiritually. So much so, they left this earth together. Is there anyone in your life whom you have done important work alongside that you would love to walk with across the bridge to heavenly Jordan?Bridges are often used in metaphors in relating a crossing over from life into eternity. Bridges may also represent where we are now to where we need to go.These two men attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, and were attacked for their attempt. These same two men crossed a bridge on July 17, 2020, and were no doubt received into the arms of their Savior. Their lives are reminders for us that bridge crossing is important work, and it is difficult work. We must do the work. Their deaths on the same day illustrate that some of those bridges we cannot go to alone. Some of those bridges require us to link arms and cross over together.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

suffolknewsherald_2020_166,"Published 4:32 pm Tuesday, November 24, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Myrtle Virginia ThompsonTheSuffolk News-Heraldwas born before a day of national recognition for the giving of thanks was immortalized. I wonder what the headlines would have been if that herald of good news had been in operation. The newspaper founders must have known the word herald was sourced in royal robes. In the far past, edicts were announced by a herald, an official delegate who went through the streets giving out the information dictated by royalty. Today we depend on our electronic devices to tell us what is happening anywhere and everywhere around the whole of our world.I was hit with reality when I heard the words “Thanksgiving canceled,” struck by how little giving of thanks must mean to some of today’s leaders. Then I remembered, Oh, they mean “turkey day” activities. Whew! Thanksgiving is always a personal thing and we are still free to voice our praise and thanks to God.I opened my Bible to the Psalms and Bible writers to see what King David and people of millennia past had to say about the giving of thanks. I found no mention of “turkey day” or sports or other activities, but there was a wonderful Thanksgiving reminder in Nehemiah’s day: “Go your way, eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy unto our Lord. Neither be sorry for the joy of the Lord is your strength.” Nehemiah 8:10.That is the Thanksgiving message. We can still have a whole day, a whole lifetime of Thanksgiving, any day, any time. It is a way of remembering God’s blessings on us as a people, as a nation and even as individuals. We can even be alone and thank God. That should be a comfort to those unable to gather in 2020.In the New Testament, Paul reminded us, “In everything give thanks for this is the will of God…”What? Give thanks for a virus that has captured and placed us in “no man’s land”? Put us in uncertainty about the future? It is not the first time we have faced incomprehensible situations. The difference may be that when we give thanks to the Creator God, we recognize Him for Who He is. It makes possible our belief that He is actually in control of the world He created. Almost every book of the Bible makes this very clear. We are reminded of the many times the tide was turned from a developing wave that threatened to devour us.We need some corporate thanks to get past this overwhelming, worldwide chain of events. Let’s not cancel THANKS-giving. God can provide us with freedom from fear and concerns this November when we give thanks to the Omni-God, the all-sufficient One, wise, powerful over the forces of evil, and present when we come to Him with our needs. We don’t need a day of thanksgiving, we need a whole life filled with thanks and praise for what has been given us in this land. Let’s just do it!Myrtle V.

They still need pencils, pens, notebooks, art supplies and more, but now they also have a higher need for things like their own small dry-erase boards and markers, earbuds and other things that enhance at-home, virtual learning.Local folks who are members of the “Divine Nine” took it upon themselves to hold a school supply giveaway recently.The nine fraternities and sororities that make up the National Pan-Hellenic Council, represented locally by their alumni chapters, made the event happen on Saturday. The sororities put together 250 bags, and the fraternities gave $800 in donations that helped purchase additional school supplies, gift cards and personal protective equipment for volunteers.The event was conducted wisely with the pandemic in mind, with volunteers handing out supplies while keeping a safe distance from drivers who stayed in their vehicles in the drive-through format.Students and teachers are coping admirably with this new normal, and we all hope that the situation will be safe enough for them to get back to in-person schooling soon. Until then, our students and teachers deserve to be supported in every way possible to help them succeed, stay on track and return to school better than ever.We send a big thank-you to the Divine Nine for their constant community support and the great success of this school supply giveaway.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_109,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Since the four officers involved with George Floyd’s death have been charged, the court of public opinion must now allow a court of law to do its job. As we wait for that to occur, Minnesota’s elected leaders must ask hard questions of ongoing racism within our criminal justice system.Blaming Floyd’s death solely on systemic racism within the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD , however, is too easy and it ignores a number of problems that haven’t been brought to the public’s attention. Threatening to disband the department is also not realistic, practical, or wise, and it only serves as a distraction to real reform. But it does prompt a legitimate question: Why haven’t previous reforms resolved the problems we all watchedMinnesota’s leaders need to think bigger. The governor has launched a human rights investigation into the MPD, but that does not go far enough. We also need a nonpartisan commission that specifically focuses on who we have leading our police departments. Specifically, I am suggesting that if state leaders are going to look at racism within the departments, then they should take a hard look at whether chiefs of police and their command staffs are competent to run these organizations.State leaders and policymakers will be shocked to learn that many chiefs throughout the state have perpetuated the crimes they now condemn. I have had several people in Minneapolis’ command staff privately admit to me they have physically assaulted suspects in custody. One even admitted that he had participated in “gay bashing” as a young officer. Another even apologized for his past conduct of beating up suspects.As it relates to the MPD, the failure for reforms to take hold should not come as a surprise when the department’s last three police chiefs and their entire command staffs have come up through the ranks.But it isn’t just perpetuating violence that is an issue for some of its leaders, it is the stifling of reform and integrity within the MPD. Most people do not understand that police departments are paramilitary organizations, and officers are ordered to follow the chain of command. The chain of command is sacrosanct, and it prevents young officers from challenging the authority of superior officers. This type of thinking may seem foreign and archaic to outsiders, but this is how all police departments run, and it may partially explain why three junior officers could not convince a superior officer to provide medical treatment to a man gasping for air and calling out for his mother in his final dying words.Similarly, many police departments have created a culture where they fail to promote officers who demonstrate the integrity and honesty we so desperately need. Critics have charged that systemic racism exists within the MPD, but they are not aware of the extraordinary heroism that some officers have displayed. In one instance, two MPD officers discovered that an African-American may have been wrongfully convicted of murder. These officers went to extraordinary lengths to exonerate the man so he didn’t spend the rest of his life in prison. Rather than promoting these officers for setting an innocent man free, the MPD’s command staff sought to tarnish their reputations and careers.Some believe that a code of silence still exists within today’s police departments, even though MPD’s discipline policies make it clear that lying on behalf of another officer will result in immediate termination. If it does exist, that code lives strongest in the chief’s office and among the command staff.I have seen evidence where chiefs cover up for each other’s serious misdeeds, ignore lies, and refuse to stop subordinates from destroying the careers of honorable officers. In one brazen incident, a member of a suburban police department’s command staff was found by a judge to have engaged in illegal discrimination. Rather than disciplining or removing this individual from his command staff, the chief openly acknowledged that he did nothing.As rage turns to reason, which it will, state leaders may reach an easy conclusion: Too many chiefs are not qualified to run the departments they operate, and it may be time to change Minnesota law that will allow civilians to run police organizations. It has worked very effectively for our U.S. Department of Defense; certainly it can work for our police departments.Patrick Burns is a practicing attorney in the Twin Cities, and has litigated a number of whistleblower cases involving the MPD. He also serves as the president of the Epilepsy Foundation."

In astonishingly little time, long-entrenched dictators were toppled in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen; elsewhere, previously unchallenged rulers were forced to conciliate or, as in Syria, Libya and Bahrain, employ extreme violence to snuff out their people’s democratic hopes.It’s been 10 years since a Tunisian fruit vendor named Mohamed Bouazizi set himself alight in a protest against corruption and injustice, starting a people-power movement across the Arab world. In astonishingly little time, long-entrenched dictators were toppled in Tunisia, Egypt and Yemen; elsewhere, previously unchallenged rulers were forced to conciliate or, as in Syria, Libya and Bahrain, employ extreme violence to snuff out their people’s democratic hopes.Unsure of whether to intervene and how to do so effectively, the West mostly looked on. President Barack Obama offered the pro-democratic protesters only modest support; European leaders, likewise. The U.S., France and Britain backed the removal of Libya’s Moammar Qaddafi with force — but their effort ended badly, and they withdrew during the chaos that followed. The aspirations of the first Arab Spring were soon crushed.Albeit tentatively, a second Arab Spring may be beginning. In Algeria and Sudan, people have again risen to topple corrupt regimes. For all its problems, Tunisia’s newfound democracy is still in place. And warming relations between Israel and a number of Arab states afford new opportunities for constructive engagement, including trade, travel and technological cooperation.The recent Arab-Israel accords can be counted as one of President Donald Trump’s few genuine accomplishments. President-elect Joe Biden would be wise to build on this success, while taking care to ensure that it serves the West’s broader interest in encouraging reform and prosperity across the region.The clearest opportunity is in Sudan, one of the countries that has recognized Israel’s right to exist. Its transitional government is making remarkable progress in advancing political and social reforms but desperately needs economic assistance. Biden can make a quick, decisive difference by providing American aid, as well as by advocating forgiveness of Khartoum’s crippling, unpayable debts. He should enlist Israel’s help in these efforts.In Algeria, Biden should work with European allies to build on the democratic gains achieved by the people-power movement known as Hirak, and guard against backsliding by the old cabal of political, military and business leaders, commonly referred to as Le Pouvoir, or the Power.Egypt poses a different challenge. Its general-turned-president, Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, has proved even more repressive than his predecessor Hosni Mubarak, the target of the protesters 10 years ago. Biden must use American assistance, crucial for the regime’s survival, to promote democratic norms.In Syria, Libya and Yemen, civil wars have only grown more intractable in recent years. Yet even here, there might be grounds for hope. The warring factions are exhausted and the pandemic is adding to the ruinous cost of fighting. The time is ripe for new efforts to resolve those conflicts, and Biden can give the U.S. a leading role. Appointing a special envoy for this task would send a signal of intent.The president-elect aims to restore American leadership in promoting democratic values, and he plans a “Summit of Democracies” soon after taking office. Challenging as it may be, there’d be no better way to demonstrate his sincerity than by working to support a new Arab Spring."
philinquirer_2020_56,"Instead of backfilling the budget with federal CARES Act funds, Wolf and lawmakers should have considered business owners and families and students struggling with education costs and online learning.With all the pandemic-related economic disruptions of 2020, many Americans are relying on the federal government — particularly stimulus checks and Small Business Administration loans — to offer financial relief. Unfortunately, state governments have adopted the same approach, relying on federal borrowing — and massively increased deficit spending — to fund their expenditures.This year’s widespread business closures and unemployment have resulted in state tax revenue shortages, despite the CARES Act funding they received. While CARES Act funds were intended to deal with direct COVID-related costs, many states are simply looking for a “free” way to fund their own excessive spending. Some states are evenlobbying for more federal taxpayer aid.» READ MORE:Without advocates in City Hall, Philly’s small businesses are unfairly expected to white-knuckle it | OpinionEarlier this year, in Pennsylvania, lawmakers worked with Gov. Tom Wolf to pass a stopgap budget that made post-COVID state spending adjustments. Then, two weeks after the election, they completed the 2020 budget during the lame-duck session. But with a $3 billion shortage to makeup, lawmakers, unfortunately, made only a halfhearted effort toward financial solvency, opting instead to rely on questionable federal aid, overlook the state’s real needs, and pave the way for crushing tax hikes.Pennsylvanians may appreciate some components of the final budget deal. For instance, lawmakers tapped into excess reserves like the“shadow budget”to cover certain COVID-related gaps, and even made a few spending reductions for expenses that were smaller this year. But these minor attempts at fiscal responsibility fell short of covering the state’s arrears; billions still remain in these offline accounts. Meanwhile, the one-time sources of revenue that made up for the state’s budget shortfalls won’t be around next year — and taxpayers will be asked to make up the difference.Instead ofcautiously reducing spendingas policy experts recommended, lawmakers chose to cover overspending with more than $2.1 billion in federal funds for Medicaid and $1.33 billion in one-time federal CARES Act money. This COVID-designated money, though, was intended for besieged restaurants and other business owners who suffered far more than government bureaucracies. Who needs federal stimulus dollars more: the many state services that barely operated this year, or the restaurants that Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenneyjust placed on restrictions again?» READ MORE:Say goodbye to your favorite restaurants. There s no relief coming. | OpinionInstead of backfilling the budget with federal CARES Act funds, Wolf and lawmakers should have considered business owners, but also families and studentsstruggling with education costsand virtual learning. After all, the pandemic has affected Pennsylvania’s countless communities in unimaginable ways. But lawmakers treated these dollars like a briefcase full of cash that nobody would miss — while passing a 7.5% increase in spending over last year. In 2021, taxpayers should prepare for the likelihood of proposed tax hikes.Clearly, Pennsylvania’s elected officials have misused federal funds — and the U.S. Treasury Department agrees. Indeed, its guidance for CARES Act spending limits possible uses to COVID-related expenses;they have already rejected one of Wolf’s earlier plansto use the money as a replacement for slot machine revenue. The act also prohibits use for Medicaid payments or employee salaries unrelated to COVID work. If the federal government rejects the budget, the state will find itself confronting a significant predicament.Sadly, Wolf and the legislature didn’t consider these eventualities when they completed the budget. Instead, during this bleak holiday season, they set up struggling families for a bigger tax bill next year.Nathan Benefield is vice president and chief operating officer of the Commonwealth Foundation.

minnpost_2020_220,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There’s a second pandemic on the horizon: one that doesn’t involve PPE, ventilators or ICU beds, but requires society to take a hard look at mental illness and suicide rates. We’ve heard experts far and wide forewarn the coming mental health pandemic stemming from COVID-19, and I’ll join them: The fear, anxiety and isolation of our time is simply unlike anything I’ve seen in my 35 years working in the mental health space.September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, and this year, we are faced with an unprecedented mental health crisis. The fear and isolation of COVID, the disruptions to our businesses, families, children and educational systems, and, of course, the unrest and trauma so present in our communities has pushed mightily on our resilience, our sense of safety and our hope. One unexpected aspect to this unusual place we all find ourselves in is the spotlight it’s shined on mental health. More people are recognizing that weallhave mental health, and the importance of supporting mental health throughout our communities has never been more important than it is right now.In Minnesota, suicide is our eighth leading cause of death – taking the lives of hundreds in our state each year. We should be ashamed at these high suicide rates, but instead, we somehow think it’s still a pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps kind of issue, or worse yet, one we are exempt from actually discussing. A complete void of hope is akin to mental starvation. We work hard as a society to prevent nutritional starvation; suicide demands the same call-to-action.So how can we help our communities proactively prevent a scourge of suicides It starts by learning to recognize common signs of those struggling (feelings of hopelessness, withdrawing from family and friends, trouble sleeping and eating, etc. and building out resources to help. Additionally, we need to target particularly high-risk groups: frontline workers; those who are unemployed; folks experiencing homelessness; Black, Indigenous and other people of color (BIPOC ; our youth; and those with a history of behavioral health conditions, to name a few. By taking these steps, we can help ensure everyone in our community has access to psychological support, and that we’re not missing opportunities for early prevention and intervention.Achieving whole-community health starts with promoting whole-person health and recognizing that our mental health is just as important as our physical health. One of our behavioral health care system’s most foundational opportunities is to eliminate the silos that exist and strive to see, understand and treat the whole person.If we want to truly provide the best care and be most effective with our programs and funding, wehaveto transform our approach to meet an individual’s entire set of needs. Mental illness risk-factors, diagnoses and symptoms are not siloed, and to effectively treat someone, our health care system can’t be either.This concept is not new toPeople Incorporated– in 2016 we became recognized as a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC . A CCBHC is designed to integrate the needs of our clients. In many cases, this can occur within the confines of our services, and in other cases it comes from innovative collaborations across organizations and service areas.If managing through the COVID pandemic taught us anything, it’s the power of partnership. We are, in fact, all in this together, and when we act in unison, our ability to effectuate real impact is unparalleled. If we truly commit our collective energy to healing, advocating, impacting, and educating, imagine how we might impact the unacceptable suicide statistics here in Minnesota and beyond.Our call to action is simple: to ensure we all do what we can to guarantee that no one is without hope.If you or someone you know needs immediate help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.Jill Wiedemann-West is CEO of People Incorporated, Minnesota’s largest community-based provider of mental health services."

While the Virginian-Pilot goes into detail into the current situation among many high-school graduates, it does not elaborate on the overall hardships undertaken by each student individually.As a mother of a high school graduate and one senior middle school student, I have seen the problems and complications that may arise with such an abrupt switch to their standards of learning routine. With the change to online learning, my child has felt less personal experience or wholistic interaction with her classmates and teachers. Also, there has been a more significant challenge to communicate with administrators, as they are equally stressed and overtasked.The editorial mentions, “They The class of 2020 have had to do without most of the events and occasions that make the last semester of high school special”; however, this goes far deeper than just this statement. Many students no longer have the luxury of walking down to their counselor’s office to ask for a transcript or to run down to the main office to update their registration. Instead, students must send countless time-sensitive emails, with the hope that it will not get lost in the pile of administrative updates, questions asked by equally confused teachers, and emails from students in other grade levels.As the old saying recalls, ‘when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.’ Based on this phrase, I have seen many of the 2020 graduates make the best out of the situation given. On one side, many have learned skills to prepare for their future, whether that focuses on home economics, financial literacy or even meditation and the fine arts. Likewise, these hardworking students have used this time to find “essential” jobs, apply for more scholarships, and, most importantly, gain earnings and become closer to financial independence.While it is crucial to practice social distancing and help the community restore its health, it is also imperative to feel empathy for the young adults who cannot participate in such necessary and lifelong memories. Moreover, I applaud and congratulate the class of 2020 for their determination, their courage, and their strength during these troubling times. My pride and admiration extend to them for their resilience in this time of turmoil, and I am convinced that they will have an intelligent edge in their future endeavors.Jasmin HeerahSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_131,"Published 9:40 pm Tuesday, May 12, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceThe pictures began like any other social media post from the first generation to be obsessed with selfies.The group of young teens struck several poses using various camera filters that gave them digital hats, crowns made of flowers, or cat whiskers on their faces. Their pictures soon changed to a darker theme as each of them glared at the camera with their middle fingers extended towards the lens.We’re all familiar with this gesture, and we know what it means. This hand signal is often given towards someone or something. It’s a favorite signal for some drivers, and we’ve probably all seen it used as a way to end an argument.The pictures did not stand out to me because of the crude gesture, even if it was being used by middle school-aged kids. What made it stand out was that there was no text in the post. They were not expressing their anger or hatred towards anyone or anything. They were simply flipping off the world.Teenagers being angry at the establishment, their parents, or their government is nothing new. The generation gap often creates some strife. This generation’s anger, however, seems different than a lot of the generations in the past. Kids in this generation are getting angry earlier in life, and they often do not know exactly why they are angry.This can be difficult for those who work with kids and teens. Is it possible to help children who are angry at the world, especially if they aren’t sure why they are angry? I believe it is, but there are a few things we must consider before we attempt to help them.We should begin by trying to understand why they are angry. It might just be the typical teenage rebellion, but there are often other scenarios in their lives that have worked to build their anger. I knew two of the teens in the pictures I was seeing, and I knew a lot of their backstories. I did not like how they were expressing their anger, but I could understand what led to their anger. Life has not been easy for either one of them. They have more sad stories than I can share in today’s column. Too often, we discount their anger instead of trying to understand why they are angry in the first place.We should also realize that many of the youth who are angry at the world have never been taught how to deal with their anger. Many have not had parents who have trained them how to work through situations that make them upset or how to deal with people who make them angry. A lot of them have grown up watching the adults in their lives handle anger through abusive language, poor behavior, screaming, fighting, or giving the bird to the world. It’s all they know.Every child’s situation is unique, so there is no template on how to help a teen who is angry at the world, but taking these steps will give us a better idea on how to move forward.We can give our best effort to help them only once we have done what we can to learn what might have led to their anger and looked to see if they have ever had the opportunity to learn how to deal with that anger.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

minnpost_2020_81,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .My fellow white Minnesotans, we see in George Floyd’s agony and Derek Chauvin’s casual cruelty what we must see. Our fellow Minnesotans’ lives are threatened by the very systems we have built. Black, brown and Indigenous Minnesotans told us this, but we did not hear. We must now listen and act to build a new Minnesota.I’m from southwest Minnesota. I moved to the Twin Cities for college and stayed to work and raise a family. My hometown, Marshall, as Ahmed Yusef noted in his book “Somalis in Minnesota,” is the first Minnesota town that offered good jobs and schools to Somali families.As a Norwegian Lutheran, I have benefited from everything Minnesota offers. Marshall High School gave me the foundation to study at Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship and Governor Rudy Perpich appointed me to chair the state commission that led to MinnesotaCare the week I had my first child. I served in a senior position at a Fortune 500 company working on Medicare and Medicaid and in a top Obama administration global health position. Today my work as a global nonprofit CEO takes me more often to west Africa than western Minnesota. And in quiet moments at night, wherever I am, my mind goes to the prairies of Lyon County.My three sons are St. Paul Central High School graduates and I know that a police traffic stop will not cost their life as it did their fellow Central graduate Philando Castile. I have never feared that my sons will call for me under a police officer’s knee.Like many white Minnesotans, I saw these inequities, but I didn’t see them well enough. My love for what is exceptional about Minnesota blinded me. I thank young Minnesotans for their relentless leadership in protest that forces clarity and action. Every Minnesotan should have every opportunity that has been afforded to me, my sons and other white Minnesotans.To witness Holy Trinity Lutheran Church surrounded by fires and yet providing first aid, food and refuge shows how Minnesota Lutherans statewide can support communities of color. On Lake Street and University Avenue, Minnesotans set the tone for America by responding to the protests with work gloves, brooms and mutual aid.This spirit of hard work and generosity now must become action in daily life, at work, and in legislation so that Minnesota is for all of us. A young Black protester interviewed by WCCO’s Mike Max at Bobby and Steve’s Auto World pointed out in the midst of protests about racial inequities that he and the white National Guard citizen-soldier next to him both had families they wanted to go home to. The pandemic shows us that we can act quickly to save each other’s lives.In 2014, I married again, and my husband is an American Muslim. This wonderful personal event gave me new perspective.We can understand each other even though our lives and our histories are different. Dr. Ayaz Virji, a Dawson physician, and the Rev. Mandy France, a rural Minnesota Lutheran pastor, launched“Love They Neighbor” conversationsso Christians and Muslims could get to know each other. This listening is to each other not just to the loudest voice or the angriest voice. A statewide conversation between every race and religion, urban and rural, of every income and age is essential.And conversations need to lead to actions to change our schools, companies, criminal justice and health care systems so Black, brown and Indigenous Minnesotans have the same opportunities that white Minnesotans have.Minnesotans, we have a choice. We can be the byword for racial injustice, or we can show this country how to be a more perfect union. It is now up to us.Lois Quam grew up in Marshall, Minnesota, and lives now in Washington, D.C., and St. Paul."
suffolknewsherald_2020_218,"Published 6:35 pm Tuesday, September 22, 2020ByStaff ReportsIt truly is a message of love when churches come together to provide material necessities for those less fortunate in their community.Members of Metropolitan Baptist Church recently spent part of their Saturday giving out clothing, canned goods, school supplies and other needs in the parking lot of the church. They held the event outside, wore masks and kept their distance from one another and from guests so that everyone would stay safe.The church’s members and ministries all pitched in to make this event happen, with church members supplying all of the donations and and the ministries, deacons and trustees helping out as well.That truly is what it’s all about. Christians are instructed dozens of times in the Bible to love our neighbor and to help others. Probably one of the best-known verses on this topic is Matthew 25:35-40: For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.’ “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’ “The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’The Rev. Donald Everett, youth pastor of education at the church, summed up nicely the purpose behind the giveaway.“If people are searching for what the church is, this is it,” Everett said. “It is Christ’s love shown through giving and love. This is the time for us to show what Christ has put into us during these times. This is not for show, but a message of love.”We thank the members of Metropolitan for answering the call to help others.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_78,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As Human Rights Day is honored around the world today, I join in with a mix of powerful emotions. Relief. Guarded optimism. And, most certainly, hope. After nearly four years of witnessing and fighting against the wholesale attacks on human rightsby the outgoing administration, my colleagues and I look to commitments that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have made not only to undo the damage the Trump administration has done, but, in their words, tobuild back better. There is hope within these promises. For survivors of torture like our clients, Inauguration Day cannot come soon enough.The theme of this year’sHuman Rights Daytracks closely what Biden and Harris have pledged: “Recover Better.” We know something about recovery at the Center for Victims of Torture, where for 35 years our work has focused on healing for refugees and asylum seekers who have survived torture and war atrocities.Recovery is hard work. For our clients, it often means finding their way to CVT when the time is right for them to take that first step toward healing. Recovery happens with attention to all aspects of a survivor’s life — assessment with a clinician, months and sometimes years of counseling, and, in some cases, physiotherapy. For many survivors, medical care is required. Daily needs must be attended to. Families cared for. And this year has added both a prohibitive pandemic and restricted travel, which means the hope of reunification with loved ones has been deferred for many. Recovery is a long process, and hope for reunification is often what keeps many of our clients going. Combine all of these factors with the increased marginalization inflicted upon survivors in the past year, and even securing food, shelter or clothing — survival itself — becomes more difficult.For a nation, the road to recovery in the broader context of human rights is similarly challenging. Even if through the narrow lens of immigration, Biden and Harris will face the daunting reality that the Trump administration has implementedmore than 400executive actions on immigration, accompanied by the outgoing president’s relentless efforts to poison institutional culture accordingly.True recovery of our values and standing as a nation of welcome must include the immediate reversal of cruel and discriminatory policies aimed largely at those fleeing persecution, which have only exacerbated the trauma borne by women, men and children who have been thwarted in their pursuit of safety. Those policies then need to be replaced by ones that don’t just return to the pre-Trump status quo, but improve upon it.As a candidate, Bidenvowedto “end prolonged detention and reinvest in a case management program.” That’s a very good start, but immigration detention should be phased out entirely. The mental, physical and spiritual health of asylum seekers and other immigrants — children and adults alike — depends on it.Biden and Harris have an overwhelming amount of work to do to make things right given the sheer number of heinous anti-immigration, anti-asylum and anti-refugee policies the Trump administration has levied — and this work on top of confronting crises ranging from the pandemic, to racial justice, to the economy, to climate change. It is gratifying to see “asylum” noted over and over again in the Biden/Harrisfirst 100 days plan, including acknowledgment that victims of gang and domestic violence are in need of protections, that members of the LGBTQ communities have been targeted, and that the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols are at the top of the list of hateful policies to be eradicated.I’ve worked in the humanitarian field for decades, through a number of administrations, and I know better than to take promises at face value. So let’s say I am cautiously optimistic about what Biden and Harris will accomplish. But I cannot deny that my heart aches a little less just knowing that they seem to hold more of the same values that CVT represents. As one of our clients expressed following the election, “Maybe there’s a chance for me with the new administration. A new government is coming and no one knows what will change, but it gives me hope.” And hope has been hard to come by for a long while.On Dec. 10 more than 70 years ago, 48 UN member states created theUniversal Declaration of Human Rights(UDHR , a groundbreaking document declaring elemental human rights for all people throughout the world. Among these principles is Article 5, which states, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,” and Article 14, “Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.” For millions around the world, these rights are self-evident and unquestioned — but the last four years have shaken all of us as we’ve witnessed attempts to destroy them. The Biden/Harris administration offers hope for greater attention to the values enshrined in the UDHR. And hope is foundational to recovery.Curt Goering is the executive director of theCenter for Victims of Torture."

Donald McEachinAs I write this in early May, we have entered the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the second month of Gov. Ralph Northam’s stay-at-home order. Most of us are tired of being at home, tired of being separated from family and friends and frightened of both the virus and the cratering economy.In compliance with both state orders and orders in the District of Columbia, my offices are closed, but we are all working remotely. We are here for you and eager to help. If you have an issue or a problem with a federal agency, my office is happy to help. Just go to my website, mceachin.house.gov, to get started. We are also happy to record your opinion on any news topic.Last month, while I could not physically be out and around the district, I’ve hosted several virtual events to inform and assist constituents. We had a roundtable with small business owners to hear directly from them about their concerns and needs. I also had a tele-town hall with experts to help with coronavirus concerns. If you have further questions, feel free to post them on Twitter, and I’ll get you answers.In early May, I held a virtual panel about at-home schooling. I know many parents are struggling with this new responsibility, and children are struggling with distance learning over the internet. We were fortunate to be joined by Atif Qarni, the Virginia Secretary of Education, Jason Kamras, Richmond Superintendent of Schools and several prominent teachers including Rodney Robinson, former Richmond teacher and National Teacher of the Year.As this pandemic continues, we are all becoming increasingly aware and appreciative of our frontline and essential workers and the critical jobs they do. Health care workers, grocery store employees, farmers, food processing workers, senior center staff, trash collectors, mail delivery persons and many more keep us going in these difficult times. We thank them and honor their service.But I know there are many more folks in our district who are working hard to make a difference, to pay it forward, to help all of us get through this. And while they are most frequently anonymous and not looking for praise, I have started a thank-a-neighbor program. If you know someone in your community who is making a difference during these trying times, we want to be able to shout them out and give them a public thank you.

Please email a high-quality photo of artwork to VA04.Projects@mail.house.gov.Pre-registration for the Congressional App Challenge, where high schoolers develop apps for the computer, is also open now and once students have signed up, they can start coding immediately. Information on all of the above programs can be found on my website at mceachin.house.gov.My congressional colleagues and I may be working remotely but we are, nonetheless, busy working on legislation to mitigate the problems Americans are facing in this pandemic. I have led on a series of letters, including working to increase funding for nursing facilities and assisted living centers, funding for higher education and supporting the shipbuilding industry. I have also led on letters to highlight the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and on low-income families.We have now turned our attention to more legislation to help with ongoing impacts of the virus. I am particularly concerned about getting funding to states and localities. Without state and local funding, many critical and hard-working employees will go unpaid and unable to take care of their families. We depend on them every day, and we need to make sure they know they will get their hard-earned paychecks.Please know my office and I are here to serve you during these disquieting and unsure times.

That there are times that our lives seem as though they have turned upside down. It seems like our lives are falling apart. Every time we look at the news, and we hear so much that is going on negatively, it sometimes can pull us in a negative and depressing direction.The Hebrew writer tells us that there are times in our lives when things will come and seem unpleasant. Sometimes events will occur and make us feel like waving our white flag, saying, “I surrender.” Life’s roller coasters can sometimes make you want to say, “I quit.” But you have to remember that what you’re dealing with at times, and what you may be facing in this current season, could possibly be the vehicle that takes your life to another level.God uses certain experiences to turn us and advance us forward. Learn to stay positive in every happening, knowing that the Lord has the last say so of all of your happenings. When we put our life into His hands, He will surely take care of you. Learn to trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all of your ways, acknowledge Him, and He will direct your path.Stay positive, be encouraged and keep an upbeat attitude. Trust God, even in the midst of negative times, and He will never fail you. Don’t allow your flesh to lead you into something that you will eventually regret. He has your life already planned out.

minnpost_2020_148,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Almost every summer since 1859, the Great Minnesota Get-Together has unfolded on a sacred piece of property in St. Paul, bringing people from across the state and the nation to walk its hallowed grounds. Not this year. When the State Fair Board announced last week that it would cancel the 2020 fair because of COVID-19, Minnesotans discovered the latest fair offerings: Disappointment-on-a-Stick, Anger-on-a-Stick and Relief-on-a-Stick.On May 21, the Star Tribuneasked readersonline whether the Minnesota State Fair should be held this year. When I checked at 8:30 a.m., the poll was running 65 percent no and 20 percent yes and the rest asking for the decision to be postponed until a later date. By the time I looked again at 5 p.m., the numbers were running just about 50-50 with those favoring having the fair slightly outnumbering those who thought it should be canceled this year. Like everything else about dealing with a global pandemic, we are discovering that self-interest often eclipses communal health.Don’t get me wrong, I love the State Fair. Since 1986, when Phyllis and I took a 2-month-old in a stroller through the fair, until last year, the fair was not to be missed — except if Rosh Hashanah was earlier in September. Those years the closest I could get to the fair was often a gift of a few Sweet Martha’s cookies (certified Kosher no less upon my family’s return.The fair is one of the last great gatherings where people are all treated alike. Sports used to be that place. But when folks realized that club seating and luxury boxes and suites could be used for making business deals while watching a game, the bleachers became places for the “bums” and the suites became places for the powerful. From neighborhoods to schools to organizations, economic stratification is evident at every turn in America.On the streets of the state fairgrounds, you see a Minnesota walking together that you never see anywhere else. You realize that Minnesota is not a homogenous blend of Scandinavians or people with ancestors simply from Western Europe, but a multicultural state of folks all seeking the good life that it has to offer.

Beyond that, Biden has called for a teacher-oriented Department of Education and is reportedly considering the former head of the biggest teachers union, and the current head of the second-biggest, for his Cabinet.By the looks of it, President-elect Joe Biden’s administration will be among the most teacher-friendly in history — and not just because incoming first lady Jill Biden, who plans to continue teaching, will arguably be the most important voice in the president’s ear. Beyond that, Biden has called for a teacher-oriented Department of Education and is reportedly considering the former head of the biggest teachers union, and the current head of the second-biggest, for his Cabinet.Unquestionably, educators deserve greater support. But Biden should remember that what’s good for teachers unions isn’t necessarily what’s best for students.Biden’s first challenge will be enacting another coronavirus relief package that includes aid for state and local governments, which may be forced to cut education funding thanks to sharp declines in tax revenue. Combined with the added costs of keeping schools open during a pandemic that could be a devastating blow. The president-elect should aim to reach a commonsense deal on a new bill as quickly as possible.Biden’s next test will be ensuring that schools can stay open. During the campaign, his team has released a five-point “road map” for doing so that aims to set national safety standards while granting plenty of leeway to state and local authorities. That’s a sound strategy, but he should be sure to discourage arbitrary decision-making by school districts and press for following science-based metrics.Longer term, Biden will have a chance to make his mark on education policy more broadly. More funding for public schools is at the top of his agenda. But as decades of experience has shown, money alone won’t fix the problems. Here Biden should follow the example of his former boss, President Barack Obama.Beyond increased funds, the Obama administration also made accountability a central goal of its education policy. It encouraged the use of test scores to evaluate teachers and embraced objective measures to address the achievement gap between minority and white students.Following up on these efforts won’t be easy for Biden. Unions largely hated the measures, and progressives are increasingly hostile to the very concept of objective student evaluations. Biden himself has expressed skepticism about so-called high-stakes testing. So far, though, he has resisted the demands from some in his party to waive federal testing requirements during the pandemic. He should stand firm: Without meaningful metrics, progress in education isn’t possible.A final goal for Biden should be the expansion of high-quality charter schools. Obama used his Race to the Top initiative to encourage such schools to flourish alongside more traditional ones. Teachers unions’ have since waged war against the idea, and Biden has said he’s “not a charter school fan.” But given the success that many have demonstrated, it makes little sense to oppose them categorically. On this score, Biden would do well to listen to parents from Black communities — especially those in New York and California — who can point to the invaluable role charters have played in their children’s development.In tackling these challenges, Biden will no doubt come under pressure from unions, his political opponents and the increasingly strident ideologues within in his own party. He should remember the one constituency that really matters: America’s children.— Bloomberg Opinion"
eugeneweekly_2020_29,"We ve got issues. These words are only my own. The last time someone called me “nigger” out loud was 1976. It was broad daylight and I was a sophomore at Mountain Home High School in Mountain Home, Idaho. There, the little white boys and girls who lived in town wore cowboy boots, drove trucks, spit tobacco juice in the drinking fountains and raised livestock as some sort of hobby. My family lived on the Air Force base near the town. Air Force kids came from everywhere, had lived everywhere. We were safe for each other. The tobacco-spitters knew that we were destined to leave the dusty-podunk-nowhere town sitting in its own homegrown dust. He was not bright at all. I helped him pass English. And when he said it, I didn’t hear it. It registered as sound, as utterance, but not as an actual word. Once it hit the air, it tore through my skull; lodged itself between my eyes. Then, I understood that “nigger” was a weapon. Their weapon. White people’s weapon. It made me undeniably black. Finally. Inside, outside, in my guts, in my brains. And although I will never forget that searing revelation of my black-blackness, I had never really thought that it would mark me as quarry in the same way it marked my slave ancestors. Then, one day a former cohort of mine at the University of Oregon casually asked me, “What is your personal politics of race?” What? What the hell is that? Does she not see my skin? Is this woman serious? Should I get one? (Oh, God! I probably need to read more books. Like, Judith Butler, maybe? Or… what was that other woman’s name? Although I was stymied by her question back then, my understanding of it now is like smooth stone. That textbook-based version of a personal politics of race is a luxury I cannot afford. My so-called personal politics of race is no longer just mine nor is it solely personal. It is no longer some gauzy, ethereal consideration blithely discussed by so-called progressives (tenured or not at heady academic conferences where everyone is a doctor of something or other. No. When Amadou Diallo (may the angels cradle him was murdered during my first year of graduate school, the phrase personal politics of race came to mean keeping myself safe because my life could be stubbed out like a cigarette. God, rest your child, Sandra Bland. Or that a white someone, a white anyone, could shoot me dead in a well-lit parking lot or a dark cavernous alley for be-ing. Black. Woman. Unarmed. Trayvon Martin was just a kid. My personal politics of race means keeping my phone charged, camera ready in case I need or need to be a witness. And I will not roll my window down without calling an ally and waiting for them to arrive if I am stopped by a police officer while in the car alone. Not. Anymore. Personal politics of race means crossing to the other side of the street at the sight of two or three or five or 12 white, college-age men walking toward me on the sidewalk in order to stay alive. Yes. Yes, it does. My inner universe howled when George Floyd was murdered by a white police officer who placed his knee on George Floyd’s neck until George Floyd was lifeless. Gone. We. All. Watched. His. Soul. Vacate. That. Street. Flew away from the white man and the camera phones and the screaming for his mama, just like in the Negro spirituals. Mr. Floyd, face down and dead, winged it directly into the arms of his Jesus. My mother cautioned us against becoming “militant” sometime in the ’70s when my glorious Aunt Margaret told us that afros should be proudly worn, that blackness meant something way cooler than plain ordinary anything else. She said it meant my brothers were kings and that my sisters, Wendy and Terri and I were queens. Blackness was a gift from God. That our Africa was everyone’s beginning. It meant dashikis and soul of rhythm were all guaranteed to me, to us, because of our lovely blackness. It meant feeling good in my skin all the way down to my chocolate toes. Militant? Me? Ph.D. in Comparative Literature me? You have to know this: All the killing has changed me. Seeing black people die over and over and over again. Day after year, after dawn, after dusk, after vigil after rally, after riot, after hashtag, after prayers, after rage, after no sleep nights and someone do something, after white people and other people turning a blind ear. The murder of black men and women has changed me. Exhausted me. Altered who I am in America. My burden is now, and has always been, yours. You are not obligated to believe me. Just look around. Witness what we have all become. To see this killing and keep your silence is an injustice to your humanity and to whatever soul you think you have. You cannot hide from this. Goddammit.

minnpost_2020_97,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .There is overwhelming support from teachers, parents, and youth for incorporating climate change in K-12 education, as seen in recent surveys. Yet state education standards continue to lag behind.In June, New Jersey became the first state to fully integrate climate change education in all subject areas and grade levels — a major accomplishment and only the beginning of climate change education’s journey into the public school system nationwide.Education standards are developed at the state level, with specific curricula and lesson plans developed at the district and teacher level. When we look at the nation as a whole, climate change education is a patchwork across states and counties — with full integration in some areas and partial or no integration in others.Today, 44 states, representing 71% of U.S. students, have science education standards that include climate change in some form. Unfortunately, there is a misconception that climate change is only a science topic. We have learned that climate change education is best when taught across subjects, because the solutions to climate change are interdisciplinary and require knowledge and skills in geography, writing, art, and health in addition to science and technology.Minnesota’s science standards also go one step further by asking teachers to include multiple “ways of knowing,” which is the method through which knowledge becomes apparent to a group of people. Historically, science has been the main method for people to learn about climate; however, we now know that climate change impacts and solutions demand our understanding of Indigenous ways of knowing (for example, Traditional Ecological Knowledge , environmental justice and anti-racism, and social and gender biases. Climate change solutions must incorporate the experiences of marginalized communities to progress our collective path forward, and provide examples of Black and brown faces doing research — faces that are critical to climate change solutions, yet those that are not represented by Western science.So once a state’s standards have changed, how do teachers start integrating climate change education into their lesson plans It’s not as easy as you may think.Funding is often lacking or deprioritized for teacher professional development around climate change education, which is an impediment to teachers receiving the full support they need to effectively integrate climate change education into their lesson plans.Washington state has integrated climate change into its science curriculum and, in response, its legislature allocated $4 million for Climate Science Education to support teachers and community-based organizations throughout the state. This resulted in ClimeTime, a collaboration between school and community-based organizations that creates professional development opportunities mostly offered for free to teachers and funds grantees to create additional support material for teachers in the state of Washington.In other states, legislative funds are still being argued about and withheld from educators, even after the education standards have changed.This disconnect is where informal educators and community-based organizations are key.Community-based organizations that focus on creating interdisciplinary climate change education resources and professional development opportunities provide support and guidance to teachers who want and need to teach about climate change.For the past 15 years, Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy has offered a three-day institute to empower and equip teachers with the resources and information they need to effectively teach about the scientific and social solutions to climate change.Next month, Climate Generation is partnering with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA and The Wild Center’s Youth Climate Program, to host the Stay-In-Stitute for Climate Change Education, a robust, virtual climate change education training for teachers across the nation on July 22-24.Wondering what can you do to helpIf you are one of the millions of people who support the inclusion of climate change into your classrooms, submit resolutions to your school board or city council, make sure you vote for legislators who support climate initiatives, sign up to participate in your local standards revision process, and show support to your teachers through emails or donations to their trusted nonprofit organizations!

philinquirer_2020_17,"It is long past time for NATO to become a political issue in our domestic politics.Eight months ago, mere weeks before the first case of COVID-19, I was in London meeting with my fellow NATO parliamentarians at one of our regularly scheduled gatherings. While we did not know it at the time, it would be our last meeting for the foreseeable future, and perhaps ever.The mood was ostensibly festive, but nervous not far beneath the surface. We, the elected members of Congress and parliaments of the 29 NATO countries, gathered to discuss the most pressing issues facing the NATO alliance. But we were also there to celebrate a special anniversary, forNATO was turning 70. And yet, gallows humor could be overheard in many of the conversations.“Let’s enjoy our 70th birthday, since we don’t know if we’ll make it to 75,” was the commonly made quip. I heard it several times. I was struck by how many of my British, German, and French colleagues openly expressed this view. It did not matter if the individuals were of the left or right parties in their respective countries. The pessimism about NATO’s future ran across the ideological spectrum. As a German friend, who has served in the Bundestag for many years and is proudly pro-American said to me, “Brendan, I love American politics and follow it closely. We both know that if Trump wins again then NATO is finished.”To me, the dire outlook for NATO was striking, and dangerous. Our traditional allies are planning for a near future in which the United States no longer leads the Western alliance. It is time for Americans to wake up to this reality and that this is not in our interest.The NATO alliance has come to the defense of the United States many times over the years. In fact, the only country to ever invoke Article 5, NATO’s collective defense clause, was the United States after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. NATO forces deployed thousands of troops to military operations, such as Afghanistan, where more than 1,100 non-U.S. NATO forces have been killed. NATO also supports and contributes to the U.S.-led counter-ISIS coalition. Most recently, NATO’s cybersecurity cooperation across the alliance will be key as cyberattacks pummel across sovereign lines.Generally, on the bulk of issues, we tend to be more alarmist than is usually warranted. But on this issue, it is quite the opposite. Tectonic, permanent shifts are happening in our post-World War II alliances while we are sleepwalking.President Trump continues to attack our allies and cozy up to dictators, which impacts all of us. He has attacked Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Denmark, and Sweden. Yet, he has praised dictators such as Putin, Duterte, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un, and Erdogan. Due to these actions, our allies are losing faith. The backlash is evident in situations like our European allies resisting American request to reject technology from the Chinese company Huawei in 5G networks. In an interview, the retiring French Ambassador to the United States said, “The current president doesn’t care about the West. He is a nationalist. He is America alone.” This is not what we want for our country. It is our allies and alliances like NATO that deter mutual security threats ranging from Russian expansion to global terrorism. We can’t and shouldn’t “go it alone” as Trump urges.It is long past time for NATO to become a political issue in our domestic politics. In the Trump era, the former bipartisan consensus for leading the West has entirely broken apart. In the Trumpist Republican Party, there is no defense of the Western alliance. Reaganism has no home in today’s GOP.Those who believe, as I do, the world is best at peace and secure with the United States firmly in the lead of the western democracies, find only one party embracing this view. Therefore, unlike in any previous election, we must proclaim this view explicitly, for it is under mortal to an empty and dangerous populism. The world we have known and led since the end of World War II hangs in the balance.Brendan F.

philinquirer_2020_2,"Educators have been asked to take on even more roles and responsibilities with little adjustment in support, training, or compensation.The Philadelphia School District announced Tuesday it would halt its plan to start reopening classrooms Nov. 30. The Board of Education approved the plan on July 30, in a vote that had been postponed after an eight-hour board meeting the week before. But tensions between the board and its educators have been building since schools closed suddenly in March. Without better efforts from the board and district, those tensions will continue.Educators have expressed their concerns about reopening school buildings in a plurality-Black school district that has lacked adequate funding for decades. This confluence of race, class, and health exacerbates concerns around who is making decisions about the district’s plan and who will actually suffer the consequences of those decisions. During this pause in reopening, the district must address outstanding safety concerns that have long been ignored by leadership that has notclearly communicatedwith its constituents in the past. It needs to prioritize decision-making informed by the experiences of those who spend the most time in school facilities and classrooms.» READ MORE:Philly schools to remain fully virtual until further noticeThe July 23 meeting, at which more than 150 students, educators, and community members registered to virtually speak, drew a swift and largely unified community response to the reopening plan: The district could not reopen schools safely given theexisting conditions of school facilities(including ventilation systems , thehigh socioeconomic needs of students, and thesignificant personnel needsin hybrid education models, such as more paraprofessional, technical, health, and custodial support to maintain separate cohorts. While no one can deny the limitations of online learning, the district’s (and board’s desire to rush back to classrooms has further eroded the trust of one of its key stakeholders: Philadelphia’s public school educators.At risk here is thelong-term healthof students, educators, caregivers, and their households and communities. Philadelphia’s long legacy of segregation has ensured that the least white, least affluent, and least healthy populations are in close proximity, andthese communities are the majority of the school district’s student population. While children have lower risk of fatal outcomes from COVID-19 complications, more than 75% of allchild deaths have been Black and Latinx.These racially disparate fatalities areconsistent across age groups, suggesting that entire households must grapple with the risks from the decision to send children back into the classroom. For Black and Latinx households, these risks are weighedagainst rising unemployment ratessince the pandemic began.The original — and yet to be adjusted in public — reopening plan was meant to bring students into schools on an alternating schedule, prioritizing elementary students and students with disabilities. One cohort would attend Monday and Wednesday for one week, then Tuesday and Thursday the following week. When not in a school building, they could learn virtually at home, engaging with their in-person and virtual classmates and their educators in the classroom. Classrooms would follow distancing protocols, everyone would wear PPE, and the district would prioritize cleaning and repairing ventilation systems to consistently circulate clean air.» READ MORE:In-person teaching puts my family at risk, but the Philly School District leaves me few options | OpinionAlthough the safety realities of COVID require fewer people in classrooms at once, there was no effort to hire more educators or to restore and remediate unusable classrooms. Somehow, the plan asks educators to teach in multiple classrooms (in-person and virtual , prepare multiple lesson plans, act as a public health monitor, and run interference on any technology issues that could emerge. In essence, the educator was asked to take on even more roles and responsibilities with little adjustment in support, training, or compensation.Philadelphia educators have sacrificed a great deal in the last decade. Between state control, the foreclosure crisis, and the constant disruptions from school closures (both due tofacilityconditions anddistrict decision-making , Philadelphia educators are consistently adjusting to district, state, and federal policies and budget cuts that assume these changes have no impact on the classroom experience. We must bring them into decision-making processes early and often to maximize the limited resources at the district’s disposal, in ways that reflect the realities of our students and communities.Our school leaders must think and act as a community, seeking the greatest long-term outcomes for the largest group — here, our majority nonwhite, non-affluent students, those who educate and support them in facilities, and the households and communities where they live. COVID has also produced an opportunity for new governance structures: bringing together experts in public health, race, education, and transportation to produce policies grounded in local knowledge. City leaders, school district officials, and the Board of Education must come together to address the concerns of educators by including them in school governance.» READ MORE:What’s best for Philly schools this year?

suffolknewsherald_2020_170,"Published 6:37 pm Tuesday, November 17, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Joseph PerryHave you ever felt as though you were between a rock and a hard place?I was pumping gas in my truck last week at a convenient store. I asked a man on the other side of the gas pump how was he doing. He said, “if you really want to know, I feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place. I’m in a place I don’t really know what to do. It seems as though my life is crumpling.” I told him it sounded like he needed to take it to the Lord immediately. The man said he needed to hear that. He needed to go to God, because he hadn’t really given that a thought.If the truth be told, there are so many people who are between a rock and a hard place. If you are, you can go to the Rock Who specializes in handling hard places.That it’s important to know that we can go up to God in the midst of our being between a rock and a hard place. There are times in life, especially right now with all that life brings, so many people who are in tough places don’t even know they have a Rock to take all of their burdens to. Oftentimes people are aware, but they feel unworthy to go to the Rock. As believers of the Lord, we must express to people who we come in contact with that when we are in between a rock and a hard place, we must share with them that God makes Himself available. He has an open door policy for all to come to Him in prayer.Moses was one who was between a rock and a hard place because demands were high from the pressure of the children of Israel. Even after they had seen God use him, in leading them out of Egypt, they still grumbled. They talked about him behind his back, and some of them were bold enough to talk about him in front of his face. Some people are mean and cold, even though you’re giving everything you’ve got to help them along the way.The stress of taking them to the Promised Land. His own personal struggles as a servant, as a leader, as a family man. It was one thing to bring them out, but it was another to get them where God wanted them, with their complaints.It’s a rough place to be. It’s a rare place for some to be. But it’s a rock in a hard place for others.God’s Spirit will encourage; He will prompt us to go to God in worship, not to wander, but to worship God, to have a conference with Him — to lay it all on the table. To say, “God, it’s more than I can handle. But you brought me to this point in life, now I need you to show me how to move forward.”Have you ever been between a rock and a hard place? Have you ever been in a place that, wherever you turn, you had to work it out? One thing is for certain: God awaits us to come to Him to show us the way.There, He is able not only to grant us peace but also to allow us to sense his presence. Lastly, he will expose His glory. If we come to Him yielding ourselves and expecting Him to pour into us, we will experience His glory like never before.That when we come down, it doesn’t even matter that we are still in between our rocks and hard places. As long as the Rock is with us, we can go through life’s journey. As I told the man at the gas pump, you can go to the Rock, the Lord. Take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there.The Rev.

There are so many unseen forces that I still cannot understand. Hatred and division are coming from the right and left and I need You to be my Center, because I admit that I have wept.Tears have watered my face and my heart has felt Your distaste for the uneasiness and disharmony that has filled our collective space. I haven’t seen anything like it, although previous generations have. Only You possess the serum, the most effective healing salve.But how do we address our differences, those things that have kept us apart? We look deep down on the inside and examine the human heart. What hurts me hurts You too, if not directly, indirect. And It may be surprising to know how much our viewpoints intersect.It may take some exploration and an extreme amount of patience to turn heated disagreements into constructive conversations. The peace You give is a keeper, a maintainer of sanity. But hope can seem so fleeting when progress is hard to see.You can bring balance to a seemingly unjust scale where the emotional weights of people can seem so hard to heal. It causes me to ask, how can we move beyond our past and see changes in our nation that are strong enough to last? With You at the Center we are destined to remember the reason why we are called the land of the free.My questions are unending and I’m still in the process of sending prayer requests to heaven for a necessary mending of emotions that were battered, special bonds that were shattered, dreams that were fractured in relationships that mattered.I ask for Your guidance even in my silence. I search for words to say when it’s difficult to pray. I go down on my knees to make my emotional plea for the blessing of unity to settle on our country.Then I think of another way to get results when I pray and soon realize how much my actions need to change. Instead of making requests for things to go my way, I start paying more attention to what I do and say.Praying without ceasing is Your ultimate goal and You allow me to be blessed when things seem out of control. You acknowledge my limitations and the times I have felt anxious. You listen to my confessions as I receive important lessons. You allow my heart to grieve whenever my loved ones leave. You accept when my heart aches and when sadness has altered my face.You know when I haven’t met my goals. You’re patient just the same, not willing that I should give up, on my victories yet to claim. You hear my cry for mercy which is my biggest and best prayer. You help me go through challenges and make choices as I prepare.You meet me in the middle, a sacred space of intimacy, right in the center of Your heart is where I long to be. I’m thankful for the way in which You lead and guide me to people desiring peace and true tranquility.

minnpost_2020_236,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On June 12, after weeks of historic protest against police brutality, the Minneapolis City Council unanimously recognized that the Minneapolis Police Department threatens the safety of our city. The council acknowledged the cost, in both lives and dollars, of allowing the damage perpetrated by the police to continue. It asserted ina resolutionpassed that day that “no amount of reforms will prevent lethal violence and abuse by some members of the Police Department against members of our community, especially Black people and people of color.” The council promised Minneapolis residents a process of healing, reconciliation, and deep engagement with local communities to envision transformative change for a new structure of community safety.Three months later, the City of Minneapolis has not begun any reconciliation process nor any meaningful community engagement. Instead, the city continues to push an agenda of business as usual, including a proposal to spend $4.8 million for building renovations and lease commitments to house the Third Precinct.The killing of George Floyd is one of many atrocities in the Third Precinct’s long history of abuse (“Minneapolis’ Third Precinct served as ‘playground’ for renegade cops,”Star Tribune, June 7 . Despite paying millions of dollars between 2007 and 2017 to settle misconduct lawsuits and despite renewed public outcry after George Floyd was killed by police officers, the Minneapolis Police Department and the leaders of our city continue to avoid taking responsibility for their continued support and enactment of police brutality against Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color. To heal the rift in our community,the City of Minneapolis, the City Council, andthe Minneapolis Police Department must listen authentically to those targeted by police brutality and take responsibility for systemic police violence. A genuine and full process of reconciliation is necessary for the building of trust and for collaboratively envisioning a new system of safety that will truly protect all who call Minneapolis home.We oppose any investment in building renovations or lease commitments for the Third Precinct prior to an authentic process of reconciliation, meaningful engagement with the communities who disproportionately suffer from police brutality, and the creation of a new system of community safety for our city.Sam Taitel is a queer Black resident of Seward, martial arts instructor, and activist.Michele Braley is a Seward resident who has been involved with restorative justice for almost 20 years.

philinquirer_2020_40,"Police academy recruits should be unarmed in the first phase of their training because it would teach them to reflexively open the distance with people in crisis, use cover, and de-escalate.The killing of Walter Wallace Jr. by policeshows just how much and how little has changed in the last year in both Philadelphia and across the nation.Last November, as a Vermont chief of police and a 19-year New York Police Department veteran, I publishedan op-edin the New York Times where I argued police shouldn’t be so quick to shoot people in crisis armed with knives. I argued that police academy recruits should be unarmed in the first phase of their training because it would teach them to reflexively open the distance with people in crisis, use cover, and de-escalate. Officers would learn not to yell stress-inducing, escalatory commands because they wouldn’t have the lethal weapons that give these orders force. They could then be trained on firearms as life insurance, not problem-solving tools.Police around the country dismissed these arguments as dangerous ones that pandered to policing’s critics. Countless police academies still show recruits video after video of officers being attacked and killed under every circumstance. Many still teach recruits the fallacious “21-foot rule,” that anyone with a knife who gets within 21 feet of them can stab officers before they have time to react.

They were looking for a new police commissioner.Danielle Outlaw got the position, which she richly deserved, but my discussions with City Hall were illuminating. They had a genuine interest in reducing use of force by police but were concerned by a lack of progress. I told them that to change an agency the size of the Philadelphia Police Department would take a decade, it would require more racial and gender diversity, and it had to be doggedly sustained through the inevitable changes in administration.I know from experience that changing a police department culture is a tall order.In 2016, my police officers in Burlington, Vt., killed a schizophrenic man armed with two knives. They shot himwhen Tasers failedto safely end a four-hour standoff. The painful lessons we learned from that led us to help the Police Executive Research Forum develop and pilot apathbreaking de-escalation curriculumdesigned for armed people in crisis. It incorporates the distance, cover, de-escalation, and communication that reduce the need for split-second decisions that can lead to gunfire.Last week, the International Association of Chiefs of Police announced thata randomized controlled trialof the program in a major metropolitan police department showed it works to reduce the use of force while keeping officers safe. Yet, most of the nation’s 17,000 police departments haven’t adopted anything that resembles it.» READ MORE:Reforming police requires action, not commissions | OpinionChange in Philadelphia will require its police to get over the idea that a person in crisis with a knife is a death sentence unless they open fire. In England and Wales, where knives are the norm and beat cops don’t have guns, police rarely shoot and kill more thanfive people a year, compared with 1,000 in the U.S.The death of Walter Wallace Jr. is proof of how wide the gap has grown between what U.S. police are trained to do and the restraint the public expects of them.

minnpost_2020_237,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Council members’ pledge to reinvent policing via a vaguely worded charter amendment put the cart before the horse. A robust democratic debate depends on citizens knowing what they are voting for. Council members offered no details, no vision or models. About half the current council members were elected in 2017 on their commitments to tackle police reform and end police misconduct and brutality. Yet, following a historic crisis we find them unprepared to share their thinking on reinventing policing.In a recentStar Tribunearticle, Steve Fletcher, Third Ward council member, said that in making his pledge to support the charter amendment, “It felt important to me to not come forward with a lot of my own specifics.” What Might not his constituents like to know what he is thinking City Council President Lisa Bender, seeking to explain the council’s lack of action, said: “I think when you take a statement and then move into policy work, it gets more complicated,” Indeed, yet she and the other council members have shown scant evidence they are capable of addressing the complexity. Nevertheless they proceeded to ask the public to grant them the final word on reinventing public safety.While the council committed to a yearlong public discussion if the amendment were to pass, they balk at taking immediate steps to prevent another George Floyd. Such measures should begin with firing all the Derek Chauvins on the Minneapolis Police Department – those officers who have been involved in the death of unarmed people. To be clear, unarmed includes a person with a rock, a knife or a metal bar – objects that police have used as an excuse to use deadly force, even when nonlethal means and de-escalation tactics could have been employed.The city needs to do the right thing for those families who have not seen justice. Those officers who killed their loved ones still patrol the city. This can no longer be tolerated, nor should have been in the past. City officials and legislators representing Minneapolis should also back the demand of these families that state and county officials reopen all the cases of those killed by law enforcement.Next the city needs to terminate those officers with egregious records of brutality and those exhibiting overt racist behavior. Chauvin’s record suggests that these kinds of officers cannot be rehabilitated. Based on the MPD’s complaint backlog and anecdotal evidence, this could be several hundred, not dozens.Next, community members must be given a decisive voice in vetting officers’ records and deciding whether the officers are fit to remain on the force, especially if entrusted with deadly weapons. Anything short of this will fail to gain the public’s confidence. Such a review process also offers a place where reconciliation and trust building between neighborhoods and public safety officers could begin.MPD officers’ support for Police Officers Federation President Bob Kroll shows there is little willingness to accept public oversight. City officials must take action now; if not, they will show the city is powerless in the face of a political organization whose mission has been to protect those unfit to serve.Terminating officers would likely violate the contract with the Police Officers Federation. Injunctions would be filed. Court cases would ensue. However, city officials can be confident that Minneapolis residents would back them. Business and civic leaders also need to lend their support to city officials and Chief Medaria Arradondo in removing officers unfit to serve the city.The mayor and council also need to act on the community demand to transfer money from MPD into hiring and training of unarmed public safety personnel. A good-faith effort of $25 million could put 200 such personnel on our streets over the next few years.Each officer terminated or who retires opens the possibility to hire two well-paid public safety professionals – youth intervention workers, mental health and drug treatment counselors, and social workers. People who live and work in their communities.Now, however, city officials must demonstrate their commitment to justice. Harboring officers with records like those of Chauvin is the antithesis of such a goal. All of humanity now knows George Floyd and witnessed his death by a police officer employed by our city. After decades of failure, city officials cannot afford to fail now.Wayne Nealis is a writer and longtime peace and labor activist living in Minneapolis."
philinquirer_2020_41,"If we are going to save the next Walter Wallace Jr., we must first acknowledge that reality.When I watched the video of Walter Wallace Jr., 27, being gunned down by two Philadelphia police officers on Monday, I was overcome by sadness and rage. Then a sense of calm certainty overtook those roiling emotions, because I was sure of one thing.This would not have happened if Walter Wallace Jr. were white.My assuredness was not based on statistics, thoughBlack men are vastly overrepresented among those who are killed by police. It was not based on identity politics, though I am as Black as they come.My firm opinion that a white man in mental health crisis would not have suffered Wallace’s fate was based on the fact that in America, police give white men the benefit of the doubt. That’s true when white men are armed, like thebat-wielding white vigilantes in Fishtown who assaulted peoplein the wake of the George Floyd protests. It is true when they are white supremacists, likeDylann Roof, who was taken to Burger King by policeafter killing nine African Americans. It is true when they are mentally ill, like James Holmes, who killed 12 and injured 70 at a Batman movie premiere and was taken alive by police.» READ MORE:Walter Wallace Jr.: A Black life that mattered | Jenice ArmstrongThis is not to say that white men are never killed by police in America. It is only to acknowledge that in any number of circumstances, police officers approach white men differently than they do Black men. Take Wallace’s situation, for instance.We know thatWalter Wallace Jr. was experiencing a mental health episodewhen police were called to his family residence around 61st and Locuston Monday afternoon. We also know, through The Inquirer’s reporting, thatpolice were called to the residence two previous times that day. When officers arrived for the third call, Wallace was on the porch with a knife. He walked to the street with his mother trying to calm him down. Then, as Wallace walked toward them with a knife in hand, the two officers — who were not equipped with tasers, according to Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw — fired a barrage of at least seven bullets apiece.This, even as Wallace’s mother begged police not to shoot her son.Perhaps you can imagine a white mother imploring police not to shoot her mentally ill son and police shooting him anyway.However, I cannot.» READ MORE:Black and Blue: 190 years of police brutality against Black people in PhiladelphiaStill, there are those who even now are justifying the police killing of Walter Wallace Jr., a young Black man with a family who loved him. Among them is John McNesby, president of Fraternal Order of Police Lodge Number 5, the local police union.“Our police officers are being vilified this evening for doing their job and keeping the community safe, after being confronted by a man with a knife,” McNesby wrote in a statement on Monday evening. “We support and defend these officers, as they too are being traumatized by being involved in a fatal shooting.”McNesby’s statement, which didn’t mention Wallace’s family, went on to ask the public to have patience as the facts are gathered.That’s the problem with policing in America’s Black communities. When cops shoot Black people, their unions and enablers support the officers, no matter the circumstance. Yet they expect the public to wait for the facts to come out.That kind of hypocrisy, from police unions that support a president that African Americans overwhelmingly view as racist, is no longer acceptable. Not in the Black communities affected by police violence.» READ MORE:Police officers who killed Walter Wallace Jr. wore body cameras.

And those who are good cops — y’all gotta stand up. Those police officers that killed Walter Wallace, why are their names and pictures not out there? If that was us who killed someone , we would have names out there.”Khabir is right, but this is about so much more than simply naming names. It’s about admitting the truth.Walter Wallace Jr. would not have been subjected to a barrage of bullets, endangering bystanders and his family, if he were a white man in a white community. White mass murderers get better treatment than that, and if we are going to save the next Walter Wallace Jr., we must first acknowledge that reality."
suffolknewsherald_2020_25,"Published 6:24 pm Friday, August 7, 2020ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:HB 972 was passed recently in Virginia by the governor’s recommendation. This bill makes the possession of no more than an ounce of marijuana a civil penalty with a fine of $25. This will not be on record and will not affect a background check. The ultimate goal is to pave the way for legalization of marijuana in Virginia.Under previous laws, those who possessed a half-ounce or less of marijuana were convicted of simple possession and those with more than a half-ounce were convicted of possession with the intent to distribute. This was punishable by jail time and at least two years of supervised probation and required drug counseling. Successfully serving a sentence did not offer any reward, hope or second chances. Due to Virginia not having an expungement law, ex-offenders, even if this was their one and only criminal offense, have suffered decade after decade of lost wages, discrimination in housing, denial to join the military, denial of bonding, delayed admission to certain colleges, and much more.In regard to employment, all professional jobs have policies that automatically prohibit the hiring of someone with a drug charge, no matter how many years have passed. I know ex-offenders who have high degrees and who are initially chosen for high-paying jobs only to be turned down following a background check showing a drug conviction. Lapsed time, no matter how many years have passed, doesn’t change an employer’s mind due to policies in place.I have worked for many years now to have expungement bills presented to the General Assembly only to see these bills go to the Courts of Justice Committee and get tabled. Thousands and most likely hundreds of thousands of those having a past marijuana conviction have had all doors to professional employment that offers benefits, high wages that increase Social Security earnings, health benefits closed to them for the rest of their lives, have suffered housing discrimination, denial to join the military, etc. Many I have advocated for were convicted as a late teen, age 18 or 19. I know firsthand these who are now around the age of 40 have had all doors closed for over two decades. They have been denied in every sense their rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” They have been victims of “cruel and unusual punishment.”To institute a civil law to protect those in possession of marijuana going forward and to be considering legalization of marijuana in Virginia and at the same time not retroactively offering expungement for the convictions of past marijuana offenders, is clear discrimination. My hope is that any organization that can help speak up about this discrimination will and that citizens of Virginia will take the time to call those who represent them and call the governor to advocate for these who are the victims of this discrimination. Expungement in Virginia for marijuana convictions prior to this civil law is the only way to end this discrimination and give hope to those who have suffered for decades.Judy SmithAbingdonOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_171,"Published 6:36 pm Tuesday, November 17, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Nathan RiceMy alarm sounded, but I wasn’t ready for the day to begin, so I hit the snooze button for another 10 minutes of sleep. That snooze didn’t seem to last too long, as my alarm sounded again. I did not feel like going to work, and I began to think of all the excuses I could use to skip the daily routine. Everything that I’d rather do than go to work entered my mind, but I knew I could not entertain those ideas. I had to get out of bed, get ready for the day, and drive to work for the daily grind.That morning, and the thoughts of all that I would rather be doing instead of working, helped me better understand some teenagers with whom I had a discussion just a few days prior. One of the teens stated that he had skipped school for nearly two weeks. Another yawned before saying that she was tired because she stayed up all night playing video games and watching online videos. All of them were facing some sort of problem in their lives due to their poor decisions.I spoke with them that evening about the importance of doing what is needed to better themselves and prepare for the future. This involves making the right, and sometimes difficult, decisions to do things that we know we need to do, even if they aren’t necessarily what we want to be doing.It’s important for them to know that they need to make the right decision about things such as going to school, but the fact of the matter is that none of these decisions should have been theirs to make.Parents should be the ones who set the rules regarding school attendance, bedtimes and other important matters.It’s not just irresponsible for parents to leave teens to their own devices in these matters; it is wrong. It’s wrong to force teens to make decisions that they are not yet prepared to make. Teenagers have difficulty seeing the long-term consequences of their actions, making it difficult for them to make wise decisions. In many cases, their maturity level hasn’t yet reached the point where they should be allowed to make certain decisions.I am not implying that we should rule over our teenagers like a dictator, make every decision for them, and control every minute of their day. They should be learning how to make important decisions. However, we should be helping them learn how to make these decisions and carefully deciding what choices we allow them to make.This is also not a matter of trust. Teens who have proven themselves trustworthy may be allowed additional leeway in decision making, but it does not mean that we no longer need to be parents. Even responsible teens need our assistance, as well as rules and guidelines they must follow. Removing a teen’s ability to make certain decisions, such as whether to go to school, is a matter of protection. It’s about teaching them, raising them, and giving them the best chance to become independent adults.Teenagers will never admit that they need adult supervision, but they do. It’s irresponsible and wrong to force them to make decisions that they should not have to make.Nathan Rice is a Hampton Roads native and can be reached at nrice@abnb.org.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2020_16,"Stanford s famed marshmallow experiment has real-world implications for pandemic response.Of all of the uniquely American failures these last four months of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, none were more consequential than reopening too soon. Instead of waiting for the cases to subside sufficiently, we dined, traveled, and shopped prematurely, even onPresident Donald Trump’s own criteria. Reflecting on this specific failure, it is not too early — or too late — to learn lessons that will save lives.The famedStanford Marshmallow Experimenthas a deceptively simple setup and a powerful punchline. Place a marshmallow or other sweet in front of a child. Promise the child that, if they wait to consume the treat, they will receive double the reward. Data reveal that children who withstood the temptation are more likely to succeed later in life. This maxim — that self-discipline is virtuous — feels painfully obvious during this roller-coaster ascent of new infections. Had we held the line during the case plateau, we would be eating the second marshmallow of expanded commerce and ample ICU capacity.But we must also consider the second lesson of the marshmallow experiment, one that has only been learned recently.New researchhas shown there is more to the original findings, which may have been confounded by the sample of children. Subsequent experiments reveal that both the educational and socioeconomic background of the particular child and their family impacts their capacity for self-control and its “value” later in life. Once you account for key factors in a child’s life, the virtue of delaying gratification looks less pronounced and more complex.New theories abound as to why the effect varies across class, but it may reflect anxieties about the unknown. As Jessica Calarcowrote for the Atlantic in 2018, “there might be food in the pantry today, but not tomorrow, so there is a risk that comes with waiting.” For some children, eating the marshmallow immediately may be a prudent strategy — not a lack of self-discipline.Similarly, the cost of the pandemic’s social distancing guidelines — the cost of waiting — has never been felt equally across the country. Millions work in jobs that rely on physical commerce and face-to-face interaction, sectors that have been decimated. If your employment was not impacted directly, perhaps your life was disrupted by round-the-clock child care without the reprieve of school or camp.For many Americans, the choice to wait and reopen was hardly a function of boredom or self-control. It was a tightrope walk of stress, anxiety, and the real possibility of financial ruin or homelessness. Unsurprising, then, that the choice became an avatar for existing political and ideological differences.The new, nuanced conclusions of the marshmallow experiment affirm the value of delayed gratification across class status and underscore the pressures facing the country in its exercise of self-control. It is much easier to endure stringent measures like lockdowns when there is both a collective sense of purpose in doing so and a social safety net that supports people during the necessary months of deprivation.We need leaders to rally the country’s self-discipline and make it laudable. We need additional financial relief to alleviate the fear of eviction and hunger. These actions will make it easier for every American to hold the line in their personal choices on a daily basis. While our coronavirus experience has thus far been a story of chaos and grief, the window of opportunity for minimizing suffering never truly closes.Poll a group of children if they would rather have one marshmallow or two, and the consensus will be clear. The decision to reopen the economy is assuredly more complex. But the choice between the economy and our public healthis ultimately a false one. The only solution to the pandemic and its economic calamity is, quite simply, to try our hardest to contain the pandemic.Appreciating the full arc of the marshmallow experiment means not only choosing to endure a little longer but working to help the Americans for whom the choice to wait is most difficult.Ezekiel J. Emanuel is the vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, where Connor Boyle is a researcher in the department of medical ethics and health policy."

minnpost_2020_79,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The introduction of COVID-19 into our society forced a 183-year-old public education system to change in a matter of days. And, change we did. School districts across Minnesota quickly looked at the needs of students, the resources available, and went into action. Fortunately for some of us, we have been pushing the public education system to morph and change for a number of years. The model we are using to foster this change is the community schools model. This nationally recognized model is a strategy for equity that aligns school and community resources for student success. The model highlights the assets of our students and families, specifically their voices, and creates opportunities for partnership and collaboration.With our understanding and implementation of the community schools model, we went to work to support our students and families across the district. We worked with our Student Nutrition Services Department to provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner to students at 22 locations throughout our community. We turned our familiar yellow school buses into “mobile resource centers,” working with many community partners to outfit them with not only meals but grocery and hygiene/cleaning items for families, books, and internet access.Nearly 100 miles away in the Twin Cities, three Minneapolis Public Schools — Bethune Community School, Cityview Community School and Green Central Community School — are responding in a similar way, utilizing its full-service model to meet the needs of its school site families and its local community through coordination of food and basic support needs, partnering with the families to support technology requests and access via donated refurbished equipment, hosting virtual parent social groups, and organizing transportation to donation sites and clinics specifically since the killing of George Floyd and the uprising responses. The team is now working across its partnerships to support in-person summer activities, at the request of families, for young people through pop-up parks via its collaborative practice, a tenet of the model, with Minneapolis Parks and Recreation and the Minneapolis Beacons Network.Responding to the needs of our students and families is the responsibility of our entire community; as the late Paul Wellstone said, “We all do better, when we all do better.” This statement is a sentiment of the community schools efforts as there becomes a vested interest not just by amazing school staff but by community leaders, for-profit and nonprofit partners, government officials, and volunteers — all committed to supporting students, families and one another.In addition to Rochester and Minneapolis, other communities across the state are also using this model and finding success and benefits in its implementation. We are grateful for this ongoing support, both at the local and state level. Our commissioner of education continues to champion this work and has identified staff at the department to work with our Community Schools State Network to deepen and broaden the impacts of community schools implementation. We ask for her continued support as we move forward into planning for the 2020-2021 school year, knowing that there are many unknowns.One known thing, however, is the power of collaborating with one another to listen and better understand the needs and desires of our community.

They ran, walked and biked their way to the total on a mission to stop diabetes.The COVID-19 pandemic forced the American Diabetes Association to delay the event, which is usually in April, and then make it virtual. But if anything, the COVID-19 pandemic has proven that conquering diabetes is more important than ever. Statistics from the first six months of the pandemic have shown that diabetes, and related risk factors and complications like high blood pressure, kidney disease and more, are major risk factors for having a more severe case of COVID-19. Diabetes is a serious problem by itself, but the past few months have highlighted the fact that it can exacerbate other conditions — even recently discovered viruses — and wreak havoc on lives and families.“We are so grateful to the community for their amazing support, even in challenging times. Though physically distanced, our donors came together on June 20 for a cause that connects them,” said Deanie Eldridge, Virginia and West Virginia executive director for the American Diabetes Association.A Facebook event page was the new headquarters for the event. On this page, participants posted pictures and videos of their preparation and how they were participating. The goal was to move for at least 34 minutes in honor of the 34 million people living with diabetes. Most walked, ran or biked, but as long as they were active, it didn’t matter how.“We are very pleased with the success of our Virtual Tour de Cure event this past Saturday. We had 512 registered event participants, and close to 200 of them indicated they were attending the virtual event on our social media page,” said Eldridge.Just as they would have at the actual event, participants learned more about the fight against diabetes thanks to informative posts on the Facebook page. There was even a virtual cooking demonstration with a diabetic-friendly recipe from Dedra Blount and Debra Brabson from Now You’re Cooking Culinary Studio.We congratulate the American Diabetes Association on yet another successful event — albeit a virtual one — and look forward to the 2021 rendition, which we hope can once again be hosted in Suffolk.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

This property is situated conveniently just off Route 58 in a part of the city underserved by public recreational facilities.The area along the Blackwater River between South Quay and the North Carolina state line has long been identified by the Commonwealth of Virginia for acquisition, protection and management for outdoor recreational and conservation purposes — at least as far back as the early 1980s (1984 Virginia Outdoors Plan .

The protests that ensued marched north to the police department’s 3rd precinct, just blocks from the high school where I teach. Twelve hundred miles away, in New York’s Central Park, Amy Cooper, a white woman, called 911, falsely claiming that her life was being threatened by Christian Cooper, a black man who had simply asked her to leash her dog.That these two events — both of which have momentarily wrested the nation’s eyes away from the coronavirus pandemic — occurred on the same day is no coincidence; injustices like this happen to people of color every day and in every city. But the juxtaposition evokes a long and tortured history of crimes against black Americans specifically, one that didn’t end with Eric Garner or begin with Emmett Till. Not all lynchings involve a rope.This year, my ninth-grade students engaged in a writing unit on social protest. Through examination and analysis of movements ranging from Colin Kaepernick’s national anthem protests to the current COVID-19 protests, they sought to approach difficult questions likeTo what extent is destructive protest justified andWhat makes a protest effectiveOne of the most common critiques of social protests, and in particular ones led by people of color, is that they lack a specific goal. Without a numbered list of legislative proposals, pundits dismiss them as ineffectual outrage. As many of my past students have pointed out, the media reinforces this idea (while perpetuating racist stereotypes by minimizing them as “primal screams.” But make no mistake, these protesters are demanding the same things as those in Ferguson and Baltimore:The most important idea I learned from my students — many of whom have been personally affected by police violence — is that rioting is the language of grief. These protests are more than catharsis; they are animperfect expression of grief. There is anger, yes, but underneath it, people are grieving, grieving the loss of a family member, a friend, a father to a 6-year-old daughter.Within this grief, what gives me hope (as naive as that hope may seem is the thousands of Minnesotans who risked their safety during a global pandemic to stand at 38th and Chicago in peaceful solidarity with George Floyd; the two New Yorkers — true white allies — who identified Amy Cooper from a viral video; the countless people of all races with the courage to continue shouting in the face of white supremacy:Enough.Christopher Mah is a language arts teacher in Minneapolis."

I mean, instead, that he’ll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.When Joe Biden is inaugurated, he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge — and I don’t mean the pandemic, although COVID-19 will almost surely be killing thousands of Americans every day. I mean, instead, that he’ll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.It goes without saying that Trump, whose conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder, will never concede, and that millions of his followers will always believe — or at least say they believe — that the election was stolen.Most Republicans in Congress certainly know this is a lie, although even on Capitol Hill there are a lot more crazy than we’d like to imagine. But it doesn’t matter; they still won’t accept that Biden has any legitimacy, even though he won the popular vote by a large margin.And this won’t simply be because they fear a backlash from the base if they admit that Trump lost fair and square. At a fundamental level — and completely separate from the Trump factor — today’s GOP doesn’t believe that Democrats ever have the right to govern, no matter how many votes they receive.After all, in recent years we’ve seen what happens when a state with a Republican legislature elects a Democratic governor: Legislators quickly try to strip away the governor’s powers. So does anyone doubt that Republicans will do all they can to hobble and sabotage Biden’s presidency?The only real questions are how much harm the GOP can do and how Biden will respond.The answer to the first question depends a lot on what happens in the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoffs. If Democrats win both seats, they’ll have effective though narrow control of both houses of Congress. If they don’t, Mitch McConnell will have enormous powers of obstruction — and anyone who doubts that he’ll use those powers to undermine Biden at every turn is living in a fantasy world.But how much damage would obstructionism inflict? In terms of economic policy — which is all I’ll talk about in this column — the near future can be divided into two eras, pre- and post-vaccine (or more accurately, after wide dissemination of a vaccine .For the next few months, as the pandemic continues to run wild, tens of millions of Americans will be in desperate straits unless the federal government steps up to help. Unfortunately, Republicans may be in a position to block this help.The good news about the very near future, such as it is, is that Americans will probably (and correctly blame Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, for the misery they’re experiencing — and this very fact may make Republicans willing to cough up at least some money.What about the post-vaccine economy? Here again there’s potentially some good news: Once a vaccine becomes widely available, we’ll probably see a spontaneous economic recovery, one that won’t depend on Republican cooperation. And there will also be a vast national sense of relief.So Biden might do OK for a while even in the face of scorched-earth Republican opposition. But we can’t be sure of that. Republicans might refuse to confirm anyone for key economic positions. There’s always the possibility of another financial crisis — and outgoing Trump officials have been systematically undermining the incoming administration’s ability to deal with such a crisis if it happens. And America desperately needs action on issues from infrastructure to climate change to tax enforcement that won’t happen if Republicans retain blocking power.So what can Biden do?First, he needs to start talking about immediate policy actions to help ordinary Americans, if only to make it clear to Georgia voters how much damage will be done if they don’t elect Democrats to those two Senate seats.If Democrats don’t get those seats, Biden will need to use executive action to accomplish as much as possible despite Republican obstruction — although I worry that the Trump-stacked Supreme Court will try to block him when he does.Finally, although Biden is still talking in a comforting way about unity and reaching across the aisle, at some point he’ll need to stop reassuring us that he’s nothing like Trump and start making Republicans pay a political price for their attempts to prevent him from governing.Now, I don’t mean that he should sound like Trump, demanding retribution against his enemies — although the Justice Department should be allowed to do its job and prosecute whatever Trump-era crimes it finds.No, what Biden needs to do is what Harry Truman did in 1948, when he built political support by running against “do-nothing” Republicans. And he’ll have a better case than Truman ever did, because today’s Republicans are infinitely more corrupt and less patriotic than the Republicans Truman faced.The results of this year’s election, with a solid Biden win but Republicans doing well down ballot, tells us that American voters don’t fully understand what the modern GOP is really about. Biden needs to get that point across and make Republicans pay for the sabotage we all know is coming.7 p.m. update:The Central Pacific Hurricane Center reports as of 5 p.m., Tropical Storm Hone is 125 miles southeast of Hilo with sustained winds of 65 mph moving west at 14 mph.

eugeneweekly_2020_28,"We ve got issues. The COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide uprisings are making systemic societal change possible. People are open to thinking big and structurally. Ahead of the pandemic, multiple Oregon communities were engaged in deliberate efforts to shift the purpose of state law from something that protects commerce to something that protects life and the systems upon which life depends. Thinking big like this requires conviction. Conviction is what led to Lincoln County, Oregon’sCommunity Bill of Rights measure banning aerially sprayed pesticidesin 2017. Adopted by the majority of Lincoln residents, the local law recognizes the right to local decision making to protect health, safety, and welfare, and the right of critical forest ecosystems and watersheds to exist, flourish, and evolve. To enforce those rights, it bans — not regulates — aerial spraying of pesticides. This aerial spraying is a common and dangerous corporate timber industry practice that threatens aquatic ecosystems and humans. Lincoln residents are not alone. Others share in their conviction, and are working to advance similar laws. What’s the cost of compromise? Carol Van Strum, longtime anti-pesticide activist and current spokesperson in an ongoing legal case to defend Lincoln County’s “Freedom from Aerially Sprayed Pesticides Ordinance,” knows the cost of compromise. (Van Strum functions as the legal spokesperson for the Siletz River ecosystem in the case. The Lincoln County law, which successfully banned aerial spraying for two years, was assisted by the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF , the organization I work for. As Van Strum and her neighbors have fought to defend local ecosystems, they have witnessed how large environmental groups cave in to the demands — and power — of the corporate timber industry. Some environmental groups initially showed interest in also proposing ballot initiatives to curtail the corporate timber industry. However, they not only neglected to advance outright bans of the destructive practices, they swiftly sank into “compromise” mode. Some things should never be compromised A private agreement (a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU was signed between certain establishment environmental groups and the timber industry, including Weyerhaeuser, Hancock, and Roseburg Forest Products. Environmental groups agreed to withdraw and refrain from legislative petitions that impact the timber industry.In return, they got expanded setbacks for pesticide spraying and clearcutting as well as increased disclosure of forestry practices by the timber industry. What about the front-line communities that have been fighting for public and forest health by advancing ballot initiatives thatstopharms? They wereexcludedfrom the compromise. The establishment environmentalists and the governor of Oregon claim victory: There is the possibility of greater buffer zone regulations and new protections for endangered species. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown called the compromise “historic” and “extraordinary.” However, those dedicated to making deep and meaningful political and legal change know that there are some things that must never be compromised. And even when some compromise takes place, “one must never label a necessary evil as good,” as Margaret Mead, the feminist scholar and anthropologist, once wrote. Calling it out Core demands from the grassroots remain unaddressed. (The MOU allows for continued clearcutting, aerial pesticide spraying and new road-making. Van Strum calls it out for what it is. Shehas spoken stronglyagainst this so-called “compromise,” between establishment environmental groups and the industry. “The MOU,” she recently wrote in theNewport News Times, “simply dresses up the status quo in new clothes, offered as a giant pacifier to a public.” To win the type of change we need post-pandemic we need conviction. “The MOU,” Van Strum wrote, “is an empty and misleading promise that allows business as usual for years to come.” Van Strum has been stalwart in her stand for protecting forests and people from toxic pesticides. She has been recognized with the David Brower Lifetime Achievement Award. She also compiled thePoison Papersalong with authoringA Bitter Fog: Herbicides and Human Rights,No Margin of Safety,The Oreo Fileand other works. “None of the signatories to this MOU represent those of us on the ground who are, and have been directly affected by timber industry practices,” Van Strum writes. “The timber industry, with state sanctioned approval, has denied us that right for many decades, but for allegedly environmental groups to sign our rights away without our consent is an unconscionable betrayal.” At the root of the global catastrophe of climate change and corporate control of forest lands is the “commercialization of forests, watersheds, life and nature itself,” wrote Van Strum. And that system is perpetuated by the MOU. Past social movements Across the history of social movements, activists have understood that once the people behind a movement begin to compromise core convictions and demands, that movement begins to languish. Conventional, establishment nonprofits have been, and continue to be, quick to agree to compromise. They seem to believe “something is better than nothing,” even at the expense of core grassroots demands. Their willingness to compromise on the necessary systemic changes for the sake of the immediate, superficial “victory” only perpetuates and legitimizes a power structure that insulates the powerful and wealthy from grassroots democratic governance. That is the opposite of how we should be thinking during this pandemic. Uncompromising Van Strum and Lincoln County community members stand behind their “Freedom from Aerially Sprayed Pesticides Ordinance” and protecting the Siletz River, following a county circuit court ruling in October 2019 to overturn the law. They recently filedan appealin the Oregon Court of Appeals to exercise the rights of the Siletz River and to reinstate the Lincoln County ban on aerial pesticide spraying. We are excited to continue our support of Oregon communities, and dozens more across the U.S., as they work to think big through this crisis and to advance, secure, and protect the rights of communities and nature. These rights are what communities demand. Kai Huschke is the Northwest community organizer for the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund. He can be reached atkai@celdf.org."
minnpost_2020_96,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .This commentary was originally published byNJ Spotlight, a nonprofit news website in New Jersey.At first, it was exciting to see my photographs of Camden, New Jersey, police officers marching with protesters published all over the world.Not anymore.The images show an oft-maligned city responding with unity and peace to the killing of George Floyd. They give people hope.But the most recent media narrative — that in 2013, the Camden City Police department was dissolved in order to root out corruption, and from its ashes came a friendly, county-run force that sets a national model for community policing — is a bridge too far. It’s important to get the history right, because amid calls for defunding police departments, what happened here shows that this is a more complex issue than people realize.It’s true that Camden is much safer these days. In recent years, the force has upped the hiring of minority officers, taught officers de-escalation tactics, worked more closely with social service agencies, and hosted neighborhood events to get to know the community on a regular basis.But contrary to many of the reports that were published with my photographs in recent weeks, the Camden County Police Department was not born out of an altruistic desire to get rid of corrupt cops. It was created by South Jersey politicians, with the support of then-Gov. Chris Christie, to break the police officers union with contracts they considered burdensome, thereby cutting costs.The problem was that to make that happen, they laid off nearly half the police force in January 2011. I stood in the street on that bitter, cold morning watching tearful officers place their boots on the icy sidewalk in protest.The most generous view of that — and the explosion of crime that followed — would be that officials didn’t realize what would happen. Many of us, though, believed it was perhaps the most cynical political decision we’d ever witnessed, an intentional effort to drive up the crime rate to justify a new county department.The death toll was so horrific that activists created a field of crosses in front of Camden’s City Hall, planting a new one for each of the nearly 70 murder victims in 2012. (There were 37 murders in Camden in 2010, 52 in 2011. I was a regular visitor to the field; sometimes the heartbreaking pictures I took there went unpublished because editors didn’t want to depress readers.Camden was proclaimed a war zone, and the stage was set to usher in the new county department that city leaders wanted. Nobody gave Camden residents a choice, and because a voter petition drive to halt the creation of a county police force was ignored, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2015 that the disbanding and reorganization was illegal.By then, of course, it was too late.The Camden County Police Department was hardly an immediate success. City residents, many of whom loved then-President Barack Obama, couldn’t fathom why he came to Camden in 2015 to congratulate its police force.I couldn’t either. The new department had not only had the highest number of excessive-force complaints in the state but also the highest turnover. Young officers, mostly white, came from all over the state to train in Camden, but so many of them fled the dangerous city so quickly that Camden asked for refunds from the municipalities where they wound up for the cost of that training.A few months after Obama showed up, Camden resident Quinzelle Bethea spent Thanksgiving in a jail cell, charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest and obstruction after being beaten by a 27-year-old cop named Douglas Dickinson for no real reason. As he was being transported to jail, Bethea reported that other officers, who knew that cop’s propensity for violence, were apologizing. It was a hopeful sign that then-Police Chief Scott Thomson expressed gratitude to community members and other officers who came forward to share their concerns. Charges were dropped against Bethea, who sued in federal court, and Dickinson eventually pleaded guilty to assault.One night around that time, I was pulled over in Camden with an African-American man in my passenger seat. “I wasn’t speeding, was I” I asked the Camden County officer, who was white like me.“No,” he said, looking at me and at my friend. “You were actually going kind of slow. Are you all right” The encounter confused me, but my passenger got it loud and clear, and had of course experienced far worse insults than that.While I applaud what hard-won progress the Camden County Police Department has made and hope for continued improvement, there is no denying that its origin was drenched in the blood of murder victims, that things got worse before they got better, and that easy fixes are fairy tales.I was there. And I have the pictures to prove it.April Saul is a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist whose lifelong mission has been to help people understand each other better.

suffolknewsherald_2020_219,"Published 9:34 pm Wednesday, December 23, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Wayne DawkinsLet me tell you about one of the greatest congressional legislators of the late 1900s that you probably never heard of. He is Emanuel Celler (1888-1981 , a congressman who represented a Brooklyn district for 50 years.Celler has two distinct connections to Virginia. I will explain them soon.Now, what is so special about Celler? For starters, he waged a 40-year battle, often enduring humiliating setbacks, then emerged triumphant when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1965 Immigration Reform law, ending 40 years of National Origins policy that discriminated against certain white immigrants and in the extreme, people from Asia, Latin America and Africa.Furthermore, Celler co-wrote three Constitutional Amendments, including the 25ththat established a line of succession just in case a U.S. president was unable to serve because of death, debilitating health, or was unfit to serve. That amendment’s relevance has come up during the reign of 45thPresident Donald J. Trump.The Celler-Birch Bayh 25thAmendment (ratified by U.S. states in 1967 was tested in 1981 when President Ronald Reagan was shot and wounded by Virginian John Hinckley Jr. Vice President George H.W. Bush was unable to fill in immediately because he was in the air on a jet to Washington. Secretary of State Alexander Haig erroneously declared “he was in control,” until authorities explained that the House Speaker, then Senate president pro tempore were next in line to lead.Reagan recovered from his wounds and resumed his presidency.Celler’s signature body of work is civil rights. In 1957, he co-wrote the Civil Rights Act that established a process to investigate unconstitutional abuses of black citizens in the Jim Crow south. A follow-up 1960 CRA by Celler added more investigatory power.However, Celler’s sponsorship of the 1964 law signed by LBJ was the game changer. But before those presidential pen strokes, Celler tangled with Virginia Congressman Howard “Judge” Smith, who tried to kill the bill in his powerful Rules Committee. Celler used a rare parliamentary move to rescue the bill from strangulation. Smith countered with a gender trick: If we give African-Americans first-class citizenship rights, he argued, white women would be disenfranchised.Celler answered with humor and cunning, offering himself as a hen-pecked husband who always deferred to his wife. Actually, Celler outmaneuvered Smith and the final Civil Rights Act added titles that prevented legal discrimination againstall Americansbased on sex, religion or race.The other Virginia connection involved Celler’s Judiciary Committee colleague Richard Poff of greater Richmond. Last October, editorials in the Roanoke Times and Richmond Times Dispatch acknowledged that committee chairman Celler was the sponsor of the bill, however argued Poff did the heavy lifting. The editorials boosted their hometown hero, but offered little evidence. Meanwhile, 25thAmendment co-sponsor, U.S. Sen. Birch Bayh, D-Indiana, told me in 2018 that Celler the Democrat in less than 30 minutes persuaded wary Republicans to reach a bipartisan consensus and craft a final report that President LBJ would sign into law.Celler, the workhorse legislator that the New York Times in 1967 called “The Congressional Bulldog,” often lives in the end notes of recent books, including a 900-page biography of U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, and “The Last Million,” another new book about the race to rescue Jewish refugees from post-World War II Germany. David Nasaw’s book references Celler 12 times.This time however, Celler is not a supporting cast member; he is the star of the first full-length biography, written by yours truly.Wayne Dawkins lives in Suffolk and is author of “Emanuel Celler: Immigration and Civil Rights Champion,” published last October by University Press of Mississippi.

suffolknewsherald_2020_130,"Published 9:41 pm Tuesday, May 12, 2020ByStaff ReportsWe are speaking on behalf of ourselves, not as spokespersons for the Suffolk City School Board.We believe that proposed amendment to School Board Policy Chapter 2, Article 3, Section 2-3.2(E in reference to a School Board Member placing items on the agenda of any Board Meeting is alarming. It changes the procedure from submitting a request in writing to the Chair and a copy to the school superintendent 14 days prior to the meeting to, “When a school Board member requests placement of an item on the agenda, the Chair will immediately poll member of the School Board separately pursuant to Virginia Code Section 2.2-3710(B for the purpose of ascertaining a member’s position with respect to the placing an item on the agenda. If any member of the School Board objects, the matter must be placed before members of the School Board at the upcoming meeting and there must be an affirmative vote of the School Board to add the item to the agenda.”At a Board Development session with the Virginia School Board Association in February 2019, the placement of items on a school board meeting agenda was discussed. The executive director of the VSBA made it clear that any school board member can have an item be placed on a school board meeting agenda. Subsequent to this meeting, this privilege was written into our School Board protocols and norms and approved by the full Board in March 2019.I, Mr. Mitnick, recently requested that the selection of community members to citizen advisory committees for the 2020-2021 school year be added to the May agenda. This request was also made on behalf of the Special Education Advisory Committee Chair. The school board chair denied my request.I, Mrs. Story, have requested several items by placed on the May agenda, such as: revisiting the 2020-2021 school calendar in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and additional costs to the district for Scholastic and Edgenuity and a plan to evaluate them.We both have also requested multiple times that the board discuss on previous agendas, such as the overcrowding of various schools in the district; these requests have fallen on deaf ears. These restrictions by the Board Chair have gone against the norms and protocols adopted by the Suffolk City School Board in March 2019.We are alarmed with the proposed amendment to the School Board Policy Chapter 2, Article 3, Section 2-3.2(E . It takes away our rights and responsibilities, as duly elected school board members, to place items on a school board agenda for discussion, for information or for updates in order to govern responsibly as pursuant to our sworn oath. In order for either of us to fulfill our stated roles, we must be able to bring items of our concern, or from our constituents or from any member of the Citizen Advisory Committees on which we may serve, to place them on the agenda for a forthcoming school board meeting, without a majority consent by the School Board. The video of the Policy Review Committee meeting on May 7, 2020 made it clear that the members of the Policy Review Committee, along with the School Board Attorney are attempting to stifle requests from individual school board members by adding filters attempting to control the flow of information to the public. This is not acceptable, nor is it considered good board practice, as evidenced by the guidance of the VSBA.We are appalled by this attempt to stifle board members from requesting agenda items for forthcoming school board meetings. The public needs to be informed concerning vital issues that affect the schools and their children. We have recently witnessed the restricted rights of citizens; the board has denied their right to extemporaneously speak. Now the rights of elected School Board members themselves are in jeopardy of being denied by an apparent “gag-order.” This proposed amended policy will not help our students, nor will it help SPS become the best. Such a policy is unacceptable to both of us, and we feel that the public needs to be fully informed about this alarming proposal. Each board member needs to have a full voice and not be silenced.David Mitnick is the Sleepy Hole Borough representative.

minnpost_2020_80,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .A Larry A. Green Center national survey finds that 2 in 5 primary clinicians won’t have enough cash on hand to stay open through August because the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded their ability to bill services. (Larry A. Green Center, COVID-19 Primary Care Survey, Series #15. This short-term phenomenon is layered on top of an already under-resourced primary care system in the U.S. The Primary Care Collaborative finds the country spends 6-7% on primary health care services (Primary Care Collaborative, Investing in Primary Care: A State-Level Analysis . This underinvestment in primary care yields more expensive spending in preventable emergency room visits and hospitalizations and poses a significant financial incentive for physicians and other clinicians to choose other career paths than primary care.Fortunately, Minnesota and the United States have a strong network of Community Health Centers (CHCs whose primary mission is to provide accessible primary care services. CHCs were born out of the 1960s civil-rights movement and for 50-plus years have grown to serve more than 200,000 Minnesotans and nearly 29 million Americans. They’re key access points in both urban and rural areas – nearly 1 in 5 of every rural American receives care at a CHC.Similar to other primary care providers, our overriding mission is to keep patients healthy, but Health Centers differ slightly in several ways: 1 We’re located in areas of high need; 2 we offer primary medical, dental and behavioral health care services “under one roof;” 3 the Board of Directors of each Health Center is governed by Health Center patients; and, 4 we’re open to everyone regardless of a patient’s ability to pay.Like other primary care centers, Health Centers have experienced caseload reductions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across our 17 Community Health Center network in Minnesota, patient visits dropped over 60% in May. Fortunately, visits are rebounding, helped in large part by our adoption of telehealth services.Any reduction in primary care is devastating for Minnesotans who experience mental health issues spawned by the stress of COVID-19, job loss, historical trauma and recent civil unrest. All of Minnesota’s CHCs provide behavioral health services onsite and are meeting demand, especially for substance use disorder. Our nimble care model ensures that any patient experiencing a mental health issue as part of a routine medical service can literally “walk down the hall” for mental health services without delay from a referral system.I fear that in the face of cash-strapped government, philanthropic and private resources, more primary care clinics will be forced to make the agonizing decision to shut their doors. Fewer primary care services translates to poorer health and increased health care costs.These factors combine to underscore the need for community health centers, whose services reduce costs to the federal and state budgets by almost 25 percent. CHCs are open and stand ready to continue our legacy to serve all Minnesotans, and their primary medical, dental and behavioral health care needs, as we have been able to do for five decades.Jonathan Watson is the CEO of the Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers (MNACHC .

Telling my kid that there’s a pixie nanny cam that transmits directly to the North Pole feels too 1984. I prefer to wait a few more years and then explain that it’s actually Google that monitors all of our behavior.The Elf’s snitching would be an easy enough narrative to remove from the tradition. But what I really can’t stand is that the Elf on the Shelf has come to represent all the fuss, muss, and imposition we have placed on ourselves at the holidays. Xmas and excess have become synonymous. There has become this obsession with filling every moment from Black Friday to Christmas Eve with mandatory holiday magic.Growing up, we visited Santa one time to take an embarrassing, plaid- and bow-adorned portrait. We went tothe Wanamaker light showand watched Christmas movies on VHS when my dad wasn’t watching the news. I have very fond memories. Now, one simply cannot miss a Christmas parade, a light show, or a fifth visit with Santa. It’s easy to see how the Elf has evolved into a mischievous imp that must appear each morning in a blue-ribbon-winning third-grade winter diorama as parents blink over their coffee, fatigued from setting the scene the night before. Or worse, forgetting about the Elf’s overnight activities and waking up early as not to disrupt the expectation they themselves have set. The horror.» READ MORE:Safer at Home vs. Christmas Village: A tale of two City Halls | OpinionI have never heard parent friends say they enjoy the Elf. They quietly curse Crackle, Sprinkle, or Chumpy when they come out of storage and the nuisance of the magic they must manifest nightly for the month of December. They do it for their kids, which is admirable. But this year, when we must forgoour treasured Wanamaker light showand visit with St. Nick to stay well, let go of the traditions you have come to resent. You will create many other memories you all enjoy. You deserve a break in this dumpster fire of a year. Dump that Elf for yourself.If you have a Sparkle, Jingle, or Snowball, I sincerely hope it brings you joy. If it doesn’t, consider ditching it to preserve your peace of mind.

I came on a full scholarship to Bennett College in North Carolina to earn undergraduate degrees in accounting and business management, and then to the University of North Carolina to earn a master’s degree in business.In the past three decades, Minnesota has welcomed and offered safety to more than 100,000 refugees from 100 countries. As refugees become more established, we also support their contributions and successes. Recently at the Minnesota Department of Human Services, we recognized 10 individuals with the Outstanding Refugee Award.Some were recognized for their civic engagement, facilitating cultural, food and language sessions so that community members can learn more about their Somali neighbors and build cross-cultural friendships. Others were honored for their entrepreneurial spirit, providing bilingual and bicultural mental health services to adolescents and adults. Still others were recognized for their leadership as youth, helping newly immigrated families with enrolling children in school, finding housing and translating important information, and for their resilience and courage, helping other refugees resettle in Minnesota.All share a desire for what most of us want: Good health, satisfying work, safe neighborhoods, happy families, welcoming communities and opportunities to pursue our dreams. I encourage you toread more about their inspiring stories on our website.Over the years I have found what often divides us is our misunderstanding or lack of information about each other. Once we take time to learn about each other as individuals, as parents, as colleagues, as young people with dreams, we often discover all that we have in common and all that we have to enrich each other’s lives. This is what I have learned about our neighbors who have come to this country to start their lives anew:But before they do this, they need a little help. That’s where the Minnesota Department of Human Services comes in. When individuals arrive from all over the world to take refuge in our state, our Resettlement Programs Office provides the kind oftemporary, but essential, help they need to get established – help understanding new systems, getting their first job in America, learning English, supporting their children’s success in school and applying for citizenship.Since I arrived in America in 1992, I’ve frequently asked myself, “How did that little girl from Zimbabwe get here” I have thrived because I was welcomed, supported and given the opportunity to reach my potential. It is humbling to know the responsibility and privilege I have today to support our neighbors in the same way I was helped; the same way we all need a helping hand at times.For those who have had the privilege to live here your entire lives, I encourage you to reach out in kindness to refugees and other immigrants in our communities. Learn about and celebrate the contributions these neighbors make to our state. By taking the time to listen to and learn from each other, we can see our common hopes and dreams as our country’s strength.Minnesota Department of Human Services Assistant Commissioner for Community Supports Gertrude Matemba-Mutasa is responsible for ensuring equitable access to services that support healthy outcomes for people to choose how to live, work and enjoy life in their communities.

suffolknewsherald_2020_6,"Published 5:43 pm Tuesday, August 25, 2020ByStaff ReportsAs long as this isn’t your first August in Suffolk, you probably know that Suffolkians take National Night Out very seriously.The crime-fighting and awareness event is a national thing, but you wouldn’t know that if you celebrated it in Suffolk. We here in Suffolk make it seem like we invented it with our enthusiasm and hard work to make sure the event — and the community partnerships that stem from it — are successful and work for the benefit of the entire community.Our National Night Out events are so great that they have placed first nationally in our population group five times — 2008, 2009, 2014, 2016 and 2018 — and had 14 straight years of top-five finishes. The events are judged based on a video and folder of documentation sent to the National Association of Town Watch, which started the event.But the real winners are everyone here in Suffolk — everyone except the criminals, that is. When neighbors get together and get to know the public safety officers protecting their communities, coalitions are formed that can help deter crime and keep everyone safer.Unfortunately this year, there is a more insidious danger at work. Crime is still a problem we must fight against to keep our community safe, but the COVID-19 pandemic is real. Keeping our community safe, this year, means we must avoid gathering in large groups as we have done in previous years.However, the mission of National Night Out will continue. The city announced the new “National Night In” earlier this week. This will be a video project in which the entire community is asked to participate. City residents are asked to create and share a short video about their participation in National Night Out and upload it at www.suffolkva.us/2020nnoportal. Videos taken with a smartphone are fine, and older folks are encouraged to ask their children and grandchildren. Videos should be uploaded by 5 p.m. Sept. 18 so they can be compiled and shared in a “National Night IN 2020” video program that will debut on the National Night Out website, the city’s municipal channel and social media on Oct. 6.Suffolk’s theme for National Night Out 2020 is “Create Community Connections,” and we can still do that virtually — one video at a time.

minnpost_2020_38,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .But increasing the number of guns on the streets does not make us safer, just as increasing the police budget does not make us safer. Both of these solutions are motivated by fear, rather than logic.If the police are abolished, the argument goes, won’t we bear the burden of defending ourselvesOn the one hand, I get it. Earlier this summer, as helicopters hovered over Minneapolis, tanks rumbled through the streets, and rumors of violence and fires spread through my neighborhood, I, too, found myself wishing I had more than an ancient baseball bat for protection.On the other hand, I’ve seen the statistics. I know that if I bring a gun inside my house, I’ll make my homeless safe. The presence of that gun will increase the likelihood of accidental death andsuicide.Evidencealso shows that it will triple the risk of domestic homicide. “Efforts to increase home security have largely focused on preventing unwanted entry,” concludes a gun violence study in the New England Journal of Medicine, “but the greatest threat to the lives of household members appears to come from within.”Not only is my gun statistically more likely to harm a member of my household than it is to harm an intruder,studies also showthat if I do attempt to use a gun against an intruder, there’s a greater chance that I’ll wind up injured than if I choose to hide or run away.As a recentop-edin The Washington Post argued, “Police reform and gun reform go hand in hand,” particularly since systemic racism undergirds them both. Police kill Black Americansat twice the rateof white Americans, even though 13% of the total population is Black and 75% is white. Although gun violence is the second-leading cause of death for all young Americans, it’s thefirst-leading cause of deathfor young Black men. The victims in the spate of recent Minneapolisshootingsare disproportionately young men of color.Currently, as a powerful piece in The Trace observed, thespecter of gunshaunts every interaction between Black communities and the police. Even gun control measures such as illegal gun arrests target Black residents at a higher rate than white, despite the fact that white Americans are more likely to own guns.So what can you do if you’re concerned about your safetyIf you supportgun control legislation that works, tell your state senator to approve the bills that were passed by the House in February.If you’re skeptical of the current research on gun violence because you think it’s funded by special interest groups, advocate formore government fundingon this issue.Most importantly, support community-led anti-violence programs that areproven to work. Gun violence is most intense in neighborhoods that have good reason todistrust the police, which is why it is imperative that we redirect money from the Minneapolis police to community-centered groups such as theGun Violence Interventioninitiative,Protect Minnesota, andReclaim the Block.Instead of buying more guns to create the illusion of home security, let’s direct our dollars instead toward organizations that are already implementing research-based, strategic violence intervention programs to improve the safety of our city.Lindsay Starck is an assistant professor of English and associate director of the MFA Program at Augsburg University in Minneapolis."

At the same website, you can invite me or a member of my staff to appear in person or virtually. My staff and I are eager to be attending events, so please let us know about what is happening in your community. As we continue to work on legislation, and my colleagues and I discuss critical issues, I want to be serving you, meeting your needs, making life better and easier for you and your family.This past month I was very excited to host a virtual listening session about education during these trying times. We were very fortunate to have a panel join us composed of local parents and teachers, as well as Virginia’s Deputy Secretary of Education and Virginia’s Superintendent of Public Schools. These folks had knowledge from their own experiences right here in Virginia-04 and brought expertise as teachers. The conversation was lively and informative. I know I was more enlightened about how we can help parents and educators, striving to do their best, through these difficult times.This month, I introduced the Protecting Our Students in Schools Act which prohibits corporal punishment in any school receiving federal funding. Each day, in nearly 20 states, students are at risk of physical punishment. No child should fear physical harm at school, and no adult should be using physical punishment to discipline a child. This legislation not only forbids these violent acts, but also provides for grants to school systems to change the culture and help school personnel learn more effective, and non-damaging, methods of discipline.I was also pleased to vote for the HEROES Act this past month, which would supply desperately needed COVID relief. This legislation includes strong support for small businesses, improves the Paycheck Protection Program, which provides a mechanism for small business owners to keep paying employees, and delivers needed assistance to restaurants and nonprofits. It also offers additional help for airline workers and more funding for education and childcare.In addition, the updated Heroes Act provides funding for state and local governments whose budgets have been decimated but need to fund first responders, schools, hospitals and other necessary functions. It invests in testing, tracing and treatment and puts more money directly in the pockets of workers and families. I am hopeful that when Congress is back in session later this month, we will be able to reach a relief agreement quickly.Nothing could be more important than helping families get through this pandemic.

We’re about to enter the fifth month of having our lives upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, and it doesn’t seem there is an end in sight. Back in March, a lot of people thought this would all be over by now, but unfortunately, the virus has only spread.We encourage everyone impacted by all of these changes to hang in there and make the best of the opportunities we have. The changes have been deemed necessary, and while they may cause consternation for some, they are the best way to protect ourselves and our neighbors from the virus.By their very nature, most sports bring athletes in close proximity to one another and have them sharing equipment and, sometimes, enclosed spaces. And while statistics show that healthy, active young people are unlikely to suffer greatly from COVID-19, less is known about how readily they can spread it to others, including their parents, grandparents and teachers. Therefore, it’s important to limit their contact with others just as it is for those of us who can only dream of being in high school again.There is still a lot of uncertainty in the VHSL sports plan, particularly because it is contingent upon the entire state staying in Phase 3 of its reopening plan.Those competing in winter sports such as basketball, gymnastics, indoor track, swimming and diving and wrestling would be able to practice beginning Dec. 14, with no competitions or games to be scheduled until Dec. 28 and the season running through Feb. 20.Sports that normally operate in the fall — football, cheer, cross country, field hockey, golf and volleyball — will not be able to start practicing until Feb. 15, with games running from March 1 through May 1.The spring sports season — for those who play baseball, softball, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track and field — would begin April 12 and go through June 26, with the first games to be played no earlier than April 26.We know this is not how some of Suffolk’s excellent student-athletes planned on spending their sports seasons this school year, but we hope it will turn out to be best for everyone in the long run.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_108,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On Friday, May 29, I had lunch with my friend Peter, an architect who has officed for decades in the restored Boyd warehouse on 4thAvenue one block south of Lake Street, filled with small businesses and nonprofits. We talked about the violent nights around us, and what matters and doesn’t in the long scheme of things. And we puzzled over who were the arsonists and vandals randomly destroying businesses and nonprofits in this most diverse of neighborhoods in the city The Midtown Global Market, with 90 percent percent tenants of color, Gandhi Mahal restaurant, Migizi Communications, the Lake Street post office A libraryThat night the Boyd Building was torched. Here’s what happened. A car with four white men pulled up to the building late that night, smashed in the glass front door, raced through the building vandalizing every office, lit on fire two cars in the basement parking garage, which exploded, and ran out. The sprinkler system saved the building but not many tenants’ businesses. We know how this happened because a tenant happened to be across the street and witnessed the attack.The most intriguing of these white mercenaries is The Man with the Black Umbrella, captured by cellphone at the initial 3rd precinct demonstration coolly hammering windows of the AutoZone store, the match that lit the flame of what was at that moment an angry but peaceful protest. Clearly, he was not there to steal motor oil. Instead, he and his cohorts acted as the white tip on the match that burned our city. They were few but acted as accelerants — they brought Molotov cocktails and not only used them but handed them out, plus gasoline and other bombs, so our police and fire departments were totally overwhelmed and could not respond as businesses were robbed and burned, including random sites on the north side. This was not because of righteous anger for the tragedy of George Floyd, but a cool calculation to create maximum mayhem.So now our city wakes up to a half a billion-dollar bill in damages, and the livelihoods of many Minnesotans of all colors destroyed, possibly forever, much of the destruction centered in one the most racially diverse and dynamic areas of the city.There will be much-needed change in the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department. And much change, we have a right to expect, in the terrible racial dynamic of parts of our city and country. But the accounting must include these violent mercenaries. Because they did not come here to address a problem, but to create one. Who were they They exploited our grief, and cost the heart and soul of this city a lot.James P.

I have a sixth-grader attending John F. Kennedy Middle School, and I have two first-graders attending Nansemond Parkway Elementary School.As a parent, I am frustrated. Parents are supposed to advocate for their children. The actions of our elected board have been disheartening while the plans and clear hard work that have been presented by our administration led by Dr. Gordon have been exemplary. I have listened to all of the board meetings and presentations given by administrators, and I have been left taken aback at the lack of allowed parent and student involvement in the meetings. Limiting our talk time, bickering among yourselves, tabling items and motions to talk about the renaming of a school, and the board not taking into consideration the results of the many surveys parents have been sent. I do not feel that parents have any voice.I have heard all of you mention at one time or another that you are concerned for the “health and safety” of the students, staff and teachers. I cannot speak for teachers and staff, but I can speak to the health and safety of my own children. Somehow, we have come to a point where health equals COVID risk. Let me make clear that I am in no way discrediting COVID. What about mental health? What about social and emotional health? My sixth-grader is at a vital stage in his mental and social growth, and he has always been a very social child. I see him every day looking to make those connections with his peers. He is currently learning about teenage stress and self-image in health class. He’s busy making Google slideshows and rewriting definitions. When in reality, he should be talking about these very important topics among his peers at school with the support of his teachers. My first-graders are being forced to complete technological tasks that are way over their heads. They both have absolutely wonderful teachers, but as a parent I am the one that sits next to them every day in their frustration to complete their work. I am the one that has to deal with the tears when they don’t want to do school that day. With the utmost respect, until you have sat down in my home on a day-to-day basis I do not believe that you can adequately speak on behalf of my children. In fact, I would happily invite you to come to my house one day and observe.I am very frustrated and disappointed in our elected School Board. I also know that there is not a solution that will please everyone. All I am asking is for the choice.

hawaiitribune_herald_2020_18,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Too soon. That’s the upshot of the Supreme Court’s decision Friday morning in a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s effort to subtract estimates of unauthorized immigrants from the census counts that will be used to determine how many seats each state will get in the House of Representatives.Too soon. That’s the upshot of the Supreme Court’s decision Friday morning in a legal challenge to the Trump administration’s effort to subtract estimates of unauthorized immigrants from the census counts that will be used to determine how many seats each state will get in the House of Representatives.And while there may have been a legal reason for punting, it was still the wrong decision, as Justice Stephen G. Breyer pointed out in a dissent signed by the court’s other two remaining liberals, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.“The Government has announced a policy to exclude aliens without lawful status from the apportionment base for the decennial census. The Government does not deny that, if carried out, the policy will harm the plaintiffs,” Breyer wrote. “The Government’s effort to remove them from the apportionment base is unlawful, and I believe this Court should say so.”The legal challenge by civil liberties groups and some state governments, led by New York, argued that President Donald Trump’s executive order to, in essence, cook the books, violated the constitutional mandate that the decennial census count everyone living in the country at the time, which over time has been understood to mean, well, everyone, with a few carve-outs for diplomats, tourists and the like.Notably, legal status is not mentioned in the Constitution.But the numbers have yet to be finalized by the Census Bureau and have not been presented to the president, so, in the court majority’s nondecision, no harm, no foul.“At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review,” the court majority said in the unsigned decision. “The President, to be sure, has made clear his desire to exclude aliens without lawful status from the apportionment base. But the President qualified his directive by providing that the Secretary should gather information ‘to the extent practicable’ and that aliens should be excluded ‘to the extent feasible.’ Any prediction how the Executive Branch might eventually implement this general statement of policy is ‘no more than conjecture’ at this time.”But how the Trump administration might implement this presidential edict is of less significance than the fact that the president ordered the stripped-down count in the first place. That was the overstep here, and that is what the court should have ruled on.There are a couple of silver linings to this, though.“This Supreme Court decision is only about timing, not the merits,” said Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Voting Rights Project, who argued the case before the court. “This ruling does not authorize President Trump’s goal of excluding undocumented immigrants from the census count used to apportion the House of Representatives. The legal mandate is clear — every single person counts in the census, and every single person is represented in Congress. If this policy is ever actually implemented, we’ll be right back in court challenging it.”The other silver lining: The Census Bureau has said that problems reconciling the data means that it likely will not be able to file its report with the president until Jan. 26, or maybe not even until sometime in February.By then, President Trump will be fighting with his Florida neighbors over whether he can live at Mar-a-Lago, and President Joe Biden, who opposes Trump’s order, will be the one receiving the numbers. And he can easily undo the damage Trump is trying to cause by accepting the total numbers — as the Constitution calls for.Scott Martelle, a veteran journalist and author of six history books, is a member of the Los Angeles Times editorial board.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today.

However, through that agreement, help had to be requested, and it then took minutes to dispatch units to provide the help. The new automatic aid agreement, which has already been put to use more than a dozen times in about a month, will eliminate the seams between the two cities and their departments for purposes of saving lives and property in danger as a result of fire, trauma such as car crashes, and other incidents. Help will be dispatched automatically, and people who are experiencing what’s sure to be one of the worst moments of their lives won’t have to wait even longer for help.Firefighters, emergency communicators and fire administrators have undergone training, shared policies and came up with new practices and made all sorts of other behind-the-scenes movements to make this process work. Those who will benefit include residents, businesses owners and travelers in areas such as Pughsville, Harbour View, College Drive, Burbage Lakes, up to the Godwin Bridge in Suffolk, and then in Chesapeake in the Western Branch area.Recent years have seen Suffolk and Chesapeake collaborating on any number of fronts, including road projects, economic development and now public safety.

minnpost_2020_173,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In Minnesota our current P-12 education system serves some students very well while missing many others. This model worked in the 20th century, but it misses the mark by a long shot in the 21st century when education for all is crucial. In aFederal Reserve report, Rob Grunewald and Anusha Nath stated that Minnesota has some of the largest achievement gaps by race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status in the nation. Yet we continue to use the same schooling model that fails to provide sufficient outcomes.In January the Legislature needs to examine the outdated 20th century system based on seat time, periods, classes, credits, grades, days per year, common standards for every student, outdated assessment models and more. Policymakers should move from trying to enforce the same for all and empower local boards toward a personalized competency-based system for each student with an accountability system that evaluates with meaning and purpose.Crises spawn rapid innovation, invention and change. The global pandemic happening in real time is showing that our schools are capable of rapid change — yet the system itself remains constant. We need to stop pursuing small incremental improvement and focus on creating deep meaningful change to better prepare all students for the 21st century. The gaps in achievement are real and will not be addressed by tinkering. We’ve been doing that forever.With bureaucracies like education, change only occurs when the opportunity and motivation to change is permitted and paired with those willing to do so. We must remove the old input-based model and transition to a competency model personalized for each student. The Legislature must be willing to permit redesign and empower local boards to do so; more important, local boards must then grab this opportunity.The pandemic has demonstrated that some of the essential benefits of our system are personalized relationships, mental health supports and social-emotional connections. We have undervalued the worth of these supports and what they provide to students and families. Students deserve active engagement in an education providing value to their future and our economy.What if:It is time for the Legislature to remove barriers to educational innovation by conferring autonomy and flexibility to local boards. This will build trust in local decision-making to use current resources that personalizes each student’s direction. Local boards can then rethink their governance by empowering schools/communities to meet agreed-on student outcomes.Will the Legislature enable that to happenBrian Erlandson is the superintendent of MN Transitions Charter School; Lucy Payne is board chair of the Mahtomedi District; Patrick Walsh is the superintendent of the Brooten-Belgrade-Elrosa District; Robert Wedl is a former Minnesota commissioner of education, in the administration of Gov.

As smaller or larger numbers of people are tested, the number of positive cases will be correspondingly smaller or larger.In the early days of testing in the United States, President Trump played a statistical shell game, arguing that we should not do a lot of testing, because testing results in high numbers of cases. He said he did not want to see high case numbers.Although reporting numbers of positive cases is important, it is incomplete information. The important statistic for tracking the epidemic is, for a recent period of say two weeks, the ratio of positive cases to the total number of people tested.This ratio as a percent should be less than 3% to avoid an upward exponential rise (spike up of infection. A good or bad infection percentage reflects the level of mask-wearing and social distancing in a local community, county or state from which the data are collected.Unfortunately, the most publicly accessible numbers reported are simply recent positive case numbers without the percentage or the total numbers of recent tests for the same period by which one could calculate the percentage.William MautzKurtistownDeprivation of optionsAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rise in the United States, we find ourselves living with many uncertainties. A few weeks ago, a dear friend of mine announced that she was having a baby. While everyone gathered around her with great surprise and joy, she stood there with a blank expression on her face. As her family members left the room, she told me that she felt selfish for not being happy about her situation.There is a stigma attached to pregnancies: Women should be ecstatic, glowing with this new life they’ve created, and looking forward to the arrival of their newborn. This isn’t always the case, and society needs to recognize that women are allowed to feel however they need/want to feel.With the stress of not having a job due to the pandemic, and her partner being furloughed, the thought of bringing a child into the world at this time has caused her stress and anxiety. To make a difficult situation even more upsetting, when she arrived at her doctor’s for a confirmation of the pregnancy, she was met with disbelief.She asked her primary physician what her options may be in the event that she was not able to have the baby. Her doctor simply stated that “not having your baby is not an option,” and not to worry because “women always feel better knowing that they’ve kept their baby.”Depriving women from being allowed to have options and making them feel guilty for a choice that should be theirs is unacceptable. Women need access to vital health care, and everyone deserves comprehensive sex education. It is a basic human right.Jessica ConnerKailua-Kona"
eugeneweekly_2020_12,"We ve got issues. Winter is coming. But its icy fingers precede its formal Dec. 21 arrival: Temperatures below 30 degrees are likely to activate the Egan Warming Center for several consecutive nights of biting cold forecast this week in Eugene-Springfield. As background for those blessed enough to be only vaguely aware of the Egan Warming Center, it is an emergency shelter system created to shield the unhoused from the elements during the coldest times of the year. Normally administered between Nov. 15 and March 31 by St. Vincent de Paul Society of Lane County — but already kickstarted early twice this year, on Oct. 25 and Nov. 8 — the program activates when overnight temperatures drop to life-threatening levels. Named for Maj. Thomas Egan, who died sleeping outside on a frigid 2008 night in Eugene, the Egan Warming Center’s clear mission is to save lives when it’s too dangerous to be outside. But what happens when it’s also too dangerous to be inside with groups of other people at the very same time? This is the troubling paradox we face right now, as deadly cold confronts a cascading set of complications presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have fewer available warming facilities to use because of fears about virus transmission at host sites, such as local churches. And even if we still had access to those locations, we would need yet more sites. COVID-19 physical distancing requirements now demand fewer people, in beds spaced farther apart, even in short-term congregate shelter settings. Public health guidance limits gatherings to 50 people, which means that with the necessary volunteers and support staff, we can house only about 40 people per site per night. During Egan activations in years past, we’ve sheltered as many as 400 to 500 across the system. We might have safe space for only about 120 with the facilities limitations we now face. The dire scenario of turning people away into the freezing dark seems unthinkable, but there is a real stretching of the system happening right now precisely because we also must maintain best practices to stem COVID-19. We are at a crucial juncture. We need more host sites, but we also need more trained volunteers to run them. Many of Egan’s existing pool of volunteers are older adults, who are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19 or have other existing health concerns and are being encouraged to stay home themselves. So what do we do in the face of these compounding, confounding factors before they severely limit our ability to protect the most vulnerable among us — people who have fallen through every other safety net in our community? For one, we need the Lane County Fairgrounds/Lane Events Center committed to ongoing Egan usage. Multiple nearby buildings there, including Wheeler Pavilion and Expo Hall #2, can shelter the largest numbers of people in a centralized location where the need is greatest. This would simplify volunteer, staff and supply logistics, limit the challenge of transporting guests to more far-flung shelter sites, and create a physical anchor for Egan through the COVID-19 storm. Second, we need more volunteers less vulnerable to COVID-19 who are willing to dedicate themselves to the Egan cause and accept a bit of calculated risk, recognizing that the immediate danger is much greater for those out in the cold. Particularly as longer activations happen later this winter, more volunteers will need to be trained and step forward when asked. Those interested can email EganWarmingCenter@svdp.us to sign up for either of two virtual volunteer orientations scheduled for Dec. 1 and 3. Finally, and more broadly, we need local government and community leaders to come together in new ways around these challenges. We must build out more sheltering capacity to deal with the cascade of issues that will peak as winter weather and COVID-19 both grow in severity. Of course, we are grateful for the many local partnerships and shared stewardship embodied in the Egan Warming Center. It represents ongoing collaboration between a nonprofit, local government, volunteers and faith communities in serving a greater good. But we all need to warm up to new ways of doing things, and we need to do it quickly. If we act together now, we can save lives as we move into a darker, colder time, when disease and freezing temperatures will pose graver threats both indoors and out. Winter, and worse, is coming. Terry McDonald is executive director of St. Vincent de Paul Society of Lane County. Virtual trainings for new Egan Warming Center volunteers, via Zoom, are scheduled 6 pm to 7:30 pm Tuesday, Dec. 1, and 7 pm to 8:30 pm Thursday, Dec. 3.

The church has a unparalleled presence in the life of the community. We need the church in our lives. We still need a place of worship, especially in these unprecedented times.I was asked by a middle-aged man several days ago to pray for him, because he was going through some things. He said, “I have some overwhelming challenges. My bills are behind. I have more money going out than I have coming in. It’s a bad place to be when you are robbing Peter to pay Paul.” The man shared with me that his blood pressure was up. He said, “I’m stressed to the max, and my wife’s sugar level keeps going up. My kids don’t have school clothing money.” He said, “Pastor, I am going through a lot. I need you and your church to pray for us.” I immediately started to pray.I saw him the following Monday as we crossed paths down a hallway. I said, “Hello my friend, I’ve been praying for you, and how was the conference call into church yesterday?” He said, “Oh, I didn’t go on the conference call today, it was such a beautiful day outside. I had a lot I really needed to do. My wife and I sat under the tree for a while and played with the dog, then we went down to some friends’ house and watched some movies, cooked on the grill around 12, then we came back home and sat on the porch. We had a great day.”He said, “We didn’t go to church like that. We attended maybe once or twice a month. But did you all pray for us when you were on your conference church call?”Let me tell you, so many thoughts were running through my head, because you want me to get on a call and pray, while you sit under a tree, and later go to a friend’s house. We need the church for so many reasons. We know that God is everywhere. He’s in our homes, and on our jobs. But we need to make sure we are connected to the church. The place He has provided for us to show our expression of love. The church should be where we come to celebrate God for all He’s done, and for what he’s doing in our lives. We still need the place of worship in the midst of all we are going through in life.In Acts 2, we see the church in its earliest existence. The power of the Holy Spirit was present.The church was growing, and powerful. The church is designed to help the hurting. It is designed to help those who need hope. The church is designed to help those recognize spiritual gifts.I don’t know about you, but I need the church. Every time I go in I express to the God who woke me up this morning, the God who gives us a reasonable portion of health and strength. The one who fights our battles and heals all of our diseases. I need the church to be able to come in this place to express my connection with others, sharing my love for Him. I know we are unable to gather in right now, but we need to continue to connect.You still have time for the movies. You still have time to sit under a tree and play with your dog. You’ve got time to still cook on the grill, but we need to enter in His gates with thanksgiving, and into His court with praise. Shout to Him that you need Him and His church!

LastNaalehuNene tragedyOn Thursday, Nov. 26, Hawaii lost two endangered and distinguished residents.During my daily cardiac power walk in Hawaiian Paradise Park, approaching the corner of Paradise and ParadiseAla Kai, I was shocked to come upon the freshly crushed bodies of two Nene geese. Another stood quietly erect next to his lifeless companions.The geese had been enjoying the temporary shallow pond created by the prior downpour. Their leg bands shone prominent in the clear water. Gently touching these motorist casualties, their bodies were still warm. No one was present in the soft rain, particularly the motorist at fault..Shortly, adjacent neighbors appeared to make phone calls to express their dismay and grief. We removed the bodies to prevent any further possible traffic desecration.The neighbors stated that speeding vehicles is a chronic problem, jeopardizing neighborhood safety in general, aside from threatening local animal life, particularly the nene geese. Frustration was shared about attempts previously made by local families petitioning to have speed bumps installed and signs posted. To date, these concerns have been nixed by Hawaiian Paradise Park administrative authorities.Fifty years ago, as the world’s rarest goose, nenes were on the precipice of extinction. Given strong state advocacy, and passage of the Environmental Protection Act, Hawaii’s Center for Biological Diversity was able to make aggressive recovery and protective efforts.Today, the state census is about 3,000 from the original nearly extinct 30. The current official designation of nenes is “a threatened species,” down-listed from the previous “endangered” status.These challenging times leave scant margin for passivity. Hawaii and the globe will be less if this irreplaceable species was to be lost, aside from ecological impact factors. This issue is unfortunately endemic in many nations, however this is Hawaii.So, where lies the greater culpability and potential for transformative change? Is it the inattentive driver, those who speed, those stained in sadism, or those lost in self-indulgent narcissism and cathected to electronics in motion?Science validates that significant behavioral change would nearly require divine intervention. Similarly, there is a minimal monetary base for redemptive action.Therefore, united and persistent community campaigning must apply to administrative authority.

minnpost_2020_124,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Have the outcome of the 2020 elections in the nation and Minnesota ever seemed murkier No, we are in uncharted waters.Consider the unprecedented circumstances of the moment. Never before in U.S. electoral history have elections loomed in an environment with three such crises afflicting the nation: racial unrest and turmoil, an ongoing pandemic restricting many normal activities, and widespread unemployment.The last comparable pandemic was the Spanish flu of 1918. Unemployment has not reached recent levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The most recent election years featuring major racial turmoil were 1968 and 1992.The uncertainties for the November 2020 elections can be summarized in fraught questions. Will the pandemic, racial unrest and unemployment improve, deteriorate or remain about the same by Nov. 3 What other unpleasant surprises lie in wait for us in the five months until the electionsConsider the potential impact of racial unrest. In 1968, riots in American cities helped the more conservative candidate, Republican Richard Nixon, eke out a narrow victory over liberal Democrat Hubert Humphrey. But in 1992, unrest after the videotape of police abuse of Rodney King, combined with an economic recession, helped sink Republican George Herbert Walker Bush’s re-election.The key groups to watch in national and state polls between now and November are suburbanites, women and racial minorities.The suburbs decide many national and state elections. How will they respond to this remarkable combination of unpleasant circumstances Women have been strongly Democratic in their leanings so far, but will the unrest move them toward the GOPSurprisingly, racial minorities have been more pro-Trump in national opinion polls than their past behavior would suggest. Is this a polling problem or a real trend that will manifest itself on Election Day 2020Present national polling indeed looks good for Joe Biden and Democrats. Biden in mid-June enjoys a lead of eight points over the president in the RealClear Politics polling average.Democratic pollster Doug Schoen warns us, however, that the presidential race is likely closer than that. He notes that recent polls have oversampled Democrats, often giving them a 7 percentage point lead in party identification over the GOP when the margin was only 3 points on Election Day 2016.Schoen also notes that current polls record preferences of registered voters – only about 80-85 percent of them actually vote – but surveys of likely voters tend to boost GOP support. This may well be the case this year because Republicans report more enthusiasm for voting this year than do Democrats.Both presidential candidates, Schoen notes, have problems with groups of voters. Biden needs to boost enthusiasm among his partisans and shore up support with racial minorities. Trump lags with independents, suburbanites and older voters.Minnesota is a state uniquely afflicted with uncertainties because of the many dramatic events of recent weeks. Will the Twin Cities suburbs continue their Democratic trend in congressional and state legislative races in the wake of the devastation from the protests Perhaps they will reward Gov. Tim Walz’s response, but perhaps not.There may be an adverse reaction to the protests in national and state politics, but its scale, geographic characteristics, and impact on the 2020 elections and on governance are impossible to judge. Perhaps the pandemic and weak economy will shrink that reaction.Who knows What if the next five months are as surprising as the first six months of 2020 The smart money is placing no November bets now.Steven Schier is Congdon Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota."
minnpost_2020_14,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Minnesotans are seeing the counterproductive, obstructive games that have plagued Washington, D.C., on full display at our state Capitol in St. Paul. It is a culture we should not accept in our state, let alone our country.Our state is in a moment of great transformative opportunity. A moment that demands not divisive politics and inaction, but transparent, proactive action from our leaders — all for a better future.For too long I have seen my GOP colleagues who currently hold the majority in the Senate play politics with the lives of Minnesotans. Strong-arming positions that block infrastructure bonding and education, even holding political-campaign-style hearings after the civil unrest caused by George Floyd’s killing, instead of passing meaningful criminal justice reform.It didn’t stop there. Instead of leading with purpose or conviction, we saw the majority begin to oust members of Gov. Tim Walz’s cabinet —starting with Nancy Lippinik, the commissioner of Labor and Industry — in response to the governor’s actions to try to keep Minnesotans safe from COVID-19.Thanks to the pandemic, Minnesota faces a deficit in the billions come January when the new Senate reconvenes and we set the budget for the next two years. It is going to take serious leadership to build Minnesota back stronger. Whom do Minnesotans want on their side to take care of their jobs, safety, and prosperity Proactive leaders, or political gamesmenMinnesotans have a choice this November — inaction from the current majority, or a new direction. We cannot accept leaders who would rather choke off all air left in government so it becomes irrelevant, unusable, and untrustworthy, while countless hard-working public servants worry about the fate of their pay and collective bargaining rights.Minnesota needs honest brokers. We need a new Minnesota Senate DFL majority, with committed public servants at the helm who are ready to get to work instead of wasting valuable time while small businesses and our kids are suffering unrecoverable costs.

Neither extremes nor denial solves problems. Purposeful dialogue, rooted in our fundamental values of decency and decorum, can.Senate DFLers have proved that in times of need, we find solutions. We don’t waste time pointing fingers or holding political hearings while a bonding bill collects dust. When in charge, we pass marriage equality, all-day kindergarten, minimum-wage increases, and the expansion of Medicaid. When we get back to business in our regular 2021 session, we will lead.It is time to give the people back their government and elect a Senate majority that puts the people first and restores trust in our most sacred democratic institutions.

minnpost_2020_132,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The culture of race and politics in Minnesota is itself unique, and a history of structural racism brought the Twin Cities to this boiling point. There are significantdisparitiesbetween black and white Twin Cities residents on employment, per capita income, and homeownership. Minnesota is also home to one of the largesteducational achievement gapsin the nation, and the Twin Cities are marked by a historical and enduring pattern ofracial segregation.In February and March of this year, I recruited and interviewed 41 white residents of the metropolitan area between the ages of 18 and 85 as part of my dissertation research. I used a combination of convenience sampling (reaching out to existing networks and posting fliers and snowball sampling (recruiting from my participants’ networks . My sample skews male (59% , older (49% over 55 , and more Democratic (61% . I asked respondents about their political identities and attitudes with the aim of understanding how they conceptualize their race and understand racial politics. My findings from these interviews provide some context for why Minneapolis became the spark that started the fire of racial justice protests now happening nationwide and abroad.1 My respondents are not put in the position of thinking about their race in any significant way. For example, a woman in her late teens conceded that “it’s just never come up in a situation where it’s really mattered or been a factor of … important life changes or decisions that I’ve had to make.” This was a common theme among respondents. A man in his late 50s said that he doesn’t consider his whiteness an important component of his identity because “I don’t think skin color has much to do with the heart.” This does not mean that the respondents don’t sometimes understand that white privilege exists. One respondent, a man in his early 20s, thought of his whiteness as “part of a big package of privilege” he was “handed when he was born.” Similarly, a college aged woman recognized that her whiteness “changed the way that the world interacts with me and the way I interact with the world but … because it’s seen as the default, I’ve kind of been unaware of it for a long time.”2 In my sample, even those who express understanding of white privilege tend to minimize the struggles of their black neighbors.In some cases, this manifested as failing to recognize the structural nature of racism and believing that racism can be directed at whites. In other cases, it was changing the narrative entirely. A male in his 60s claimed that “white privilege ain’t nothing to American privilege … the difference between whites and anybody else in America is nowhere near as stark as the difference between any American and the average person in the world.” Another older male similarly changed the narrative by arguing that “black males have always come ahead of white and black females in making progress in the government system.”Like many Americans, those I spoke to in Minnesota often don’t recognize their whiteness as an identity. Minnesota in particular has a history of structural silence around issues of race, instead embracing the reputation as a liberal stronghold, the culture of ‘Minnesota Nice,’ and theMinneapolis Miracle. At the same time, Minnesota is a microcosm of some racial dynamics playing out at the national scale. Growing diversity is evident in the largest concentration ofSomaliimmigrants in America. Rep. Ilhan Omar’s election thrust this community into the national spotlight. Minnesota is also home to high profilepolice violencethat resulted in protests multiple times before.It’s important to recognize the limitations inherent in a qualitative interview study for making population-level inferences. However, the structural conditions of the Twin Cities — growing diversity, disparities in almost every outcome across race, and historic silence on racial issues — are not unique to Minnesota or even the Midwest. These structures shape how my interview respondents understand their own race and the fight for racial justice that we are engaged in, and they contextualize white lack of empathy toward the protests. Minneapolis may be on fire now, but it’s been burning for a long time.Geneva Cole(@genevavalerie is a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Chicago, where she studies American politics with a focus on political identity and public opinion."

However our graduates chose to participate, it is important that we all join them in celebration. We all need a little celebration in our lives right now, and these students have earned our praise.A student graduating from UH-Hilo this year has persisted through the 2018 lava flow, the rain and flood of Hurricane Lane (which thankfully did not hit us full on , and has completed two semesters of coursework largely online. Because of these challenges, some of these students have lost their homes, they or their family members have lost jobs, and some have had family members experience firsthand the symptoms of the coronavirus. In that respect, they are not all that different from many in our local community. Through it all, however, they have kept their eyes on the goal.This week there will also be the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the night sky, also known as the Christmas Star, which has not been seen this close since 1226. Given Hilo weather, I am not counting on seeing it. Yet, the smiles on the faces of graduating students and families, staff and faculty, is all the light I need. This year has seen another amazing conjunction of staff dedication, faculty ingenuity, and student resilience.Indeed, this holiday season, I am grateful beyond measure for the constellation of amazing things happening at UH-Hilo. The UH-Hilo Kipuka Native Hawaiian Student Center received a new Title III Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions grant that will support the program entitled “Kukulu: Strengthening Native Hawaiian Leadership by Building Retention and Graduation Effort.” This federal funding will allow us to continue to enhance our support of Native Hawaiian students.The UH-Hilo Student Support Services Program has received another U.S. Department of Education TRIO grant award that will allow the program to continue providing services to low income and first-generation UH-Hilo students for another five years. These efforts all support students staying on course and getting closer to the goal of graduation.The ‘Imiloa Astronomy Center, which has had to close its doors to the general public during the pandemic, used county CARES funding to run an educational program for local keiki this fall. This program, using ‘Imiloa’s hallmark strategy of combining culture and science, provided a wonderful supplement to the online learning provided by local schools this year. The young people, exposed to learning, may become our UH-Hilo students of the future, providing us with more of those radiant smiles at commencement time.Another conjunction of inspiration and skill is coming from our data visualization projects, one of which has art and marine science working together to create a 3D reconstruction of local coral reefs. This work is not only cool to look at by those of us who are non-experts, but also provides a useful tool for students and faculty to study the reefs without creating further damage to our fragile ecosystem.This is but one of many projects we hope will come out of our data science team, who is also in the process of developing a new major for students to learn important skills to enable them to work with the big data that lies behind so much of what we do today, whether it be in science, business, or health care.UH-Hilo is an ideal place for interdisciplinary teams to come together to address the big issues, and as our planets align, I am confident that we will be able to continue to serve our island and see more happy and amazing graduates in the years to come.Happy Holidays!Bonnie D.

eugeneweekly_2020_8,"We ve got issues. In this past week, we have seen many in the nation honor the passing of Congressman John Lewis — one of the great leaders of the civil rights movement. In his autobiography, he stated that Martin Luther King was “the person who, more than any other, continued to influence my life, who made me who I was.” Both were beacons of light on the tremendous power of nonviolent resistance and its ability to create social change. I am old enough to have marched with King and yet young enough to be actively taking part in the protests following the murder of George Floyd. It has been heartening to see the number of people willing to speak up and be counted. At the same time, it has been disheartening to see some people dishonor the memory of such civil rights leaders by resorting to violence. Much inspiration for King was provided by the nonviolent campaigns of Mohandas Gandhi. Many who advocate violence believe that the ends justify the means. Gandhi addressed this issue directly: “There is no wall of separation between means and end…. The means may be likened to a seed, the end to a tree, and there is the same inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree.” His point is that once violence has been legitimized, a pattern has been set in motion in which violence continues to be legitimized over and over again. How many times have we seen this borne out by the annals of history? Gandhi and King taught that the only way to break this vicious and endless cycle is to not allow violence to corrupt the process of change in the first place. But there is another response to the “ends justify the means” claim that is immediately and supremely relevant. Donald Trump is a classic demagogue who plays on people’s fears. The violence being employed in Portland is providing the perfect imagery which Trump will manipulate in TV ads to stir up his base of not only voters but also financial support. These ads will not be used on the West Coast but rather in the absolutely critical swing states that won the election for him in 2016. FromThe Atlantic: “Now that it has been deliberately escalated, the violence will provide pictures, footage, video clips, and other material for Trump’s media supporters, and eventually for his campaign advertisements.” They will show “uniformed troops pushing back … restoring order with a strong hand. And it will use the kind of language that appeals to that part of the population that prizes safety over all else.” When lasers are aimed at the eyes of officers and rocks are thrown, these are deliberate efforts to maim human beings. Even if anarchists wish to debate the ethical stance of nonviolence, there is a separate and totally legitimate question which begs to be asked. If you see Trump as the epitome of the greed and capitalism you say you adamantly oppose, why on Earth are you engaging in the very activity that can prop up his campaign and give him a chance to still win the moderate votes that carried his victory in 2016 and are quite capable of doing so again? On the ultimate issue of survival of life on Earth, there are no margins to absorb setbacks. Four years of Trump wiping out efforts to prevent climate catastrophe have placed our world on the very edge of the point of no return. Four additional years will place us on the path to hothouse Earth when unstoppable heating bakes our life support systems and eventually turns Earth into a hellish wasteland. Why are you giving support to putting him in office another four years?

suffolknewsherald_2020_223,"Published 6:14 pm Friday, September 18, 2020ByLetters to the EditorTo the editor:The region’s public infrastructure is critical to our quality of life, our safety and our economic vitality. Infrastructure assets include roads, bridges, rail, air and transit systems, our ports and the extensive systems of utilities serving our communities. Sept. 14-19 is National Infrastructure Week, and this year’s theme is “United for Infrastructure.” For some, it is easy to take infrastructure for granted since many of these assets have been in place for a long time and in some cases, are not even visible to the public. But when these critical systems fail or do not perform as intended, our day-to-day activities and way of life can suffer. For example, it is estimated that there are 850 water main breaks each day in North America.HRSD (Hampton Roads Sanitation District was formed in the 1940s to address water quality concerns in Hampton Roads. As the regional wastewater agency, HRSD is responsible for collecting and treating about 150 million gallons of wastewater each day from 18 communities in Southeastern Virginia. HRSD takes a regional perspective to address these wastewater challenges, operating more than 500 miles of buried pipe, more than 100 pump stations and 16 wastewater treatment plants. This infrastructure is financed with fees paid by local ratepayers, allowing significant economies of scale as the costs to maintain the wastewater system are shared by all. The link between wastewater treatment and water quality in the lower Chesapeake Bay and tributaries is an important and vital connection. A healthy Bay is directly tied to regional economic drivers like tourism and commercial and recreational fishing, along with many other sports and leisure activities.HRSD’s vision of “ensuring future generations will inherit clean waterways and be able to keep them clean,” requires more than improving water quality in our waterways. Fresh water sources need to be available for our future generations — This is where SWIFT comes in. The Sustainable Water Initiative For Tomorrow will ultimately treat up to 100 million gallons of wastewater per day, bringing it to a quality suitable for drinking. This SWIFT water will be repurposed to restore groundwater levels located beneath our very feet. The underground region that holds groundwater, also known as an aquifer, is a very limited and precious resource in Hampton Roads.To accomplish this, SWIFT will require a large infrastructure investment. During the next 10 to 12 years, more than $1 billion will be invested in the region to design and construct the needed pipelines, state-of-the-art treatment plant improvements and groundwater recharge wells. This effort will require talented engineers, contactors, vendors and suppliers. According to the Business Roundtable, every $1 invested in infrastructure generates $3.70 in economic growth. This investment in infrastructure will result in numerous high-paying jobs for many of our local citizens. Beyond economic growth, this wise use of the region’s funds will provide other benefits to our region: it helps address Chesapeake Bay restoration, it will increase pressures in the natural freshwater aquifer to limit saltwater from further entering the groundwater and, hopefully, prevent further settlement of the land. HRSD stands “United for Infrastructure,” and will continue to address some of the most pressing water quality challenges facing our region using wise investments to the region’s infrastructure.Bruce HusselbeeDirector of Engineering, Hampton Roads Sanitation DistrictOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

(Mark Makela/Getty Images/TNS President-elect Joe Biden is expected to restore protection to “Dreamers,” provide a pathway to citizenship for other immigrants, rescind his predecessor’s travel bans and allow in more refugees. It is a welcome break from the cruelty of his predecessor, who separated children from their parents and put them in cages.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to restore protection to “Dreamers,” provide a pathway to citizenship for other immigrants, rescind his predecessor’s travel bans and allow in more refugees. It is a welcome break from the cruelty of his predecessor, who separated children from their parents and put them in cages.Immigration is often discussed as an abstract political concept. But for so many of us, it’s the story of our family.My mother, Violetta Tironi, born in Milan, Italy, in 1931, was a studious girl who liked sports. Her father, Sergio, was a police officer. Her mother, Giuseppina, worked in a bank.World War II turned her life upside down, as it did for so many others. She recalls huddling in a dark cellar of an apartment building to wait out Allied bombing raids, spending hours until the siren would signal that it was safe to come out. She remembered seeing rats, stirred by the underground tremors, crawling over the pipes. One of these raids struck a train, killing her cousin and her uncle.After her studies, my mother set out to find work in the United States. She left the family’s apartment on Washington Street in Milan, took a train to the coast and, on July 4, American Independence Day, boarded the Giulio Cesare for an 11-day journey from Genoa to New York.After a brief stint at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, my mom and dad moved to Kentucky and settled in Barbourville, a coal mining town of about 3,000 people, where they would practice medicine for more than 40 years and raise 10 kids.It must have been difficult for a big-city European girl to relocate to small-town Appalachia. She had to come to terms with concepts like “dry counties,” where no legal alcohol could be sold. Catholics in the 1960s there were often treated like visitors from outer space. When told what church we went to, neighbors expressed consolation and pity.As an immigrant, too, it must have been initially lonely, having to make new friends among people with whom she shared little culturally. No doubt, she could relate to others who felt like outsiders.One holiday season, when I was about 7, we were out delivering gifts to friends. Mom stopped the station wagon behind a downtown store, handed me a bottle of wine and instructed me to take it up the long staircase in the back, to give a special greeting to the woman who lived inside.I suspected the message was some sort of inside joke between the two of them, but I did as I was told. When the lady opened the door, I shouted: “Happy Hanukkah!” She burst into tears and kissed my face until my cheeks were wet. Mom knew just what she needed to hear.Citizens will continue to have honest differences over immigration policy, which is, after all, quite complicated. But when people talk about immigrants in the same way that they speak of an airborne illness, they are disparaging our story, the unique legacy and lifeblood of our nation.If you go back far enough, all of us are from someplace else. We all start as outsiders hoping to belong.Diversity is what truly makes — and keeps — America great.Happy Hanukkah.Joe Hayden is a professor of journalism at the University of Memphis. This column was produced for the Progressive Media Project, which is run by The Progressive magazine, and distributed by Tribune News Service.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.If there’s one thing that wasn’t on my bingo card for 2024, it was this: that amid a national outbreak of bird flu among dairy cows, sales of raw milk would surge.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.The Central Pacific Hurricane Center tropical storm warning remains in effect for Hawaii Island as of 1 p.m. today. The center is forecasting wet and windy weather conditions to persist throughout the day but will decrease in intensity later this afternoon and into the night."
minnpost_2020_165,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Let’s start with why legislators of both parties, our farmers, business communities and a growing number of others from across our local communities are opposed to the California emissions standards.Right now, emissions and air standards are governed at a federal level. Minnesotans have a governor, two U.S. senators and eight members of the House of Representatives to amplify our voice or the voice of our local media if we are happy or if we are unhappy with the rules the feds come up with.Primarily because California has worst-in-nation air quality issues, and probably for some historical political reason, California was allowed in the 1970s to set its own standards. Over time, states have been allowed to choose between the federal standards and California standards. States that choose the California standards, as Minnesota is planning to do, are left without a voice or any representation. Minnesota, even with excellent air quality, would be ceding its regulatory powers to an unelected California bureaucracy that hasn’t even written the next set of rules.2020 has been a tough year for our families, farms and businesses. The economy is hurting and employment suffers because of a virus we can’t yet fully control. These newly proposed regulations could have a devastating effect on a strong economy, let alone the ailing economy we are currently experiencing.We know California is banning gas-powered cars and we know they have a bias against our Minnesota grown ethanol and bio-diesel. We know “California cars” are more expensive than “federal cars,” and we know becoming a “California car” state would prevent our local dealers from doing “dealer trades” to help consumers get the models they desire. This should at least give us pause. We should not impose these regulations, and certainly not in this way, as we struggle to get our economy back moving again.Marlin Fay is the Mower County Farm Bureau president.

minnpost_2020_55,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .At 4 a.m. on March 13, the first teacher strike in St. Paul in more than 70 years ended. With little rest, the district negotiations team who had spent days in intense, closed negotiations — after spending weeks and months in public negotiations — went right back to work continuing to plan for an anticipated closure of Minnesota schools due to COVID 19. This planning started weeks before, running concurrently with both negotiations and the daily operation of the state’s second largest school district. When schools were closed the following week, we heard the phrase, “unprecedented times” a lot. We knew things would never be the same; we just didn’t know how different they would be.Once schools were closed, everyone who doesn’t work in and around public education learned what those of us who do have always known: Schools are deeply connected to the communities they serve. Due to strong leadership and immense talent and operational capacity, Saint Paul Public Schools was well-positioned to respond immediately to community need and did so by repurposing staff duties and restructuring its nutrition services to distribute and deliver, to date, more than 6 million meals to Saint Paul families.All of this proactive, compassionate planning began in late February and ran concurrently with an emotional and contentious teacher strike. What we didn’t know at the time is this planning would also happen alongside our community’s deep and sustained racial reckoning after the killing of George Floyd and the devastating illness and death of Board of Education Chair Marny Xiong. This planning was and is accounting for the deeply personal nature of education and the many ways our families live and work in our community. Reflection and readjustment have been present from the beginning to assess implementation and in real time, change to meet needs in an unpredictable environment. While paying close attention to the feelings connected to school closure, the team has also relied on data, best practices, and expertise from all corners of education and community to ensure not only a good start to the 2020 school year but meaningful transformation of our system of education in the future.I am fortunate to know this team and watch them work, and the connection to Saint Paul schools runs deep among district administration staff. Many are long-time Saint Paul residents, parents, aunties, and neighbors who have more than a professional stake in how this job gets done – they have personal accountability to their communities and families. No one inside of SPPS is thinking about doing enough to get by; they are thinking about how to make it better – even the best of what is possible in unusual times and whatever lies beyond. Saint Paul Public Schools demonstrated incredible leadership in the early days of the statewide school closure and has shown a remarkable ability to adapt — and it’s precisely because of this track record I am confident as a SPPS parent and Saint Paul school board member that we will meet the challenges ahead.As district plans roll out, please remember this: Most people are not interested in making a political statement with their back-to-school preference but rather, they are thinking about how to best care for their families. The parent who says I need an in-person school option because I have to be at work to pay the bills and can’t support my child at home during distance learning or who is concerned about learning loss is not a villain, nor is the parent who is fearful that in-person learning exposes members of their family to risk of illness, nor is the educator or nutrition services worker concerned about keeping themselves and their families safe. All these things are true.And because they are true we can choose to show love and compassion for all our neighbors who are living through the pandemic, the fight against racial injustices, personal grief and losses, and any combination of ongoing health concerns and economic anxiety. We can acknowledge that this is hard for everyone. We can recognize and act on our deep connection and responsibility to one another and decide to do all we can to ease any burdens that may arise with what will be an imperfect and evolving back-to-school plan. Social media victory laps or pointing to a political scoreboard has never taught one child how to read or provided families reliable access to wi-fi, so what we choose to do next and how we choose to treat one another matters a great deal.In Saint Paul, I’m looking forward to unprecedented collaboration and extraordinary acts of love and kindness in the weeks and months ahead to support our schools. If you believe education is important, stand up and be counted. It’s time to go to work.Jessica Kopp is a resident of the Midway neighborhood of Saint Paul, a former teacher, and current member of the Saint Paul School Board.

minnpost_2020_22,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .In the heart of Minneapolis’ Southside Green Zone, in an area nicknamed the “Arsenic Triangle,” East Phillips community members have vied – so far to no avail – to have a voice in a project with direct implications for their environmental health and economic opportunity.The Hiawatha Campus Expansion Project would consolidate Public Works’ water distribution operations and employees from three different sites into one central location: the former Roof Depot site at E 28th St. and Hiawatha Ave. The original vision for the project dates back to 1991 and, thanks to a series of City Council and city agency decisions over the past five years, the site is nearing demolition in preparation for project construction.We ask the City Council to reconsider its decision to use the Roof Depot site for city operations, and to return the land to the East Phillips community. We make this request on the following grounds:Environmental racism:Although the proposed project is expected to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions in city operations, this would come at the direct expense of local environmental quality by increasing pollutants from traffic near this site. As a neighborhood that is 83% Black, Indigenous, and people of color, the East Phillips community would be expected to bear the brunt of the impact for the “greater good,” which is an unacceptable trade-off. Racism has recently been declared a public health emergency in Minneapolis. Knowingly increasing the amount of pollution in a neighborhood primarily populated by Native American, Latinx, East African and Black communities will only exacerbate this problem and demonstrate the hypocrisy of the city’s words.Poor community engagement:Like any neighborhood, East Phillips is no monolith, and individual residents have differing perspectives on the value of the Hiawatha Campus Expansion Project. But, by almost any account, the project does not align with the stated needs or wants of the community, especially its historically disenfranchised populations of lower-income and underemployed households, Indigenous people, and people of color. Even in notes recorded by the city from community meetings, repeated patterns of marginalization emerge: sidelining requests to use part of the site for local food production, affordable housing, and jobs training; prioritizing the needs of Public Works ahead of those of the neighborhood; and failing to respond to residents’ concerns about traffic congestion and pollution on and near the site.The ability for Public Works to explore alternative project sites:The city’s choice to locate the project in the East Phillips neighborhood limits options available to residents to develop their vision for a local community center that promotes sustainable food production, job training, affordable housing, and business development. Public Works has a larger geography to choose from but has chosen to invest there at the expense of community-driven plans. This is unfortunate, as this site could be championed as a step toward realizing the City’s Green Zone initiatives, and instead is moving forward in a business-as-usual mindset.At this pivotal moment I am writing to ask !This work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.by Erin Niehoff, MinnPostAugust 25, 2020"

Gerald Connolly (D-VA-11 . The passing of this bill would require that producers of products creating plastic waste take responsibility for collecting and recycling materials, among several important measures aimed at reducing plastic pollution. This bill would require a nationwide 10-cent beverage container refund on returned containers, regardless of material. It will require source reduction and phase out certain polluting products, and initiate a carryout bag fee for single-use plastic bags. It would require product producers to have a minimum recycled content amount for all goods produced. It would support recycling and composting in our communities. It provides additional accountability for plastic tobacco filters, e-cigarettes and derelict fishing gear (for commercial use . It would prevent plastic waste from being shipped to developing countries that cannot manage such materials. This bill will protect existing state actions, and place a temporary pause on new plastics facilities.Action on this bill appears to have stalled in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, as an active environmentalist and Registered Nurse, I believe that now more than ever we need to take measures that will end the health threats of pollution from petrochemical plants on communities and task federal agencies to develop comprehensive plans to address plastic pollution in our waterways. I care deeply about the environment and our communities affected by plastic pollution, and this bill works to reduce non-recyclable plastic items and encourage the recovery efforts and corporate accountability of recyclable plastic materials. This is a historical effort that will spur innovation and investments in the United States’ domestic recycling and composting infrastructure.

minnpost_2020_112,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’m a white person with a racially diverse family, a student of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and ’60s I grew up with, and informed by racial justice and diversity and inclusivity work both professionally and as a volunteer. Here’s what I’ve learned as relates to our unique moment of opportunity for racial justice and equality:There’s a straight line from slavery to today’s injustices.Equal Justice Initiativefounder and Executive DirectorBryan Stevensonhas said, “The true harm of slavery was the narrative that Blacks are less than human. Slavery didn’t end. It evolved.”When the 13th Amendment outlawed slavery in 1865, whites terrorized Blacks through systematic lynching, convict labor, Jim Crow laws and segregation. When the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools inBrown v. Board of Educationin 1954, it took the National Guard and the Civil Rights Act 10 years later to integrate southern schools. When the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ensured Blacks, once and for all, the right to vote, voter suppression tactics became an art form that continues to this day. Trying to eradicate racial injustice from American life is like playing whack-a-mole with racism.The reason the Civil Rights Movement, for all its courageous acts and hallowed martyrs that led to landmark policy achievements, fell far short of reaching true racial justice and equality is because there has never been a similar, sustained movement to change white hearts and minds. The Freedom Riders, marchers and sit-in demonstrators earned for Blacks freedoms codified in law, but the people from whose chokehold they were yearning to be free haven’t let go.Too many whites still don’t consider Blacks equal, and are triggered by such a small thing as a Black man going for a run or asking a white woman to leash her dog per park rules. And, as Minneapolis has reminded the world, a Black person suspected of passing a $20 bill still might not survive an arrest.There are two strikingly different American experiences.More and more whites are opening our hearts and minds to the reality of white privilege and the pervasiveness of systemic racism. Even before the George Floyd murder, the pandemic and resulting financial crisis exposed egregious inequities inherent in our system, with a growing chorus of calls for rebuilding a more just society. And now, with united chants of “I can’t breathe” echoing across our land and from beyond our shores, whites marching with their Black and brown neighbors in solidarity, we’ve reached a moment of opportunity.But we will have squandered this awakening if we focus exclusively on the urgent need for justice for George Floyd, essential policy changes and criminal justice reform. Now is the time for those of us in the majority to shine a light on the underlying attitudes that have made racial injustice such a resilient force, and that perpetuate the dual American experience.Fill in stereotypes’ blanks.The Minneapolis YWCA racial justice program where I volunteer affirms that we’re all at different points on a continuum of racial sensitivity and understanding — what matters is the desire and commitment to keep moving along the continuum.The best way to move along the continuum is to recognize that racial fear and misunderstanding are fueled by stereotypes that stamp an entire class of people with one perception — one story.People of color can teach others.Every interaction or conversation with a person of color — or their every article or blog — is an opportunity for whites to better understand what it’s like to be born into a society where the color of your skin puts you at a daily disadvantage and subjects you to hatred by complete strangers. People of color can tell whites about personal struggles we never even consider, like building pride in one’s identity without feeling bitter or angry — Martin Luther King Jr. described being Black in America as “plagued with inner fears and outer resentments.” They can tell us the emotional toll of feeling under suspicion wherever they go.They can tell us what it’s like to be excluded from the official or “normal” perspective. Juneteenth provided a prime example: President Trump said, “No one had even heard of it.” That may be a somewhat true statement — if “no one” refers to only Americans who aren’t Black.It’s time to listen, and time to talk honestly about just what it is we’re afraid of. In the spirit of the great Civil Rights Movement over half a century ago, let us not rest in this effort until all people fully experience the rights, privileges and protections promised in the Constitution.Rich Cowles is a retired nonprofit executive, writer, volunteer for various nonprofits, and proud grandfather."

minnpost_2020_75,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .When he was 17 years old, Richard was attending his high school graduation party and dove into shallow water. He struck the bottom of the lake hard, leading to a c5 spinal cord injury, which resulted in a diagnosis of quadriplegia. Richard now uses a power wheelchair for mobility and receives eight hours per day of PCA services, empowering him to be fully capable of managing the affairs of his life.While some of Richard’s employees have come and gone over time, Wendy has supported him for 20 years. She assists Richard with getting out of bed, helps him conduct range of motion exercises, dresses him and positions him in his wheelchair. Without Wendy’s consistent and competent service, Richard would likely be forced into an out-of-home institutional setting, where he would lose his self-directed life. Richard’s relationship with his son would be disrupted; his participation in community activities would be discontinued; and he might lose his job, making him completely dependent on public supports. Wendy and her fellow PCAs enable Richard to enjoy a genuinely inclusive life in his community.PCAs are essential not only to Minnesotans with disabilities and older adults, but also to Minnesota’s health care system. As the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed our hospital systems, PCAs — who are among the lowest-paid employees in our state — are helping keep the highest-risk populations out of Minnesota’s ICUs and long-term care facilities.PCAs make much lower wages than almost all essential health care workers. Minnesota’s PCA program is administered by the Department of Human Services (DHS and is available to individuals of all ages who meet the federal definition of disability. The minimum wage currently agreed upon by DHS and the home care union, SEIU, is $13.25 an hour for many PCAs. For PCAs not covered by the SEIU contract, the average minimum wage is estimated to be $12 per hour.To acknowledge the critical work performed daily by PCAs, Accra, the largest nonprofit provider of home care services in Minnesota, voluntarily increased our PCA wages by 20 cents per hour. Still, it is not nearly enough. The state must do more to support these critical workers.While there is currently a proposal before the Minnesota Legislature to increase the reimbursement rate for PCAs, its prospects are uncertain, given the state’s current budget deficit. And yet to not make this investment, to fail in support of these vital workers, is to risk jeopardizing a system that saves the state tens of millions of dollars every year by keeping our most vulnerable friends and family healthy and in their homes.If our clients are unable to get the help they need to live in their own homes, they will be forced to live in long-term care facilities – which are the highest cost option for the state, and currently the facilities hardest hit by the virus. COVID-19 has killed more than 1,100 Minnesotans at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, accounting for almost 80% of the statewide deaths attributed to the pandemic. Treating people in their own homes whenever possible is critical to protecting their dignity, their safety and our centers of care during the pandemic.Minnesota needs to keep our health care system working for everyone. We can’t afford to jeopardize the care of at-risk Minnesotans. Wendy and Richard are counting on us to do the right thing.John Dahm is president andCEO ofAccra."
eugeneweekly_2020_24,"We ve got issues. On June 13, protesters pulled down a statue called The Pioneer, formerly situated centrally on the University of Oregon campus, and dragged it to the steps of the main administration building, Johnson Hall. They subsequently removed The Pioneer Mother statue on the other side of the building, as well. In doing so, they followed the lead of activists pulling down monuments to racism and racists around the world. Students have protested the presence of these monuments at UO multiple times over the past decades, splashing them with red paint, hanging signs on them and circulating petitions. Professors introduced a measure to the faculty senate to remove the statues as far back as 1992. Faculty and staff likewise contested the pioneer narrative in general in 2015 and called for a review of campus statuary in 2017. Graduate student Marc Carpenter delivered a report to President Michael Schill in May 2019 that irrefutably established The Pioneer’s white supremacist intent. No response. Like people around the world, protesters said, “We’re done asking.” The dedication ceremony for The Pioneer in 1919 was explicitly racist, celebrating the conquest of the “Anglo-Saxon race” over “savage Indians.” Bouts of genocidal violence and forced removals designed to kill Indians were not just the work of a few bad apples — Indigenous erasure was the settled policy and practice of elected officials, with immense support from white citizens in Oregon, regardless of gender. Preferring a narrative of death by pandemics, the U.S. tends to ignore the historical record of Indigenous death by aggressive Anglo wars of expansion, enslavement, murder and forced removals. Why? In part because monuments such as The Pioneer celebrate the people who committed these acts of genocide as heroic. The connection of The Pioneer and Pioneer Mother to Black lives might seem more oblique to people raised on the K-12 curriculum of this state. What do the statues have to do with the Black Lives Matter movement? Why would the Black Student Collective put the removal of these statues on their list of demands? For Black people, expansion of the U.S. meant expansion of white racial terrorism. Every new territory whites invaded meant the expansion of white supremacy and violence against Black people. Most Black people in Oregon know that it was founded as a whites-only state in 1859, with provisions for flogging any Black person who tried to stay. The Pioneer and The Pioneer Mother would likely have been among the “wide majority” who supported the Black exclusion acts that began in the 1840s. The first half of the 20th century, when these statues were made, was the peak of the “scientific” eugenics movement, which espoused the superior “genetic stock” of the “Nordic race.” The racist mural in the stairwell of Knight Library reflects the ideology of this movement. The era further saw the rise of new alien land laws to keep Asians out of Oregon and anti-miscegenation laws that added Hawaiians to the list of races unfit for marriage to whites. The prominent KKK sign that rested on Skinner Butte for years continues to inform how Black people in particular relate to this place. You might still find a racial covenant in the deed of your house, saying it can only be sold to “a member of the Anglo-Saxon race.” After Oregon’s Black exclusion provisions were repealed in 1926, white Oregonians still found ways to make sure people of color — especially Black people — did not feel welcomed. White Oregonians of that era wanted monuments that proclaimed white superiority. The Pioneer statue was not just a monument to a racist individual, but a monument to racism itself. We are relieved that the statues are gone. President Schill has condemned the act of vandalism, but has not repented his own inaction in the face of indisputable evidence of the white supremacist intent of The Pioneer. This could have been a very different story if he had listened the first time and acted more resolutely, but that opportunity was lost. We hope that the decisive actions of those who pulled the statues down will serve as a reminder of the urgency of our fight against systemic racism. We can wait no longer, because the wait is killing us.

minnpost_2020_7,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The following is an editorial fromThe Timberjayof Ely/Tower/Cook, Minnesota.Across northern Minnesota, tribal governments have shown remarkable leadership in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As we’ve reported here, the Bois Forte Band has been out front locally in their efforts to inform, test, and respond to outbreaks of the disease on the reservation.The Bois Forte have established strict protocols for slowing the spread of the coronavirus, by instituting a mask requirement at their facilities, including Fortune Bay Resort Casino, and they did so long before Gov. Tim Walz issued such an order statewide. They’ve been using temperature checks at the entrance to the Fortune Bay compound to screen out those who are potentially ill and they’ve regularly set up community testing for both band members and the general public.And they’ve been aggressive in keeping band members who do test positive quarantined at home. At the same time, they’ve been remarkably transparent about their approach to the disease and about informing the public when band members do test positive.We wish there were as much transparency off the reservation.While, as we’ve seen, such an approach does not guarantee success in completely controlling the pandemic, the sense of community and respect for elders that permeates native culture in Minnesota ensures that tribal governments take COVID-19 seriously.At a time when so much of American society is bitterly divided, we can take a lesson from the common purpose that is so frequently on display on our northern Minnesota reservations. While the reservations certainly have their contentious battles at times, they also have a shared sense of identity that keeps those divisions from becoming self-destructive.That sense of identity with a community in which we live is, sadly, fading from the broader American culture, as too many of us find our identity in disparate online groups or among Facebook “friends,” many of whom we’ve never met. We have increasingly isolated ourselves in political silos, where we only talk to those with whom we agree and demonize those who don’t share our convictions.The loss of community in the broader American society reflects a concerted effort by some of our political and opinion leaders in recent decades to discourage such thinking. While, for much of our history, Americans banded together to create community, in more recent years we have been sold the myth of “rugged individualism,” as if this nation was somehow built by cantankerous mountain men. That, of course, is nonsense, dreamt up in Hollywood, bearing little relation to American history. It was common effort and a focus on the greater good (at least the greater good of those of European ancestry that built America.Today, consideration of the greater good has all but vanished from America, for any group, in favor of self-interest.Fortunately, despite the many challenges that life on the reservation still presents, band members are buoyed by a shared identity that keeps a broad majority paddling in the same direction.Traditional respect for their elders is another reason that native tribes take the COVID-19 pandemic so seriously. This is a disease that has hit the elderly very hard— and native culture does not share the view of some in our nation’s capital who have suggested the deaths of the elderly don’t really matter.Reverence for the elders is built into native culture and it manifests itself in the case of the pandemic with a sense of shared responsibility to keep elders safe from harm.In that sense, it should be no surprise that tribal governments have shown leadership in the face of the coronavirus. Native culture, in general, builds a foundation of identity, community, and respect, that makes a coordinated response possible. These are values that the rest of America desperately needs.Republished with permission."

But millions of people are still being brutalized by a subtler, yet no less abusive, form of law enforcement: probation and parole.During the November election, voters across the country approved a slew of initiatives to reform police departments, curb the failed war on drugs and reduce incarceration. But millions of people are still being brutalized by a subtler, yet no less abusive, form of law enforcement: probation and parole.Promoted as alternatives to incarceration, probation and parole have become systems of oppression and control, primarily over Black and brown people. To fully reckon with racial injustice and police abuses, we must reform these discriminatory systems of supervision.Take Willie White, a middle-age Black father I met in December 2019 at a jail in Lowndes County, Georgia.Like one in every 18 adults in Georgia, White is on supervision — in his case, probation for 10 years due to a 2015 marijuana conviction. In October 2019, White had been riding his bicycle through town when police approached him. He was arrested for possessing drugs, and ended up spending months in jail just waiting for a hearing to challenge allegations of violating his probation.Nearly 4.4 million people in the United States are on probation or parole, often for years. While under supervision, they must abide by numerous vague, difficult to follow, and oppressive conditions — including paying fines and fees many cannot afford; attending frequent meetings, often far away or during work hours; reporting every address change, even if they lack housing stability; and staying away from people with felony records.This system is oppressive for everyone, but it disproportionately impacts Black people. Across the nation in 2016, one out of 23 Black people was on probation or parole, compared to one in 81 whites.I spoke with a Black mother in a Pennsylvania jail just days before her third child was due. She had spent years in jail or on probation for charges she said stemmed from a longstanding substance use disorder. “I asked for programs,” she said, but her probation officer “didn’t want to hear that I need help; they just gave me time.”Probation and parole were designed in the late 19th century to keep people out of jail and prison and help them to get needed services. But the “tough on crime” movement that began in the 1970s turned probation and parole into a means of racial control. Conditions toughened, sentences lengthened, monitoring increased, and sanctions for violations were heightened. Now these systems are fueling mass incarceration.In 2017, nearly half the number of people entering state prisons in the United States were sent there for violating probation or parole. In states where Human Rights Watch conducted in-depth research — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia — people are often locked up for minor rule violations, like failing to report an address change, or low-level crimes, like drug possession or disorderly conduct.To be sure, probation and parole do keep some people out of jail and prison. But in far too many cases, they lead people right back to a cell, while in large part failing to connect them with the services and resources they need.The movement to divest from police and invest in communities is important. But to protect Black lives, we must also divest from probation and parole, and invest those savings into increasing access to jobs, housing, education and health services.7 p.m. update:The Central Pacific Hurricane Center reports as of 5 p.m., Tropical Storm Hone is 125 miles southeast of Hilo with sustained winds of 65 mph moving west at 14 mph.

minnpost_2020_145,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Trauma, anger and pain have boiled over in Minneapolis since George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. As the only state where police officers are required to have a college degree, we have the most educated police force in the nation. Yet we are continually making national headlines for officers killing unarmed citizens. Each incident seems to follow a now-familiar cycle that includes pain, outrage, demands for change, and what seems a conciliatory attempt to improve officer training, police-community relations, or both.As professors of criminal justice, we focus our teaching and research on the social inequalities and structural mechanisms deeply rooted in the criminal justice system. Changes are needed in policing in Minnesota. Below, we recommend several changes that follow existing research. These policy changes are only a beginning. They do not address the longstanding systemic racism in the Twin Cities, where we have some of the worst racial disparities in the country. They do not address the recruitment problem in Minnesota policing, where there is a desperate shortage of officers of color policing in communities where they live. They do not address the toxic culture within some Minnesota police departments, or the need to address officer mental health. They will not rebuild the trust between the MPD and the community, which is likely irrevocably damaged.These changes are a start. They have little cost. And they can be enacted right now.To our knowledge, there has been no evaluation of this new in-service training mandate over the past two years. Our sense is that few departments have used the millions of dollars of funding that the Legislature provided for training, and the training that is taking place is primarily provided by retired law enforcement officers as opposed to experts in conflict management, mental illness, and cultural diversity. For training funds to make a difference, their impact must be independently evaluated.The Minnesota legislature created The POST Board in 1967 to establish law enforcement licensing and training requirements, and set standards for law enforcement agencies and officers. As theStar Tribune showed in 2017, over the past two decades, hundreds of Minnesota law enforcement officers have been convicted of criminal offenses. However, most were never disciplined by the state because the POST Board has little authority. In the criminal complaint against Derek Chauvin, one of the officers is “worried about excited delirium or whatever.” Excited Delirium is not recognized by the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, or the World Health Organization as a legitimate diagnosis. Yet it continues to be a POST learning objective required to be taught to all future Minnesota officers. Currently, 10 of the 15 seats on the Minnesota POST Board are held by law enforcement. It needs to be restructured, and independently evaluated.These recommendations are consistent withthe recommendationsof the Minnesota Working Group on Police-Involved Deadly Force Encounters and the21st Century Task Force on Policing. We are calling on Minnesota to use these recommendations to help break this cycle. We must make meaningful evidence-based change that is continuously independently evaluated.Gina Erickson,Sarah Greenman,Jillian Peterson, andShelly Schaeferare associate professors of criminology and criminal justice atHamline University."
suffolknewsherald_2020_91,"Published 11:10 pm Friday, June 12, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Suffolk Sheriff E.C. HarrisThe senseless killing of George Floyd, the agonizing cries of a man created equal by God but treated much differently by four men, was the result of the brutal combination of an indifference to life and the signs of racism that our minority, and especially African American, communities have endured and continue to endure in this country at the hands of evil and misguided individuals.Police departments, sheriff’s officers, and all aspects of government are not immune from having those same racist and misguided individuals find their way into these governmental organizations, create pain and havoc, and spoil the good efforts and character of the many hardworking, caring and forthright individuals within them. Finding a solution to this problem is not easy, but finding the starting place is. Put simply, there is no place in our world for racism and injustice and no place for racism and injustice among those that call themselves law enforcement.Law enforcement officials, from police to prosecutors, wield enormous power that is on a daily basis used against our fellow citizens in a manner that we hope is right action. But that action is not always right. We know that. We have seen that. We saw that for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Our own city is not removed from the history of racial injustice in the country, nor is it immune to the actions of our citizens, law enforcement and other government actors who fall short of the golden rule, which is to treat people the way you wish to be treated.The principle of treating others the way you would want to be treated has been the rule and guide of my 38 years in law enforcement. If someone is breaking the law, I stop them. That’s my job. But I stop them while preserving their life and dignity as a human being and afford that person the due process owed as a citizen of the United States. That is what I would want afforded me. That is how I would want to be treated. But I know that our African American communities across the country are not always afforded this type of treatment, equality or respect by law enforcement. I am angered and frustrated by that fact.So how do we respond? We have responded as Americans who, as a nation, have had a rich tradition of peaceful protest and social discourse to find solutions to our problems, and we should welcome the opportunity to find ways to allow liberty to flourish for all our communities, regardless of race, creed, color, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.How do I respond as the sheriff of Suffolk? With the continued community engagement that has been the cornerstone of my office and built the relationships with our fellow citizens that we still enjoy today. That includes continued training and my continued requirement that my deputies are and will be the quality and compassionate human beings Suffolk deserves.How does the broader law enforcement community respond? By showing what good police officers are, sharpening their hiring and training processes, and by rooting out those officers that would damage the institution and cause the type of pain George Floyd’s family is experiencing.I don’t have all the answers. I don’t pretend to. But I realize if things were going right in our country, so many people wouldn’t feel so wronged. So, as I listen to the experiences and stories of our minority community, their pain, their hope, their desires for change, what they are happy with and what has to improve, I am encouraged by their resolve, desire their trust, and realize that we as law enforcement still have a good way to go to strengthen that fragile and all-important trust that exists between the police and the community it is policing.I encourage the citizens of Suffolk to never forget the injustices we have seen and heard, to have the hard conversations that need to be had and have them with a heart filled with compassion and understanding, and above all else to care for one another.E.C.

With the COVID-19 health crisis and the social and economic unrest, I certainly believed things were just about as bad as they could get. I then received news of two more deafening blows: namely that a developer is proposing to build even more houses in the historic village that my family has called home for well over 100 years, and, again, the Nansemond River is closed to harvesting oysters because of polluted waters being discharged into it.These two poison apples grow from the same twig; they are intertwined. In fact, the overdevelopment of North Suffolk is a major casual factor of the pollution of the river. Suffolk and the Hampton Roads Sanitation District simply do not have adequate facilities to appropriately keep up with the demand caused by the growing population.I am a descendant of Eclipse watermen and like generations before me, I lease oyster grounds from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Being able to harvest oysters from the nearby river is one of the truly unique things about life in northern Suffolk. It is unfortunate that this occupation that has weathered the storms of DERMO and MSX is now being threatened by overdevelopment.The overdevelopment that concerns me is not merely happening along Bridge Road and in Harbour View, it is taking place right within the center of our historic oystering community. To the disgust of nearly all of my neighbors, friends and relatives in Eclipse, a tract builder has begun erecting houses in what was the forest in the center of Eclipse — a place that was the setting of many of my best childhood memories. It is not enough that space has been cleared for home development, but now we understand a builder wants to cram 15 houses onto the field behind our community center, the building my relatives called their schoolhouse. I am left to wonder about the absence of environmental impact studies that would show the harm this development is doing to the oysters on the grounds I lease.This disregard for our oyster-harvesting way of life and for our cherished historic community is nauseating. When will those who we elected to protect us stop this intrusion and strengthen the things that remain?John S. Newman Jr.SuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_63,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .What if you were unable to access housing or find a job with a livable wage And you couldn’t access public benefits that might be able to help, you lost your parenting rights, and were not able to exercise your right to vote This is often the reality individuals with a criminal record face in our society simply because they cannot remove the stigmatizing label of “criminal.”One legal remedy available in Minnesota is criminal expungement, the sealing of criminal records. But it’s not working: The cost, time — including an in-person hearing — and intricacy of the process make expungement something many Minnesotans can only dream of. This is a miscarriage of justice.Our criminal justice system demands rehabilitation but does not support individuals as they try to re-enter society after a criminal conviction. The current system keeps people in poverty or engaging in other criminal activity as a means to survive and needs to be addressed more comprehensively by the Minnesota Legislature.We know that an individual’s criminal record often determines future interactions with the criminal justice system and can easily become cyclical. Criminal expungement, when allowed to work properly, can disrupt that cycle of crime, stigma, poverty, and despair. We are long past the time to consider the full spectrum of an individual’s interaction with criminal justice, from a first interaction with the police to expungement of their criminal record once they have served their time.Our research in this area has led us to conclude that criminal justice policy and police reform must be informed by those most directly affected by current policies. We should also look beyond police brutality in order to address structural racism in the criminal justice system.This system is stacked against the re-entry of certain groups with criminal records, especially against individuals who are victims of sexual exploitation and who have prostitution and prostitution-related convictions. Research shows that many people who are arrested for prostitution are also victims of exploitation and trafficking. They are then arrested and potentially charged for crimes — including petty theft, check fraud, or drug possession — that may be caused by their circumstances of exploitation. These arrests and charges follow them forever, impeding their ability to thrive. They are forced to live with a criminal record that exacerbates their feelings of trauma, stigmatization, and shame.After two special sessions of the Minnesota Legislature following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent uprising, both of which focused on police brutality, a police reform bill was passed that unfortunately does not go far enough to address structural racism in the criminal justice system. For that reason, we are proposing several recommendations, based on feedback we received from individuals who are victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking, and more than 35 interviews with professionals working in and around the criminal justice system.Minnesota legislators must now direct their attention to criminal justice policy more broadly.Change policy design processes.Policy should be, first and foremost, informed by those most affected. Many policies around criminal justice and police reform have not been informed by those affected, and thus have resulted in greater harms than benefits.Standardize the expungement process.Wide variations in the expungement process across Minnesota counties and cities make it difficult for individuals who need to file for expungement in several counties. Many counties across the state do not even hear expungement cases.Shorten the time requirements to access expungement.Before filing an expungement petition, individuals must wait between two and five years, depending on the type of conviction, without committing any other offenses (including traffic violations .SupportH.F. 3816— The “Clean Slate Act.”This bill would allow automatic expungements for certain convictions. Individuals would not have to file expungement petitions or navigate the complicated process, but rather be led through prosecutorial agreements. A provision in the bill would also benefit individuals who have been sexually exploited.As things stand today, the process for obtaining criminal expungement is an obstacle course. It is in many ways designed to make the re-entry of individuals with criminal records impossible, thus creating a cycle that forces individuals into generational poverty or crime as a way to survive. We need to break this cycle, which involves legislators addressing more than police brutality.In February 2019 at the University of Minnesota, Sasha Hulsey (MPP, MPH , Kshitiz Karki (MPP , Olivia Reyes (MPP , and Alyssa Scott (MPP began researchingthe barriers individuals with prostitution and prostitution-related crimes face when accessing criminal expungement. They have done extensive work in this area, including an emphasis on participatory policymaking."
suffolknewsherald_2020_68,"Published 5:40 pm Tuesday, December 15, 2020ByStaff ReportsFollowing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine late last week, the first shipment of the freezer-packed vials arrived in Virginia this week, with health care workers and nursing home residents the first to receive doses.Officials have solved the logistics for quick transport of the two-dose vaccine, which must be stored at 94 degrees below zero, but the biggest hurdles will be tackling Americans’ skepticism about the shots and continuing to promote safe practices such as wearing face masks and social distancing throughout the coming year.Considered the world’s strictest medical regulator, the FDA stated that Pfizer’s vaccine appears safe. However, the shots can cause temporary fever, fatigue and aches — meaning hospitals will need to stagger employee vaccinations. And wary Americans will be watching to see whether health care workers take the shots.A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Health Research poll revealed that U.S. residents are not convinced. Only about half want to be vaccinated. The remaining 50% are evenly divided between those who won’t take the vaccine and those who are unsure.Health and elected leaders officials are also concerned that COVID fatigue and indoor holiday gatherings could lead to “spreader” events — causing a significant increase in coronavirus cases and deaths.This global pandemic is a marathon, not a sprint, and we are nowhere near the homestretch. Even if Moderna Inc.’s coronavirus vaccine receives FDA approval as expected later this week, it will still be midspring until either of the shots are available for the average person.In other words, this holiday season is not the time for us to let our guard — or our face masks — down. The best gift we can give the frontline health care workers we have depended on during the past nine months of the pandemic is to continue practicing 6 feet of social distancing, proper handwashing, limiting our contacts and wearing face masks. After all they have done for us, this is the least we can do for them.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_153,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when asked whether he needed proof that Soviet missiles were in Cuba, French President Charles de Gaulle famously replied: “No, no, no, no. The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me.”The country that commanded such respect was the one I proudly represented for nearly four decades as a foreign service officer. Sadly, the era when people around the globe trusted and admired America is of another day. We no longer inspire others or convince them of our commitment to democracy, human rights, the rule of law and telling the truth.Our exceptionalism always rested more on adherence to principles laid out in our Declaration and Constitution than on our military might or economic power. When Lech Walesa —the shipyard worker who helped bring down the communist regime in Poland — spoke to a joint session of our Congress, he began with the stirring opening lines of our Constitution: “We the people.”Later, when the Berlin Wall fell and Eastern Europe was freed from Soviet domination, people there wanted to be like us. They sought democracy, a market economy, and individual freedoms. We had promised to help them achieve those aspirations, and we did so; we kept our word. With material support and encouragement from us and other Western democracies, the former members of the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact made the reforms that enabled them to join the two premier democratic clubs, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO and the European Union.Another example of the value we have placed on credibility is the U.S. radio network, the Voice of America. When it went on the air during World War II, it broadcast this pledge: “The news may be good or bad for us – we will always tell you the truth.” Reliable, objective journalism remains VOA’s watchword to this day (though critics maintain – against all evidence and logic – that a one-sided propaganda tool would be more persuasive .Our nation’s credibility suffered a huge blow during the Vietnam War as the rosy outlook pushed by senior military and civilians officials clashed with on-the-ground reporting by journalists. We eventually saw that the downbeat picture offered by reporters was far closer to the mark than the official view.The war we launched against Iraq in 2003 was another searing example of words failing to match deeds. We said the war — which cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars in squandered treasure —was justified because Saddam Hussein’s had weapons of mass destruction. None was ever found.Nations, like people, stand tallest when actions are faithful to words, when we consistently mean what we say and say what we mean. Regrettably, that’s just not the case today. One day our president suggests the leader of North Korea is a mad man; the next morning the two men are exchanging love letters and North Korea’s nuclear threat is said to be over (it isn’t .We embrace anti-democratic tyrants while sidelining or ignoring the interests and contributions of long-time friends. If policy is what leaders and governments say and do, the world is rightfully confused and uncertain about America’s direction. What and who are we for today And tomorrow How can friends and allies count on a country whose president offers threats, tantrums and unsubstantiated boasts but no clear purpose or consistent messageThe same incoherence bedevils the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Bombast, dishonesty, dubious cures and disdain for scientific facts have characterized the White House effort. Instead of admitting our errors, we blame others. Once the United States led the international response to such crises; now we sulk on the sidelines and look for scapegoats. Few are impressed.Restoring our national reputation requires returning to our core values, including credibility. That task must start at home, by leveling with the American people about the work to be done to put our own house in order. The coronavirus has revealed pervasive social injustice that must be acknowledged and seriously addressed. As Shakespeare put it, “To thine own self be true; And it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not be false to any man.”The next American president should speak the truth, to Americans and to the rest of the world. He should not exaggerate our accomplishments or sugarcoat our imperfections. We can aspire to greatness without claiming to be Utopia. When we strive to live up to our ideals — and are honest when we fall short — the world will notice and applaud. There will be no need to blow our own horn.Dick Virden is a retired senior foreign service officer and a graduate of the National War College. He lives in Plymouth."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez actually got something out of politics this year beside a barrage of campaign advertisements: With a sliver of the almost $19 million that she raised on her glide to reelection, AOC bought and gave away 200 Thanksgiving turkeys.Turkeys are reminiscent of New York’s Tammany Hall, which used to deliver birds, along with coal and other useful things, to Democratic constituents. Much of AOC’s New York City district is poor. If government is hobbled, and mediating institutions like political parties and unions (another traditional source of holiday turkeys are diminished, constituent needs go unmet. That’s both challenge and opportunity.“The Congresswoman believes that when a larger federal response fails, as it has with Covid-19, we have a responsibility to think creatively about what we can do with others in our community to meet the needs of our constituents,” said Ocasio-Cortez campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt in an email. Hitt said AOC campaign volunteers and donors made 200,000 community check-in calls, delivered 80,000 meals, distributed 100,000 masks and recruited more than 11,000 tutors for students in remote learning.The results of a decadeslong conservative campaign to destroy the efficacy of government, and to undermine voters’ faith in it, are now painfully evident. The politics of the 21st century has consisted, to a substantial degree, of a series of Republican mega-failures — Iraq, Katrina, financial crisis, Donald Trump, COVID-19. Yet consequences have been severed from performance; voters have repeatedly stuck with the party. Democrats have held full control of the federal government for only two years this century.Polarization has been devastating to U.S. governance but a financial boon to U.S. campaigns. Democrats spent tens of millions of dollars on losing campaigns this year. Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, raised an absurd $94 million in her run for Senate in Kentucky, most of it thanks to Democratic rage at her opponent: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Defeats don’t necessarily mean all the money is wasted; some campaigns produce positive after effects. But what if a portion of that money had gone to the equivalent of turkeys and coal instead? What if Democrats, as a party, provided fewer television advertisements and more health care — delivered directly to struggling constituents?As long as Republicans retain the power to obstruct, the capacity to use government to improve outcomes is limited. But the capacity to use a party is not. ActBlue, the Democratic donor website, raised more than $4 billion this election cycle. If 1% of that sum were redirected to high-profile, politically salient constituent projects, Democrats would have $40 million to work with. That’s $40 million — potentially far more when combined with local donors — to ease cynicism, build trust, nurture loyalty, deliver services. (It wouldn’t be a crime if a disproportionate number of beneficiaries were in swing counties. AOC delivered turkeys (and more this year, like a ward boss of the past.

It wasn’t until 1965 when BlPOC people — menandwomen — were able to practice the exercise ofactually voting. The first vote ever cast in the U.S. was in 1788. It wasn’t until 1870 that it was written to allow Black men. Even then, that right wasn’t met with acceptance. There were several barriers in place to ensure Black men couldn’t afford to vote. They were literally charged a tax to do so. In 1920 white women were included in the right to vote. It was another four and a half decades before Black and Brown women were able to partake in the process of decision making in regards to the well-being of our own families, finances or representation. The cards have always been stacked against us. Voting was a way to participate with the agency of our own freedom, even when walking miles and miles and waiting hours and hours to cast that vote. It held dignity, a step to sovereignty, It wasn’t given to us. We fought for this. Our perceived freedom wasn’t a package deal with civil rights. As a matter of fact, our perceived freedom had very specific barriers to civil rights, human rights or recognition of our existence as functioning human beings. Voting gives “the people” a voice. Our ancestors brought generations of our families through the struggle for the right to be heard. To be considered “the people.” Voting is a calculated choice. It is not a lottery ticket. It’s not the end all be all, we know that. It is, however, a right. The very least of grievances the Black community can make as a collective voice. To have the ability to vote is a well deserved, hard earned right passed down from our ancestors to exercise choice as full citizens of these United States. It was never a given. Even to this day suppression of the Black vote is rampant, and every hour we stand in line is a homage to the dedication of our grandparents and great grandparents who sacrificed everything for us to do so. If our vote didn’t matter, the systems in place wouldn’t try so hard to stop us. We know that too. Over the years I’ve watched my mother walk, drive and, now in her wheelchair, approach the ballot box with her assertion of power. I proudly follow in her footsteps. As she has passed her conviction to me, I have done the same for my children. The battle continues. For the wellness of Black people, this war against our existence as whole humans is far from over.

suffolknewsherald_2020_215,"Published 6:41 pm Friday, September 25, 2020ByStaff ReportsPeople who deal with incidents at railroad crossings in Suffolk have come to regard them as a matter of not if, but when.That’s the message from Norfolk Southern Public Safety Director William Miller. In an interview this week promoting Rail Safety Week and a new partnership the rail line has with Waze, he said the incidents have become “almost a yearly occurrence” in Suffolk.He’s right. Since 1975, there have been 64 vehicle/train incidents in the 47 at-grade crossings in Suffolk. Many of them have resulted in tragic deaths, as have incidents with pedestrians on the tracks, as well.Since 2000, 19 at-grade crossing incidents in the city have occurred, including two so far this year, two last year, three in 2018 and one in 2016.The partnership with Waze is in its second year, but users of Waze — a navigation app — in Suffolk just started seeing safety messages this week, when the partnership expanded to Suffolk.Users in the downtown Suffolk area, where many of the crashes happen due to the numerous railroad crossings, see safety messages through the app. One says, “Tracks nearby. Be smart. Be safe.” The other says, “Your safety starts with you. Cross carefully.”Miller stressed that drivers should not try to go around lowered gates or try to beat a train.“We tell people, no matter what, don’t ever try to beat a train,” Miller said. “It’s just not worth it. If there’s a reason that a train is stopped, and it’s longer than normal, turn around.”Other safety tips around trains include:The train you see is closer and faster-moving than you think.Be aware that trains cannot stop quickly.Never drive around lowered gates — it’s illegal and deadly.Do not get trapped on the tracks; proceed through a highway-rail grade crossing only if you are sure you can completely clear the crossing without stopping.If your vehicle ever stalls on the tracks, get out and get away from the tracks, even if you do not see a train. Locate the Emergency Notification System sign and call the number provided, telling them about the stalled vehicle.At a multiple track crossing waiting for a train to pass, watch out for a second train on the other tracks, approaching from either direction.When you need to cross train tracks, go to a designated crossing, look both ways, and cross the tracks quickly, without stopping. Remember it isn’t safe to stop closer than 15 feet from a rail.Always expect a train. Freight trains do not follow set schedules.Rail Safety Week began Sept. 21 and continues through Sept. 27.

But it would also be helpful if they would publicly deal with the concerns that have already been raised relative to the proposed PolyMet and Twin Metals mining projects, which place Lake Superior and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness at serious risk. Every one of these issues falls within the scope of what the Responsible Mining Foundation and IRMA advocate. This includes:In addition, both the mining companies and our elected officials have ignored the impact of artificial learning and machine learning on the reduction of jobs in industry. This is a most impactful technological advance and may well explain the failure of the Minnesota-PolyMet contract to guarantee employment levels. The simple fact is that mining is becoming increasingly automated thereby requiring less labor.Other concerns, including the corruption of the permitting process by Minnesota Pollution Control, are currently under review by the courts.The addition of David Foster and Mark Richie and their respective organizations in this battle for a more open and honest government would be most welcome.Tom Berkelman is a retired DFL legislator from Duluth.

suffolknewsherald_2020_184,"Published 3:49 pm Friday, November 6, 2020ByStaff ReportsIn approximately two months, City Council will have two new faces. LeOtis Williams, a longtime community leader, takes over the Whaleyville Borough seat. With the promotion of Mike Duman to mayor, someone yet to be appointed will fill in the Chuckatuck Borough seat.We are eager to see these two new people step into leadership roles and work with the rest of the council. Likely one of the first things they will have to do is hire people.The city currently is without a permanent city manager, deputy city manager, police chief, public utilities director and city assessor. The chief of staff also is working on her retirement papers.To be clear, City Council directly hires only two of these positions — the city manager and assessor. However, the other positions will be filled by the city manager, in turn.We’re certain that every one of the people in these positions on an interim basis is performing his or her job well.As such, we wouldn’t quite call this a leadership crisis, but we do hope to see purposeful movement to fill these positions on a permanent basis soon. Having an interim leader almost inevitably leads to a certain amount of uncertainty among those who are employed by the city and these individual departments, and those who must interact with these organizations on a regular basis.City Council took its first steps toward selecting a new city manager on Nov. 4, with the hiring of a consultant firm to help with the search. They also gave permission to their human resources director to begin interviewing candidates for the assessor job and putting together a packet for City Council to review.It remains to be seen whether council intends to do any hiring before their new colleagues are inaugurated, but it’s good to see they’ve at least started the process.Council should take its time and make the right selection, particularly as it relates to the city manager. With the right city manager, most of those other positions will fall into place.The city assessor also is a council appointee, and an important one, as this position directs the assessment of real property. This revenue stream is expected to bring in roughly $225 million, according to the city’s adopted 2020-21 operating budget. And while the city needs this revenue stream, it also must ensure the assessor’s office is fair to all of its citizens and conducts its work transparently and accurately.The right decisions here will benefit all.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_104,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .National data clearly show that, more than any other racial or ethnic group,Black Americans are more likely to contract and die from COVID-19. This statistic is not surprising; it is part of an unjust but predictable pattern of racial disparities in health outcomes caused by policies, practices, and structures that routinely disadvantage Black Americans, Indigenous communities, and people of color while creating advantage for white Americans.It is clear that to eliminate health disparities, we need to name and address racism. This is why, in the midst of a global pandemic and protests demanding justice following the murder of George Floyd, there has been a growing movement to declare racism apublic health emergency.Our health and well-being are shaped by multiple factors and systems that shape neighborhood conditions, opportunities for education and employment, and access to resources that support health and well-being. However, structural racism – which doesn’t require individual intent – is also present in how these systems function, leading to racial disparities across multiple outcomes,including health and well-being.In the United States, the COVID-19 mortality rate for people who are Black is higher than for other racial groups.National data showthat the mortality rate for Black Americans is 2.3 times higher than the rate for Americans who are white or Asian, and 2.2 higher than the rate for Latinx Americans.COVID-19 presents new challenges and threatens to further widen existing health inequities. Black Americans and people of color already experience higher rates of chronic disease as a result of inequitable systems; these underlying conditions increase the risk of having more severe COVID-19 symptoms. Social distancing, our primary prevention strategy for slowing the spread of the virus, can be considereda form of privilege, easier for people with a stable home and who live in places with lower housing density, who have jobs where remote work is possible, and who can afford to have healthy food delivered to their door. People with health insurance or the ability to pay out-of-pocket for health care can seek testing and treatment, rather than delaying care.There isn’t a simple short-term solution for eliminating these health inequities, but we can make changes. As nonprofit organizations and businesses, health care systems, school districts, and state and local governments respond to COVID-19, it is critical that we not only create a short-term safety net for all, but also do the long-term work to dismantle and rebuild the systems that contribute to inequities.Without a long-term commitment to change, the same inequities will persist after the immediate threat of COVID passes. In our recent report,“The Role of Health Care in Eliminating Health Inequities in Minnesota,”we offered aframework to guide collective actionfor the health care sector and its partners. There have beenother recent callsfor the health care sector to take deliberate action, but a public health approach to addressing racism requires work to occur across multiple systems.Our report also provided the following as starting points for institutions and organizations working to reduce health inequities:Naming racism as a public health emergency clarifies our direction forward, but will have no impact unless followed by action. This must be a moment to collectively recognize and address racism as a crisis that demands our attention and a true commitment to long-term change.Melanie Ferrisis a research scientist at Wilder Research.

suffolknewsherald_2020_110,"Published 9:54 pm Friday, May 29, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Howard HallRecently, we’ve learned of numerous disturbing decisions by the Virginia Parole Board, beginning with granting parole to Vincent Martin, who murdered a Richmond police officer. It’s alleged that this terrible decision was made without input from the victim’s family or the Commonwealth’s Attorney. Subsequently, we learned that criminals convicted of murder in Halifax County, Roanoke, and Amelia County also have been released without required notifications. This is a disturbing trend.The Office of the State Inspector General has initiated an investigation of the Parole Board. The Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police strongly supports this investigation. There are numerous issues that deserve examination, including the processes used during the parole review and whether it’s appropriate for the board chair to conduct her own investigation into Martin’s guilt or for her to publicly criticize the VACP and Richmond police chief. Others include allegations that sex offenders have been scheduled for release without GPS ankle bracelets, that decisions have been based on hearing examiner reports that are insufficient, and that the IG’s Office has interviewed at least one individual who has knowledge of procedural and ethical violations at the Board. If any of these are true, the Board is not only negligent, it’s putting law-abiding citizens at risk. We urge the IG to thoroughly investigate these issues and not be bound by any artificial timeline.We are grateful that the first steps have been taken to stop these dangerous decisions, but we fear this is part of an effort to release a larger number of criminals into our communities. Recently, the General Assembly passed an emergency bill to allow the immediate release of certain inmates, under the guise of preventing the spread of COVID-19. Seventeen members sent a letter to the Governor urging, among other things, that we “use every tool at our disposal to reduce the inmate population.” There is no mention of why these criminals are in jail. It’s because they were arrested on probable cause, convicted on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and sentenced by a court. It’s because they have victimized our citizens.What I have described is the goal of the “criminal justice reform” movement. It’s an effort to release criminals to reduce “mass incarceration.” The authors of the aforementioned letter note that more than 57,000 criminals reside in Virginia’s jails and prisons. That is six-tenths of 1 percent of our 8.5 million residents. Since a very small segment of offenders are responsible for most violent crime, this is not surprising. What these activists fail to acknowledge is that, despite its faults, our justice system has been the most effective in the world for more than 200 years.We have seen this before. During the ’70s and ’80s, consideration for criminals outweighed consideration for victims. Crime was much higher, and citizens demanded action. Elected leaders of both parties passed legislation that increased accountability for offenders and made victims a priority. Criminals went to jail and, especially for violent crimes, stayed. Crime was reduced to historic lows. While we continue to enjoy the results, we are in danger of squandering these accomplishments to appease the ideals of radical activists. How soon we forget.Reasonable people may disagree about how criminals should be punished. New ideas that show promise for rehabilitation are worth evaluating; however, there are crimes that are so heinous that the perpetrators must never go free. The murder of a police officer is at the top of that list. These criminals will never pay their debt to society and, while prison won’t rehabilitate, it will prevent additional victimization.The release of convicted criminals places the safety of our citizens in jeopardy. Other states who are following this dangerous path are already suffering. Headlines from New York, California, and others document the crimes committed by those who’ve been released. Do we want this in Virginia? I hope not.Our officers are committed to ensuring your safety, but we need help. Before the misconduct of the Parole Board gets worse, before our elected leaders continue down the path of placing criminals before law-abiding citizens, and before crime rates rise, we must demand that accountability be restored and that dangerous criminals be kept in prison for the duration of their sentences.Howard Hall is chief of police in Roanoke County and president of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2020_190,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .As the confirmation hearing process heads toward the seemingly inevitable placement of Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the U.S. Supreme Court, the notion being bandied about in some Democratic circles — and opposed in most Republican quarters — to enlarge membership of the Supreme Court is attracting increased attention. Politics aside, it is a prudent proposition.Expanding the size of the tribunal would not be that novel, although it certainly would be running into strong headwinds. The size of the Supreme Court has varied from six at its outset to up to 10 justices, numbers that occasionally invited but rarely produced evenly divided tie votes.Some Republicans, incidentally, have advocated the reverse: court unpacking. During Barack Obama’s presidency, a diverse handful of GOP senators — ranging from Ted Cruz of Texas to Arizona’s John McCain — suggested a smaller Supreme Court. One, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, advocated cutting the number of lower federal court jurists for fear that Obama or his presumed successor, then seeming to be Hillary Clinton, would fill the existing or future vacancies.But the number of Supreme Court jurists has been stabilized since 1869 by statute at the current number of nine, apart from vacancies resulting from resignation or death.The last overture to change the law and add jurists, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s effort to boost membership, has given the concept a bad taste and a troublesome term: “court packing.”It came about because of FDR’s dissatisfaction with some rulings by the conservative-leaning court, composed primarily of pre-New Deal Republican appointees overturning some of his New Deal programs. The effort was viewed negatively by the public, including many in Roosevelt’s own Democratic Party, and was soon defeated in Congress.But the short-lived plan had some significant effects. One was that the court, perhaps fearful of changes to its composition, veered off in a different direction and soon thereafter upheld three key pieces of New Deal legislation.Those important victories were balanced against major GOP successes in the ensuing off-year congressional elections, winning an extraordinary 72 new seats in the House of Representatives and gaining seven new senators. These triumphs effectively brought Roosevelt’s domestic legislation to an end, coupled with the increased attention and resources devoted to foreign affairs and military matters as World War II loomed.While Roosevelt’s “packing” proposal then and the one being aired now have political roots, expanding the number of High Court jurists makes sense for wholly apolitical reasons.The main one is the favorable effect it would have on the court’s productivity. With rare exceptions, such as litigation between states, the Supreme Court picks and chooses which cases it deigns to hear among the 7,000 to 8,000, or more, petitions for appellate review filed each year. For many years after World War II and extending for several decades, the court accepted and decided 300 or more of about 3,000 to 4,000 annual applications, about 80% civil lawsuits and 20% criminal.But that figure has precipitously declined in recent years. During the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts over the past 15 years the court has been accepting and deciding 75 or fewer cases each term. The past COVID-affected term dipped below this figure, with the justices issuing decisions in just 61 cases, less than 1% of the total of appeals brought to them, and 11 fewer than in the 2018-2019 term. In short, while the number of requests for hearings has doubled in the last few decades, the number of cases accepted and decided has shrunk remarkably, by about 80%.This is not to suggest that the current justices are not working hard. But they have more resources than ever before, three or four high-caliber law clerks each, along with technologically speedy devices. They also seem to be spending more time on outside ventures than their predecessors, with half of them writing books, along with teaching, public speaking gigs, and occasional engagements with media talking heads.If they have the time and energy for these activities, some would say, they could spend some more of both churning out additional rulings.In contrast, the Minnesota Supreme Court, with seven members, issues decisions in about twice as many cases per year — 146 in 2018, for example. Granted, it has fewer petitions for appellate action to review each year, about 700 annually, but it accepts in its discretion about 15% of them each year, in addition to several dozen cases that the tribunal is required to hear, such as workers compensation and first degree murder appeals.Roberts has recognized these dilemmas. In a presentation at the University of Minnesota Law School two years ago this month, he lamented his tribunal’s shrinking case load and indicated he would like to see it boosted, an aspiration that has not materialized. Neither he nor anyone else has equated the declining quantity of the court’s output to an increase in the quality of its work or the opinions it issues.A prudent solution lies in the expansion of the number of justices, i.e., court-packing. It should be done for reasons of improving the performance of the court, not for politics.If the number were increased to 15, the figure that seems to be a fixation of court-packers from FDR to today, the court could sit in rotating panels of five jurists, much like most intermediate appellate courts at the federal and state levels in Minnesota and elsewhere. Or, it could have two seven-member panels with one alternate in the event of unavailability, recusal of jurists, or other openings. This would allow the court to hear many more cases, perhaps double or treble the current number.The “packed” tribunal also could provide for cases of extraordinary national significance or uncertainty to be heard in full 15-member sessions upon agreement of a majority of the jurists, another practice followed by the lower federal appellate courts.There is undoubtedly other tinkering that could make an expanded Supreme Court more efficient and effective. Those tweaks can help advance justice based on prudent principles, not politics.Court packing, to be sure, is not a panacea for what ails the nation or the judiciary. There would be added costs involved in having more judges and their associated personnel (do they really need four clerks apiece . But in an era when the federal government hands out billions with no regard for the deficit, what’s a few more millionIt may be well worth it to advance the interests of justice. It also would do away with those divisive 5-4 rulings — unless, of course, they are replaced with 8-7 decisions.Marshall H. Tanick is a Twin Cities constitutional law attorney and historian."

suffolknewsherald_2020_239,"Published 4:39 pm Tuesday, September 1, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Winford K. Rice Jr. and Sabrina HaqueRacism is a cancer to the fabric of our country and permeates our school systems through educators’ un-interrogated biases and premeditated assumptions about the “other.” Race is a complex social phenomenon, and how it is presented in classrooms determines our children’s development. Data has shown that schools with higher degrees of integration, on average, have improved graduation rates, test scores and educational attainment. Minorities that deal with less discrimination also have decreased psychological stress linked to lower school achievement. It is our contention that anti-racist learning environments can produce more empathetic individuals who are able to dismantle cycles of intergenerational racism.Our opinion is not merely grounded in our professional backgrounds, but is informed by our matriculation through a segregation academy, Nansemond-Suffolk Academy. Segregation academies are private schools that were founded in the late 1950s-1960s to resist federal desegregation orders post-Brown vs. Board of Education (1954 . Although they do not explicitly discriminate by race today, their damaging legacies as white-only schools still linger across communities in our country.This is true of NSA, where the majority of Black and brown students had two revelatory experiences during their time: the first day of school when we were gazed upon by white students for being non-white, and the second being the day we realized why the school was founded in 1966. Our classmates’ racial biases were left unbridled — many now working hard to unlearn these purviews as adults. These challenges are partially due to unchecked racist incidents — something that Black high school students across the country have been recently highlighting — but also from a lack of representation in the school’s population, as well as in the narratives taught to shape our worldviews.The Academy’s infrastructure was constructed to privilege whiteness. Consequently, we remember not being able to challenge the notion that the Civil War was about states’ rights and the South’s economy, not slavery. We remember having to re-enact and glamorize a colonial period of history that was detrimental to our ancestors. We remember being reprimanded for sitting with the few classmates who looked like us during lunch. We remember having administrators who could not relate to the particularities of our racial identities, who celebrated the election of George Bush, but lamented Barack Obama’s historic victory.While our private school education was a privilege, it should not have come at the expense of our racialized identities. We have been fortunate enough to navigate institutions that have given us agency, self-worth and the tools to engage in discourses on race. We know private schools like NSA will not change without external pressure. Thus, we urge all parents to articulate the need for anti-racist learning environments — ones that enable the excellence of their minority students and better prepare children to be more socially conscious, compassionate individuals who are able to eviscerate systemic racism. We recommend the three following actions:The recent outpouring of support for Black lives compels us to believe that we can finally build coalitions that demand schools to change their cultural ethos that will allow all children to thrive. Our demands could be met with disguised, segregationist rhetoric such as “if you don’t like it here, leave.” However, parents can, and should, hold their children’s schools accountable to becoming anti-racist; if not for civil rights, for the sake of their children’s development. Does your child’s school have what it takes to become an anti-racist educational institution?Winford K.

As a Camden resident, I know firsthand that the force here embodies none of the reforms people are yearning for in spirit or truth.Unfortunately, people’s need to find a bright spot in the way minorities are policed has led to a vast oversimplification of Camden’s reorganization. Truthfully, our switch in 2013 was the result of a policy shift designed to get cities to share services. Camden’s overreliance on state resources provided the leverage and cover politicians needed to make broad changes to police services. Predictably, the results for crime have been mixed. While violent crime as a whole went down, homicidesspiked in 2016andincreased again from 2018 to 2019.Recently, activists have started making appeals to defund the police to divert resources to social services. Conversely, the plan in Camden was to get more officers on the street. Coincidentally, at the time of transition, suburban departments were shedding officers due to cuts, so Camden was getting a lot of white officers to police a predominantly black and Latino city.More officers, coupled with an aggressive policing strategy that would facilitate as many as six officers on the scene at minor traffic stops in our streets, lead to the kinds of scenarios that activists are protesting against.Academics have cited civilian review as crucial in reducing police brutality. Many agree the reporting structure where officers report to a police chief who reports to a mayor is too weak. In Camden, the force reports diffusely to the mayor and City Council — yet not to civilians.No one with a basic understanding of the demands of activists right now would seriously look at Camden.In fact, when concerned residents tried toorganize a vote to block the changesto the department, the mayor and other local officials sued to prevent the vote.As it turns out, weaker civilian oversight has meant, for example, that the public has never gotten insight on thedeath of Nerreada Robles, a 17-year-old high school senior killed by a speeding police car last year. Following her death, City Council inexplicablyconsidered a measurethat would reduce the amount of time residents couldmaintain makeshift memorialslike one created for Robles.Since the reorganization of the police in 2013, Camden has been more lucky than good. Any one of the aforementioned circumstances in other places would have caused a riot elsewhere. Frankly, no one with a basic understanding of the demands of activists right now would seriously look at Camden. If America has finally become serious about the notion that black lives matter, it can’t start with a policing model where regard for black lives was an afterthought.Theo Spencer is a longtime Camden resident and currently works as a vice president of software development for a large U.S. bank. Spencer is also a former school board member and was a candidate for mayor in 2013 and 2017.​By ZaneKaleemIn the wake of angry nationwide demonstrations, Philadelphia’s response to peaceful protests exemplifies everything wrong with urban policing in 2020.Not only did we experience somechaosthis month, but after days of public frustration over police brutality, Philadelphia police were caught abusing their power on camera. Officerswere spottedpulling goggles off of seated protesters’ faces and spraying tear gas into their eyes, despite protesters’ obvious efforts to be civil in displaying their outrage over the killings ofAhmaud Arbery,Breonna Taylor,George Floyd, and many other black Americans by officers nationwide. Adding insult to injury in Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenneydid not express regretat the teargassing assault of peaceful protesters by his city’s police force.While unrest unfolded in Philadelphia, across the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, police in Camden took a different approach to the trauma and emotion being expressed. Instead of fighting back, Camden policecame togetherwith protesters to march in solidarity with black American communities.How did this happen in one of the country’smost dangerouscities in 2012? A big part of it was community policing.Police are trained to shift their identity away from solving issues with their authority and guns and instead strive for a partnership with local residents.Community policingis a public health approach to public safety that tasks police and community members with collaborating to improve safety and quality of life in their neighborhoods. Camden officialsrevampedthe city’s police force in 2013, with the goal of shifting the culture of policing from one of dominance in the community to greater trust and stronger relationships with locals. Police are trained to shift their identity away from solving issues with their authority and guns and instead strive for a partnership with local residents.Community policing relies on key foundational principles that any city can adopt as a start toward change. These principles lie in procedural justice, which former Sheriff Sue Rahrin King County, Wash., simplified into what was coined theLEED framework: Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity. Under such a framework, officers are trained to listen first, be transparent by explaining why they approach a person or pull them over, and explain the legal process to people who encounter law enforcement, such as when stopped on the highway by an officer. LEED helps police become trusted and have honest discourse with community members.» READ MORE:Camden shouldn’t sanitize away the truth | OpinionNationally, organizations like Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform, of which I am a task force assistant director, havehighlightedthe negative health effects of police brutality and its role in systematizing racism, especially its contribution to poor health outcomes in black communities. TheAmerican Medical Associationshared that more encounters with police in minority communities are linked not just to elevated stress and anxiety among residents, but also to increased prevalence of high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma. Research also suggests thatracial discrimination leads to adverse mental healthoutcomes.Yet, as theAmerican Psychological Associationreports, the evidence suggests that when police “treat people with dignity, respect, fairness and neutrality, people are more likely to comply with their directives and accept any outcome, whether favorable or unfavorable.” What the APA describes matches the public health approach that Camden adopted via community policing.Switching to a community policing model for Philadelphia is a step in the right direction to end police violence. Advocates have yelled their battle cry for change.

minnpost_2020_128,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .On May 29, President Donald Trumpdeclared his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization(WHO and leveled accusations that it had failed to alert the world of the gravity of the COVID-19 virus in a timely manner and is too closely aligned with China. It is imperative that we set aside our focus on assigning blame right now and focus on saving lives. There will be plenty of time for analyzing our successes and failures later. The health care workers of the world need us to work on getting them the tools to do their job and keep people alive until better treatments, and vaccines, can be developed.How do you coordinate a global effort on this scale WHO has people in almost every country and years of experience dealing with infectious diseases. It also has strong partners. In the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI , WHO partners with Rotary International, UNICEF, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and now Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. They have a working relationship with national governments across the globe. In 1988, when the GPEI was launched, there were 350,000 cases of wild poliovirus in 125 countries. Thirty-two years later, there were fewer than 200 cases of wild poliovirus in the world last year in just two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan.In 2004, I led a team of Rotary members to West Africa for an integrated vaccination campaign, where the oral polio vaccine and Vitamin A drops were administered, along with measles vaccine, bed nets for malaria prevention, and medicine to kill intestinal parasites. Each intervention had its sponsor. It was an incredible example of leveraging the work of multiple organizations to provide more comprehensive coverage to children than any one organization could have managed. At the same time, each organization was used to working alone, getting all of the publicity and having their way when it came to planning for a national campaign. There were some disagreements as we prepared to launch that threatened the effectiveness of the campaign.In this context, the WHO national director arranged for me to join the chair of the Togo National PolioPlus Committee to address the public on national radio. We provided the names of all of the partners and the important contributions made by each, explained the importance of attending the vaccination events and addressed rumors that had circulated about the safety of the vaccines. Then, the WHO director summarized the schedule for the coming days and called on all parents to bring their children to the vaccination sites. Internally, he also worked to remind all of the organizations that our goal was the same, to protect children from illnesses that were preventable. The campaign was a huge success and the entire region has been free of the wild poliovirus for more than 10 years.In northern Nigeria, where conflict with Boko Haram and related militant groups has made vaccinations dangerous and difficult, WHO coordinated the work of national health service agencies in several bordering countries, security forces in each country and international partners with such success that Nigeria has not had a case of wild polio in more than three years and the entire African region may soon be declared free of the wild poliovirus. There are many powerful nonprofit organizations with a focus on health care. Without WHO, they lack the organizational power and global presence to coordinate their efforts.The world was already full of conflict and discord before COVID-19. The coming months will be terrible ones, even in countries with relatively robust health care systems. For those with fewer resources, the outcome is still in the balance. Pandemics cannot be treated piecemeal. Viruses do not respect international borders. If any country fails to contain COVID-19, we are all vulnerable. WHO is needed now more than ever.The current situation reminds me of a DC graphic novel that was made into a blockbuster movie, “The Watchmen.” In the movie, the nations of the world are locked in conflict and nuclear war seems inevitable. At the end of the movie, the villain turns out to be a former member of the Watchmen who has decided that only a tangible, external threat will be enough to unite the governments of the world to defend themselves. He engineers a horrible attack on New York City in which millions are killed and the governments of the world unite to face the “alien” invasion. It is not a happy ending, but at least the threat of nuclear war recedes as the world’s leaders realize that they cannot fight each other and face an external enemy at the same time. Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, and it is hard to fathom why we are not uniting with WHO and the governments of the world to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We have the resources if we work together.As a major supporter of WHO, the U.S. has influence. If we pause our funding now, we weaken our most valuable partner. If we have complaints, we have every right to voice them. In order to have this voice, we need to be more engaged than ever. If a glimmer of hope can be seen in times like these, a recent article in the New York Times informed us that, in spite of publicly rejecting calls to ease sanctions on Iran to allow them to face the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked behind the scenes to allow them access to the resources they need. I am hoping and praying that our announcement that we will withdraw from WHO is another “negotiating” tactic and behind the scenes we are working to repair the relationship and unite to strengthen WHO’s capacities in this time of need.This is an opportunity for us to see the big picture and do the right thing for a world in need of our leadership. If we seize this opportunity, it will be a source of light in dark times.Charles AdamsCogan, a member of the board of directors of the United Nations Association of Minnesota, Harold E.

minnpost_2020_18,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .I’m sticking my neck out to offer my take on recent, devastating events. None of what I say here is intended to justify anything; rather, I want us to consider the roots.First. The person who started the rumor that a Black man was killed by police late Wednesday afternoon should be held responsible for inciting a riot. I saw a retweet of the post but didn’t take a screenshot and have given up trying to find it again note to self: always take a screenshot . What actually happened is a man took his own life (after allegedly taking someone else’s life rather than be arrested. We won’t know why the suspect chose that way out. I inadvertently watched him do it (on video and it was horrifying.Second. Minneapolis erupted in out-of-control violence after the false news spread and those who damaged, broke into, trashed, and looted local businesses should be held responsible.Those are two things I believe. However, it is also necessary to consider the environment in which this took place. At the time of the murder/suicide, when the false information spread, a peaceful, planned protest against police brutality and America’s culture of racism was taking place downtown. The peacefully protesting crowd was like dry kindling doused by the rumor, and a fire raged.It is further necessary to consider the overall atmosphere of our city. People are tired, worn out, on edge. People are traumatized, and my limited knowledge of trauma is that when experiencing trauma, the possibility of “rational behavior” goes out the window. With the killing of George Floyd still hot in our collective memories, and the recent paralysis of a Black man by police as well the murder of two Black protesters by a white vigilante in Kenosha, Wisconsin, any suggestion of continued injustice is going to be met with rage, fear, and deep sorrow. And actions and behavior spring from that.Furthermore, there are always bad actors. Always. People who want war, people who are bored and often unjustifiably angry, people who want to see our city fail, who want to see our democracy fail — these people, originating from all points on the political spectrum, showed up, quickly. Both from within and from without. There is a reason the highway exits into downtown were eventually blocked by patrol cars Wednesday night: It was an effort to try to keep more of those people from finding their like-minded brethren and inserting themselves into a volatile situation. Much like we saw happen in late May and early June.Add to this the fact we are in the powder keg of a contentious national campaign, with a sitting president insisting the vote will be rigged; a pandemic with little signs of slowing that has obliterated any sense of normalcy; environmental disasters coast to coast and across the globe; and worldwide rising political tensions inspiring massive migration, refugees with nowhere to go, and uncountable civil and human rights violations. We are all hurting in some way and, as the saying goes, hurt people hurt people.I am not suggesting bad behavior should be excused, but I am pointing out that there are reasons, and it would be wise to recognize that.Me I’m praying and writing and praying some more. And I am studying topics that will increase my understanding and knowledge. And I am calling out in anguish, begging Jesus to defeat the evil that has taken control — that has, really, always been in control. I am praying for peace and for justice, fully recognizing there will be no peace without justice.Marti Martin is a psychology and political science student.

suffolknewsherald_2020_147,"Published 9:22 pm Friday, May 1, 2020ByStaff ReportsInnovation of all kinds will be needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and one of the most innovative ideas is featured in today’s paper.The problem? Health care workers are terrified of bringing the coronavirus home to their family after long shifts where they are either taking care of patients who have the virus, or they are at least in the same building with them. These doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and others have gone to extreme measures to distance themselves from their family during these times, and some of those measures, like renting hotel rooms, cost a lot of money.The solution? Match up health care workers with RVs where they can stay in relative comfort and still be distanced from their family.The “RVs for MDs To Fight the Corona Virus” Facebook group created this solution and has matched many RVs with medical professionals who can use them to stay away from their spouses, children, parents and other family members, some of whom may be elderly or immunocompromised. This temporary distancing is for the safety of their families, but it is hard enough on all of those involved, so this solution helps these families save money and take a small amount of stress from the giant load they’re carrying right now.Local woman Frances Knaack-Day and her husband, Justin, a U.S. Navy lieutenant commander and physician at Navy Medical Center Portsmouth, know this challenge firsthand.Knaack-Day has health challenges due to a childhood ingestion of lye, which caused lung damage and chronic lung aspiration pneumonia, which put her at high risk for COVID-19.She came across the Facebook group and originally received a response from someone with a trailer to provide, but the couple wound up giving up the opportunity to help others in need.She shared it with their friends in the military and medical field, and before she knew it, she was the state director for Virginia for the page. She said this is a great way to pay it forward to the medical community that has helped her overcome her health challenges.Cleaning companies on the group are even offering free cleaning and disinfection services for when the medical professionals are done with the RVs and it’s time to return them to their owners.We love this group and the innovation it shows and encourage anyone who can to get involved.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

suffolknewsherald_2020_13,"Published 6:22 pm Friday, December 18, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbieMrs. Alida Sharp is a 57-year-old, Christian missionary who lives in Belize. I began following her life story when we connected through a writers’ group for women of color. She has an amazing testimony of how her relationship with the Lord, specifically learning to listen to His voice, has transformed her life time after time. She and her husband, Tom, are both creatives. He is a painter and she is a worship leader, author and recording artist. They use their gifts to minister hope to the lost and hurting. We have never met, yet I consider her to be one of my influencers. I love how she is aging with such grace. Older women who have that vivid grace about them inspire me. I pay attention to shereos of the faith like her. I want that grace in my life.In every other blog or Instagram post, Mrs. Alida mentions something about how change comes when choices are made. Recently, she posted a photo of herself standing next to a graph she took from the activity profile on her MyFitnessPal app. The graph showed her weight changes over the past six years. In the caption for the picture, she stated, “My fitness journey has not been and is not now a perfect straight line but transformation has still occurred because I haven’t given up.”I looked at that jagged line on her graph and I thought about the character within the bends and breaks and peaks of that line. That line spans six years of narrative and milestones.Mrs. Alida’s graph is not an example of “I got the weight off and kept it off.” I noticed only one plateau or level line in the graph and it was very small, which tells me that there was a very short period in which there was little or no change in her fitness journey. I suspect that was a short period when Mrs. Alida was likely not checking into her app. But as she confessed in her caption, transformation still occurred. Whether the evidence was recorded or not, the line was still taking shape.The jagged line graph reminded me of a heart rate monitor. It is said that the heartbeat is the symbol of life. When a child is conceived in the womb, the first sound that brings joy to the parents of the unborn child is the thumping of that heart in an ultrasound monitor. Furthermore, connection between heart rate and life is found in the relationship between the resting heart rate and survival. Medical research into this inverse relationship between heart rate and lifespan suggests that healthy choices such as exercise and reduced stress affords a human being the ability to live long.Inasmuch as the heartbeat indicates the existence of life, I believe we can say that our choices throughout our lives indicate survival outcomes. As we all know, when you are looking at a heart rate monitor, a plateau line is not an indication that we want to see. Flat lines mean death. If we are not making choices, we are not living. Our choices demonstrate the activity, the vigor and the energy in our living. Choices activate progress and transformation. Every choice we make lands up or down on our biographical timeline. Whether we are monitoring weight highs and lows or career high and lows or emotional highs and lows, we all have a jagged line that tells our story. Here’s the catch. We want the jagged line to progress forward.To ensure that survival happens as a result of our choices, we have to make good ones.I believe our Bible confirms that choice is the heartbeat of survival. How willing we are to exercise progress and transformation daily will lead us to eternal life, which is the ultimate survival. Deuteronomy 30:19 reminds us that we have the power of choice for a great purpose. “I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live!”If this pandemic has taught us anything, it should be that everyone has the power to shape the graph up or down. Our choices are the evidence of the transformation. Choose well so that you and your children may live.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

minnpost_2020_201,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .To see what’s at stake with Amy Coney Barrett’s potential confirmation to the Supreme Court, look no further than this week’s decision where the court declined to review a legal issue in the lawsuit against Kim Davis. You may remember Davis asthe county clerk from Kentucky who refused to issue marriage licensesto LGBTQ couples based on her religious beliefs.This week, the Supreme Court started its new term — the first time it has convened since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death. Kim Davis, who is being sued by gay couples for refusing to sign their marriage licenses, asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court’s decision denying her qualified immunity in that lawsuit. The Supreme Court declined to hear the issue. While Kim Davis might not get her day at the Supreme Court, religious objections to LGBTQ rights just might.This is the judicial philosophy we can expect to dominate the court if Barrett is confirmed. She previously clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, who dissented inObergefell v. Hodges, stating that when the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, the law defined marriage as “one man and one woman.” Even though the 14th Amendment guarantees all people equal protection of the laws, it doesn’t specifically discuss a definition of marriage, so the promise of equal protection does not apply to LGBTQ+ people or marriage. In other words, he believed that the constitutional promise of equal protection for all does not guarantee any civil rights that were not available or expressly contemplated in the 1800s.Scalia was an originalist, and so is Barrett — someone who applies and interprets the Constitution according to its original meaning. Originalists believe thatRoe v. Wade, the case where the Supreme Court first ruled that access to abortion is protected by the Constitution, was wrongly decided. DespiteRoebeing the law of the land, Justice Scalia regularly ruled, or joined in rulings, stating that reproductive rights are not protected by the Constitution because the Constitution does not explicitly mention abortion or other reproductive rights, and the government has historically controlled women’s rights to decide if and when to grow their families.This is the legacy that Barrett would pursue on the Supreme Court. She restated at her nomination event just last week regarding Justice Scalia’s judicial philosophy, “his judicial philosophy is mine too.” With cases that concern the government’s right todiscriminate against LGBTQ foster parentsand our right toaffordable health care accessset to go before the Supreme Court this year, we cannot afford to confirm someone for a lifetime appointment who is intent on setting back our civil rights. As Justice Ginsburg said, “a prime part of the history of our Constitution is the story of the extension of Constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded.” We must fight to continue her legacy.Megan Peterson is the executive director of Gender Justice."

She spoke to him as he put on his shoes, but her language seemed to be geared more towards an unruly sailor than an elementary school-aged boy. It caused my heart to ache.He walked to my car, and we began our few hours together. Occasionally, a word would come out of his mouth that he knows I do not like to hear. He would apologize, and I would thank him for his efforts in trying to avoiding certain words. I know that he does try to watch his language around me. My heart sank some more as I thought about how the culture of his home has made foul and crude language his native tongue.Later that day, when I took him home, he was met by a scowl at the door. He waved goodbye to me and entered his home for another week. We were together for about five hours that day. It was such a small amount of time in the grand scheme of things, and I left feeling like I had placed a Band-Aid on a wound that needed surgery and stitches.Words of people who know of my efforts with Timothy echoed in my mind. “There’s not much of a chance what you do will matter,” “There’s a very slim chance that he comes out of this OK,” and “Statistics show he’s just going to be another tragedy,” pained my heart some more as I drove away.I know they are right. I know he’s starting life so far behind the 8-ball that it will be a miracle if he comes out of his situation on top. I’m not ignorant of the statistics. I know there’s a slim chance. Nevertheless, I am going to try to help him.Our time together shows him that there is a different way of life. He can see that not everyone is rude, crude and foul-mouthed. He can know that not everyone meets him at the door with a scowl. He can know that love exists and see that chaos does not rule every household. He might not know this way of life existed if he didn’t have a chance to see it for himself.I can try to teach him some things that he won’t learn in his home. It’s far from an ideal learning platform, as these life lessons are intended to be taught over vast periods of time through constant reinforcement in the home. I do not have that much time with him, but we can work on things at a different pace and build on what he has learned in our years together.A slim chance is better than no chance. He deserves to have someone who will try to help him, even if the odds are not in his favor. Every child deserves a chance.I hope others will find those around them who are considered unlikely to overcome the odds. They are worth your time.

minnpost_2020_217,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Chronic sorrow, a term which has been used in the medical literature for many years, is described as a normal response to an abnormal situation. Specific characteristics, as described by Eakes and colleagues in their article “Middle-Range Theory of Chronic Sorrow” (Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 1998 include a perception or sadness or sorrow over time in a situation with no discernible end; sadness that is cyclical or recurrent; sadness that is triggered internally or externally and brings to mind a person’s disappointments, losses or fears; and sadness that is progressive and can intensify. The ambiguous or never-ending nature of the circumstances precludes resolution and instead precipitates periods of intense sorrow, sometimes described as loss in bits and pieces. It is the disparity created by what one desires or what one had in the past with what one is experiencing that is the common denominator associated with chronic sorrow.It occurs to me that we as a society are collectively experiencing chronic sorrow as we grapple emotionally with the impact of the pandemic. Although recent news about vaccination development is quite encouraging, and some vaccines are already being distributed, much about the vaccines’ effectiveness and how and when they’ll be widely distributed remains uncertain.This massive uncertainty interferes with our ability to focus on the future. We face a roller coaster of information that raises our hopes, only to dash them. It is impossible to forget about the virus as we are surrounded by masked individuals and a parade of news about business and school closings, thus constantly triggering anxiety. We aren’t getting clear messages from our leaders about how we can protect ourselves. And we constantly mourn the loss of things we used to take for granted that are no longer possible: a restaurant meal, a large family reunion, a sporting event, a grandchild on one’s lap.When this period in our history is over, most of us will resume our lives relatively unscathed, although it may take a while for some of us to get back on our feet financially or for children to catch up academically. But for those who lose a loved one, suffer enduring health problems, experience such severe setbacks that dreams and futures are forever dashed, chronic sorrow may continue to circulate.Meanwhile we must do our best to live with this very challenging situation. Most of us are familiar with ordinary coping skills: keep busy, think positive, maintain healthy habits. All easier said than done in our current situation.Before I retired as a psychologist, I found particularly useful a strategy for managing intense emotions that I have heard called “And Therapy.” Such therapy begins with the concept of validation. When a client told me his or her most personal feelings, I was quiet and just listened. If I did make a comment I would validate these thoughts or feelings with words like “I understand why you feel that way.” Or “I would feel the same way if that happened to me.”At the same time, we have a right to assert our own feelings and opinions, with statements such as “I understand that you want to spend more time with the grandchildren, but I just don’t feel that is safe right now.” “My reading has convinced me that masks protect both you and me.”After a person has a chance to fully express his or her opinions, it is appropriate to move on to the “And” mentioned above. As in “And what do you think you should do about it” or “And what do you think should happen next” Using words such as “but” or “at least” are invalidating and judgmental, because they imply there is a right way to feel. One benefit of the “and” is that it often focuses on behavior. It is important for individuals to be aware that whereas they can’t easily control their thoughts or their feelings, they can control their behavior.I think all of us can practice the two steps of “And Therapy” without needing a degree in psychology to do so. 1 Listen and validate. 2 Add an “and,” not a “but.”While we wait out the virus, we must give ourselves permission to label what we are feeling as a form of chronic sorrow. We are responding normally to an abnormal situation. We are doing our best.Martha Bordwell of Minneapolis writes about current events, family life, and travel."
philinquirer_2020_61,"A bold national strategy to boost economic opportunity and mobility in the most impoverished rural and urban counties can help bridge this deep divide.Editor’s note: A previous version of this op-ed inaccurately stated the poverty rate and median household income of Pike County, Pa. The error has been corrected.Rural counties in Northern battleground states — which are overwhelmingly white and Republican — seemingly share little in common with diverse, Democratic big cities.Philadelphia, which is nearlytwo thirds non-white,gave its votes to Joe Biden by a63-point margin. Meanwhile, Donald Trump won rural, McKean County, Pennsylvania — which is 95% white — by 46 points.Yet something surprising unites Philadelphia and Pike County: very high rates of poverty and exceedingly low average incomes.Even pre-pandemic,Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate of any big city— 24% — and a median household income of $43,744.McKean County had a poverty rate of 16.8%and a median household income of $46,953. (In comparison, thenational poverty rate was 11%and the median household income was $60,293. In fact, there were more thantwo dozen counties in Pennsylvania with high poverty ratesand with median household rates below $50,000 per year; they, too are overwhelmingly white and rural and gave massive pluralities to Trump.Likewise, while Wayne County, Michigan (home of Detroit and Cuyahoga County, Ohio (home of Cleveland , have large non-white populations, high poverty rates, and a historic propensity to vote for the Democratic Party, both states have large numbers of high poverty, including in mostly white, rural counties that also overwhelmingly supported Trump.The reasons for the disparities between economic conditions and voting behaviors are clear: race and culture. After the Democratic Party embraced civil rights, reproductive choice, gun safety legislation, and LGBTQ rights, rural white voters — even very poor ones — swung heavily to the G.O.P.What, if anything, can help bridge this deep divide? The best hope is for President-Elect Biden and Congress to team up to implement a bold national strategy to boost economic opportunity and mobility in the most impoverished rural and urban counties.» READ MORE:Number of households with hungry children nearing 14 million, study findsIn 2019,58.8 million U.S. residents lived below 200% of the poverty line. That means that, even pre-pandemic, nearly one in five Americans lived in near poverty, pushing the great American middle class even closer to extinction.Even though the largest number of impoverished Americans are white, the racial disparities in U.S. family income are vast.In 2019, when the nation’s median family income was $68,703, it was $76,057 for non-Hispanic whites, $45,438 for Blacks, and $56,113 for Hispanics.As vast as these differences in income are, the differences in assets are a veritable Grand Canyon. According to the Federal Reserve, in 2016, the typical white family hadeight times the wealth of the typical Black family and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family.Since the pandemic hit, all these problems have gotten far worse, and anestimated 50 million Americans, including18 million American children, becoming food insecure, unable to afford enough food.The good news is that — based on a poll that Hunger Free America just conducted among 800 low-income Americans nationwide — we know that urban, rural and suburban Americans (and people of all races actually agree on key points of a policy agenda for boosting economic opportunity and mobility.

minnpost_2020_169,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Much has been revealed about DNR’s decision making in these cases, and it’s not pretty. The Supreme Court seemed aware of one particularly questionable element of the PolyMet permits at last month’s oral argument. One of the justices questioned DNR’s lawyer about support in the record for PolyMet’s proposed method to minimize highly toxic “acid mine drainage” in the tailings basin. The “bentonite amendment,” as it’s called, would involve putting bentonite clay (mixed with tailings on the dam, pond floor, and interior beaches of the basin as a sort of “cap,” in an effort to prevent oxygen from interacting with the tailings and producing acid. The scheme is absolutely central to PolyMet’s claim that it could control the nastiest form of pollution that sulfide mines are known to produce.The court’s questions on the bentonite method, however, revealed just how little science there is in DNR’s record to support it. In fact, after the hearing, DNR asked the Supreme Court for permission toadddocuments to the permitting record to bolster its bentonite claims — a highly unusual move at this point in the process. But even those documents only further expose the experimental nature of the bentonite scheme. They establish that DNR does not know how the tailings and bentonite would be mixed, or applied, or whether the material would degrade over time. And they make clear the method has never actually been successfully demonstrated — let alone used — in the field.In other words, essentially no one, including the DNR, knows if this bentonite idea would work.This is just one dimension of many in a complex case. As the court wrestles with questions like this, it’s useful to also take a step back and remind ourselves of the facts that are not actually disputed by any party to the litigation, and what those facts would mean for Minnesota. What follows are facts drawn directly from the permits that DNR issued — a sort of “best case scenario” if one were to accept all of PolyMet’s claims and promises as true.Building a PolyMet mine would require the direct destruction of almost 1,000 acres of wetlands — the largest permitted destruction of wetlands in Minnesota’s history. These wetlands take millennia to form, are a critical source of carbon sequestration, and once they are gone, they are gone. Peatlands cover only 3% of the world’s land, but store fully one-third of all soil carbon.The dam holding back the massive amounts of pollution and waste would be made from mine tailings stacked on top of other mine tailings stacked on top of unstable peats and slimes — the “upstream” design. This is the type of dam that failed catastrophically at Brumadinho in Brazil and at Mount Polley in Canada. It’s the type of dam that has been banned in countries around the world, including Brazil, Chile and Peru. Andengineers have been clearthey fear more catastrophes await if this design continues to be used.And because the permits issued by DNR would allow PolyMet to leave this all in place even after closing the mine (a “wet closure” , the pond and dam would be with us essentially forever. Even if everything were to work as promised, the company and DNR admit that it wouldstillleak at least 16 million gallons of pollution into the groundwater, wetlands and rivers every year that the polluted pond exists.So, there, behind the risky dam, the polluted water and mine waste would sit — 250 feet in the air, built on a pile of sand, with forever pumps, and a forever dam, leaking 16 million gallons of pollution into the Lake Superior Watershed every year. A quarter million northeastern Minnesotans, including in Duluth, Cloquet, and at Fond du Lac, would be living downstream of this threat in perpetuity.In the two years since permits were issued by DNR, Minnesotans have learned a great deal about what PolyMet has proposed, very little of it good. And in the coming months the Minnesota Supreme Court will issue its ruling. If it joins the Court of Appeals in rejecting the permits, the Walz administration will have its own opportunity to do the right thing. That means rejecting the risky dam, rejecting the permanent pollution, and finally holding the neutral court hearing with experts from all sides that Minnesotans have been requesting for years. In other words, 2021 will bring with it opportunities for Minnesota’s leaders to act with more care and transparency in the face of a mining company that wants permission to leave behind a toxic lake upstream of our people, forever.JT Haines is the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy’s Northern Minnesota Advocate and is based in Duluth."
minnpost_2020_59,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .“I was on a recent conference call helping an organization put a statement together and this Sudanese brother says, ‘I don’t understand this Black Lives Matter stuff, I have never felt racism in this country.’ You know, I’m just letting people have it now … we African-Americans can sniff out anti-Blackness right when we step in the room, wherever we are. … I have never felt welcomed or comfortable in any African immigrant establishment in Minnesota.” These words come from a recent conversation I had with a close connection of mine.As a second-generation Ethiopian immigrant who is ethnically Oromo, I was born and raised in the Twin Cities. I never imagined that the place I call home would become the epicenter of historic racial uprisings and protests that sparked a fire across the world.Amongst the sea of protesters that stood in solidarity in the streets of Minneapolis in the wake of George Floyd’s death were 1.5 and second-generation African immigrants (1.5 generation immigrants refer to those who came to America before they reached 12 years old; second-generation immigrants refer to those who were born in America .Minneapolis, in fact, is home to a diverse population of racially Black individuals and a large fraction of them are African immigrants and refugees. We have the largest population of Somali immigrants, a vast number of Ethiopians, as well as immigrants from other African countries like Eritrea, Sudan, Liberia, and Nigeria. While African immigrant communities showed up in large numbers to protest police brutality and racial injustices, an oft-neglected nuance is the prevalence of anti-Blackness within these very communities.The support for the Black Lives Matter movement from the African immigrant community demands that we address and correct the racist practices within our own community that are often left unquestioned. For us to truly support the call for racial injustice, we must take the step eradicate anti-Blackness within our own communities.Growing up in the Twin Cities, I have witnessed countless anti-Black sentiments, expressions, attitudes, and practices from close relatives and community members. Some examples include: looking down on marrying African-Americans, addressing and treating African-Americans and their communities by negative racialized stereotypes (i.e. lazy, not hardworking, criminals and our perpetual disassociation with the African-American community in order to distinctly identify ourselves as African immigrants and not “Black/African-American.” This identification process has been heavily documented and proved as a mechanism for us to distance ourselves from African-American communities for various reasons, including social stratification.Furthermore, there are racist undertones within our languages and cultural practices that are anti-Black at their core. The way in which we use our own languages to describe African-Americans carry negative connotations. For example, terms like “madow” (Somali or “gurraacha” (Oromo literally mean black, but convey a deeper disdain. The way and which we utilize these terms to identify African-Americans is a way of positioning them as inferior to our own African immigrant identities, as noted by immigrant scholars likeNimo Abdi.I bring forth these examples in order to shed light on the anti-Black and racist injustices that we allow to thrive in our community. As we stand in solidarity against racist practices, it is equally important that we call out and rectify the injustice within our own communities. If we refuse to acknowledge these issues, it is nothing short of hypocrisy.The purpose of this is to bring forth these wrongs that are practiced within our own communities so that we may correct them. It is imperative that we reflect, interrogate, and critically analyze the ways in which we perpetuate anti-Blackness within our cultural practices and ideologies as African immigrants. Then we must call these out, wherever they may be, to better collectively hold ourselves responsible and truly fight against anti-Blackness and stand in solidarity against racism. So that we, as Black people in America, do not repeat the same marginalizing practices.I have had countless conversations with many African-Americans who have expressed their exhaustion and frustration with many communities, but especially with the African immigrants here in Minnesota.Going forward, as racially Black people in America, we must truly educate ourselves on the systemic issues of race. We must understand the various forms of racism and oppression that have formed this country. We must build a bridge to better connect with African-American communities. We must learn from their experiences so that we, as a new African immigrant community, can survive as racially Black people in a systemically racist society.Eskender A.

suffolknewsherald_2020_52,"Published 9:09 pm Friday, July 10, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy QuaWanna BannarbiePrayer is a mirror. I think often people avoid times in prayer because they are unwilling to face what shows up when they go to our Heavenly Father in prayer. We are alarmed when our efforts to rise early in the morning to seek His face are met with reflections and revelations about our own faces, status, fate and conditions. It is not always a pretty picture. Yet, it should not be such a surprise. The older I get, the more I am learning that God deeply involves Himself in our maturation. He grows us up by His grace.In prayer, I reached a place where I got quiet enough and honest enough to confess. I admitted that I need to be more of a practitioner of the gift of my time than a performer in it. Even as the words came out of my own mouth in devotion, I was trying to understand how I could be more of a practitioner of life. I recognize some things that I can do better, such as how I spend my time.My search to understand the way to become a good practitioner led me to one practitioner of little known history, Brother Lawrence, a monk who faithfully served in a Parisian monastery in the kitchen. Brother Lawrence is credited with mastering the practice of God’s presence. He found God in the kitchen and in everything he did. He found that the simple way of talking to God about his faults, his troubles, daily habits, tasks or his concerns only required that he invite God to wherever he was. He had no need for a chapel or an altar. He made an altar anywhere.If you think about it, COVID-19 has caused us to learn this art of making our spaces useful for anything, because the times have required it. We have had to conduct “common business” (as Brother Lawrence calls it outside the confines of what is common use. Although some of our usual business has returned to normal, the fact that new COVID-19 cases are rising assures us that these spaces may remain dual purpose for some time.Brother Lawrence demonstrated how his kitchen prepared spiritual food for him simultaneously while preparing natural food to feed others. It happened simply because He invited the Creator of all things to join him there. One of his letters records these words, “I have very often experienced the ready help of divine grace upon all occasions. When I have business to do, I do not worry about it beforehand. When the time comes to do it, I see in God, as clearly as in a mirror, all that is needed for me to do.”Practitioners are regularly and actively engaged in whatever task they are skilled to do. Performers turn on the skill when the curtain rises or the opportunity knocks or the task requires it. They are not regularly employed. During times of crisis, they are unemployed.I am beginning to understand that the weariness of this season is because I have been performing, doing what is necessary to be done until the opportunities cease to exist or the task is finished. I believe the Lord is trying to teach me (and perhaps you that just like my dining room table became the schoolhouse because COVID-19 required this, God is able to bring the resources of heaven to where I am if only I practice engaging the help of my Helper regularly.QuaWanna Bannarbie is an adjunct professor of nonprofit leadership and management with Indiana Wesleyan University, National and Global.

minnpost_2020_186,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .The statue was a meaningful project conceived of in 1927 by Minnesotans of Italian heritage and installed adjacent to the state Capital on Oct. 12, 1931, the same year that Columbus Day was made a state holiday.According to historianHeather Cox Richardson, “President Franklin Delano Roosevelt officially instituted Columbus Day in 1934, but the idea for the holiday rose in the 1920s, when the Knights of Columbus tried to undercut the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan by emphasizing the role minorities had played in America. In the early 1920s, the organization published three books in a ‘Knights of Columbus Racial Contributions’ series, includingThe Gift of Black Folk, by W. E. B. Du Bois.”Columbus Day, in other words, was part of an antiracist movement by Catholics who sought to carve a space for themselves, and other minority cultures, in a nation dominated by bigoted white Protestants.One of the things we have learned since that early June day is that Minnesota does not have a process for removing a statue. It should.For years, people have questioned the Columbus statue, and for years they were told to follow the legal process. Indeed, just before the statue came down, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said “state officials ‘will be out there to meet with the group and explain to themthe legal process for getting a statue removed.” That same day, Gov. Tim Walz released a statement saying that protesters should havefollowed a formal process to have the statue removed.By June 12, it had become clear thatMinnesota does not have a legal process for removing public art. Paul Mandell, executive secretary of the Capitol Area Architectural and Planning Board, which is responsible for approving any changes to the Capitol grounds, said the board is planning to meet to talk about what to do next because “we don’t have any process for how to handle removals; we’ve never done this before.”When the United States began, most people were not in the room. Property qualifications restrictingthe right to votewere widespread, and except for New Jersey, which allowed propertied women to vote until 1807, the franchise was restricted to men. In addition, depending on the state, there were age qualifications, and legal restrictions that prevented aliens, migrants, African Americans, Native Americans, paupers, and felons from voting.Over time, through sustained movements, often lasting generations and involving everything from war to widespread civil disobedience, many of these restrictions have been lifted or revised. The struggle for voting rights is not over, and there has been considerable backsliding sinceShelby County v Holder(2013 , but in 2020, the right to vote has been greatly expanded since the founding.Now most of us are in the room. Trouble is, the furniture is still from the 18th century, all the seats are taken, and the room hasn’t been redecorated in 233 years. That’s were we are today, a 21st-century democracy with18th-century thinking. As we figure out how to redecorate and remove public art, I propose we reconsider our public spaces every 40 years. We could assemble a panel of citizens, representative of our diverse communities, and including experts in public history, to consider public spaces from the municipal to the state levels. We should examine such things as place names, monuments, and art installations on public grounds.No doubt, much will remain the same, but having conversations about what to remove, what to add, where to provide historical context, and what to continue to venerate, will be healthy for our democracy.Regularly scheduled conversations about our shared history and public spaces will cause us to learn our history, reflect on what we value, remove us from our ideological silos, expose us to our neighbors who have different perspectives and experiences, and force us to find common ground on the profound questions about who we’ve been as a state and nation, who we are, and who we want to become.These conversations will not be easy, but democracy is not easy. It requires hard conversations, finding points of agreement, and remembering that we are all Americans. Just maybe, such conversations will help repair the divisions that threaten us. I can assure you that ignoring problems does not make them go away.Jeff Kolnick, Ph.D., is a professor of history atSouthwest Minnesota State University.The views expressed in this commentary are solely his own."
suffolknewsherald_2020_106,"Published 10:21 pm Tuesday, June 2, 2020ByStaff ReportsBy Joseph Perry“Jesus wept.” — John 11:35Did you know it’s all right to cry?My supervisor called me this morning because he had lost his best friend. He was hurting. I had to immediately minister to him. That’s why we always have to stay in prayer, and in the word because you never know when The Lord has need of you.When we cry, we are coming from deep within. When special people depart from us, or when special events occur, or when overwhelming things come to us, people will in fact shed tears. The truth of the matter is, it’s OK to cry. It’s a human characteristic to cry. It’s the makeup of an individual to cry. It doesn’t matter if you are a man or a woman, a leader of an organization, or a leader of a family. When special things happen, when sensitive moments are touched in you, we show expressions of tears.In the fourth gospel of the New Testament, Jesus heard that Lazarus was dead. He and Lazarus were close. They were like family. Someone said that they were brothers from a different mother. It tore Him up to know that Lazarus had departed. Life is that way; one day we will have to depart. It doesn’t matter what you’re working on. It doesn’t matter who loves you the most. It doesn’t matter if you are the one who makes it all come together. One day, The Lord will call you out of this world to come home.Please allow that to sink in, because life is short, and life is also precious. We are here today and gone today. You have to make the most of today, because tomorrow is not promised.But listen, it’s OK to cry. Jesus shows us He is divine but yet still human. Whether you know the Lord as your personal Savior or not, when certain things happen, they will make you cry. You see, crying for one can release the agony and pain. Even Jesus couldn’t hold it in. He released it, and when you release it, somehow and in some way, it can take away the agony and pain that you are enduring. It doesn’t show that you are weak, or a lesser person, when you cry.I saw President Barack Obama cry one year on national television when he saw the video of one more young black man being murdered. Crying can help reduce the pain. Not only that, crying can reveal to others how much you care.The people who were there watched Jesus as he wept. Oh, how He loved Lazarus so. In His physical ability, He couldn’t do a thing about it. But in His divinity, He had the power to bring him back to life. We have the power to pray and cause God to move in such a way where even in lifeless situations, we can see life still exist. Life still exists in the family. Life still exists in friendships and relationships. Look around and notice life still exists.Lastly, crying can reset you to go on. Thank God for the memories. You can go on if you want. When John the Baptist died, Jesus and His disciples eventually got it together and went on. It may take a while, but you can go on. Here’s a small portion of a great hymn that was written many years ago titled “Precious Memories”: “Precious father, loving mother, fly across the lonely years, and old home scenes of my childhood, In fond memory appears.Precious memories how they linger, how they ever flood my soul, in the stillness, of the midnight, precious sacred scenes unfold.”When people cry, it’s OK, because our Lord cried. And if Jesus can shed a tear, so can you.Cherish the memories that God gives to you, for one day you will only be a memory.The Rev. Dr. Joseph A. Perry is pastor of St. Mark AME Zion Church.

eugeneweekly_2020_4,"We ve got issues. “Big Trees Cause Rain.” As long-term Eugene residents, we remember the vintage bumper sticker. But in no prior September were we as thankful for the arrival of the rain, water that is life to communities, animals, birds and many big trees. We’re thankful, too, for dedicated firefighters and for scores of volunteers helping those whose homes and possessions were consumed in the fast-moving flames. People left quickly and needed shelter and everything else from food, clothing and baby supplies. Like many of our neighbors, we felt trapped in Eugene, hunkered indoors to avoid smoke filled lungs. A friend reported his honey bees dead in the yard. Deer in the south hills were seen licking each other to remove ash. The east wind, which brought the fire toward the valley, was unusual, but the fires and thick smoke that have stayed in the area are becoming too common. Small particulate pollution and toxins from burning forests, structures and vehicles are a recurring health risk. Because of summer forest fires and winter wood stove usage, the American Lung Association in 2018 rated Eugene’s bad air spikes among the worst in the nation. A health provider that serves Oregon Health Plan recently lobbied for more compensation. The company forecast a 500-percent increase in forest fires and predicted the resulting smoke would dramatically increase respiratory illness, and, therefore their own costs for service. Are we doomed to see ever more devastating natural and human disasters from forest fires, strong winds, hurricanes, flooding and crop failures? “The debate is over in terms of climate change,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom says. “The hots are getting a lot hotter and the wets are getting a lot wetter. The science is absolute. The data is self evident.” Climate is warming rapidly; and, if we do nothing, the human and ecological costs will be staggering. Oregonians, too, are also ready for climate action, and as 350Eugene points out, citizens are acting to stop the Jordan Cove pipeline, phase out natural gas expansion and demand robust local Climate Action plans. Forests are an important part of needed climate action. West of the Holiday Farm Fire just outside of Springfield, the Bureau of Land Management plans to log mature second-growth forest (seeEW7/23 . Josh Laughlin of Cascadia Wildlands tells us the BLM’s own study shows if these Thurston Hills Natural Area trees are cut, the forest fire danger is increased for the next 30 to 40 years. In a study of 1,500 forest fires tracked over a four-decade period across the U.S. West, “forests with the most logging burned in the severest fires,” forest scientist Dominick DellaSala says. Citizens can add their voices to protect the Thurston Hills Natural Area, and they can press local government to achieve climate results. As a city councilor, Emily Semple introduced and saw to passage last fall’s youth-led climate action resolution. Ralph McDonald sat on last winter’s air quality subcommittee of the Sustainability Commission, and urged action from Lane Regional Air Protection Authority (LRAPA and the state to protect forests adjacent to the valley’s airshed. The Eugene Climate Action Plan (CAP has identified some critical steps to curb fossil fuel emissions, but both urban and rural forest protection should also be addressed. Yes, one local government can’t just rewrite forest practices or regulate rural fire hazards, such as unsafe power lines, but Willamette Valley cities can press the Oregon Legislature to adopt better forest and airshed protection. These steps make economic sense. The annual fires are economic disasters for our communities, harming responsible local wood products companies, the many employees of these companies and the small businesses that serve these companies. Very few get rich from cutting the remaining Oregon “big tree” forests, shipping the logs to China whether their trunks are blackened or not. The big older trees resist and slow down fires and it’s important to protect them. Prior to becoming a councilor, Semple was a forest ecology graduate student, holding a degree in renewable natural resources. In her studies, she learned the large water quantity that mature trees store, 50 percent and more by weight, cools and moistens the forest glen. Big trees shade the understory to reduce flammable “ladder fuels” and ground foliage. They allow better air filtering, remove toxins and add oxygen to the airshed — important for forest embedded communities like ours. Protection of such trees should be a local priority, including both remaining ancient “climax” forests and mature second growth like the federal BLM Thurston Hills Natural Area stands. Semple also urges Eugene city government to develop infrastructure and services to support climate refugees relocating to our area. Better fire emergency evacuation plans and resident alerts must be developed by the city (an emergency alert didn’t go out to residents in Talent engulfed by the Almeda Fire, requiring emergency personnel to rush house to house . Local neighborhood associations can be asked to identify neighborhood structures that would serve as nearby smoke and fire shelters. Forest policy change is required to stop another “unprecedented” Cascades fire and valley smoke inundation. Local emergency planning is in our own hands. Together, these form our best chance to breathe easier tomorrow. Emily Semple is Ward 1 Eugene city councilor and is current council president.
