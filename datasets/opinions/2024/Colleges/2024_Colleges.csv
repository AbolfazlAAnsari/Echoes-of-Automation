crimson_2024_34,"Harvard students have busy schedules. Google calendars are booked with classes and office hours to attend, countless assignments to complete, and extracurriculars and social activities to top it all off. But there is another, often overlooked, item on my to-do list: my hair. Yes — hair. Taking care of my curly hair takes up more time than one would think — and it does not help that I used to struggle to make a basic braid hold. From washing to detangling to styling, taking care of my natural hair is a big part of my schedule. Moreover, for those of us who either don’t know how, or choose not to do our own hair, finding services that are affordable and easily accessible from Harvard’s campus is another obstacle. For many Black students adjusting to life at Harvard, hair care is a challenge. Often far from home, we are isolated from the stores, family, friends, and hair stylists who made up our hair community. We are forced to learn to do our hair — a time laborious project — or find natural hair services — a money laborious one. Hair salons and services for natural Black hair in Cambridge are hard to find and expensive. The few in close distance are, much like everything in Harvard Square, quite expensive. For the most basic styles, prices seem to start near $80, but more generally run from $200 to $300. The price increases from the baseline if you want more intricate styles, like bohemian braids. In 2020, the first Black hair shop opened in Arlington, a neighborhood near Cambridge, attempting to fill this niche for surrounding neighborhoods; but the shop has since closed. From gaining access to hair products for curly hair, finding affordable hair services, and fitting maintenance into busy schedules, caring for natural curly and coily hair is, simply put, complicated on campus. The problem is exacerbated considering the importance of natural hair as an expression of identity, culture, and even politics. Massachusetts itself only recently passed the CROWN act, a law prohibiting discrimination based on natural and protective styles. Inan article for Fifteen Minutes, Katherine A. Okumu ’21 described the importance of outward appearance, writing “At Harvard, where students compete to be both hired and admired, this pressure is magnified. If you can physically imply wealth or institutional knowledge about which trends are popular, you might have an easier time navigating spaces comfortably at Harvard.” Considering how hair plays a role in public perception, hair care affordability becomes a question of who can afford to navigate Harvard’s spaces with ease. Given students’ limited control over Cambridge businesses, Harvard should recognize this need within our community, and step in to provide necessary resources for hair care. This is not unrealistic — on-campus projects already happen at a smaller scale. In Adams House, the Hair Art Project is a student-led initiative that “seeks to create spaces to celebrate natural hair and alleviate stressors that hair maintenance may bring to Black students through workshops and hair care services.” While the project aims to build community by gathering students in person and providing a space to discuss hair woes and triumphs, it also aims to find a more tangible solution. The project hosts peer-led workshops for students to learn how to do braids, cornrows, and twists, and they also host Black hair stylists to provide free hair services for Adams House residents — including natural and protective styles. While Adams House has taken the lead, other houses, including freshman dorms, should offer the same services and community for their students. Hair care affordability should not be a concern for any student — nor should students be stressed over the time it takes to care for their hair. Black students should have access to free or affordable hair services and a community where they can learn the basics of hair styling. Hair care should not be a luxury reserved for Adams House residents; it is a basic request that should be granted to all Black students in the Harvard community. Lyat M.

crimson_2024_125,"Back when he was running for Senate, Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance (R-Ohio made his views on higher education abundantly clear. “Professors are the enemy,” he said in a speech at the National Conservatism Conference, endorsing a quote from former President Richard M. Nixon. “If any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.” Vance’s views on higher education aren’t unique, nor are they new. For decades, conservatives across the country have waged war on higher education institutions, denouncing the so-called liberal orthodoxy and, recently, smearing critical race theory. Since Hamas’ attacks on Oct. 7, conservatives have opened up a new assault on higher education, claiming that professors promulgate a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion agenda that teaches their students to be antisemitic. As a rabbi and a professor at Harvard Divinity School, let me just say that this narrative couldn’t be further from the truth. To see why, let’s take a look inside my own classroom at HDS, where I teach modern Judaism. After Oct. 7, HDS was reeling from the impact of Hamas’ massacre, the brutal war in Gaza, and the campus protests that ensued. As a result, my classes this year, like those of my colleagues, were not easy. Students entered the classroom every week amid rancor and controversy, their actions constantly scrutinized by the national media. My classes drew students with diverse experiences and wide-ranging political views, all coping with the events of Oct. 7 in different ways. I taught many Zionists, including Alexander “Shabbos” Kestenbaum, a recent speaker at the Republican National Convention, alongside Zev Mishell, who wrote a response to Kestenbaum in The Forward, as well as other members of “Jews for Liberation,” a non-Zionist group. Outside of class, Shabbos and Zev and other students in my classes attended protests and counter-protests. In class, they debated complex issues with open minds. My classes were filled with disagreement; students sometimes felt upset at what others were saying, some felt personally attacked. Like most of my colleagues, I sat during office hours with many students who expressed frustration and felt hurt by what transpired in some of those discussions. But every week they returned, and every week we continued to wrestle with themes of Jewish identity and the unfolding crisis on campus. Why? Because that is what universities do. Did dialogue sometimes break down? Certainly. That is the price of serious and passionate dissent. But my students, no matter their political views, learned to sharpen their own positions by hearing those who disagreed with them. In his speech at the RNC, Kestenbaum repeated an oft-cited platitude from the right that universities like Harvard are no longer teaching students “how to think, but what to think.” This platitude misunderstands the entire purpose of the university. Yes, university education should train students how to think. But to suggest that professors should not also at times teach students what to think, at least about their course subjects, is ludicrous. Professors are human beings, not machines. We have opinions and viewpoints that we express with conviction. In general, students are encouraged to disagree, make counter-arguments, and present different evidence or logic to challenge us. Does the “power of the lectern” sometimes get abused? Does the “how” sometimes become doctrine rather than argument? Certainly. But after over thirty years teaching at public and private universities, a rabbinical school, and HDS, in my experience those are the exceptions, not the rule. And let’s be honest. It’s mostly not professors who are teaching people what to think about the Israel-Palestine conflict. It’s politicians, groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, social media “influencers,” and some rabbis in the pulpit. The fact that Kestenbaum, who knows my leftist views on Israel, chose to speak at the RNC after sitting in my classroom for a year, demonstrates that professors don’t indoctrinate; they encourage independent thought. So what was really happening at Harvard this year? In event after event, Harvard’s commitment to intellectual openness was laid bare. Amid the protests, Harvard hosted Rashid I. Khalidi, professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University. More than 300 people — including Jews, Israelis, and many of Middle East origin — attended his lecture on the Israel-Hamas war. The audience, diverse in background and opinion, engaged in respectful dialogue, including an Israeli student who asked a pointed question about the phrase “from the river to the sea.” No interruption, no rancor, no disturbance. The student who asked the question may have disagreed with Khalidi’s answer, but after the lecture ended we all left peacefully. On Oct. 23 the School of Education hosted a forum on the war with three panelists, all experts in their field with pro-Palestinian perspectives. Each speaker was informed, respectful, but also passionate and, at times, controversial. This time, an audience member sharply criticized one of the panelist’s remarks about genocide, leading to an intense exchange. Though the questioner stormed out of the auditorium, the panel continued, and when it ended, we all left without incident. In November, former University President Lawrence H. Summers spoke at Harvard Law School about the economics of the conflict in Gaza. When he began his talk, many students silently protested, some holding “Stop the Genocide” signs, and staged a silent walked out. This was obviously their plan. Summers paused as they exited, acknowledged their right to protest as part of university life, and then continued with his remarks. J.D. Vance is wrong. Professors are not the “enemies.” In fact, we are essential to democratic society because we create space for robust debate where Kestenbaum and Mishell can sit with students who disagree with them. Despite what Kestenbaum may have said on stage, I know that he didn’t see me as an enemy. In fact, he praised his professors in his graduation profile — including me — calling the experience “intellectually enriching” and “an immense privilege.” We will continue to create these open spaces for future students, until the government hauls us away to prison.

crimson_2024_63,"We are facing a transportation crisis in Massachusetts, etched onto our streets with each tragic incident that unfolds. Just three weeks ago, a four-year-old girlwas struck and killedby a pickup truck in South Boston. Days later, a man in a wheelchairdied in a crash witha cement truck. Near South Station, a third personwas struck by another vehicle. Amidst these painful events across Boston, Cambridge faces significant challenges, too. Last year alone, there were hundreds of collisions — many involving pedestrians and cyclists — on our streets. These aren’t just “accidents,” but reflections of policy failures — lethal ones. It is our mandate to rectify this harm. We have already developed an answer to this crisis:Vision Zero, an ambitious plan the city adopted in 2016, aimed at eliminating traffic fatalities through improved infrastructure design. Another critical step toward realizing this vision was an ordinance dedicated to enhancing safety for cyclists. In 2019, Cambridge committed to installing protected bike lanes, becoming the first city in the U.S. to do so. I’m reminded of the urgency of Vision Zero every day when I pass by the “ghost bike” in the Square, which commemorates the cyclistkilled by a tractor-trailerthere in 2020. If we already have the solution to our transportation crisis, we need the leadership and intention to implement it. Yet today, only some elected officials are aligned with these goals. Earlier this month, three city councilors — Paul F. Toner, Joan F. Pickett, and Ayesha M. Wilson —proposed a policy orderto suspend bike lane installation on major corridors throughout the city. From Cambridge St. to Main St. to Broadway, the affected thoroughfares are ones that cyclists use daily. Such an order would have life-threatening impacts, and those seeking this delay risk future tragedies on our streets. Contrary to the arguments supporting a delay, Cambridge’s mobility culture is shifting. In 2015, we were the only city in the nation with over 100,000 residents where over 30 percent of commuters walked or biked to work, and our share of commuters who bike has only grown since then. Not only have we seena dramatic upswingin the number of people taking trips by bike over the past decade, but safe-cycling candidates also retained a majority in last November’s city council election. I believe this is not because of driver shame or guilt, but because people are genuinely excited about effective modes of transportation beyond driving. The November election demonstrated that transportation is a crucial issue for Cambridge residents. Research shows that installing protected bike lanes canimprove safetyin places like Cambridge St. by reducing vehicle speeds and crosswalk distances; theBoston Cyclists Unionhas argued that people feel safer riding in and around Cambridge neighborhoods with these lanes. And in places like Hoboken, Vision Zero policies led toincredible improvementsin pedestrian safety and zero traffic deaths in seven consecutive years. So, why delay on safer streets? Why continue to stall when life-saving solutions are apparent and when60 percentof Cambridge residents supported constructing additional bike lanes in 2018? The progress and goals set in Cambridge did not come about naturally nor without effort; we made much of this progress in just the last few years. Organizers and elected officials took proactive steps to ensure our laws reflected our values. Community-led movements have made — and will continue to make — our streets more livable and vibrant.Mobility justicegoes hand-in-hand with these goals, pushing for people-first, sustainable, multimodal transportation. Everyone should be able to use our streets with dignity. Ahead of potential efforts to stop bike lanes, we musturge City staff and the City Councilto remain steadfast in their commitment to street safety. Let’s continue to fight for sustainable, just mobility. Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."
crimson_2024_75,"On April 16, the week before Passover, Christian-Palestinian theologian Mitri Raheb spoke at Harvard Divinity School about his recent book “Decolonizing Palestine: The Land, The People, The Bible.” The book criticizes the use of Biblical texts in substantiating Israel’s right to statehood and calls for the decolonization of Palestine, which, according to Raheb, requires decolonizing theological concepts including “Israel, the land, election, and chosen people.” The presentation at HDS is the latest in a series of pro-Palestinian programs that feature speakers like Raheb who seem to have a great deal to say about Jewish scripture, Jewish theology, and Jewish identity. Somehow, it has become acceptable for Raheb to dictate to Jewish people — the people who have read and interpreted the Torah for millenia — how to “decolonize” their own identities to suit his own political agenda. It is cultural appropriation par excellence. The expectation that Jewish history and identity need to be adjusted to be acceptable to the current socio-political landscape disregards the endurance of Jewish traditions through 3,000 years of development, often in the face of extreme oppression, colonialist displacement, and ethnic cleansing. Never mind the fact that the Torah has already been frequently usurped and weaponized against the Jews by both Christians and Muslims, who reinterpret key Jewish texts in an attempt to harm Jews. Let me be clear: You can’t tell Jewish people how to be Jewish. We don’t need non-Jewish academics to explain to us concepts central to our identity — such as the land of Israel, the people of Israel, or the return to Zion. We can figure them out ourselves. And, guess what? We have. For more than a thousand years, Jewish theologians and Bible commentators have developed Zionist ideas, advocating for a literal return to a literal land, before our current understanding of Zionism or colonization ever developed. Jewish philosophers in medieval Spain regarded the return to the land of Israel not just as a theoretical concept, but as a concrete religious duty. They treated it seriously enough to get on a ship, and voyage across the perilous mediterranean to the land of Israel. Later, Maimonides, one of the greatest scholars of Jewish philosophy, talked about the Messianic age as a political upheaval, liberating the Jews from bondage to other nations in their own land. And after the expulsion of Jews from Spain, Yosef Nasi tried to create a Jewish prefecture in the Land of Israel under Ottoman rule. He was even appointed governor of Tiberias with the express aim of encouraging Jewish resettlement in “Palestine,” though his attempt was ultimately unsuccessful. So now, in 2024, we do not need a Christian blatherer to tell us about how we were wrong about Zionism all along. The audacity of Raheb to strip us of our theological and historical agency — an idea that would be unthinkable for any other minority group — is staggering. The “theologian” in question also champions the Khazar theory, which posits that modern Ashkenazi Jews are descendents of Turkic converts to Judaism, denying them of links to the land of Israel, notwithstanding large amounts of evidence to the contrary. Consider the precedent Harvard is setting. Would it be acceptable to invite a speaker who claims that the descendants of English settlers are the “real” Indigenous peoples of North America, effectively erasing the historical claims of the First Nations? Or a speaker who claims that globally recognized cultural monuments were actually built by Europeans? The Divinity School has done the equivalent by hosting a speaker who peddles ahistorical, politically motivated conspiracy theories that marginalize Jews, all under the guise of academic discourse. I do not see how Harvard, an institution claiming to uphold “Veritas,” can justify platforming such viewpoints. I’m a religious Jew, with an excellent religious education. I don’t need to be patronized and mansplained the tenets of my own faith. The nuances and complexities of my religion are not open for reinterpretation by those who do not share in its lineage or practice.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_8,"UCI undergraduatespay$149.98 toward the Anteater Express yearly, placing it in the middle range of the university’s undergraduate student fees. Despite this charge, students and the university have not gotten their money’s worth in several ways. As an Anteater Express operator, I can attest that it is a great job and an essential service, but there is plenty of room for improvement. In an interview with New University, an anonymous source employed as an Anteater Express operator detailed problems with Anteater Express’ electric buses, passenger satisfaction and being short-staffed. The operator estimated that out of 20 buses in the fleet, only about 11 are reliable at any given time. They described two buses with long-term issues and said others “randomly break” sometimes. While many problems are minor, such as AE-19’s infamously broken radio antenna, some buses face disasters like acceleration issues or “powertrain failure.” The buses were manufactured byBYD Motors,costing$15 million. On top of that, the “zero-emission, electric hydrogen fuel cell bus”addedto the fleet in 2015, known internally as FC-1, was reportedly a “problem child” before being removed from service in summer 2019. Breakdowns arecommonfor electric buses, but it is disappointing that Anteater Express funding has returned these results. The operator described electric bus technology as not “fully fleshed out,” which may be the source of these costly troubles. Electric buses aremore expensiveto buy up-front than gas-powered buses, but theoretically cheaper over time due to lower maintenance and charging costs. The biodiesel fleetreplacedby the electric one was also generally inconsistent, and sometimes “even more unreliable” than Anteater Express’ current buses. Anteater Express has been unable to win with its fleet at the expense of students and taxpayers, and the challenges are poised to continue. Anteater Express wassupposedto put five new electric buses in service in fall quarter 2023, but it now seems they will be placed in service during the 2024-25 school year. The manufacturer, Proterra,filedfor bankruptcy in August 2023, delaying the new buses’ arrival. Phoenix MotorcarsacquiredProterra’s transit business line in November 2023. The operator described Proterra’s bus quality as “rocky,” evidenced by theirstrugglesin Edmonton, Canada, where only 16 of 60 Proterra buses were in service three years after their purchase. Proterra’s failures cast doubt on the future of the electric bus industry, and it is certainly poor timing for Anteater Express to have bought from the unsteady company. On top of the existing issues, Anteater Express does not have enough drivers to utilize five new buses. Anteater Express has eliminated routes and reduced the frequency of buses on some routes due to a post-COVID-19 staffing shortage. The Main Campus (M Line is overcrowded because Anteater Express can only assign it two buses, leaving studentsfrustrated. Off-campus routes to places like the Irvine Spectrum Center and Diamond Jamboreeno longer exist, limiting student access to Irvine’s main activity hubs. The Camino Del Sol (C and Vista Del Campo (V lines, were also removed and turned into a combined A Line, placing a greater burden on the already busy Vista Del Campo Norte (N Line. Anteater Express’ new Plaza Express (E Line has failed to service the new Plaza Verde II housing community, with the operator saying it is not used “nearly as much” by Plaza Verde II residents compared to N line. They want to see Anteater Express do away with E Line and bring back the C and V Lines, but that is impossible without resolving the staffing shortage. Anteater Express has failed to attract enough workers, forcing them to provide insufficient service. Anteater Express willraisethe starting wage to $20 an hour for 2024-25 school year, offering a $1 raise for each 400 accident-free hours worked, with a capped wage of $23 an hour. Considering California’s $20 fast food minimum wage policy, whichstartedin April 2024, Anteater Express no longer pays more than comparably accessible jobs for UCI students. Drivers have to learn how to drive a bus, get a specialized Class B driver’s license and consent to random drug testing that includes tests for marijuana. The operator describes working for the Anteater Express as a “really nice job” that is “so worth it” past the intensive training period, and I agree. Still, Anteater Express will have to increase its wages further to solve the staffing difficulties. Whether it’sdriving poorly,not stoppingor supposedlyleaving stopsearly or late, passengers love to hate Anteater Express drivers. We make mistakes sometimes, but some buses have extremely sensitive brakes that are nearly impossible to manage perfectly. We are always meant to follow aschedule, and there are many locations where we are only supposed to stop if someone is waiting or a passenger presses a stop request button. Passengers, please pay attention and press the stop request button once the bus leaves or passes the stop before yours. When waiting, some stops have poor visibility so make sure that drivers can see you and that it is clear you’re looking to catch their bus. The TransLoc app and the Anteater Express website offer schedules and live bus tracking. Passengers can use these tools to catch their bus, but Anteater Express should implement broader measures to inform students of route changes. Several major route changes this school yearconfusedstudents due to inadequate communication. Such information should be emailed to all students rather than only accessible through itsInstagramorwebsite. If you’re a student dissatisfied with Anteater Express, be the change you want to see in the world andapplyto be a bus driver. It is a flexible, fun and relaxing position. Anteater Express needs more drivers to improve its route design and run more buses. We have limited power to fix the Anteater Express’ woes as students, but we can do our part as employees and passengers, and urge it to do better. Daniel Waters is an Opinion Staff Writer.

crimson_2024_22,"Over the past few months, Harvard has routinely made national headlines, oftenalongside one name: Bill A. Ackman ’88. The billionaire has captured the public imagination since Oct. 10, when he fired off the beginning of an inflammatory series of X posts criticizing Harvard’s handling of antisemitism. Ackman’s posts, made undoubtedly in bad faith, fueled already virulent retaliation faced by pro-Palestinian student activists. These students, who faceddoxxing and harassment, were largely Black and brown. Ackman has repeatedly abused his influence to intimidate those with significantly less power. Asymmetric attacks on educational institutions — and the values of diversity and dissent which they strive to espouse — are nothing new to me. With Ackman’s recent theatrics, I am reminded of a similar incident that occurred at my high school in December 2020, where Ackman is a current parent. At the end of my freshman year of high school, my school hosted a town hall in light of the murder of George Floyd. During this town hall, I, along with many other students of color, shared my experience with the racism that pervaded our campus. In the hopes of better protecting students like myself, several teachers and administrators then crafted a document of anti-racist proposals, whicha far-right bloglater leaked. The ensuing months thrust our school into the national spotlight, although not to the same extent as Harvard today. First, the recently appointed head of diversity, equity, and inclusion was targeted and resigned under pressure. A few months later, thehead of our school resigned. After that, our top health educator resigned over the spread of malicious disinformation about her curriculum. A truck then parked itself in front of our high school flashing anti-“woke” messages — a strikingly similar parallel to the“doxxing truck”that paraded Harvard Square last semester. It is worth noting that quite a few parents at my high schoolsupported this attack. That year, I watched as my wealthier classmates were emboldened by their parents’ behavior. My peers mocked recently implemented DEI measures as “woke-ism,” despite learning of the importance of their implementation in our community through stories shared on the viral “Black at Dalton” Instagram account and a mandatory assembly that fall. Like the controversy involving former Harvard President Claudine Gay, my high school’s community had many valid criticisms to offer of our former head of school. However, this does not change the fact that, as in the case of Harvard, the loudest criticism originated beyond the walls of our school, from reactionary right-wing pundits. The campaigns to tarnish the reputations of these two leaders and their respective institutions present a stepping stone for further attacks on freedom of speech on school campuses. The success of both of these campaigns raises urgent doubts about institutional autonomy in the face of external, moneyed influence. The right-wing assault on education has not stopped at the gates of Harvard or my high school. The former president of the University of Pennsylvania — after testifying at the samecongressional hearing on antisemitismas Gay —resigned following similar public scrutinyover her performance at the hearing and Penn’s initial response to Oct. 7. The past several years have witnesseda national attackon diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, namely education surrounding race and BGLTQ identity. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis passed the infamous“Don’t Say Gay” billwhich effectively banned the discussion of LGBTQ+ identity in classrooms. Similarly, many states haverecently passed lawsor regulations criminalizing the teaching of Critical Race Theory. The broader anti-DEI campaign being championed by the right is one that seeks to silence and erase large portions of America’s population and history. It attempts to deny the fact thatoppression is systemic. It is no coincidence that Ackman is a vocal proponentof this anti-DEIcampaign. His attack against Gay was motivated by a reluctance toward change. Most deplorably, he weaponized antisemitism as a smokescreen to advance a political agenda — a move that undoubtedlyundermines efforts to combat true antisemitismon college campuses. For Ackman and the right, Gay’s departure represents a triumphant victory in a far greater war: the nationwide crusade against free speech, especially when it attempts to shine light on America’s history of oppression. I have seen, now twice, how unchecked vitriol endangers the most vulnerable members of our community; these attacks make everyone less safe. So, to students across the United States — regardless of education level — it is our responsibility to speak out against this siege. We must do so to protect our classmates, teachers, and our school communities. Finally, to Bill Ackman, my message is simple: do better. Your reactionary words have threatened the livelihoods of countless students and endangered the prospect for open and constructive discourse on campus — an undeniable violation of yourostensible commitment to free speech. In my conversations with those from across Harvard and my high school community, there has been a shared feeling of profound disgust and anger for your actions. Going forward, I hope that the public will remain vigilant in their critiques of the crusade against higher education. At this moment, the future depends on it. —Jasmine N.

rice_thresher_2024_28,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/16/24 9:51pm Apetitionwas posted by an anonymous Rice student Jan. 13 asking for Fondren Library to be open 24/7. By publication, the petition had garnered 313 signatures. While we understand the desire for more study spaces, the extra labor required to support this endeavor may cause more difficulties than it solves. Instead, we have some suggestions for other study spaces and resources that those who want it can access 24/7. The petition claims that the change will “enhance student life and academic performance.” While it is possible that more study hours may improve grades for some, it is also true that allowing students to study at all hours will encourage unhealthy behaviors. Rice is already known for its “cult of busy-ness,” or the myth that Rice students perpetually keep themselves occupied at all hours with homework, internships, extracurriculars and more. Opening Fondy 24/7 could incentivize students to sacrifice their physical and mental well-being as they pull more and more all-nighters. Further, there will have to be additional staff and resources allocated to support those long nighttime hours. For those who would benefit from extra study time, there currently exist places to go at all hours. The Rice ID swipe that gets you into Fondren can also access college commons and private dining rooms for late-night study sessions. Residential colleges have computer rooms with printers. The BioSciences Research Center in the Texas Medical Center is open past 2 a.m., when Fondy closes, and there is a shuttle to transport students to and from the BRC in the late hours of the night. There are many other resources that Fondren provides, from books to data software access. Even if Fondren’s hours are extended, some departments are not open for all of the library’s current hours. While Fondy’s hours are 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Thursday, the Digital Media Commons is open 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. those days and the GIS/Data Center from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Extending Fondy’s hours would also raise the question of whether these departments should match it, putting undue stress on their staff. Meanwhile, there are a plethora of resources available online, including the Woodson Research Center’s archives and digital collections. A sizable chunk of books, journals and otherdatabasesin the Fondy catalog are available as Ebooks 24/7 throughEZproxy, enabling students doing late-night research to access them without having to go to Fondy itself. Although the desire for longer hours is understandable, we do not believe opening Fondy 24/7 would increase the quality of student life. Rather, we encourage students to utilize existing opportunities at hand and prioritize their well-being and that of others.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_59,"Yesterday morning, on the eve of a recall election campaign seeking to remove him from the Harvard Undergraduate Association’s co-presidency, John S. Cooke ’25 penned an op-ed in The Crimson defending himself. In that piece, Cooke told us, in his own words, everything we need to know about him. We are deeply unimpressed. The op-edbegins with a laundry list of professional accomplishments. He has helped us institutionalize funds for our summer storage, he tells us. He created student organization grants and advocated to keep the add-drop deadline later. He sat on a panel. This rebuttal falls flat. Nobody is dissecting Cooke’s resumé nor his performance in his amateur office — he is under scrutiny for allegations of serious misconduct. Cooke proceeds to characterize the criticisms against him as levied in bad faith, likening them to “mudslinging” and politically-motivated scheming aimed at discrediting his administration, damaging his reputation, and scaring him and others like him — whatever that means — “into abandoning our aspirations for public service.” This claim is as vague as it is self-aggrandizing. In suggesting that people are smearing him in the way they would a national politician, Cooke incorrectly assumes that people care about his role nearly as much as the serious allegations against him. This is not a witch hunt. In reality, it is clear that so many of our peers, in their scrutiny of Cooke, are acting out of empathy and legitimate concern for accountability. To dismiss them so completely could not be more callous, audacious, or disrespectful. Cooke writes in defense of his ego — not to engage seriously with his peers or the claims before him. There is a right way to respond to these circumstances. We understand that Cooke is in a challenging predicament, but that cannot excuse how greatly he has failed to meet this moment with the dignity and grace it requires and that we should expect from someone in his position. In focusing on himself and his recent discomfort, Cooke cripples the case in his defense. His piece reads as a call for pity rather than an earnest engagement with the sincere concern motivating his recall. As we place our votes in the recall election today, we must ask ourselves one simple question: Is John Cooke a good leader? A good leader is gracious, he treats his constituents with respect, and he always puts himself second. A good leader can defend himself without disparaging his critics or their motivations. A good leader does not cast anyone aside. There are nine days left in Cooke’s term. Removing him from office will have no real impact on the HUA’s functioning or campus life. But this is not an election about tangibles; it is a referendum on the principles of the undergraduate community. We must consider whether Cooke’s response is befitting of the HUA co-presidency or the character and values of the student body he purports to represent. John Cooke has had his word. Now we get to have ours. E. Matteo Diaz ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Grays Hall. Layla L. Hijjawi ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Grays Hall. Lorenzo Z.

stanforddaily_2024_9,"On April 24, President Richard Saller and Provost Jenny Martinezsent a message to studentsreminding them of Stanford’s rules regarding overnight camping and noting that those who violated this and other rules would be given OCS citations, disciplined and possibly arrested. We believe such bureaucratic responses do not sufficiently recognize the reasons the students are protesting in the first place. The Saller and Martinez notice gestured in the vaguest manner possible at the growing number of studentproteststhat have erupted across ournation— “a number of university campuses have been experiencing disruptions in recent days” — deliberately setting aside the historic genocide unfolding before our eyes and treating this moment as if it were an ordinary occurrence, and indicating that Stanford students’ protest against the ongoing slaughter would be dealt with simply as a bump on the road, a “disruption.” But as the administration well knows, students are not “camping” for recreational purposes, but rather using their encampment to peacefully protest Stanford’s investments in the destruction of the Palestinian people. Expediency should never trump a concern for basic humanity. Our students are not being disobedient without cause — they are driven by a moral purpose that cannot and should not be so quickly dismissed as irrelevant to the University’s mission. The warning sent out by Saller and Martinez in fact belies the sentiments of their Oct. 11messageto the Stanford community condemning Hamas’s attacks of Oct. 7, 2023. That statement evoked international humanitarian law (IHL to undergird that condemnation. However, while explicitly condemning Hamas and not Israel, Saller and Martinez failed to note that Israel’s decades-long occupation of Palestinians is illegal under international law. Indeed, the current protests memorialize and decry what the International Court of Justice, the highest adjudicating body of international humanitarian law, has nowdeterminedto be a plausible case of genocide in Gaza perpetrated by the state of Israel. In this horrific and extremely disproportionate instance of collective punishment, a cardinal violation of IHL,35,000Palestinians (as of this writing — 70 percent of whom are women and children — have been killed by bombs (some of them weighing2,000 pounds , artillery (some ofwhite phosphorus, which is illegal ,live tank ammunition,diseaseandpurposeful starvation. The State of Israel shows no signs at all ofcomplying with the Genocide Convention and the measures put in place by the ICJthat it stop all such acts and indeed prevent their recurrence. As a signatory of the Convention, this is their obligation. Saller and Martinez’s advisory notice to students also omits the fact that being protested, as well as a horrific genocide, is the massive scholasticide being perpetrated by Israel on our colleagues at not just Palestinian universities but also at all Palestinian schools, including United Nations schools. According toexpert testimony to the UN on April 18, “more than 5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors have been killed in Gaza, and over 7,819 students and 756 teachers have been injured — with numbers growing each day” and “at least 60 percent of educational facilities, including 13 public libraries, have been damaged or destroyed and at least 625,000 students have no access to education.” Stanford protesters, as they did in the 120-day sit-in, are demonstrating their empathy and solidarity with their Palestinian peers by showing up to the encampment and spending night and after night, showing their willingness to sacrifice their comfort and ease and to draw our attention to what is happening in Gaza. Faculty and students around the world are breaking the ordinary rules of universities in acts of peaceful civil disobedience modeled on the civil rights, antiwar and anti-apartheid movements of the 1960s and later. Stanford students were active in those movements and theyare now proudly commemorated at Stanford. Indeed, it is not peaceful protest that should be condemned and disciplined, but rather the criminal and morally unconscionable business as usual circumstances that persist with impunity, and are evident in the Saller and Martinez memo. As the late historian Howard Zinn astutelyobserved, “They’ll say we’re disturbing the peace, but there is no peace. What really bothers them is that we are disturbing the war.” It is in this context that we absolutely support our students’ rights to peacefully establish the People’s University for Palestine. There, they are learning and teaching the lessons in civics and respect for international humanitarian law that Stanford has not only inadequately provided, but has helped to undermine throughits investments in companies aiding and abetting Israel’s US-enabled genocide.We demand that no students’ education be curtailed or harmed in any way, no financial support be suspended or removed, and no visas or other immigration status effected, and that no criminal charges be filed. We stand in utmost solidarity with all those who peacefully and respectfully exercise their free speech and academic freedom rights, and do so without interfering in those of others.

thetech_mit_2024_25,"In Fall 2023, Bavaria attracted over 7.2 million visitors, solidifying its status as a dream destination. These figures set a new milestone for theMunich Wiesn, the internationally acclaimed Oktoberfest. Equally record-breaking, and a hot topic for study abroad programs, is the ascendance of Bavaria s Technical University of Munich (TUM . For several years, TUM has been heralded as Germany s leading university,consistently securing top spots in the Shanghai Ranking, QS, and THE, with its graduates being ranked 13th worldwide in employer esteem.DespiteGermany s innovation economy having a hard time, TUM students have consistently produced successful high-growth startups, prompting a question: What s going on in the land of Dirndl, Lederhosen, and why does it matter to MIT? Since becoming TUM s president in 2019, Thomas Hoffmann has been a lucky duck. He was named German University Manager of the Year in November 2023. Soon after, he secured funding from the Dieter Schwarz Foundation for 41 new professorships over 30 years, closely tied to the wealthiest German and his Lidl supermarket chain. What is likely the largest private investment in a public university in Germany s history is also an anomaly for its egalitarian higher education system. Anne MacLachlan of the Berkeley Center for Studies in Higher Education predicted in 2018 that the emergence of a German elite university akin to those in the United States was improbable. Yet, if TUM were a franchise, it would already be an export hit with four German spin-offs in different regions, a Singapore campus, and liaison offices in Brussels, San Francisco, Sāo Paulo, Beijing, and Mumbai. This expansion somewhat mirrors formerStanford President Gerhard Casper s 2015 call for German universities to evolve into foundation universities. TUM s latest donations mark yet another stride in an ambitious journey dating back to 1990. The initial spark was in California, whereTUM graduate student Helmut Schönenberger undertook a study comparing his alma mater with Stanford University, which led to the recommendation of creating a startup center in Munich. By 2002, with prominent support from BMW heiress Susanne Klatten, TUM foundedUnternehmerTUM(Eng: EntrepreneurTUM . Dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship, the spin-off averages 80 startups annually, launching notable scale-ups like Flix and Celonis. With a workforce of over 400, UnternehmerTUM stands as Europe s largest startup accelerator, offering comprehensive support across various growth stages, including a three-month digital product school, the XPlore go-to-market program, and an incubator for validating business models. The organization also spearheads cooperative ventures like the Digital Hub Mobility, focusing on technology scouting for SMEs, and the Circular Republic funding platform, initiated with BMW. Additionally, it runs BEFIVE, catering to construction and real estate firms, and FamilienUnternehmerTUM, which fosters innovation within the family businesses of the renowned GermanMittelstand. Today, a as a vice president on Hoffmann’s executive team, Schönenberger plays a pivotal role in redefining entrepreneurship as a crucial link bridging research and teaching, basically positioning it as the third foundational pillar. Regarding teaching, a key component of TUM s entrepreneurial formula is its in-house Management & Technology degree. This program, especially favored by international students,enjoys great popularity in the student-based CHE survey. Its interdisciplinary frameworkaligns with Stanford empirical studies recommending integrating business and engineering education to nurture entrepreneurial mindsets. Sheri Sheppard, a corresponding study author, was named a TUM Honorary Professor in 2023. Her collaboration with the TUM School of Management has previously facilitated opportunities for students, e.g., from the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM , to undertake research in Silicon Valley. In partnership with Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich s oldest university, CDTM is another part of TUM s focus on entrepreneurship. This center offers a joint honors degree in technology management, similar to Boston s Cross Registration, enabling students from MIT and Harvard to take courses at multiple universities and utilize all of the regional ecosystem s resources. Comparable to FC Bayern Munich s distinct status in soccer, this study model is in a class by itself. Across Europe, TUM’s Champions League profile extended its influence by establishing a distinctive entrepreneurial ecosystem. Since 2011, UnternehmerTUM has managed its nearly $400 million venture capital fund, UVC Partners, setting a precedent in the academic world. While East Coast startup founders might reference MIT s The Engine, it s noteworthy that UVC Partners predates it by around five years. Despite The Engine s larger fund, surpassing $1 billion in 2023, both funds concentrate on seed and early-stage investments. In Munich, UVC Partners is crucial in mitigating theGerman bottleneck problem, where risk capital availability diminishes at each successive financing stage. TUM s focus on deep-tech startups, withone in ten founded at the university, pairs well with its Industry Engagement Program launched in 2023. This program partners with companies like BMW and Siemens, offering them customized access to the Academy for Innovators and Entrepreneurs for intrapreneurship training and consulting by TUM students and researchers. On the academic front, TUM s twelve Venture Labs provide specialized support, e.g., for artificial intelligence to biotechnology startups, akin to the interdisciplinary innovation initiatives fostered by organizations such as the MIT Media Lab. It is fair to say that Cambridge startups significantly gain from local ties to large companies, exemplified by the MIT Industrial Liaison Program started in 1948, alongside over 50 accelerators in the Boston area and global connections like the Cambridge Venture Café. However, unlike Silicon Valley s,Cambridge s tech scene has a relatively short history, beginning about 65 years ago with the exit of the Lever Brothers soap factory, leading to a drop in city tax revenues. In response, Mayor Edward Crane leased the empty factory spaces to the MIT Corporation, catalyzing the transformation into a technology hub to boost city finances. Today, Kendall Square hosts around 2,000 companies, including leading biotech firms and over 600 startups. While Munich s scale is different, it boasts over 450 large companies with at least 250 employees and recently expanded startup opportunities with the 118k square feetMunich Urban Co-lab, initiated by UnternehmerTUM and the city s economic development agency. Support for TUM s initiatives also comes significantly from the Bavarian state government. Starting from the upcoming term,the university will soon charge tuition fees to new non-EU students, albeit much lower than those of prestigious U.S. institutions like MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, the Ivy League, orStoxbridge in the United Kingdom. These additional funds will likely help TUM compete more closely with its Swiss counterpart, ETH Zurich, which benefits from higher public funding. Further legislative reforms to speed up hiring processes for top scholars.Highlighted by Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti, such initiatives not only enhance the academic landscape but also bolster the urban economy by generating five additional non-sector jobs for every high-tech position. At MIT, one is well-versed in legislative efforts to boost innovation ecosystems. TheRegional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP emphasizes the role of government policy, university initiatives, committed corporates, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. Munich s approach, encouraging collaboration among all key players, mirrors MIT s contribution to Greater Boston s economic growth,where, as of 2014, more than 30k startups founded by MIT graduates employed 4.6 million people and generated nearly two trillion USD, surpassing half of Germany s economy. On the one hand, replicating this success in Munich may seem exaggerated even with its GDP consistently above the national average. On the other hand, Kendall Square was not built in a day either, while TUM has clearly been proactive in unraveling the intricacies of its regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. With experience spanning over 80 regions from 30 countries since 2010, REAP understands that governments across the globe see this effort as a Rosetta Stone to translating innovative entrepreneurship into tangible economic growth. The absence of German regions from REAP may reflect the disability at which the public higher education sector forms strong ecosystem partnerships. TUM stands out as an exception. Despite its size, with over 45,000 students as of 2023, making it the largest technical university in Germany, its demonstration is that even the biggest tankers in the higher education sector can navigate swiftly. This capability suggests that robust transformation is achievable within Germany s educational landscape. Observing the similarities between the logos of TUM and TIM’s home leads to an inevitable conclusion: Against all odds, Munich is on its way to establishing Germany’s first elite university for entrepreneurs and innovators. Its blueprint is obvious. Said D. Werneris affiliate project lead at Professor Fiona Murray’s Lab for Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship & Geopolitics. Before, he advised the Parliamentary State Secretary to the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and spent a term as Vice President of Student Affairs at Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen in Germany."
ubyssey_2024_18,"March 1, 2024 Written byUbyssey news staff All year, we’ve been attending governance meetings and keeping an eye on what’s going on in the AMS, Senate and Board of Governors. We’re familiar with the issues and the pressures of each position in student government. This elections season, we talked to all the candidates, attended all the debates and fact-checked their claims and platforms. Here’s the result. We’re not here to tell you who to vote for, but we will be honest about each candidates’ strengths and weaknesses. Behold,The Ubyssey’s guide to all of the 2024 AMS Elections candidates. CK has the most experience in student government among all candidates and has worked in the President’s Office this year — he’s your capable, status-quo candidate. He created a strong student community as EUS president in 2022/23. He’d like to create an exam database and increase student community on campus, and while these goals are not particularly new, they’re detailed and in line with what students want. However, his dismissal of other candidates’ qualifications during debates brings into question his ability to work with people coming from other perspectives. Marx could bring a unique perspective as president with their years of work in AMS services. Marx has also been part of resource groups and has built connections with students who have previously felt ignored by the AMS, especially as part of the PC1/2 working group. As seen in debates, Marx is passionate about fighting for the voices of marginalized students but some of their platform points lacked specificity and they could struggle with the institutional limits of the role. Smith highlighted her experience as a resident advisor and teaching governance procedure throughout her campaign. She wants to bring more transparency to the AMS and seems intent on improving the tenor of discussions between the AMS and students at large. While her platform has some interesting initiatives like pushing for more needs-based student aid, there may be an oversized focus on residents and some goals outside the president’s role. The Bulldozer brings an outside perspective to the race. He is enthusiastic about wanting to rebuild relationships with students who have previously felt dismissed by the AMS by adding minimum consultation time for large policy changes, but his unspecific platform shows a lack of experience. While he genuinely wants to bring change for students, it seems he needs to concretize his goals first. The Bulldozer’s joke candidacy is also not a particularly silly one — it’s unclear what the bit added. Kevin Heieis’s strength in public speaking makes him a promising candidate for a role that needs effective communication and presence. He’s promised a quick turnaround in communication and event promotion that lets club members take control of their own marketing. His idea to replace Porch with a Mexican burrito bar, while fun, may be out of the scope of the position. Amy Liao’s priorities and AMS experience as the club administrator promise a smooth transition from this year’s administration. Her practical goals and sustainability focus set her apart. However, budgeting was not the strongest suit of the VP administration office this year, and Clubs Fair and related club events were the only initiatives she expressed could be an opportunity to cut costs. It’s clear that Jai Sodhi conducted external research on the initiatives that work at other large post-secondary institutions when creating his platform. Sodhi’s club-centric vision aims to reintroduce sleeping spaces on campus and increase the Nest’s operating hours. However, these initiatives may become costly on top of the AMS’s ongoing financial deficit, and work against food insecurity is mostly done by other executives. Fung-Quon is the status quo candidate in this race. He has worked extensively in the VP finance portfolio and is currently the associate VP funds, meaning he knows the AMS’s financial management. His idea to automate the deposit system for clubs and expand information campaigns about student subsidies are unique. However, the rest of his policies lack ambition. He plans to focus on long-term financial sustainability goals articulated by this year’s office. Fung-Quon is knowledgeable and seems passionate, but is certainly not looking to make waves. Malik is an AMS newcomer and is looking to make big changes to its finances with a focus on cutting costs. He has a background in political organizing as a youth board member of the BC United. His plan to cut all AMS executive salaries and reduce the number of paid support staff is unique but it’s unclear how feasible — or ultimately worthwhile — this plan would be. Malik is ambitious, but showed some knowledge gaps in the debate. Fontana has experience fighting for students through his term as the EUS s VP academic. He has fresh ideas on sexual violence prevention, namely on how to make UBC s sexual misconduct policy more survivor-centric. He’s knowledgeable on what the VP AUA office achieved this past year and where it can improve, but lacked specific ways he’d get his food security goals done besides initiatives already in the works. Fontana is also passionate about advocating for affordability and accessibility, specifically around UBC s Disability Accommodations Policy and the Centre for Accessibility. Shaikh s platform centres on affordability, but with no student government experience at UBC, her housing goals are outside the scope of the VP AUA. She has experience with bureaucracy through working for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Shaikh s platform includes sexual violence prevention, specifically around improving BIPOC students’ experiences during the investigations process. She clearly knows what students want and has worked with university administration in the past, but sometimes lacked specifics on how she would achieve her goals. Irfan has a solid platform and is consistent about her proposed policies throughout campaigning. Her time spent on AMS Council, coupled with her experience working in all levels of governments, shows she has the knowledge to get the work done. Having lobbying experience is not required, but using pre-existing connections in the interest of students doesn’t hurt. Her ambition and passion for students is clear, though Irfan may struggle prioritizing everything she wants to accomplish in a one-year term. Sawatzky’s platform covers areas of student interest and concern, but lacks depth on actionable goals. It is unclear what he specifically wants to accomplish in office or how he would do so. Sawatzky does seem like a people-person, despite being reserved in the first debate, and shows genuine interest in wanting to engage and build relationships with students and the community. While Sawatzky has some knowledge gaps, it could be possible for him to learn and grow in the position. Bhangu, the only incumbent, has spent over three years delivering on her promises for students across various roles, including AMS president and VP academic and university affairs. This year, she provided strong and targeted advocacy against tuition raises and made student voices heard on the Board in key discussions. Bhangu’s platform is nothing groundbreaking — she is keen to continue focusing on increasing student affordability and housing. But, if her platform points resonate with you, Bhangu is a candidate who can get them done. Kanji hopes to make the jump to the Board after successful stints as a student senator and VP academic and university affairs. He seeks to continue similar goals as his predecessors around student affordability and leverage his current relationships with university administration to achieve results. In the past, he’s shown he can secure funding for the student body’s needs despite budgetary constraints — something that could prove valuable for next year. However, his plans from last year to “break down communication barriers” between the Senate and students didn’t materialize this year, and he doesn’t seem keen on focusing on them this time around. Lorien is a first-year student vying to bring a voice of disabled students to the Board and to increase the university’s commitments to affordability and divestment. Overall, Lorien has a good grasp on what is feasible and what isn’t. They have a background in advocacy as an executive of the Disabilities United Collective and have shown familiarity with policy at the debates. However, with their limited time at UBC, they haven’t had the same opportunities to develop relationships with university administrators as other candidates. Rother s platform centres international students, advocating for capping international tuition increases and scaling up international financial aid. His campaign also calls attention to campus sustainability and lays out a vision to create a better cycling network for bikers and pedestrians alike. Rother has leadership experience as Interfraternity Council president, but has little familiarity liaising with Board members, and his absence from the debates raises questions about how he’d make his voice heard. Rout’s platform focuses on advocating for international and graduate students — communities not often heard on the Board. Although he has ambitious ideas to reduce food insecurity on campus, his goals appear unrealistic and unfeasible, demonstrating his lack of understanding and knowledge of what the Board is capable of accomplishing. Rout did not attend either of the debates, which leaves us with unanswered questions about his goals and ability to achieve them. Leonard Wang’s emphasis on his finance and banking background says a lot about the approach he wants to bring to the Board. He supports incremental tuition increases and also seemed unfamiliar with the issue of food insecurity, which limits his ability to advocate for central issues facing students. While he has experience on Senate, the majority of his campaign revolves around working with the university’s investment management trust, raising questions about his understanding of the governor role. Wang also did not attend the debates. As a PhD candidate and parent, Zusman brings perspectives to the Board that have often been missing. She’s been involved with student governance for 10 years, so she seems likely to have the institutional knowledge to work within the structures of the Board. While her policy proposals are sometimes outside the scope of the role, she brings fresh and comprehensive ideas that seem to come from genuine concern for student wellbeing. However, her absence at debates made it difficult to assess how she would achieve her goals. Chui’s platform is geared towards representing the voices of faculties outside of arts on the Student Senate Caucus. While his goals lack specificity compared to some of the other candidates, something that became especially clear during debate, Chui’s platform is hoping to increase transparency and focus on feasibility. Despite, showing some knowledge gaps during debates, he will be able to bring a non-arts perspective. S, so if you thatthat, vote for him. Hassib brings genuine care and knowledge to the race, which he has also developed through experience on the Board of Governors. He places strong emphasis on his engagement and transparency efforts, like regular updates on personal social media accounts. However, his platform of accessibility, accountability and equity remains largely the same since he ran last year and has seen little progress. But Hassib’s passion is evident, and if he is able to continue advocating his platform next year, he could continue his work thus far making headway on his original goals. Kamil Kanji is one of two incumbents running in this year’s Senate race, bringing two years of experience that will help him advocate for student priorities around expanding academic support systems and equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. As a lead author of the Student Senate Caucus’s three-year policy strategy he’s demonstrated an ability to work with other student senators to push for student-focused policies. But, while he has delivered results, he has also struggled to engage with the students who elected him, forgetting that you can walk and talk at the same time. Lorien’s campaign focuses on advocating for the needs of disabled students. They bring their extensive involvement in advocacy with Disability United Collective and have a meaningful platform focused on self-certified academic concessions, accessibility in UBC buildings and addressing UBC ties with organizations complicit in human rights abuses. While Lorien’s advocacy experience is outside student government, they showed expertise and familiarity with Senate policies at the debates. Commuter students are the focus of Malik’s platform, which aims to expand remote class offerings. He has done some research, but his main platform promises are extremely ambitious and would face significant hurdles in the slow-moving Senate, considering student terms are only a year long. When it comes to issues beyond the central focus of his platform, his proposals can also lack specificity. Malik has a clear focus, but his inexperience and infeasible goals could hamper his effectiveness as a senator-at-large. Rogers proposes ambitious platform goals, including an extended fall reading break and earlier December exam period, but his knowledge of the feasibility of these changes seems unclear considering it took years to get a fall reading break at all. However, Rogers does appear receptive to the needs of the student body, and has experience in local politics on the Student Union at UBCO. While he could learn how to be an effective senator on the job, it’s questionable as to how much he could deliver on his platform within a one year term. Rother has some experience interacting with aspects of UBC governance through his role as president of the Interfraternity Council. While his commitment to international students, student community and academic flexibility are evident, and his platform is fairly specific, the Senate may not be the ideal place to advance his goals. As a newcomer, he also has knowledge gaps around the student caucus’s work on Senate 2026 that he would need to fill if elected. Rother did not attend any debates. Although Shaikh’s work at the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation gives her experience in bureaucratic processes, her focus on housing policies and affordability is not particularly relevant to the Senate. She held herself well on the debate stage despite her lack of experience in student government, though she may be set back by her seemingly surface-level knowledge of prior Senate policies and lack of direction in her platform. Yi-Kieran brings a fresh perspective to the table as a first-year in the Senate race. He is keen on amplifying 2SLGBTQIA+ and international student voices. As a member of the BC NDP and first-year representative on AUS, he brings some prior experience in student advocacy and governance. Despite being a newcomer, Yi-Kieran has shown he can go toe-to-toe with his fellow candidates in debates and has a genuine passion for academic policy. Share this articlecopied!

thetech_mit_2024_33,"One of the primary demands of the recent protests, as listed in the UA and GSU referenda, is for MIT to cut all research associated with the Israeli military. The explanation given is “MIT’s institutional complicity in furthering violence against the Palestinian people through the Institute’s special ties with the Israeli military 1 .” Let’s approach this MIT style. Let’s ask the key questions, then try to find the answers through analysis of documentation and consultation with experts. We need to look at what is actually going on, and how to evaluate actions in a grounded way. The issue is not how research might possibly be used, but rather how it is likely to be used based on the evidence. It is not sufficient to say “this outcome is bad,” but rather benchmark other outcomes to see how this compares. This process doesn’t get as much attention as chanting slogans and waving signs, but it gets us a lot closer to the truth. The questions are: What exactly is the research? What is its intended use? How are the military actions of the Israel Defense Forces in this war different from other countries in similar situations? What are the benchmarks? First, let’s look at the research and its uses.SAGEhas kindly provided a list of research at MIT funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense 1 .I am going to take that link as the authoritative list because that is the only evidence the protesters are providing to support their conclusion. I am using only papers and news articles referenced in the SAGE document. Here’s their list, what they claim the research is used for, and what their own references actually say it is used for. Please note the Alleged Use has no independent documentation in the 7,000-word website. I only listed the Alleged Uses that are related to offensive military activity. If, hypothetically, the research were used to detect missiles launched at Israel, that would not be contributing to the violence against the Palestinian people and should not be cut. The Documented Use is based on the images presented in the SAGE web page itself. I provided links to the paper when I pulled out information not in the SAGE webpage. In fact, there is no evidence that any of this research is used to attack civilians in Gaza. The stated purposes, both alleged by SAGE and by their reference documents are almost exclusively defensive or generally beneficial, e.g. detecting rocket launches, jamming missiles, monitoring natural disasters, and detecting landmines. The only plausible use in association with an offensive military weapon is the drone swarming, but there is no evidence that the research was used in an offensive capacity. The only available evidence suggests the opposite. As far as spending, the actual amount spent on drone research is a little over $55,000, according toSAGE spreadsheet7 . And of course the research is available to investigators everywhere, not just Israel. So the protests, and the resolutions, and the utter disruption caused by all of that, comes down to $55,000 spent on something that, based on available evidence, is used to detect missiles launched at civilians… Moving on to the second question—how are the military actions of the Israel Defense Forces in this war different from other countries in similar situations? What are the benchmarks? The Gaza Ministry of Health has said that over34,000 peoplein Gaza have been killed during the war 8 . Let me start by saying without equivocation that each one of these deaths is tragic, equal to each death in Israel on October 7. This is not to imply a balance between the methods and intentions of the opposing forces, but to allow me to continue with my point that war, without exception, creates monumental tragedies. Both parties have a right to respond to attacks, even though they create further tragedy, as long as they are in accordance with international law. There is alarge body of lawon what is allowed in international conflicts 9 . Very briefly: Only attacks on military objectives are permitted Incidental civilian harm must be proportional to military objectives Care must be taken to avoid incidental loss of civilian life There is some debate as to Israel’s behavior. It is easy to simply look at the numbers and make a judgment, since 34,000 is a staggering number in a peaceful world. And we can see the damage up close every minute on every news outlet and social media site. But that is only using our hearts, and we should be using our brains as well. How do the IDF actions stack up against the laws? How do they stack up against other conflicts in similar situations not in a peaceful world? The military objective is clear. The number of people killed by the terrorist group Hamas on October 7 was the equivalent of thirteen September 11s, taking into account relative populations. The military objective is to eliminate the force that was responsible for that attack, a force that has vowed to do it“twice and three times”until Israel is destroyed 10 . Hamas forces are protected in400 km of tunnels, buried 5 to 70 m underground 11 , which is to say under apartments, hospitals, and every form of infrastructure. Dropping bombs on the tunnels is a valid military objective. The requirement for proportionality is not one-for-one, i.e. only kill the number of civilians on the other side that is equal to those killed on your side. The rule is that civilian harm should not be allowed at all when there is no military objective. Significant civilian harm is only allowed for a significant military objective. Ending Hamas, the constant missile attacks, and threats of another October 7 is such an objective. As far as incidental civilian harm and care that must be taken, the situation in Gaza is difficult to compare to previous conflicts. Virtually the entire theater of operations is urban, and as mentioned above, every military objective has human shields, by design. Simply declaring that Israel is prohibited from attacking Hamas because of the density of their human shields means Hamas can operate with impunity, and denies Israel the right of self-defense. The only way to resolve this question is to establish that Israel is doing at least as much to protect civilian lives as other militaries would in a similar situation. Fortunately, there are people who study this exact field. One such person is John Spencer. He currently serves as the chair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute at West Point, and as co-director of the Urban Warfare Project. He is also a founding member of the International Working Group on Subterranean Warfare. If I tried to imagine someone more qualified, I would have difficulty. Among other things, he has written: Israel has taken more measures to avoid needless civilian harm than virtually any other nation that s fought an urban war.”(January 31, 2024 12 In my long career studying and advising on urban warfare for the U.S. military, I ve never known an army to take such measures to attend to the enemy s civilian population, especially while simultaneously combating the enemy in the very same buildings. In fact, by my analysis, Israel has implemented more precautions to prevent civilian harm than any military in history—above and beyond what international law requires and more than the U.S. did in its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.(March 26, 2024 13 But that is all qualitative. Let’s look at thequantitative12 . Of course, the true number of Gaza civilian deaths is unknown. The current Hamas-supplied estimate of over 31,000 does not acknowledge a single combatant death (nor any deaths due to the misfiring of its own rockets or other friendly fire . The IDF estimates it has killed about 13,000 Hamas operatives , a number I believe credible partly because I believe the armed forces of a democratic American ally over a terrorist regime, but also because of the size of Hamas fighters assigned to areas that were cleared and having observed the weapons used, the state of Hamas tunnels and other aspects of the combat. That would mean some 18,000 civilians have died in Gaza, a ratio of roughly1 combatant to 1.5 civilians.Given Hamas likely inflation of the death count, the real figure could be closer to 1 to 1. Either way, the number would be historically low for modern urban warfare. The UN, EU and other sources estimate that civilians usually account for 80 percent to 90 percent of casualties, ora 1:9 ratio, in modern war(though this does mix all types of wars . In the 2016-2017 Battle of Mosul, a battle supervised by the U.S. that used the world s most powerful airpower resources, some 10,000 civilians were killed compared to roughly 4,000 ISIS terrorists.”a ratio of 1:2.5 Emphasis added, and the 31,000 figure is from late March. The UN had been using numbers from the Gaza Ministry of Health, but recently revised them, cutting the number of fatalities of women and children by half. That likely means the ratio in Gaza is even lower than 1:1.5 So, while the death of 18,000 civilians is undeniably horrific, compared to similar situations it is remarkably small. If Israel only did as well as the US army fighting ISIS, then there would be 14,000 more civilian fatalities as of late March. Here’s the conclusion: Israel responded to a horrific attack on its territory with lower civilian casualty ratios than other nations have done in similar circumstances. None of those casualties can be linked to MIT research. Which raises a third line of questioning: Why is Israel being singled out? Why no mention of Hamas atrocities (or even Hamas , or hostages, or the war crime of using human shields, in either referendum when discussing a ceasefire? I look forward to hearing from the MIT community and will be responding to comments."
rice_thresher_2024_12,"ByMatti Haacke4/10/24 2:41pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based onguidelinescreated by the BDS movement. S.RES 02 also calls on Rice University to divest its endowment from these corporations and to disentangle itself from the war economy more generally. S.RES 02 implements divestment as a powerful political tool to dismantle systems of racism, oppression and warfare. It joins the calls for divestment in the Israeli colonial war machine that are nowechoing across the United States, following in the footsteps of studentdivestment movements that targeted South Africaand werekey to its liberation. S.RES 02 would be a powerful first step in along-term campaigntowards divesting from Israeli apartheid and colonial violence more broadly at an institutional level. Just two days after proposing the resolution, the two Senator co-sponsors and the Student Association president received an order from Richard Baker of the Office of Access, Equity and Equal Opportunity tohalt votingon the resolution indefinitely due to a complaint from a single student. The complaint alleged that S.RES 02 proposes an antisemitic policy based on the false claim that the resolution could entail the defunding of Jewish student organizations in the future. However, this is clearly an attempt to falsely discredit the resolution, which does not restrict, in any way, funding to any Blanket Tax or other student organizations. Rather, it calls for the ethicalspendingof Blanket Tax funds by existing student organizations. No organization under this resolution would lose funding. The fact that this single complaint blocked the democratic process of voting sets a dangerous precedent that blatantly disregardsstudent freedoms, democratic practices and the will of the student body. We cannot establish a university standard for policing speech and political activism that immediately conflates any criticism of the state of Israel with antisemitism. The same standards do not apply to the sanctioning of China, Russia, Iran or the divestment from South Africa. The critique of the actions of states represents legitimate and necessary political discourse. As a Jewish student, I can unequivocally say that the sentiments in this resolution do not, in any way, foster antisemitism. This resolution is not about dividing us — it is about coming together as one united student group to take concrete actions towards justice. On April 1, the day scheduled to vote on the resolution, Dean of Undergraduates Bridget Gorman and the General Counsel Omar Syed met with every voting member of the Student Association. I’ve spoken to voting members who alleged they discussed the possibility of individual lawsuits being filed against Senate members. I believe these meetings were designed to instill fear of legal repercussions amongst the voting members. It is hard to imagine that these meetings were unconnected to the injunction on voting by Baker, which suggests a coordinated attempt by the Rice administration to suppress this resolution using lawfare on multiple fronts. To my knowledge, there has beenno recorded incidentof individual lawsuits at any other U.S. universities grappling with similar resolutions, such asUniversity of California, Davis,Harvard Law School, and theUniversity of Houston. The administration has also attempted to foster a culture of fear by asserting that by passing S.RES 02, Rice may open itself up to “legal uncertainties.” However, Rice is classified as a nonprofit and not subject to Texas’ current anti-BDS legislation which, as outlined byTexas Government Code Chapter 808and2271, specifically targets companies defined inTX Gov Code 808.001as explicitly for-profit organizations. Wecannotbase our legislative decisions on fears that the law may adjust to add nonprofits or on hypothetical assertions that are unlikely to occur, nor would they be retroactively applicable. It is a moral failure that Rice has chosen to block the popular student expression of anti-war politics by deploying its highest ranking administrators to harass individual students. As we saw in the Thresher last week, this is not the first time Rice has engaged intargeted suppressionof the Student Association and student activists. From sanctioning anti-war activists to failing to divest from South Africa and more recently targeting Student Association organizing efforts to include HCEDD as an equal decision maker in the Community Benefits Agreement in thedevelopment of the Ion, Rice has a history of suppressing student voices. Wecannotlet this continue and must demand that Rice protects our academic freedoms. Rice administration’s suppressive actions reveal that student activism isworking. The university is afraid of the passage of this resolution, as it not only forcefully demands concrete action but also exposes its complicity in genocide. I question the morality of administrators and institutional systems that are scared of cutting ties with companies that profit off of genocide. Rice University must listen to the calls of the students, stand up to genocide and divest. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. When I first set foot on the Rice University campus, the contrast with my small hometown of Toomsuba was stark. Moving from a quaint town of 800 people to the big city of Houston, Texas made me realize how large the divide between my experience and that of my peers was.

crimson_2024_18,"Harvard has lost its way. The Harvard community is blessed with many brilliant, articulate, and well-meaning folks. But it has become intolerant — too lazy to seriously consider contrary views. There isa dominant groupthinkthat stifles debate, intimidating students and faculty from challenging the common wisdom. This may be the view of only a minority of those on the Harvard campus, but it is widely shared by outsiders who have observed recent events. I would like to try to explain how this could happen. One would hope that the governing bodies of Harvard would have energetically fought against this development. After all, it has a long, cherished tradition to invoke in favor of vigorous, informed, and thoughtful debate. When I studied at Harvard more than 50 years ago, that tradition was in full flower. What could be a better dinner conversation in Dunster House than to hear the political discussions of then-graduate students Barney Frank ’61, Lee W. Huebner, and Sanford V. Levinson — one a future Democratic congressman, another the founder of a Republican think tank, and the third a constitutional law professor. One would think that it would be essential that the members of the Harvard Board of Overseers — the second most powerful body of university governance on campus, besides the Harvard Corporation — hold diverse views about, and attitudes towards the University. One would think, too, that the election process would favor people who view the position as a call to duty, not a badge of honor — people willing to sacrifice personal advantage to serve one of the greatest institutions of higher learning in the world. A strong selection process is essential for effective oversight. On nearly any committee or board, there is a strong centripetal force that acts against members raising challenges to the status quo. The more prestigious the board, the greater this force. When surrounded by some of the most important and influential people in the world, why raise a stink and risk alienating potentially valuable connections? Why make critiques or propose new ideas that no one else has seen fit to advance? Harvard’s current selection process for the Board of Overseers, which is dominated by the Harvard Alumni Association, is not fit to address these issues. Alumni associations are valuable. They help classmates keep in touch with one another and recruit members to interview applicants and raise money. Before becoming a federal judge, I was active in my local Harvard alumni organization. But why is this an appropriate body to exert such control over university governance? Alumni associations are rah-rah — they promote a positive image of the university. This purpose hardly seems conducive to introspection and a willingness to critique the university. Further, in my impression, the HAA mirrors the University’s strong ideological tilt. At the college and law school reunions I attended in 2022, there were some wonderful conversations among classmates, but the speakers and some classmate discussion leaders were one-sided. The law-school reunion could have been aptly described as a “Jamie Raskin for President” rally, with the Democratic congressman serving as an invited speaker twice in three days. Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, a brilliant scholar and one of my best professors, devoted a considerable part of his 90 minutes before the 50th reunion class — billed as “A Conversation with Professor Laurence H. Tribe” with “special guest” congressman Jamie B. Raskin ’83 (D-Md. — to passionately express his view that Raskin should be the next president of the United States. Is this what we are now to expect at reunions? This was not a one-off. A few months ago, Harvard Law School alumni were invited to watch several eminent professors discuss the Supreme Court decision that found against Harvard s affirmative action policies. All four professors were insightful. All abhorred the decision. The diversity of their views concerned only how best to minimize the impact on Harvard. Despite its ideological tilt, the HAA has outsized influence on university governance, mostly controllingthe committee that nominatescandidates for election by alumni to the Board of Overseers. This committee selects a slate of candidates — slightly larger than the number of openings — to be placed on the ballot. Outsiders who wish to challenge the HAA slate can be nominated by a petition process, but acquiring these signatures can be a challenging task, with the number of signatures required to get on the ballot increasing from 201 in 2016 to over 3,000 today. After severalinsurgent challengers found success, the University furtherlimited the numberof petition candidates who may serve on the board at one time to just six. Clear signs of open-mindedness. What Harvard needs, now more than ever, is members of the Board of Overseers who will civilly — and without ad hominem attacks — question the powers that be and the status quo, insisting that Harvard be the premier institution in this country for informed, thoughtful, civil debate. For now, all that concerned alumni can do is sign petitions in support of dissident candidates for the Board of Overseers by Jan. 31. Regardless of the outcome, there needs to be some hard thinking about how to improve the selection process. Harris L Hartz ’67 is a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He is currently petitioning to be a candidate in this spring’s Board of Overseers election."
crimson_2024_38,"Americans of all political persuasionshate the revolving doorbetween government and corporate America. And with good reason: Conflicts of interest threaten to privatize governance, undermining confidence that government is by and for the broader public. But revolving door issues aren’t limited to the government. They can plague universities too, with much the same corrosive effects. Thanks to current University Professor and former University President Lawrence H. Summers, they exist right here at Harvard. Summers is not a stranger to the government’s revolving door, having moved from high-ranking positions in the Clinton administration to Wall Street and then to the Obama White House. However, since leaving the Obama Administration, Summers has truly made a name for himself in corporate America, all while he remained in his primary role as a Harvard professor. As the founder and executive director ofthe Revolving Door Project, a public interest watchdog group, I have followed Summers’ conflicts of interest — and his continued failure to adequately disclose them — for years. Summers’Kennedy School CVis incomplete, leaving out many of his extensive corporate ties, which include positions withcryptocurrency firms, fintech firms,banks,real estate companies, apharmaceutical retailer, and, as of recently,OpenAI. This unparalleled body of corporate work alone should concern administrators. Such a large number of business relationships inevitably risks conflicts of interests, and Summers’ lack of full disclosure, coupled with his frequent media appearances, worsens the issue. It is Summers’ role as a frequent pundit that makes these conflicts of interests imperil the wellbeing of the University. There are few, if any, Harvard professors who can rival Summers’ ubiquitous presence in the media. In many of his appearances, the esteemed Charles W. Eliot University Professor’s Harvard pedigree features prominently, trumpeted by hosts as evidence of his experience and expertise. While these analyst appearances may benefit Summers, who is quite open about his desire to shape policy, his frequently undisclosed conflicts with the businesses he’s discussing present a real risk to both Harvard’s credibility — its commitment to Veritas — and the interests of the general public. Last year, amid Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse — the second largest bank failure in U.S. history — Summers appeared across media outlets and liberally posted on X to discuss what was happening to SVB. What viewers didn’t know? Summers had serious conflicts of interest with SVB. Two firms with significant early investments in Circle Internet Financial, SVB’s single largest depositor, have had close ties to Summers. Digital Currency Group, a firm specializing in cryptocurrency investment, employed Summers as a board advisor well into 2022, while Atlas Merchant Capital, an investment fund, still employs him as a senior advisor. Even as Summers loudly advocated for the government to guarantee funds deposited at Silicon Valley Bank — posting on X that “failure to act strongly enough would be a Lehman-like error” and that “this is not the time for moral hazard lectures” — he neglected to mention his history with some of SVB’s largest customers. What’s more, these firms had much to lose. Circle, amazingly, had over $3.3 billion in deposits at the bank, of which it potentially stood to lose all but $250,000 if Summers’ backstop idea wasn’t implemented. After Summers’ full-throated media campaign, depositors were eventually covered, averting a crippling blow to Circle and protecting DCG’s and Atlas’ investments. These connections are concerning, to say the least. Regardless of whether Summers’ opinion on the course of action federal regulators should take was the right one, this was a violation of Harvard’s policies on disclosing conflicts of interest when speaking with the media and, worse, a violation of public trust. While the SVB case was particularly egregious, Summers’ diverse corporate ties, frequent media appearances and wide online following make conflicts of interest inevitable. This inevitability makes disclosure — not just to Harvard internally, but to the public — all the more important. He has consistently failed to do so. When the Revolving Door Project published a letter in July 2022 calling on Summers to disclose publicly any sources of corporate funding he had received, Summers, while not publicly disclosing,told The Crimsonthat his “personal policy is to go beyond Harvard’s requirements by not engaging in paid public advocacy or advocacy to public officials on behalf of any commercial entity.” Without public disclosure, this claim is not verifiable. Since then, the need for transparency has only become more evident. The SVB example could easily be taken as advocating via the media to government officials on behalf of the interests of a commercial entity in which Summers had substantial corporate ties. At a time when Harvard is undergoing a crisis of credibility, with confidence in higher education seriously diminished among the American public, the University and its scholars must be more committed than ever to fastidious transparency in their relationships with corporate and governmental interests. With his extremely public role, Summers’s punditry and nondisclosures not only imperil good governance — they also damage Harvard’s reputation for commitment to the truth. These last few months, Summers has staunchly and widelycriticized Harvard’s leadershipfor failing to meet incredibly high standards. It’s time for him to hold himself to those standards too. Until then, his criticisms of the University — and his commitment to the public — ring hollow. Jeff M.A. Hauser ’95 is the executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a government ethics watchdog group."
rice_thresher_2024_32,"ByRodolfo Gutierrez4/9/24 11:09pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. I decided to go to Rice in part because I was told that this university had a unique culture of honor, trust and freedom. The honor system is one of Rice’s longest-standing traditions, created by the first classin 1912. I joined the Honor Council four years ago because I believed that students, rather than faculty or administration, should keep other students accountable and that their cases be heard by their peers. It is a privilege that can only be maintained if all members of the Rice community — the student body and faculty — actively nurture mutual trust. As I am about to graduate, having deliberated in over 90 Honor Council cases and talked with students, TAs and professors, I can say that honor at Rice is a joke. Many professors respect the Honor Council and the honor system. Nevertheless, too many professors do not trust their students. Professors and TAs have expressed, both to me and the Council, frustration about feeling unable to accuse students of violating the Honor Code during tests because of apolicy barring active proctoring. Therise of assignments written by AIhas further alarmed professors already trying to limit other avenues of cheating, such as homework forums or unauthorized collaboration. The student body does not give professors reason to trust them. Although the Council sees many cases, these are a small fraction of the total Honor Code violations committed based on input from students, TAs and professors. The result is that, in my opinion, academic dishonesty is common and normalized at Rice University. There is a general lack of knowledge about the Honor Code and academic integrity beyond (potentially reciting the Honor Code pledge. Many times, students inadvertently commit Honor Code violations because of general ignorance. For example, unintentional violations have occurred because of misunderstandings on permissible aid in pledged or unpledged assignments. Similarly, confusion with academic standards of citation have resulted in false citations and plagiarism. I have also heard cases where students commitheinousviolations that actively harm the academic environment of Rice, yet are not punished because they attempt to delete evidence or are not reported. But in nearly all cases, students do not care enough about the Honor Code until they are sitting at their hearing. This has been confirmed to me with the discourse surrounding the Honor Council and Honor Code, most recently with the many misconceptions surrounding a new policy on confidential accusations. Mainly, the introduction of confidential accusations is an attempt to encourage students to reportsuspectedHonor Code violations while mitigating the possibility of social reprisal. Failure to report a violation is an Honor Code violation, and this has always been thepolicy(Article 3, Section 2 of the Rice Honor System Constitution but the Council gets few or no reports every semester. Modifying this policy has been a yearlong discussion, with a feedback meeting open to the whole Rice community, attended by only a handful of students and one professor. The Honor System only works if professors trust students, students know about and follow the Honor Code, and students keep each other accountable. None of these cases are the norm at Rice. I do not know or believe there is a single panacea to resolve this. The Honor System was created before electronic calculators were invented, much less wireless telecommunications, the internet and generative AI that facilitate cheating. I don’t want to accept the assertion that we can no longer be trusted to maintain honor today. There are many people in the student body, faculty and administration who are deeply invested in the Honor System, but we need to have active reestablishment of trust by everyone in the Rice community. Students need to trust the Honor Council to advocate for the interests of students and hold their friends accountable to academic standards to prevent violations from occurring. Professors should make their syllabi clear about permissible conduct and collaboration, and make it a greater part of their curriculum. If honor at Rice continues in this charade, the Honor System is untenable. It would be unfortunate that this privilege and freedom that has been protected for over a century can no longer continue because we can no longer trust. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

thetech_mit_2024_13,"Written on Monday, May 6, 2023 Dear Sally, A year ago this week you were becoming the 18th President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I remember sitting close and hearing your speech about the possibility of MIT becoming a place where no problem is too large. And why? You said it best in yourMay 1, 2023 Inaugural Addresswith the question you raised first to all present: “What are university leaders good for?”: “Three things – that add up to something big. First, we can help provision the trip – the right resources and the right talent. Second, we can clear away bureaucratic boulders that block the trail. And finally: We can scout out the best routes for scaling the toughest peaks – and build and inspire the right teams to get there. This capacity to link vision and action – that may be the greatest accelerant of all. If we do those three things right, we create an environment in which every individual has the freedom and support to flourish and grow, and in which we all have a sense of community, connection and shared purpose – those human bonds that allow us to go farther and faster together than any of us could go alone.” I believe in the power of words, especially one’s own words. Your operative words here arecanandif. These words imply an ability to do something (can and a consequence relying on that faithful execution of that ability (if . So, why aren’t you mobilizing this 3-step capacity or ability for protesting university students under your current leadership? Where are the purported “resources”? Where is the clearing of “bureaucratic boulders”? Where is the report out on “scouting out the best route”? You’ve seen the hundreds of MIT students protesting with their bodies, you’ve heard their voices and their reasoning, and you’ve read theirdemandfor a total divestment of MIT from the governmental state of Israel. And that should be enough, yet these courageous students have even done the administrative work of identifying what the specific MIT to Israel ties are, including the drone technology the IDF benefits from directly, the training of police forces by IDF intelligence, and so on and so forth. A significant student population is yearning for your leadership to take action based on their work and thorough vision for an MIT that is not contributing technology toward genocidal use. Let’s be clear – this problem did not appear on October 7, 2023 with the in-kind and murderously resistant effort by the Hamas government against the occupying forces of the Israeli government – this problem has origin a little under 80 years ago in 1948 with genocide, ethnocide, and outright massacre of the people in Palestine, called “Nakba,” by the Israeli regime. MIT’s relationship with modern day Israel as an institute of technology wasalwaysgoing to produce disastrous results — it was just a matter of when and how. No one chose this time to be alive, not the students and not you. But, we all have to deal with life on life’s terms. There’s no place for pride, only humility. There’s no place for fear, only love. You’ve been chosen by fate to play this role today, a privilege that calls for both humility and gratitude. Instead of respect for the intelligence of the students and a multi-faceted approach to clarifying and establishing their demands, you and your administration are more focused on silencing.I’ve written extensively about this topicand will leave that explanation in those writings, but I come now because of what I said to you when we first spoke that warm Spring day of celebration and your new beginning. After your inaugural address, you walked down the aisle toward the line of folks waiting for you. I interjected early to shake your hand, take a picture, and told you from my own wealth of experience fighting for justice at MIT under your predecessor’s leadership (and members of your current team that the best advice I could give you was to listen to the MIT students. I remember telling you that you have to trust them, because they are the beneficiaries of this MIT experience and that their hearts and minds are what make this place what it is. After all, college is an experiment and the students give the best data for analysis. I am beyond disappointed in how blatantly you’ve forgotten the meaning behind these words. The academic suspensions and other disciplinary actions you’ve sanctioned, including the series of other violent acts you’ve taken against your own students reveal an eerily familiar playbook of facism that has no place in this world, and no place at MIT. For me to offer a solution would be arrogant at best. So, instead I’ll give you back your final words in your inaugural address as a path forward, because I agree with them: “Importantly, curiosity is also the one and only path to understanding one another – to empathy and appreciation and mutual respect. In effect, curiosity is the indispensable first step in both collaboration and community. Today, the problems before us – the problems of human society, and of its only planet so far – require that we harness our curiosity in exceptionally productive ways. The people of MIT have always wanted to know how things work, and how we can be part of big solutions. Now, it’s imperative that we know – and that we help lead the world to action.” So, get more curious. It takes immense courage to do what students under your leadership are doing and at the time they are doing it. Students would much rather be focused on their chosen course of study. Graduating students would much rather be excited for Commencement. But, the times have chosen all of us to do something. Please don’t disrespect their efforts by not treating students as the brave souls they are. Ask more questions in an effort toward collaboration. Don’t give into propaganda and noise from others. MIT is in your hands and history will view it that way, as well. And when it gets tough, take your words as goal posts: Provision the trip for your students’ clear demands as Scientists Against Genocide. Clear the bureaucratic boulders stifling progress toward an actionable plan of divestment; and Scout out the best route for scaling this “tough peak” that accompanies any multi-million dollar divestment plan. It’s as simple as 1-2-3; and the good news is you wrote the steps. It’s time for you to lead us and the world at-large into a brighter future where “every individual has the freedom and support to flourish and grow, and in which we all have a sense of community, connection and shared purpose.” Can we count on you to join us?

crimson_2024_80,"My first exposure to a keffiyeh was over a decade ago, when my father brought one home after completing I’tikaf — the practice of living in a mosque for an extended period of time — during the last 10 blessed days of Ramadan. He grew very close with his Gambian, Nigerian, Algerian, Pakistani, and Indian brothers who prayed Tahajjud late at night alongside him. During his I’tikaf, my father met a Palestinian man and asked what brought him to this remote mosque in Texas. The man explained that this mosque was closest to him during the summer months, when he lived about an hour away. In a tragically ironic twist of fate, the man’s summer home was located in Palestine, Texas — the closest he could get to the homeland from which he had been cruelly expelled. As an Uyghur, my father too remains exiled from his homeland — for him, the landscapes of East Turkistan exist solely in memory. As an homage to their shared displacement, the Palestinian man gave my father a keffiyeh on one of the final nights of I’tikaf; my family continues to wrap our copies of the Holy Quran in that very keffiyeh to this day. This is not to say that the struggle for Palestinian liberation is strictly a religious one. The movement must recognize that in addition to Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious minorities live within Palestine. However, more important than religious identity is the solidarity felt across all oppressed groups, exemplified by the bond forged between my father and the Palestinian man so many years ago in a remote Texas mosque. The two found comfort in their parallel hopes of homecoming, of a return to their lands, freed from occupation. Despite their natural solidarity, occupying forces have historically driven wedges between men like my father and his Palestinian friend. China, the colonizer of Uyghur lands, supports — hypocritically — the establishment of a Palestinian state and defends the Palestinian people’s right to resist oppression. Yet in a stunning display of duplicity, the Chinese government also recently detained an estimated 1,000 Tibetans for protesting the development of a dam along the Drichu River in eastern Tibet — a project that would destroy several ancient Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and villages. Evidently, the regime’s endorsement of the Palestinian cause is mere lip service. Unfortunately, such lip service has led several Uyghur advocacy groups to release statements backing Israel after Oct. 7. Moreover, many Uyghur organizations maintain diplomatic ties or receive support from countries and organizations that also maintain close relations with Israel. These geopolitical barriers to solidarity are a poignant reminder of the vitriol that swept our campus last semester. Intimidation tactics such as the “doxxing truck” that circled the Square, the purchasing of domains under student names, and the creation of no-hire lists labeling students as “terrorists” ran rampant. Insidiously, students with some of the most marginalized identities — Black, brown, Muslim, undocumented — were targeted. I was no exception. My face was on the doxxing truck, a domain was purchased under my first and last name, and I was placed on a no-hire list. As one of the few Uyghur students at Harvard, these attacks furthered the language of the oppressor. They echoed rhetoric used by the Chinese government against my people, justifying the concentration camps in East Turkistan and painting Uyghurs as the enemy in the regime’s own war on Terror. Despite efforts to silence voices like mine — voices that unabashedly advocate for both Uyghur and Palestinian liberation — the inextricably intertwined nature of the Uyghur and Palestinian struggle cannot be denied. In his 2002 dissertation, Pan Yue, the current commissioner of China’s Ethnic Affairs Commission, called on China to learn from contemporary colonizers such as the United States and Israel to occupy Tibetan and Uyghur lands. Yue describes the westward expansion of the United States together with Israel’s controlled deployment of settlers to the occupied West Bank, demonstrating how structures of colonization and occupation have always been interconnected. This Ramadan, I can’t help but think of Muslims across the world experiencing some of the most difficult days of their lives. Uyghurs in occupied East Turkistan can’t fast for risk of being detained for religious extremism — some have even been forced to eat pork in direct violation of their faith. Amid a landscape of starvation, sickness, and death, Palestinians in Gaza have no choice but to break their fast with blades of grass picked from the rubble of their homes. For these reasons, I will always shout “free East Turkistan” and “free Palestine” in the same breath. From the mountains of Kurdistan and Afghanistan to the rolling plains of Sudan and Senegal to the vast Tarim and Congo basins, oppressed people across the world are engaged in a universal struggle for liberation, reciting the same prayers and having the same dreams. As I think about all oppressed people struggling to observe Ramadan this year, I am continuously drawn to the timeless words from the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad PBUH, Sahih al-Bukhari. “Beware of the supplication of the oppressed, for there is no veil between it and Allah.” Kawsar Yasin ’26 is a joint History and Anthropology concentrator in Eliot House."
ubyssey_2024_7,"April 9, 2024 Written byVannia Flores Forsyth Vannia Flores Forsyth is a Peruvian-born and raised entrepreneur and 2022 UBC anthropology alumnus. Reflecting on my time at UBC, it s clear that my anthropology degree did more than fill my head with facts — it shaped my perception of how I view the world. Grappling with complex issues without straightforward answers prepared me well for what lay beyond campus life. It wasn t just about cultural studies; it was about learning to navigate the gray areas of life. Right after I had decided to major in anthropology, for the sake of credits and camaraderie, I enrolled in a GEOG 120 class alongside my best friend, Grace. Initially, this geography class seemed a mere divergence from my anthropology major, with its mandated memorization of cloud types — cirrus, stratus, cumulus — appearing tangential at best. Throughout the course, however, not only did I learn several important lessons about the principles of climate, hydrology, geomorphology, biogeography and human-induced changes, but also developed a comprehensive understanding of the ways in which the quarterly shopping spree at the mall, which I had grown up so used to, had a detrimental effect on our planet. This significant turning point came while diving into a research project on the pressing issue of fast fashion. It struck a chord with me: the fashion industry s relentless drive for profit at the expense of both people and the planet was something I couldn t just study and forget. The hard truths from scientific studies shocked me. Sitting cross-legged in my $25 sneakers and the cheap sweaters from Costco, I was struck by the carelessness with which the fashion industry contributes to climate change, water pollution, marine pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. How did I become so oblivious? I came to question my complacency in this cycle of destruction. I was appalled by the unsustainable and unethical exploitative labour practices and models of overconsumption and waste propelled by a trends-driven pop-culture industry resulting in millions of tons of textile waste every year. Among the noise at 3 a.m. in the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre, I had a moment of clarity. In some way, I was able to connect the dots into an embodied understanding, which along with a genuine concern for our collective environmental footprint sparked the idea for how I might bring my anthropological background into my business ventures. Amidst the depths of job searching and the desire to make something meaningful with my skills and life, Sacred Warmth was born in September 2023. My background in anthropology, not business, not only meant having a wide array of skills and an ever-so-daunting lack of a “specialty” for a corporate role, but also stepping into unchartered territory. Nonetheless, armed with confidence about my skills and lessons from UBC — critical thinking, cultural sensitivity and an appreciation for ethical business practices — the mantra everything isfigureoutable became my North Star. If I were still in school, I would be soaking up every lesson, every critique and every insight. The skills you re honing aren t just for passing exams; you’re developing an understanding of transforming intellectual prose into praxis. UBC didn’t just give me a pretty diploma — it steered me through the challenges of starting a business with a mission to tackle the very issues I once wrote essays about. By intertwining my business model with support for charitable causes, I not only challenge the prevailing norms of the fashion industry but also champion a model where fashion serves as a force for good. As a researcher turned entrepreneur, I have harnessed my understanding of fast fashion s environmental and social impacts. Looking back, I ve realized that this path I’ve been navigating is less a departure from my academic roots and more a continuation of my commitment to understanding and improving human interactions with the environment. The challenges of sustainable business practices are as complex as any cultural system studied in anthropology, demanding the application of theoretical knowledge in practical and impactful ways. My studies in history and culture during my degree complicated my understanding of capitalism and its shortcomings, and at first, dampened my initial desire to start a business. Eventually, though, these feelings cultivated the curiosity and courage to speak up and innovate creative ways to disrupt the status quo. As the saying goes, you must understand the rules before you can break them. For me, it took a lot of courage, and I mean,lotsof it. It took over 150 essays to embrace my ideas, my opinions and my voice to share the vision of what I stood for. I feared failure, but I feared more not trying. My anthropology degree didwaymore than fill my head with facts. It showed me who I really was beyond all labels and identities. It empowered my voice to be heard, for my ideas to be nurtured and my witty self to dare make a difference. Your voice, experiences and ideas hold power. Staying small and illusions of greatness serve no one. Whoever you are, wherever you are, I know you are brimming with groundbreaking ideas. My journey has taught me that you shouldn’t wait for the perfect moment to pursue them.

state_press_2024_11,"ASU junior Alysa Horton dancing with Frank Fitzhugh on Thursday, Aug. 3, 2023 in Nampa, Idaho. We re going to get old. Time will move forward, creases will become more prominent and we will learn to say more goodbyes than hellos. The way I plan to prevent this? Befriending people of all ages. Intergenerational friendships, or cross-generational friendships, are those where people have an age gap of 15 years or more. The concept can scare away many Gen Zers who are worried they will become the resource for iPhone advice. But I speak with more people over the age of 50 Thursday through Saturday than people in their 20s — and I wouldn’t change it for the world. The truth is, friendships that venture beyond age curate new perspectives, aid in mentorship and reduce the need for comparison that s often prominent in friendships with people of the same age. I ve worked as a waitress in older communities for three years, first in an assisted living home and then in a retirement community, Mirabella at ASU, where I have been for seven months. As I pour married Mirabella residents Bill Gates and Bobbie Reed their pot of half-regular and half-decaf, I hear stories about the classes they are taking tointegrate into the college communityright next to their home. Bill emails me about Taylor Swift s impact and says he finally understands why I love her music. I ve learned that people of your generation are going through some of the same hopes and fears I went through at your age, Gates said in a written statement. I love the fact that while students hold the door for an old man, at least a few may sense it s worth spending some time getting to know me as a person, not just an old guy. Bill learns about Taylor Swift from me; from him, I learn about what the newspaper world was like before the digital age. He tells me stories of his travels and the life he s created with Bobbie. Bill tells me I will be okay when I get to his age, and I believe him because if he s navigated it all, so can I. Bill and Bobbie have created intergenerational friendships through Mirabella and a pen pal program with a scholarship group at ASU. Their chance to connect with a new, younger friend isn t one that everyone gets to experience. According to AARP, almostone-third of older adultshaven t made a new friend in at least five years. ​ Bill initially joined the pen pal program because he wondered why college freshmen would want anything to do with oldtimers. He has two pen pals in the program: my roommate Drew and I. Bobbie s pen pal is Esther Low, a sophomore studying biomedical engineering. I originally connected with Bobbie because we both studied science, and she got her Ph.D. in chemistry, Low said. So it s allowed me to understand how my degree can provide a career beyond my time at ASU. I ve also learned a lot about how learning is not for any particular age group. You regularly make friends until your mid-20s, but after you turn 25, your circle shrinks, and the people you contact daily continue to decrease. The difference with intergenerational friendships is that half of them will reach the 10-year mark of friendship, and one in five will see two decades together. Whether we want to admit it or not, it s nearly impossible to notcompareourselves to our similar-aged friends. I look in the mirror and pick out what s different from my other friends, or I sit in class and wonder how I ll get ahead of everyone else in the room. With my cross-generational friendships, I get to take a breath and listen to how none of my comparisons will matter when I get older. It s not particularly common to have these kinds of friendships, Low said. But (Bobbie and I were talking over lunch about how our generations are so different, even our point of view. We can learn from each other in every single way. No matter how much therapy we promise to go to, Gen Zers have a way of making their emotions more like a comedy skit. A looming fear of forming cross-generational friendships as a young person can be having to say goodbye to someone we grow to love and want more time with. The fact is that we could lose a friend too soon, no matter what age. Sure, it becomes more prominent when your friend collects social security, but we have the chance tocelebrate the lifewe have, no matter how long it has left. We can’t lose opportunities for connection because we worry we’ll be without it one day. Most of my contemporaries spend a lot of time thinking and talking about the past, myself included, Gates said. It s so much more rewarding to communicate with people who are about to embark on careers and have decades of trial and error — and great successes — ahead. The way to keep understanding and growing is by befriending young people; we can be that for someone else right now. Whether you want to grow your social circle or fear the unknown of the future, now is the time to make an unlikely friend. Edited by Walker Smith, Sadie Buggle and Caera Learmonth.

rice_thresher_2024_7,"ByPrayag Gordy3/19/24 9:46pm I still can’t believe it’s over. Today ends my term as editor-in-chief of the Rice Thresher. I’ve been involved with the paper since freshman year — even before the semester began, actually, since I was one of those annoying freshmen who wanted to start over the summer. I wrote a few times as a new student, but life often got ahead of me. It was 2020, after all, back when we all wore masks outside and anxiously awaited Kevin Kirby’s COVID-19 response weekly updates. By sophomore year, I became a senior news writer. I quickly realized that the Thresher was my home. I was shocked that a year of isolation didn’t seem to shatter the Thresher’s social side; in retrospect, we spent more of our meetings gossiping than working. It was a thrill to write, to receive edits and to eventually see my byline in print. Only in my junior year did I realize I wanted to pursue a career in journalism. Former editors-in-chief Ben Baker-Katz and Morgan Gage gave me the opportunity to create my ownspecial projectsdesk, and we did award-winning work. First, I led an investigation intoRice’s developmentsin Houston’s historically-Black Third Ward. Then, some six months afterRoe v. Wadewas overturned, we wrote ahistory of abortion rights at Rice. We even ran a project aboutbaseball, the best sport in America. Art Director Robert Heeter madeeye-catchingdesignsin print, while a team of developers built a stunning website. Finally, it was time to run the show. Riya Misra and I took the reins in May 2023, built our team and eagerly counted down to the fall. When we returned in August, we dove into the daunting task of telling the stories of the largest student body in Rice’s history. I don’t think we ever could have anticipated the term we had. It’s been a historic 10 months in so many ways, from the suddenremoval of Willy’s statueto the campus’responseto the Israel-Gaza war and a$33.75 millionlegal settlement — not to mention a certainlingerie partygone wrong, the Baker Institute for Public Policy’s30th anniversary galaand so much more. Each of our front pages tells the story of a busy week, with far too many of the details still stuck in my head. Our editorials provided sharp but fair critiques of the day’s news, and we solicited reams of guest opinions and letters to the editor. And our lengthy list of long-term initiatives is still pasted to my wall, barely half checked off. As I look back at the last year, I recognize that I’ve experienced a slew of emotions leading the Thresher — but none more than pride. I am deeply proud of every single story and editorial we ran, every photo we printed, every illustration we commissioned. None of it would have been possible without the best team in the world. Some 150 students have contributed to the paper this year, including more than 30 core masthead staff. Our writers, photographers, illustrators, editors and designers are immensely skilled, and each person was individually such a pleasure to work with. I’m thrilled to call you all friends. To Katharine Shilcutt, the director of student media: We could not have made it far without you. I will always remember your advice, your stories and your friendship with gratitude. To Riya, my fantastic co-editor: I wouldn’t have wanted to do this with anyone else. You’re going to crush it next year. Just please remember how to convert the backpage to an image. To my friends and family: You carried me through the hardest days. Your enthusiasm for and encouragement of my work meant the world to me. And to the Rice community: Our newspaper would be nothing without you. Thank you for trusting us with your stories. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_79,"On Oct. 7, Hamid Abu Ar’ar was driving to work with his wife, Fatma, when a group of terrorists on motorcycles opened fire. A devout Muslim, Fatma was wearing a hijab, but that did not stop Hamas’ fighters, one after the other, from peppering her vehicle with bullets. I met Abu Ar’ar — who lives in the Israeli village of Arara — at a recent gathering at Chabad, where he and a handful of other Israelis with family members who were murdered or kidnapped by Hamas spoke with Harvard faculty and students. Abu Ar’ar told us how his wife, a mother of nine, recited the final prayers Muslims often say in their last moments four times before she died. His infant son was also wounded. Abu Ar’ar hid in a metal container for hours, lying on top of his baby, before he saw Israeli soldiers approaching. As an Arabic speaker, he could hear Hamas terrorists nearby formulating a plan to shoot them, and in a snap decision, with his baby in hand, Abu Ar’ar ran to alert the soldiers to the impending ambush. He described the emotional moment in which, after a shootout, an Israeli soldier recognized him and ordered his subordinates to halt their fire. He believes it is a miracle that he, his baby, and the soldiers survived: “If the soldiers had advanced five more meters, they would all have been shot dead.” Abu Ar’ar risked his life to save theirs. “Our Islam is the opposite of what the terrorists have done,”he wrote. This week, the “Wall of Resistance” is once again up at Harvard, now with the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war and everything that’s happened on campus since Oct. 7. While this year’s wall “only” accuses Israel of apartheid and genocide, past iterations have referred to it as premised on settler colonialism and white supremacy, and the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, which sponsors the wall, continues to use such reductive and inflammatory rhetoric. Pro-Palestinian activists use these buzzwords because they are familiar to the American left, but the truth is that regardless of one’s view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is simply inaccurate to characterize Israel as an apartheid state or occupier. At the very least, these terms don’t tell a complete story. For one thing, most Israeli Jews are not white — a plurality descend from those who fled from the Middle East and North Africa, many amid violent persecution that long predated 1948. Yemen, for example, was once home to 55,000 Jews, but the United Nations has reported that just one single Jew remains. The Houthis now rule most of Yemen, and their slogan declares “Curse the Jews.” Furthermore, the refugees who founded Israel were not “colonists” — many were repatriates to a land that Jews, as a diaspora people, are native to and had no other country to call their own. My own great-great-grandmother, arrested while fleeing to the land of Israel, was held in a British internment camp in Cyprus. She is certainly not what you imagine when you think of a mighty colonist, beholden to a European power. Palestinian citizens of Israel — some of whom call themselves Arab-Israelis — serve in the Knesset, sit on its Supreme Court, and even reach the highest ranks of Israel s military, including the officer leading the agency responsible for coordination with the Palestinians. Arabs have reached the pinnacles of Israeli society in other sectors too. A leading Israeli virologist during the Covid pandemic was professor Jihad Bishara, which is perhaps unsurprising, considering 43 percent of new physicians’ licenses awarded in 2021 went to Arabs, who compose 21 percent of Israel’s population. One of those medical professionals was Awad Darawshe, a paramedic who was working at the Nova music festival on Oct 7. When his colleagues heard gunshots, they begged him to flee, but Darawshe would not budge. “I speak Arabic, I think I can manage.” He was shot and killed by Hamas while bandaging a wounded partier. Given Abu Ar’ar and Darawshe’s experiences, it is perhaps unsurprising that many Palestinian citizens of Israel feel a newfound sense of belonging to the state. A poll one month into the ongoing warfound that 66 percentof Palestinian citizens of Israel support Israel defending itself against Hamas, and that their sense of solidarity and belonging to Israel is the highest it has been in 20 years. It is an odd position, for campus activists to deny Israel’s very legitimacy while most Palestinian citizens of Israel have never embraced it so decisively. When you are confronted with the plain-and-simple narrative of Israel favored by campus activists, I ask that you think of Abu Ar’ar. “Everyone who lives in this country must be one. Arabs, Jews. We must be one unit. We cannot let anyone infect us with hate,” he says. Peace in the Middle East will come thanks to people like him, not the Harvard students chanting, “From water to water, Palestine is Arab.” The tragic story of Israel and Palestine is not simple, and it serves nobody to pretend that it is. Only so many words can fit on a wall. Charlie A. Covit ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Holworthy Hall."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_4,"During finals week, all UCI faculty received email blasts from administrators prescribing action steps in the case of “student disruptions” to exams, which included recommendations to call 911 or the UCIPD on student protestors, especially if the situation could not be resolved by completely canceling class. As our campus continues to be shaped by political and institutional contestations over the exercise of free speech and student activists’ calls for the university’s financial divestments from the US-backed Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the ongoing military siege and genocide in Gaza, a sub-set of faculty, including members of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine (FSJP , question the conditions under which these emails are being sent, and refuse these recommendations to all UCI faculty. Administrative language often erases power relations embedded in the normal functioning of the university. Such administrative emails reduce student activists — and to be more specific, a particular subset of the student body who have been peacefully exercising their rights to free speech, assembly and protest — as potential disruptors, who constitute a seeming problem to be managed. This framing risks contributing to a fearful campus environment wherein faculty are encouraged to view their students through a racialized lens of suspicion, criminality, and alarm. Recommendations for de-escalation and then returning to normalcy after a “disruption” also construct student activists as irrational beings prone to violence, from whom nothing is to be learned. We are struck by the fact that — less than one month after hundreds of police were deployed onto campus in what could be described as the most significant disruption to classes and campus life in recent history, with many members of our community exposed and subjected to lethal weaponry — the police are nonetheless framed as the solution to campus and community safety and the seeming restoration of business as usual. Bringing police into classrooms not only guarantees completely ending the class session, but it also creates an unsafe environment — not just for the protestors in question, but for other students for whom the police are not a sign of safety. In fact, despite image-building campaigns that aim to construct UCPD as less violent than other police departments, research and the embodied knowledge of Black faculty, Black students and other racialized communities reveals that the now militarized UCPD can easily revert to escalatory tactics and endanger lives and well-being. UCI is a majority minority campus, and many of our students come from communities that have been victimized and even torn apart by the US government’s domestic and international policies surrounding anti-terrorism, security, surveillance and other forms of political, religious and cultural repression. In fact, several of the student protestors are calling for the university’s divestment from the US military-industrial complex due to their embodied understanding of the human impacts of US-backed militarism and securitized policing, especially after 9/11 and the so-called “Global War on Terror”, now reconstituted through the geopolitics of Palestine-Israel. It is alarming to us that faculty are encouraged to rely on anti-terror, securitization and policing practices, when such policies and practices disproportionately target Black and Brown communities and criminalize student activists as potentially violent. The routine nature of these emails make clear the transnational connections between US militarism abroad and militarized policing at home and on UC campuses. The dissemination of such emails is as alienating for some faculty as it is for students, as they contribute to a repressive and hostile environment for racialized faculty members. What for some faculty may seem routine emails about campus procedure, for others is received as a painful reminder that our, along with many of our students’, lived experiences of surveillance, suspicion and racialized policing are not taken seriously by this university. It is especially troublesome since some of these emails are even being circulated under offices set up to complement diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI efforts on campus. Furthermore, the UCIPD is involved in other kinds of violent acts against students, including the meting out so-called“interim suspensions”to student activists without due process and on the basis of student protest being constructed as an “imminent threat to safety.” Some faculty associated with FSJP, for example, have documented the ways that upper administration has largely misled others in campus leadership on the actual impacts of these suspensions on students, including students’ lack of access to housing and other vital campus resources, the inability to take final exams or even attend their graduation commencement ceremony. At a time when nearly every campus unit and research programs are being asked to take on budget cuts and fundraise for themselves, hundreds of thousands of dollars are being spent on policing, the deployment of private security guards and even metal detectors at graduation commencement. Whose safety and whose inclusion is being prioritized here? The normalization of administrative and campus policing must end. Instead, we invite university administrators and our colleagues to embrace more imaginative ideas and pedagogies that avoid any reliance on the police to navigate power and politics on campus, including interactions with student activists, students’ expressions of distress in the classroom and faculty responses to such distress. Divesting in policing and reinvesting in resources that facilitate instructors’ learning about transformative pedagogies in the classroom, including leaning into the universal capacity for humanization, empathy, curiosity and care, is one possibility. “Student disruptions,” can become meaningful learning experiences for both students and faculty engaged with the history and present of activism in the UC system. Classes do not have to be canceled. Instead, faculty can employ creative work-arounds to support the completion of exams or other kinds of assignments that reflect on-campus life contextualized within a global society. The rejection of policing on campus is just the beginning of meaningful accountability and repair after the campus police siege on May 15th. This rejection of policing builds on the long-standing work of Black activists and others involved in the UC-wide abolitionist Cops off Campus and BLM university and social movements, those who trace connections between the devastating impacts of militarized policing on Black, Palestinian and other communities of color transnationally and in the US. The rejection of policing resists the creeping neoliberal authoritarian repression that is increasingly becoming normalized and authorized by administrative ranks. Instead, we can envision another kind of university and an alternative politics of DEI that truly aligns with and makes real the stated missions of theUC Principles of CommunityandUCI Office of Inclusive Excellence. Together, we can envision more just futures on our campus, the UC system, US society and globally.

crimson_2024_96,"Early this year, interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 announced the formation of the Presidential Task Force on Combating Anti-Muslim and Anti-Arab Bias, which was charged with understanding how hate and bias have impacted life on campus for Muslim and Arab members of the Harvard community. We are the co-chairs of that task force, and we write to share what we’ve found from our work so far — and where we’ll go from here. We began meeting in February and launched a series of listening sessions in April — to date we have had 45 sessions with more than 400 students, faculty, and staff across Cambridge and Longwood. We also met with several affinity groups to ensure that a wide range of vital perspectives were heard. Our goal was to learn more about what Harvard community members have experienced and form recommendations for what the University can do about it. We learned early on that though the name and charge of our Task Force refer to Muslim and Arabs, we had to focus particularly on Palestinian members of our community and those with diverse backgrounds who identify as pro-Palestinian, both of which groups have experienced a great deal of trauma and pain. What we heard was heart-breaking. Palestinian community members spoke of the tragic loss of many family members and loved ones in Gaza. Muslims, Palestinians, Arab Christians, and other individuals of Arab descent reported compounding feelings of uncertainty, abandonment, threat, mistrust, and fear. We heard of incidents of bias, including of Muslim women in hijab and pro-Palestinian students wearing keffiyehs being verbally harassed and called “terrorists” by other Harvard affiliates. People of color from other groups and identities — often Black and South Asian students – shared experiences of racism and hatred because they were allies, or because they were misidentified as Arab, Muslim, or Palestinian. This pain and anxiety, we found, extends to the administration’s actions too. Students reported getting doxxed by outsiders and insiders alike with little administrative response. Palestinians spoke about feeling their identity ignored and erased by campus-wide messages that did not acknowledge them. Many felt that University responses to campus protests amounted to a “Palestine exception” to free speech. Others raised concerns that policies have been applied unevenly to Muslims, Arabs, and pro-Palestinian students versus other groups. Many students and faculty, including Jewish allies, said they continue to fear negative consequences when speaking out publicly on issues they care about such as human rights and Harvard’s engagements and investments in the Middle East. The threat of harassment, physical violence, or professional consequences force these members of the Harvard community to choose between free expression and personal well-being. Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias at American universities are not new developments. They became particularly significant after 9/11 and its lasting effects on U.S. foreign policy and domestic politics. Students also noted that Harvard lacked faculty and course offerings dedicated to Palestinian studies and the complexities of the Israel-Palestine conflict — a reality that perpetuates a lack of understanding on campus about the crisis happening in Gaza today. To complement these findings from the listening sessions, we have recently launched a Harvard-widesurveyin collaboration with the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism. We encourage all students, staff, and faculty to take it. Although many community members are feeling harm, disappointment and isolation, there is also a deep desire for positive change. Despite all they have experienced, members of our various communities came forward with suggestions for creating a better Harvard — one that pays attention to the voices and views of all students, faculty, and staff. As challenging as the situation is, we remain committed to starting the healing process and fostering a more inclusive Harvard. The Presidential Task Force on Combating Anti-Muslim and Anti-Arab Bias will continue to engage with its communities and hopes to deliver preliminary recommendations to the President shortly and further recommendations and a public report in the fall. We are also coordinating with our counterparts on the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism to share what we have heard, look for similar trends, and demonstrate our shared commitment to create bridges of understanding between our work. While we will work together to identify opportunities to increase dialogue across differences, we will also recognize the diversity of lived experiences that exists between groups at Harvard. Too many students have felt invisible at Harvard in recent months. Our task force is committed to making visible and improving the experiences of Arabs, Muslims, Palestinians, and pro-Palestinian allies within our community. Ali S. Asani is the Murray A. Albertson Professor of Middle Eastern Studies and Professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures. Wafaie W. Fawzi is the Richard Saltonstall Professor of Population Sciences and Professor of Nutrition, Epidemiology, and Global Health.

Ni’s resignation resurfaces conversations about the responsibilities and benefits of student leadership. Aperennial topic in our news sections, student leaders like Ni work long, solitary hours in the shadows of the Rice administration. Much of the SA presidency consists of tedious work behind the scenes, yet ordinary students hardly go a day without seeing the results of such labor —munch, for instance, was anSA initiative. During Orientation Week, student leaders are far more visible than Rice’s administration. The 33 O-Week coordinators provide an essential and highly marketable service to the university, organizing the welcoming committee for more than 1,000 new students annually. They review new student forms, pair roommates and set O-Week groups. The coordinators are the first Rice leaders many new students encounter. Yet the university is struggling to attract and retain its next generation of leaders. Ni — and every other candidate alongside him — ran unopposed, and now he has resigned. At Martel College, just one of the three 2024 O-Week coordinators is a Martelian. There is no easy fix. Some may say that students do not care, that they just want to secure a degree and leave. We strongly disagree. Rice students do value this university and do strive to improve it. There are students who are motivated to pursue leadership. It is not an issue of interested students — it is a consequence of a series of deterrents. One such obstacle is money. Ni was not paid. O-Week coordinatorsreceive a stipendthat many say amounts to less than $1 per hour, in addition to room and board for the summer. Clearly, students who need to work to survive cannot easily serve as leaders. Beyond that, many students see a system rife for abuse, where the university can write a laundry list of responsibilities and avoid fairly valuing the results. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as throwing money at the problem. For instance, who should pay the SA president? The SA’s role is to fight for the students, often against the administration. If Rice paid them directly, it could create a conflict of interest. (It is far easier to increase O-Week coordinator stipends since their work is always in the university’s best interest. More broadly, we as a student body must figure out where we stand. There are a series of legitimate, difficult questions about student leadership to address. Beyond the source of the money, we must ask which positions need compensation and which should remain voluntary; we must also reevaluate the responsibilities student leaders hold. While this is not the first time we’ve found ourselveshaving this conversation, we hope Ni’s resignation will reinvigorate these essential discussions and spur some sort of action when it comes to valuing our student leaders.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

wildcat_arizona_2024_4,"It’s been quite a year for the University of Arizona with multiple happenings making the news, most notably the financial crisis caused by royally failing to maintain a balanced budget. UA has since drafted aplanto balance the budget thatincluded hiring and pay freezes, along with “budget reductions.” It’s wonderful the UA has decided a balanced budget is ideal, and hopefully lower employees are shielded from consequences of senior leadership’s mistakes. TheArizona Daily Starreportedthat Lisa Rulney,no longer the UA’s CFO,remains on university payroll, making $506,325 a year as a senior advisor to business operations. TheStarwent on to report thatPresident Dr. Robert C Robbins did not mention this during a meeting with the Arizona Board of Regents. Robbins since then has madestatementson Rulney saying the role istemporary, ending on June 30, and he made this decision to “help ensure a minimally disruptive and well informed transition.”According to an email sent by Robbins to the UA community, Rulney’s role will be to “provide support to our Interim CFO as he focuses on implementing the University’s financial action plan and managing the division’s broad operations.” This situation is clownishly illogical, given the fact Rulney was CFO during a colossalblunder, yet continues to remain on payroll after resigning and being given an advisor position.Everyone is entitled to job security, but one could only hope that their boss goes through the leaps and bounds Robbins is for Rulney. This is a luxury regular people are not often afforded, but something that seems quite commonplace in the highly anemic and wimpish overpaid bubble that is higher academia. Gifting Rulney a role in supporting the Interim CFO is like givingRichard Nixon oversight of Gerald Ford after Watergate. Anyone closely tied to this disarray should be removed, because I’d prefer to avoid future financial problems and remain proud of the school I attend. The UA made a statement saying “We appreciate Lisa Rulney’s willingness to utilize her longtime experience and expertise to continue serving the university at this critical time.”Well, I feel very secure in the fact that Rulney took this job out of a willingness to serve the university and not because she’ll be keeping her full pay in the process. To test how strong Rulney’s “willingness” really is, let’s see if she would be willing to have her salary cut to 45k a year. It reveals just how out of touch they are with the employees and students here at UA, and we deserve better. Much like politicians, CEOs, police and bankers, it’s no surprise to see those leading powerful institutions doing everything within their reach to protect their own, but it’s disappointing to see this play out at home. However, in the long run, the university will get past this. OnJune 30, Rulney will leaveand Robbins won’t be here forever. Those are two “budget cuts” that will make all the difference.

stanforddaily_2024_5,"The Stanford Management Company manages the fourth largest universityendowmentin the nation at $36.5 billion. TheStatement on Divestment, which calls for Stanford to divest from Chevron, Lockheed Martin and other companies tied to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, was recentlypassedin Stanford’s 2024 ASSU election. This bill, coupled with campaigns for Stanford to divest from thefossilfuelindustry, highlight that the investment of our endowment is under more scrutiny than ever. Questions over the ethics and responsibility of the University’s investments are handled by the Board of Trustees’ Special Committee on Investment Responsibility (SCIR , whichsteersStanford’s investment decisions. This committee currently features no student members. We believe that the inclusion of student representatives has long been needed, independent of current movements. The Board of Trustees haseleven committeesthat make recommendations to and advise the Board on various aspects of the University’s operations. Currently, two student representatives serve as “full, voting members” on four of these committees: namely, Development, Finance, Land & Buildings, and Student, Alumni, & External Affairs. Student members on the Finance Committee already oversee fiscal matters similar to those SCIR deals with. We call upon The Board of Trustees to introduce two student seats on the SCIR to officially include students in discourse and decision-making concerning Stanford’s endowment. The case for student representation on SCIR Students offer a different perspective than current seated stakeholders on how institutional responsibility should motivate investment decisions. Having student members on the committee would foster more direct and effective representation of the diversity and conviction of student views, removing the kinds of bureaucratic red tape that isolates decisionmakers from our voices. Student members could serve as spokespeople who listen to, summarize and report on student concerns, rather than leaving it up to the Board of Trustees to speculate on campus sentiments. Our argument for student input is separate from particular activist causes or advocacy. Rather, it is rooted in the need for an active and official student partnership with the Trustees overourUniversity’s institutional holdings. Stanford’s investment portfolio, or the “Merged Pool” controlled by the Stanford Management Company, is money that is invested in the name of our education. Many current students will become alumni who endow gifts that are managed as part of this portfolio. Representation on the Investment Committee would cultivate the financial partnership between Stanford and future alumni from an early stage. It will also foster greater trust and transparency between current students and administrators. With these benefits in mind, why are students not already represented on the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility? If top Stanford leaders believe students are not experienced or knowledgeable enough about finance and investing, this conflicts with the fact that students are already represented on theFinance Committee. Moreover, the student body at large has earned the confidence of the University to take onloans for their education. If Stanford does not wish to disclose its investments to members of the student body, we do not think this is a sufficient reason to preclude student representatives. Stanford students already work as summer analysts at theStanford Management Company. If Stanford believes students are incapable of putting the good of the University before advancing their personal politics, then maybe they should have not trusted students to serve on thePresidential Search Committeein the first place – a committee with a similarly significant task. A brief history of student-led investment decisions at Stanford Stanford students have longdemonstratedthe desire to discuss and revise institutional holdings. In 1985, the student bodyvoted 2,045 to 485that Stanford should divest from Motorola due to Motorola’s sales to South African military and law enforcement. Stanford’s Trustees voted in agreement with students’ recommendation, committing todrop its nearly $4.7 million worth of Motorola stockif Motorola continued business operations with the regime. This culminated in Motorolasellingall manufacturing operations in South Africa. In 2005, the Stanford chapter of “Students Taking Action Now: Darfur” (STAND pushedStanford to divest from four companies whose business operations supported the Sudanese regime that perpetuated genocides in Darfur. In 2014, the Board of Trustees announced that the Stanford endowment wouldno longer fund coal mining companies, making Stanford the first major university in the nation to take any such action. The Board Chair at the time described Fossil Free Stanford, the student coalition behind much of the advocacy at the time, as having “catalyzed important discussion” about investments made by the University. In all of these cases, the Board ended up revising institutional holdings due to student perspectives. It’s time to institutionalize the partnership between students and the Board of Trustees. Formal seating of students on the Investment Responsibility Committee would provide stability to the tumult that exists on all sides of difficult investment discussions. A seat at the table Since the Board’s 2018adoptionof itsStatementon Investment Responsibility and Ethical Investment, the school has witnessedintense student advocacyfor divestment including ASSU ballot initiatives andpetitionsto faculty and the Board of Trustees. To be clear: we are not arguing that students alone should drive Stanford’s portfolio. Rather, we are simply asking for students to be respected enough to have a seat at the table when discussing whether the endowment gets spent in line with the values Stanford claims to stand for. This includes “environmental, social and governance factors,”accordingto the Committee’s statement of values. We propose that students should have two seats — one undergraduate, one graduate — on the Special Committee on Investment Responsibility. This selection process should be rigorous, credential-based and should start as soon as possible. An ideal candidate for the committee would have an extensive background in finance and investing, the ability to communicate the diverse interests and needs of the student body and, most importantly, demonstrate the shared values our community embodies. If the University commits to this increased transparency, the Board of Trustees will gain invaluable insights into student perspectives, while students will gain long-awaited involvement in critical decision-making related to Stanford institutional holdings. Aligned investing is difficult — more accountability can only help. The Stanford Daily Editorial Board comprises Opinions Editors, Columnists, and at least one member of the Stanford Community.

crimson_2024_55,"This Women’s History Month, I find myself grieving for women — not those fighting for their historical contributions to be celebrated, but those fighting for their lived experience to be simply recognized. When another South Korean woman who was forced into sexual slavery under the Japanese colonial military passed away last year, the number of known surviving Korean “comfort women” dropped to a mere nine. These women in their nineties, whom Japanese soldiers sexually enslaved before and during World War II, spent almost half a century concealing their stories. These women have faced obstacle after obstacle in the fight for reparations — the difficulty of their stories unequivocally compounded by the culture of patriarchy and misogyny in South Korea. The stigma of infertility, sexual diseases, and experience with sexual slavery itself have left many survivors unable to integrate into society with ease. Many were single or divorced, making them more vulnerable to financial difficulties in a society where men were often the breadwinners. Societal emphasis on chastity also meant that when these women did break their silence, they could be met with humiliation. The public sometimes looked down upon victims and activists picketing outside the Embassy of Japan — only in the 1990s did protests help change public perception. Even now, the retelling of the full experiences of comfort women is still in progress — reparations and healing remain incomplete. It all began with the Japanese government’s denial of responsibility, and it continued with the Korean government’s failure to properly negotiate and seek compensation from Japan for their historical sins. In the present day, revisionist views among scholars, including Harvard Law School professorJ. Mark Ramseyer, have twisted the truth and framed sexual slavery as voluntary or contracted. But now, even more pressing is the threat of time. It is only a matter of a few years before the young girl sitting in front of the Embassy of Japan in South Korea, a historical monument commemorating these comfort women, becomes a relic of some seemingly distant past. It is comforting to think that progress might naturally accompany the passing of time — but in reality, it is not so simple. In recent years, South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol — whose presidential campaign was rooted in anti-feminist rhetoric and included plans to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality — has seemed to legitimize the decade-long witch hunt against feminist movements. In a country with the highest gender wage gap among OECD countries and an excessive political crackdown on false sexual assault accusations rather than sexual assault itself, calls for women’s rights have been silenced as misandrist efforts to vilify men. Such politicization of women speaking up about their experiences today only makes it more difficult to address the unresolved issues — like comfort women — of the past. Will we ever be able to celebrate progress for comfort women, and will a single survivor be around to celebrate with us? Or, will this cycle of silencing women continue? Some of my sorrow stems from guilt. My first exposure to this history came in the form of the Korean movie “I Can Speak,” which I thought little about as a politically disengaged seventh grader. It was not until I took part in translating a book of survivors’ stories into English in ninth grade, that I finally understood the issue’s gravity. As I further explored this historical tragedy through academic research — learning about both the ticking clock of surviving comfort women and the regression of women’s rights in Korea — I have felt helpless and regretful for my prior indifference. I continue to lament the persistent lack of progress that survivors have undeservedly faced for nearly a century now. After decades of efforts aimed at justice, survivors are now being chased by time: the most objective and neutral, yet potent force. This alone should be sufficient reason to continue to demand reparations in recognition of survivors’ dignity. Every second counts. Aimee K. Choi ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews hall."
crimson_2024_7,"There are many facts I could tell you to support Derek J. Penslar’s appointment as co-chair of Harvard’s recently-establishedantisemitism task force. I could tell you that his decades-long, world-renowned research focuses on Zionism, Israel, Palestine, and Jewish history and antisemitism specifically. I could tell you how many ofPenslar’s colleaguesandstudents have advocatedfor him. I could tell you that he is a signatory of theJerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism— one of the most well-regarded definitions of antisemitism to date — which clearly acknowledges that criticism of Israel can be antisemitic, especially when that criticism denies the Jewish right to self-determination and security. Instead, I will show you what it’s been like to be one of Penslar’s students. I was a student in Penslar’s class, “Jews in the Modern World,” last semester. In that time, we collectively experienced the Oct. 7 attacks. In that lecture hall, I felt profound grief, not just from the students but from Penslar himself. I also saw the way he immediately rushed to support students, making us feel comfortable and safe in a time of momentous instability. In his office hours a week after the attacks, we spent an hour discussing the conflict and temperature of the student body. He listened to me and genuinely made me feel more comfortable navigating both campus life and the conflict as a whole. In Penslar’s class, I also observed robust, constant discussion of antisemitism. We were asked to attempt to understand what, specifically, it means to be Jewish, and what it means to hate Jews. Penslar drove us to explore the complex roots of antisemitism and the ways in which it is similar and dissimilar to other forms of bigotry. He did not shy away from highlighting the antisemitism often present in the administrations of Arab states, military organizations, and political leaders in their consistent opposition to the state of Israel’s existence. Penslar’s focus on antisemitism as a term, as a sentiment, and as a driving historical force is one based on the facts and careful analysis of thousands of years of history. On the situation in historic Palestine, Penslar takes an approach that all scholars — especially those of history — should, one rooted in adherence to fact and a rejection of dogmatism. It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then, that Penslar is able to consider himself a Zionist, all while holding strong, thoughtful critiques of the Israeli government and its treatment of Palestinians. He is not an adherent to all-consuming ideologies, and leaves room for his views to change when presented with the right facts and a solid analysis of those facts. He considers all sides of a problem with honesty, compassion, and a genuine thirst for understanding. Such an approach is threatening to his dogmatic critics. Outside observers like hedge fund CEO Bill A. Ackman ’88took to social mediato criticize the pick, with figures like Rep. Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y. evengoing so faras to accuse Penslar of antisemitism. The reaction to Penslar’s appointment is a problem that is at once much deeper than Penslar himself, but also epitomized by the responses like Stefanik’s and Ackman’s. It’s a problem with the politicization of Harvard and our student body. Conservative politicians and activists see Harvard as synecdoche for “woke” universities, and they view our campus as a battleground for their never-ending “culture war.” Penslar is not just an excellent choice to lead the antisemitism task force — he is also the obvious choice. It seems Penslar’s critics would only be satisfied if someone wholly uncritical of Israel and Zionism was chosen in his stead. Their ideal candidate wouldn’t question Israel’s status quo, a quality which runs counter to the nature of true academics — especially those picked to task forces with the overt goal of investigation and change. Academics are supposed to be independent, critical thinkers, and it’s ridiculous that critics reject the selection of Penslar in service of a political agenda. Some critics have claimed that Penslar has downplayed antisemitism at Harvard in saying that outside forces have overblown it. It is perhaps the closest opposition gets to a valid point, but I still believe it falls short of legitimate criticism. Largely because Penslar’s is a sentiment I — along with all those I’ve talked to — share. While antisemitism is a real and rising problem on our campus — as Penslar has noted — it is nowhere near as large a problem as national media makes it seem. Contrary to what thedoxxing truckswould have you believe, we are hardly a hotbed for Hamas apologia. What has been lost in the relentless, national discussion of antisemitism on our campus is that Harvard is an actual school; it’s not just a symbol for the ostensible wokeness of present day academia. There are students who go to Harvard, and playing political games with their mental health and physical safety is dangerous. Whether or not you align with Penslar’s politics, he fundamentally understands antisemitism, and he cares deeply about his students. Stepping outside of the political theatrics of it all, it becomes clear that his genuine stake in intellectual rigor and student well-being is what truly matters, and what makes him the right choice for this task force.

crimson_2024_113,"We are organizers withHarvard Alumni for Palestine, a newly founded collective of Harvard alumni of conscience appalled by the University’s complicity in Israel’s genocide against the Palestinian people and its repression of pro-Palestine, anti-war student voices. Over the last several months, Israel has waged a catastrophic genocide against the Palestinian people of Gaza that has flouted every principle of international law. For more than 200 days, the Israeli military mercilessly slaughtered over34,000 Palestinians— more than 14,500 of whom are children;forcibly starvedanddisplaced almost two million Palestinians;destroyed every single university in Gazaand nearly all of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure; completely or partially demolished nearly all of Gaza’s hospitals; murdered hundreds of healthcare workers, over200 aid workers, and more than 100 journalists; and attempted to mask countlesscrimes against humanity, each more heinous than the next. Meanwhile, Harvard has actively been advancing a campaign against pro-Palestine activists. Harvard’s leadership silenced pro-Palestine voices on campus, callously disregarded the rights and wellbeing of its students, andsuspended the Palestine Solidarity Committeethrough disparate enforcement of obscure University policies — a move immediatelydenounced by the Massachusetts ACLU. Harvard administrators failed to defend students who were subject to adangerous smear campaignand receiveddeath threatsfor peacefully protesting an ongoing genocide. Now, Harvard itself is targeting these same students. On May 6, the Harvard alumni community received an email from interim President Alan M. Garber ’76, describing the student encampment for Gaza in Harvard Yard as a disruption and threatening students protesting Israel’s atrocities withimmediate involuntary leave– one of the largest acts of repression against students in Harvard’s history. Not one reference was made to the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people. Given Harvard’s mission to inspire its community members to“strive toward a more just, fair, and promising world,”students daring to protest in defense of Palestinian right to life should be celebrated, not oppressed. The University’s repression of pro-Palestine activists cannot mask its complicity in Israeli apartheid, occupation, and genocide. Despite over two decades of student activism demanding divestment and a ruling by theInternational Court of Justicethat characterizes Israel’s actions in Gaza as a plausible genocide, the Harvard Management Company, which oversees Harvard’s nearly $51 billion endowment, refuses to disclose information about the scale or nature of its investments in Israel today. The University’s lack of transparency and McCarthyist response to pro-Palestine student activism begs the question: What is Harvard hiding? In the face of these egregious acts, and inspired by the bravery and moral clarity of the students who have launched Harvard’s Liberated Zone encampment, we are founding Harvard Alumni for Palestine, part of the nationalAlumni for Justice in Palestinecoalition. We are a collective of Harvard alumni actively committed to the cause of Palestinian liberation and guided by a mission to hold our institution accountable for its complicity in Israel’s ongoing genocide as well as its failure to protect its students. We champion the students who are bravely taking the weight of the U.S. war machine on their shoulders and challenging the imperial violence in which our institution is complicit. We endorse the nonviolent movement forBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions. We reject the premise that student protesters are disrupting the functioning of the University — the University itself is doing so by refusing to meet their reasonable demands. In Harvard College’sown words, “alumni are a vital source of connection and philanthropy that help Harvard achieve its mission to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” Our support — financial and otherwise — seeks to embrace this mission, but our faith in our alma mater has been jeopardized. The past seven months have demonstrated the need for a strong and unified alumni voice of conscience, advocating for the rights and freedoms of Palestinians on campus and abroad. We will therefore withhold all our donations and support to Harvard University and withdraw our consent to display our names, likenesses, and work on Harvard websites, promotional materials, and donor appeals. We will continue denying our support until our core demands are met: honoring the demands of Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine’s Liberated Zone, including disclosing investments, divesting from Israel, and dropping charges against students; providing amnesty to students partaking in protests for a free Palestine; and upholding free speech on campus by reinstating the Harvard PSC. From the Vietnam War to South African apartheid, history has demonstrated that the legacy of student activism is one of truth and liberation — the current movement against Israeli occupation and genocide is no different. As alumni watching the Harvard Liberated Zone unfold, we beseech Harvard to refrain from replicating the brutal crackdowns we have seen on other college campuses, which we see as an extension of the same colonial and imperial violence practiced in Palestine. We attended Harvard because of its touted commitment to academic freedom, equality, and justice. Today, we implore Harvard administrators to join us in fulfilling that mission, and we will withhold our financial support for the University until it does so. Harvard administration, history is watching. We are too. Nizar H. Farsakh is a lecturer on international affairs at George Washington University. Hossam M. Nasr ’21 is a former co-president of the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee and co-founder of Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine. Rosa Vazques ’20 is a former co-lead for the Harvard Ethnic Studies Movement and the Protect Undocumented Students Harvard Initiative. All three are co-organizers of Harvard Alumni for Palestine."
stanforddaily_2024_27,"Stanford is on the hunt for a president. We’re not the only ones: Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania are also scrambling to find a new leader to replace a recently ousted president. We certainly do not envy the presidential search committee in this difficult task. University officials and their decision-making are subject to more external forces than ever, from alumni to donors to the broader public unleashing their critiques through the Internet. Specifically, the recent resignation of Harvard’s first Black president, Claudine Gay, has raised questions surrounding the role of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI in the search for presidential candidates. But to examine these questions, we must first define what qualifies somebody to be the president of Stanford University. What is the purpose of a university president? To be frank, we think many Stanford students just want an uncontroversial president who will give both a decent convocation and commencement speech. However, the role of university president is critical in many additional aspects of university life, and unique from other University leadership roles. In brief, Stanford’s president representsour valuesand excellence as an institution. This person must inspire confidence in Stanford’s potential to maintain relationships with, and solicit generous donations from, organizations, alumni and donors. In addition, they should work to advance the long-term progress and knowledge-seeking mission of our university. Conversely, some factors that mayappearto be within the purview of the university president are in fact the responsibility of other administrators. The Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and other administrators directly manage student life, and faculty and graduate students largely shape the education and research environment. What qualifies our president? To that end, there are only a few strictly necessary qualifications for our future president: What do we want from a president? To return to the discourse around DEI, being uncontroversial doesnotmean that the president must continue Stanford’s trend of being a white man, simply out of concern that a “minority” (including a woman president would create discontent among anti-DEIadvocates. Of course anyone’s identity shapes their life experience, and therefore how they develop as a leader. But while a candidate’s leadership skills and qualities may be rooted in their personal background, these qualities can and should be evaluated independently from the candidate’s immutable characteristics. The immutable characteristics — gender, race, sexuality among others — of a president or candidate are often overstated by both the proponents and detractors of DEI. For example, when President Joe Biden stated during his campaign that he would nominate a Black woman for the Supreme Court if given the opportunity, his words stirred up debate about the approach of deciding certain desirable immutable traits before officially beginning the selection process for an influential position. People on Biden’s shortlist and eventual Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson were unfairly and harshly judged as underqualified (through no fault of their own , and discourse around the nomination became clouded. While Stanford has not made any similar public commitments, the treatment of Justice Brown Jackson exemplifies the trend wherein candidates’ significant, laudable achievements are overshadowed by discussions about identity. In reality, there are dozens of distinguished academics from minority backgrounds who are well-qualified by their merit alone to lead Stanford, just as there are dozens from non-minority backgrounds. We are asking for the presidential candidate pool to be broad, and for the bar — outlined by the three criteria above — to be high and immovable. While we don’t believe that the future president of Stanford ought to “belong to” or “represent” any certain groups, we also believe that it is important regardless of the president’s own identity that our university environment champions adiverse student body. A commitment to a diverse campus is independent of any political movements; it is simply necessary given the realities of our highly diverse country and globalized world economy. While representation is meaningful for many, it is not possible to make all stakeholders happy, and we should not place such a heavy burden on the Presidential Search Committee. If some Stanford community members are hoping that the Committee will choose a President who will make everyone’s identity feel represented, they may be holding the Committee to an impossibly high standard. Amid the noise Stanford University’s Presidential Selection Process must pursue a balanced, nuanced approach when tackling the multidimensionality of hiring a new President. At a school whose motto is “The Wind of Freedom Blows,” the freedom of an individual, or Presidential candidate to express or maintain their cultural identity, ought not to waiver in the face ofexternal pressure. When a group of people have the opportunity to appoint someone to a powerful position, we believe that it is unwise to definitively settle on a narrow list of immutable characteristics as criteria before the selection process even begins in earnest. This cuts both ways across the current political foment over DEI. Amid so much noise, the presidential search committee ought to focus on what is most important: our university principles of academic excellence and integrity, and a record of great leadership. A misplaced emphasis on the demographics of our president can distract from these core qualities and the objective evaluation of candidates’ strengths and weaknesses. Only when we resist thefringevoices, who would boil this complex decision down to discrimination one way or another, can we truly make the best decision for Stanford.

The results revealed that the Venezuelan opposition party led by Edmundo Gonzalez and Maria Corina Machado collected more than 70% of the votes in favor.

As a result, there was a massive reaction of the people defending their votes in the street. Meanwhile, the regime issending the armed and collective forcesto the streets to repress, harm, or murder anyone who defends their rights. After 25 years under a dictatorship, Venezuelans are fighting more than ever to get their freedom. It is our job to say something. But in this moment of profound hopelessness, when hot tears blur our disbelieving eyes, the only words that seem appropriate should be directed to the evil author of this suffering. Your blatant corruption, disregard for democracy, and authoritarian rule have plunged our beloved country into unprecedented despair. Monster! Killer! Beast! Isn t the suffering you ve inflicted upon the Venezuelan people enough? How many more families will be torn apart until you stop your vile attacks on our dignity? How many more lives must be lost before you decide to relinquish your grip on power? What was it you wanted us to believe after you proclaimed yourself the winner of Sunday’s election? Whatever it was, know that you failed. Did you want to make us fear? We stand united and defiant, more determined than ever to fight for justice. Did you really expect us to accept your fraudulent results? You just fueled our desire for change. Do you feel strong in your ill-gotten power? You are about to learn. Let us tell you about who we are. We are a group of students who left Venezuela in search of a future that was stolen from us. Our families were targeted by relentless oppression and persecution, forcing us to flee for our safety. We are also young and ambitious. Our small group is composed of future engineers, doctors, lawyers… We are lucky, too, spoiled by the fortune of having the resources to leave, a privilege not shared by many of our friends, who sadly remain trapped. And we all suffer from the injustices occurring in our homeland. We never truly left; we simply live farther away. Some people––you, perhaps––think that all of this makes us weak. Know that you are wrong. We are not weak. In fact, we are strong in ways that you could not imagine. Downhearted Yes, we are in despair. We are in mourning and reeling from the shock from the fraudulent election results. We are still grappling with the blatant insult of your so-called victory. Our hearts ache for the families who have lost loved ones to violence during peaceful protests. Our anger burns for the hundreds imprisoned and tortured for their political beliefs. Your legacy will be one of shame and failure. You have inflicted upon our nation suffering and bloodshed unlike any we have endured before. But there is a stark difference between hurting us and making us surrender. We are tired. Our folks will not endure any more humiliation. The voices of millions demanding justice and transparency cannot be silenced. It occurs to us that you expected to maintain control without significant challenge. But we know our people, as we believe you do not. The Venezuelan people are resolute and will not relent until their voices are heard and their will is respected. Your attempts to subvert democracy will only fuel our determination to fight for justice and reclaim our rightful future. To The Resilient People of Venezuela: Gloria al Bravo Pueblo! Your courage and commitment to fighting for democracy amidst overwhelming adversity inspire us all. We, the Venezuelan students at MIT, stand with you in the struggle to reclaim our rights and restore justice to our homeland. Your bravery does not go unnoticed, and we are deeply moved by your determination. To students and individuals across institutions everywhere We call on you to join us in spreading awareness and shedding light on the dire situation unfolding in Venezuela. By amplifying our voices and bringing global attention to their plight, we can help support their fight for freedom and hold the regime accountable. It is a plea of humanity to the world. FUERZA VENEZUELA! --- Javier Gil Undergraduate Student 2026 | Chemical and Biological Engineering Javier arrived in the United States in 2018 in search of a better future after fleeing Venezuela due to the dictatorship. He is currently studying chemical-biological engineering, driven by a passion for scientific innovation.

ubyssey_2024_14,"March 16, 2024 Written byMarie Erikson Marie Erikson (she/her is a third-year student in the philosophy honours program and a Staff Writer at The Ubyssey. In a representative democracy, it is often impossible to vote in a way that entirely matches our views. Be it a federal or AMS election, voting for a candidate often means accepting that some of their positions contradict our own. Candidates are people, each with a myriad of opinions, and we can not expect one person out of a few to have an identical worldview. Many of us, however, still vote on the grounds that voting for the best but imperfect candidate is better than staying silent. Enter referendums: a chance to provide a clear answer to a specific issue. Unlike voting for representatives, referenda allow us to be precise in our voting, ideally leading to a decision that more accurately reflects the voices of the people. But one proposed AMS referendum this year nearly stole our clear voices. Referendum question 2, drafted by anonymous organizers and promoted by the resource group UBC Social Justice Centre, among other groups, would have affected AMS investments and Food Bank access and called for UBC to take a particular stance on the Israel-Palestine war. Demands to support Palestine would also have been sent to UBC from its student body. AMS Councilrejected the referendumduring its February 28 meeting. Of course, there is nothing wrong with the student body proposing and voting on topics relevant to UBC and the AMS. In my view, the problem lies in that this referendum unnecessarily forced students into an all-or-nothing position. A student, for example, may want the AMS to separate from RBC but keep their food bank’s focus on students, or vice versa. Either combination of views makes sense considering that expanding food bank access would require more financial investment into the program, an additional difficult process was the AMS to reject a major sponsorship while running a deficit. The referendum, however, would have driven that student to abandon one of their goals for the AMS or accept contradictory courses of action. Students would not only have been forced to choose between their views on RBC, the AMS Food Bank, and Palestine; the referendum’s actions regarding Palestine were too broad to expect an individual to come close to fully agreeing or disagreeing. It is possible to want Jewish students to have a dedicated space on campus through Hillel BC while opposing the Israeli military’s actions. It is further possible to hold these views and want UBC to provide resources for affected groups while disliking how the referendum requires a boycott of unspecified organizations. It’s also possible to support protecting free speech but disagree that UBC should promote a particular view on the war. Even if provisions regarding RBC and the AMS Food Bank were excluded from this referendum, students on the spectrum between extreme Israeli or Palestinian support wouldn’t have been accurately represented by their votes. None of this is to say that past referenda were perfect examples of breadth versus specificity. AMS bylaw changes have been decided through one referendum in the pasttwoyears, and a 2022 fee reduction referendum also included a change to require that all opt-outs be digital. Conversely, the AMS Council wasrightfully criticizedfor separating gender-affirming care from its referendum on health insurance fee changes. But, the previous broad referenda did not egregiously combine distinct and controversial issues into a yes or no question. Our broader society has enough instances of harshly pushing people onto one ideological side or another. Even if the AMS Council rejected this referendum for separate reasons, we should be grateful that we are not unnecessarily compelled to abandon our values. While some may suggest that we add a bylaw restricting such referenda, I doubt that it would be possible to capture the nuance of the problem. Referenda with a few bylaw amendments tend to bewidelysupported, and it would be easier to encourage alreadyhesitant studentsto vote on a briefer set of options. Thus, restricting referenda to a single item would unnecessarily make the process less efficient. It is then on us as students and AMS members to oppose omnibus referenda and support the union’s democratic process. The best way is to only propose clear referenda on distinct issues. When these anti-democratic proposals come forward again, we should not sign petitions or vote for such referenda, no matter how much we support their ideas. Better still, we should propose separate referenda for issues raised in omnibus proposals. Individuals shouldn’t have to think about enforcing the rules of democracy in student elections. But like with government elections, only supporting respectful and democratic initiatives will demonstrate that rule-breakers can’t succeed in our system. This is an opinion article.

state_press_2024_6,"If it doesn t solve the problem better, enhance the outcome better, help the student better, we re not going to do it. As artificial intelligence spreads to new fields, not all of them are quite ready to embrace it. They need more time for security measures to be implemented, comprehensive ethical guidelines to be developed and regulatory frameworks to be put in place. On Feb. 1, following their partnership with OpenAI, ASU began accepting proposals for potential applications of the program. One such proposal showcased in theirInnovation Challengeupdate is intended for theCollege of Health Solutions, called BehavioralSim. The initiative s goal with AI is to simulate counseling scenarios for students to practice their skills on, including person-centered techniques and practical skills. This raises serious questions about replacing human teachers and their professional experience with AI. While utilizing this tool or similar AI bots, it s important to acknowledge the inherent limitations of such technology. They have a lot of flaws,ASU President Michael Crowsaid in a meeting with The State Press. I ve asked them really complicated social questions or cultural questions that I had one of them lying to me, you know, along the way. Despite its ability to offer guidance and information, an AI bot cannot fully replace the expertise and nuanced understanding provided by human counselors. In times of heightened stress or when faced with psychologically intense questions, the efficacy of AI may be questionable. Andy Woochan Kwon is a Licensed Associate Counselor and graduate of the Masters of Counseling program at ASU. A lot of your prognosis in counseling as a patient is dependent on the relationship that you formed with your therapist, Kwon said. I believe the research shows us about (25 % of that prognosis can be attributed to the relationship that you have with the therapist. The complexities of human emotions and experiences often require the empathetic support and personalized approach that only a trained counselor can offer. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of counseling necessitates the ability to adapt and respond in real time, a capability that may be lacking in AI-driven interactions. AI is a great tool, but it s not yet a replacement for how complex humans can be, Kwon said. Additionally, it s essential to recognize that AI, like humans, possesses biases and limitations. These biases may inadvertently influence the responses provided by AI bots, potentially impacting the quality and accuracy of the information offered. In situations requiring sensitivity and nuanced understanding, the reliance solely on AI may fall short of meeting the diverse needs of individuals seeking mental health guidance. Until the risk of bias and false information is proven to be minimally impactful and mechanisms are in place to verify the diagnoses that AI replicates, it should not utilized in the mental health field. Protecting patient privacy and ensuring data security are critical considerations in the integration of AI into counseling. However, an ethical dilemma arises when attempting to utilize patient data to enhance AI models without compromising confidentiality. The ethical code about confidentiality is there to ensure that clients feel safe in the therapy setting, Kwon said. Currently, ASU s proposal guidelines state that ChatGPT Enterprise, the AI engine behind these projects, is not approved for FERPA-protected or other sensitive data. This creates a paradox, where in order to improve itself, the BehavioralSim must access data it is currently not secure enough for. Crow was asked in a meeting with The State Press about how the success of OpenAI partnership programs, such as BehavioralSim, will be evaluated. If it doesn t solve the problem better, enhance the outcome better, help the student better, we re not going to do it, Crow said in the meeting. So if it doesn t have the ability to be of any value at all, then it s not going to be doing so. While this approach might be suitable for other fields, the consequences of mishandling mental health are too serious to risk. Is the mental health of students worth being an experiment for AI? Navigating the complex terrain between data-driven insights and high ethical standards is essential for fostering trust and confidence in the use of AI technology in mental health and beyond. AI has not proven that it can hold up to the standards that are required for mental healthcare, and so it should be prohibited until it is improved.

This response was signed by several senior faculty members of the Department of Linguistics in response to an ongoing dispute between DeGraff and the Department of Linguistics regarding a proposed Fall 2024 seminar that touches upon the Israel-Palestine conflict. We write as senior members of the Linguistics faculty in response to comments of a personal nature that appeared in four paragraphs of a recent (June 13 Guest Columnby Prof. Michel DeGraff of our department. We want to express our strongest possible support of our colleague and department head Prof. Danny Fox, who was attacked in this column. Prof. DeGraff finds himself at odds with a negative decision of his department concerning a proposed Fall seminar entitled Language and linguistics for decolonization and liberation and for peace and community-building from the river to the sea in Palestine and Israel to the mountaintops of Haiti and beyond.” We believe that his account of events does not accurately characterize the process leading to this decision. Although we do not believe that this is an appropriate venue to discuss the details, we do think it is important to clarify that the decision concerning the proposed seminar has been the result of a course approval process involving a proposal, a committee, and discussion by the department as a whole.

stanforddaily_2024_31,"An elected group of my peers at the Stanford Graduate School of Business recently rejected our proposal to form a defense technology club. The rationalization sent to all denied clubs included scripted justifications of “not addressing an underserved need” nor having enough “potential contribution” to enhancing the school’s culture. To be clear, I’m confident these students were not ideologically fighting against the presence of national defense on campus. Rather, their decision was based on a bureaucratic priority ranking under fixed resources. Because Stanford University restricts external financial sponsorship, club funding is generated through default “student activities”feesalongside tuition. New clubs either dilute the fixed funding-pool and lower all club budgets (not ideal , or Stanford raises student fees to maintain funding (also not ideal . Under this fixed constraint, my MBA peers were stewarding limited resources to best serve our community. A defense technology club was simply not ranked above the cutline as a prioritized, independent organization. However, our peers did vote to approve an official Stanford MBA Pickleball Club. To me, this event serves as a microcosm of a broader tragedy that threatens our future national security. I firmly believe the students who voted against our proposal are not naive individuals at an elite, out-of-touch institution against defense; rather, my peers arebrilliantindividuals who simply do not feel urgency toward this area. The tragedy here isn’t “woke” resistance — it’s apathy. And, I argue that dismissal is equally as dangerous to our country’s future. First, dismissing defense technology flies in the face of local history. Silicon Valley wasbuilton a relationship with national security innovations. Many local inventions — microwaves, radar, transistors, circuitry, GPS and the internet — all originated from government grants targeting explicit military applications. Frederick Terman (popularly considered the father of Silicon Valley spent his decade as University provost (1955-1965 purposelyscalingour STEM departments to securemorefunding from the Department of Defense. A relationship with the Pentagon runs in our school’s DNA: Defense technology ultimatelyenabledStanford to become the powerhouse we enjoy as lucky students today. However, I am not solely focusing on the past to justify the formation of an independent defense tech club. I also want to highlight the urgency surrounding our current, critical moment in history. Amid the first major land war in Europe since 1945, conflictcascadingacross the Middle East beyond Gaza,risingtensions from a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan and democracydecliningacross the globe, Stanford students are graduating into this “decisive decade” with global uncertainties set to immediately shape our nation’s future. In this consequential moment, our country’s defense leadershipagreesthat innovation is a vital step toward securing the nation’s future. However, most discussions automatically equate the concept of “defense innovation” with technological advancements, which I believe is incorrectly short-sighted. Any such consequential advancement in technology is veritably built on the hard work of individuals. Put simply, pushing the limit requires brilliance. Therefore, I argue that true defense innovation must first focus on capturing that foundation of human capital — attracting outstanding, young talent toward careers supporting our national interest. At a campus where we glorify occupations in industries like technology, finance and consulting, I believe highlighting defense technology is an opportunity to redirect some of Stanford’s brilliance. This was the original motivation of the defense technology club — to promote alignment between our student population’s superb capabilities with careers supporting public service and/or national security. If we can get one student to consider a career in defense technology instead of dedicating their exceptional talent toward increasing advertising click rates, that is a win. We are pushing forward to build a movement here on campus advocating for defense technology. If you want to be involved with our “club,” pleasereach out— we would love to expand the community and show you opportunities that have real impact in securing our nation’s future.

crimson_2024_14,"I can think of many words to describe former University President Claudine Gay’s tenure, but the three that come most readily to mind are Thomas Hobbes’s immortal triplet: “nasty, brutish, and short.” If I could pick a fourth, I would have little trouble: unfair. While Gay’s departure was partially prompted by plagiarism allegations, it was fierce criticism of her posture towards antisemitism that overwhelmingly fueled the calls for her resignation. As a Jewish student at Harvard, I believe the issue of antisemitism on our campus — and Gay’s purported failure to properly address it — has been criminally exaggerated. Oct. 7 produced a well-documented and concerning increase in antisemitic crimes nationwide. Concurrently, the Harvard administration came under tremendous scrutiny for its ostensibly inadequate response to Hamas’s terrorist attacks, namely its failure to condemn student groups — particularly the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee — for blaming the Hamas attacks on Israel. Somehow, these two stories seem to have mixed in our collective consciousness, creating the impression that the University’s inaction was representative of the national spike in antisemitism. This is untrue, and Gay unfairly bore the blame. There is a narrative — if not produced, then intentionally fostered, by certain organizations on our campus — that Jewish students have been living in terror since Oct. 7. In a Nov. 30 email responding to a campus-wide protest that involved use of the controversial slogan “from the river to the sea,” Harvard Hillel wrote that “students were terrified by this protest and the violence it endorsed,” with fear of such protests causing “Jewish and Israeli students to avoid class, University events, and dining halls.” Institutions like Hillel have positioned themselves as authoritative spokespeople for Jews, but their bordering-on-blind commitment to Israel canalienate as many Jewish students as it attracts, myself included. There is an assumption that non-Zionist Jews constitute a small minority of Jewish Americans, butsurvey datareveals significant diversity in Jewish American attitudes toward Israel, with ambivalence greatestamong the young JewsHillel ironically claims to represent. Many — I would wager most — of the terrified Jewish students Hillel speaks on behalf of have self-selected into its community because they identify with its staunch position on Israel. As a result, Hillel speaks for some Jews, but certainly not all or even most. Hillel abuses its mandate by speaking about antisemitism in absolutes, misleading the many outsiders who rely on it to understand Jewish students. With this unquestioned authority, these institutions perform a sleight-of-hand, insisting that phrases like “from the river to the sea” amount to “calls for genocide and anti-Jewish violence,” when in reality many who use it do so as a call for a binational state in the region rather than for ethnic cleansing. While I wholeheartedly acknowledge that some Jewish students genuinely view such chants as antisemitic, this perception does not make it so. It is in fact certain supporters of Israel — not the activists who chant this phrase — that render it antisemitic. Nonetheless, the mischaracterization of Harvard’s campus politics as a microcosm of the nationwide rise in antisemitism prompted Gay’s now-infamous congressional hearing. While Gay condemned antisemitism at multiple points during her testimony, only her answer to a factual question from Rep. Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y. , on whether calls for the genocide of Jews violate Harvard’s code of conduct went viral. The answer to that question is, as she responded, context-dependent; even very objectionable speech often may not constitute the targeted and specific harassment that Harvard would discipline. To answer otherwise could well have been perjury. Despite her creation of a task force on antisemitism, politicians, organizations, and donors took Gay’s answer as confirmation of her lack of commitment to defending Jewish students’ wellbeing. In its response to the hearing, Hillel wrote that “President Gay’s failure to properly condemn this speech calls into question her ability to protect Jewish students on Harvard’s campus.” A superficially persuasive but extraordinarily fallacious conclusion, again legitimized, if only inadvertently, by Hillel’s support, entered the national discourse: that Gay not merely failed to properly understand antisemitism, but had no intention of fighting even a manifestation thereof — the ‘genocide’ called for by Palestinian advocacy groups — so obvious she could not plead ignorance of it. This development threatened to worsen the mass flight of donors from the school, over 1,600 of whom have threatened to withdraw their contributions, including billionaire Bill A. Ackman ’88, who claimed Gay’s response to the Israel-Hamas war lost Harvard over one billion dollars. And so here we are. Gay has resigned. The plagiarism scandal certainly played its part, but I would be shocked if the impression that Gay was weak on antisemitism and the donor trouble that followed were not determinative factors. With that in mind, I’ll end with a word to my fellow Jews: For a people that has suffered for centuries from horrible, libelous conspiracies that we control the levers of power in the world’s most important institutions, it does us no service to celebrate the impact thatmoneyand influence appear to have achieved in this case. If Gay’s resignation follows pressure from powerful figures who saw her support of Israel and protection of Jewish students as inadequate — which I fear will be how it will be remembered, regardless of whether that’s what really happened — it is not the win against antisemitism many may feel it to be. Disappointed to see President Gay go, I hope she and the Corporation made this decision for the right reasons. Otherwise, I fear antisemitismwill have been weaponizedagainst a well-meaning, reasonable, and honest university leader — someone meant to support the process of inquiry, not predetermine its conclusions — for failing to take a strong enough side on one of the most authentically controversial political issues of our time. I couldn’t think up something more cynical if I tried. Samuel P. N. Libenson, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies and Philosophy joint concentrator in Eliot House."
crimson_2024_43,"Harvard is at a crossroads of institutional identity. From an ongoing congressional investigation, to publically halted financial contributions, and to the end of the shortest presidential tenure in history, Harvard has perpetually found itself at the center of the national news cycle. Last month,The Crimson reportedthat Harvard would consider a policy of “institutional neutrality.” In the name of fostering academic freedom across different viewpoints, such a practice would bar Harvard from making publically political statements as an institution. Famously, the University of Chicago has practiced institutional neutrality since 1967. While its implementation for the sake of promoting academic freedom is understandable, UChicago has used institutional neutrality as an escape from engaging with well-backed calls from divestment on multiple occasions. When several other peer institutions — including Harvard, albeit in a limited form — announced divestment from South African apartheid in the 1980s, the University of Chicago refused to divest their holdings, citing the decision as too political. More recently, they have repeatedly resisted calls for fossil fuel divestment under the same reasoning. Harvard must not follow in UChicago’s footsteps. These last months have undoubtedly catalyzed the call for neutrality on our campus, but Harvard — and student activist criticism — is no stranger to the political spotlight. Most recently, the 2010s witnessed arobust student movementat Harvard favoring fossil fuel divestment. The peak of 2010s divestment activism at Harvard came in 2019, when hundreds of student activists stormed the field at the annual Harvard-Yale football game to pressure both universities to divest from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt. A few years later, Harvard acquiesced, announcing in 2021 that they would divest from fossil fuels. But there’s no doubt that claims of the need for “institutional neutrality” from biased sources could have challenged this important shift in Harvard’s investments. If Harvard chooses to adopt a long-term policy of institutional neutrality, which seems increasingly likely, it can not be used as an excuse to neglect intentionality and vision in its investments. In fact, in plenty of scenarios, divestment can be good for neutrality. Moving money away from industries and companies with histories of purposefully spreading disinformation for their financial benefit would not be a political statement — it would be one aligned with Harvard’s iconic motto of “veritas,” or truth. Exxon Mobil is a great example. In the 1970s they denied claims regarding the problems of global warming despite the contradictory reports they received from their company scientists. More recently, despite company knowledge of the health and economic benefits of the clean energy transition, Exxon has been accused of using their monetary influence to hinder legislation that adequately addresses the climate crisis (a charge they have denied . With even meager concern for values, why would Harvard want to invest? Divesting from industries and companies with histories of purposefully spreading disinformation for their financial benefit is not a political statement; it is, in fact, aligned with Harvard’s iconic motto of “veritas” — truth. Further, divestment, when appropriate, falls within the boundaries of “neutrality,” and promotes it, severing Harvard from controversial political ties. Remember, fossil fuel divestment is not as controversial as one may think. Despite the polarization of Congress on the issue of climate, Americans on both sides of the political aisle recognize the benefits of moving away from fossil fuel reliance. Harvard has not shied away from divesting from objectionable industries in the past. Historically, the industries from which Harvard has notably divested their endowment — Big Tobacco and the fossil fuel industry — have abused their influence to fund studies that produced results favoring their industries. (Harvard has yet to disavow research funding from fossil fuel companies, but individual Harvard schools have disavowed research funding from Big Tobacco. In fact,67 percentof American voters support universities not taking direct research investments from fossil fuel industries for the sake of producing trustworthy research. It would be a shame to let neutrality hamper a critical approach to Harvard’s divestment under a presumption of “politics” when remaining invested is an equally political position. If Harvard chooses neutrality, its leaders should pursue a policy that allows for divestment and changing decisions on where Harvard’s money flows. Jasmine N.

crimson_2024_105,"A couple of years ago, I participated in a Zoom event held by Harriett’s Bookshop, a store in Philadelphia owned by Black women, which included a segment called “Rip or Repair.” My co-panelists and I were asked to respond with one of these choices in rapid-fire reaction to a prompt. When the United States Constitution was listed, the panel split: half for ‘rip,’ half for ‘repair.’ I voted to save the founding document upon which our modern freedoms depend. I am a scholar of slavery and race relations with four prize-winning histories published on these topics. I am not naïve about the flaws of U.S. history, but I want to see this country last. I feel the same way about Harvard — a great yet imperfect university that has been trapped in a horror show this year, as, among other things, a sustained external campaign against DEI harmed individual reputations, damaged the trust that we have in each other, and clouded our ability to triage threats to our most valuable asset: the sense that we are in this together. In December, former Harvard University President Claudine Gay testified before Congress alongside MIT President Sally A. Kornbluth and former University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill. Enough ink has been spilled analyzing that congressional circus. Suffice it to say that aside from its stated goal of investigating antisemitism, the hearing emphasized a bane of the political right: Diversity, equity, and inclusion. Conservatives have long been suspicious of DEI and Critical Race Theory, which they see as linked. They worry that these approaches stifle freedom of thought, action, and expression by mandating sensitivity trainings and diversity statements, and they argue that a growing campus bureaucracy reflects a toxic orthodoxy that draws outsized resources. DEI is, in truth, a motley set of practices and ideas that I would not champion in every occurrence, and any educational program should be subject to critique and reform. But there may be a darker intent behind some of these charges. As revealed ina New York Times investigative report, some far-right activists seem to hope that crushing DEI programs will turn the societal clock back to a time when fewer women, fewer people of color, and fewer LGBTQ people could enter universities like Harvard and emerge as leaders. My own experience with DEI is that the best of these programs open opportunities to greater numbers of students; foster a sense of belonging in places that have traditionally been monolithic, exclusionary, and cold; and showcase the idea that diversity is an institutional and societal strength. They give students the chance to know one another and work together despite different backgrounds and experiences, fostering the kind of co-exposure and collaboration upon which a healthy civil society depends. DEI became a target after the congressional hearing unleashed a public frenzy against President Gay, Harvard’s first Black and second female president. Gay faced scathing criticism for her testimony before Congress (for which members of the Corporation haverecently acknowledgedthey did not adequately prepare her . Then critics ramped up anonymous plagiarism charges against Gay, carefully timed to do the most damage, according to Christopher F. Rufo, a conservative activist who first publicized the accusations. Many of the ugliest attacks on Gay were not about her comments on Capitol Hill or even about plagiarism, but rather about her construal by critics as the queen of DEI. The Harvard historianKhalil Gibran Muhammad, theHarvard Crimson Editorial Board,Claudine Gayherself, and many others, have argued that deposing Gay was an opportunistic effort to undercut the cultural authority of higher education. It was not long before the campaign against DEI at Harvard evolved, appearing to single out Black women as a group. Black female administrators and scholars were scrutinized, accused of wrongdoing on social media, and represented as symbols of a DEI-CRT regime. The media storm of negative stories about Black women had the effect of presenting diversity as a bankrupt and even corrupt value that the University should reject. “Let’s not ignore the pattern,” Rufo said on X.“This is the fourth black female CRT/DEI scholar to be accused of plagiarism at Harvard ... initial reports suggest that the grievance disciplines are rife with fraud.” Plagiarism is obviously bad, but it strains credulity and the public record to think that only or mainly Black women have made these mistakes. The “pattern” that Rufo cites is not natural. As many of us lost sleep fixating on rhetoric like Rufo’s and questioning how our community could conscience such mean-spirited barbs, former President Donald J. Trump steadily advanced toward the Republican nomination, praising autocrats and claiming that he wants to be “dictator for a day.” This escalated DEI culture war diverts time, emotion, and resources from the bigger threat: “democratic recession.” Is DEI more dangerous than dictatorship? Anyone who joins me in answering “no” has a shared purpose. In a 1975 speech given at Portland State University, Toni Morrison famously declared that the function of racism is distraction, meaning that racism operates to distract those on the receiving end from doing their vital work. Similarly, the anti-DEI crusade represents a diversion from the real threat to universities and free societies posed by vitriolic divisions. To overcome them, we must rediscover our common accord. Repairing the university means defending the spirit of our collectivity. Class of 2024, ever excellent, ever resilient: we need you to help lead the way. Tiya A.

crimson_2024_104,"After the shortest presidential search in at least 70 years, the Harvard Corporation, led by Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker, selected Claudine Gay to be Harvard’s next president. Somewhat poetically, this short search led to the shortest tenure of any Harvard president in the 400-year history of the University. In a bid to help the University do better, I ran a last-minute campaign to try to get on the ballot for the Harvard Board of Overseers, the only body with real power to check the Corporation. While I received just shy of one percent of all alums to write me in for the ballot — more than any other write-in candidate this year — it wasn’t quite enough to get on the ballot after the University substantially raised the signature threshold in 2016 However, my campaign brought me in personal contact with hundreds of alums who care deeply about the university and are worried. Indeed, 20,000 people now receive our weekly newsletter from the 1636 Forum, an organization I created to inform and organize alumni around helping the University refocus on academics over politics and improve its governance. Having run to become an Overseer and, now, having spent months engaging with alumni on the issues facing Harvard, I’ve learned much about how Harvard should proceed. As the academic year comes to a close, the Corporation turns to perhaps its highest-stakes presidential search in modern times. Given the Corporation’s insular and secretive nature, it is hard to say exactly what went wrong with the last presidential search process. As a general rule, the Corporation reaches decisions by consensus and almost never issues statements, leaving most external analysis to guesswork and hearsay. Even as it has erred seriously and repeatedly over the past year, the governing body has been unwilling to publicly explain its errors or offer any sort of apology or contrition. Still, what we know about the failed process that picked Claudine Gay raises serious concerns about the one that will pick her successor. First, we know that the process was rushed. The Corporation claimed to review 600 nominations fully in just five months — a seemingly impossible task — and if they did, they did it alone: Unlike most other universities, the Corporation does not formally use outside executive firms for their presidential searches, instead keeping the work ‘in the family.’ We know that the highlight of Pritzker’s career thus far has been her role as United States Secretary of Commerce in the Obama administration. I have spoken with many influential Harvard alums who believe she was motivated in her presidential choice primarily by a desire to use her position leading Harvard to create a second ‘Obama’ moment. Rather than focusing on choosing someone who exemplifies excellence with a remarkable ability to lead, many believe, she decided to make history by handpicking the University’s first Black president. Finally, we know now that, with the sheen stripped off the job and a host of obvious challenges ahead for the next president, it is unclear which serious, qualified academics will even want to take on the position. Here is what needs to happen to make this presidential search successful, and help the University forward. First, the Corporation needs to publicly and fully recommit itself and the University to putting academic excellence above all else — and find a president who will doggedly drive the University towards that goal. Harvard has been a durable and important institution for hundreds of years by focusing on academics, but in recent times, it has started to prioritize other ideals. In admissions and hiring, for example, it has treated representation of different communities as an end in itself rather than simply looking for excellence wherever it might be found. This ‘multi-bottom-line’ approach is simply unsustainable. Among many other problems, it places far too much power in the hands of a few leaders and at the whims of individual administrators and governors to trade goals based on their personal politics. Second, the Corporation needs to change its communications approach and bring stakeholders along rather than operating in secrecy, including by finding a president adept in modern communications. You simply cannot lead a modern complex organization in secrecy. With so many stakeholders and so much pressure, the only way to lead is with openness and transparency. When you make a mistake, you own it. You explain what went wrong and how to do better. When you have to make an unpopular or challenging decision, you communicate broadly and honestly the sides of the argument and why you are choosing, on balance, the course of action you are. When you err, you are willing to say “I am sorry’” and “I made a mistake.” Third, the Corporation needs to revise the criteria for selecting new members of their body and the Overseers to guarantee that the incentives of those in charge are aligned with success for the University and support for the right president now and in the future. In many cases, the real way you become a member of the Harvard Corporation is that you donate a lot of money — Pritzker has given nine figures — and schmooze the existing Corporation members. The way you become an Overseer is to be extremely involved as a booster of the school and administration via the Harvard Alumni Association and then campaign hard with the approximately 10 percent of alums that vote in the election. When the governors are selected this way, you frequently get people who are interested in the trappings of Harvard, and perhaps leveraging the brand for their own political and social ambitions — not those seriously committed to improving the school. You don’t get people willing to make unpopular calls or invest the time and effort to enact challenging reforms. None of these reforms will be easy, because the entire structure of Harvard’s governance is designed to reject outside feedback, and self-reform is perhaps the hardest reform of all. But for the sake of Harvard, we have to hope the Corporation will do just that. Selecting the right president is the first step; fixing Harvard’s broken governance is the next. Samuel W. Lessin ’05 lived in Kirkland House."
crimson_2024_42,"For a discipline that seeks to understand the experiences of up to one-in-four Americans and 1.3 billion people worldwide, there is a glaring lack of disability education on Harvard’s campus. This academic year, only two Harvard undergraduate courses included the word “disability” in their title. In response to the lack of course offerings, in 2022, the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Clubcalled for the creationof a disability studies department. Harvard’s lack of disability education is not unique, but its resistance to fixing it is. In 2023, UCLA offered a disability studies major for the first time, and campuses across the nation have created disabilities studies minors. Despite efforts from groups like HUDJ, these goals have yet to materialize at Harvard. To better understand the case for disability studies, we can look to the decades-long fight for ethnic studies at Harvard and beyond. Ethnic studies, like disability studies, centers the experiences of marginalized students and communities, carving out academic spaces where students so often neglected by universities can feel that they belong. But, to be clear, ethnic studies is far more than an affinity space. A discipline in its own right, ethnic studies teaches unique theoretical approaches to understanding the histories, narratives, and interactions of and between minority groups in the U.S. The same is true of disability studies. Disability studies is not just a conglomeration of courses about disability — it is also a field that offers frameworks for an interdisciplinary analysis of access, impairment, and how disability is socially and legally constructed in societies. More fundamentally, disability studies investigates how structural power impacts our bodies and our spaces. Unfortunately, many Harvard undergraduates won’t ever encounter it. The University’s reluctance to create an ethnic studies concentration — much less any kind of disability studies program, degree, department, or certification — reflects its continuing neglect of both student demands and scholarship that falls outside the Eurocentric disciplinary mainstream. Without Harvard’s support, students interested in such fields are forced to search for courses on disability strewn across disparate departments or in the various graduate schools. Oftentimes, students can’t receive credit for these courses, either because they don’t fit into their concentration or because College departments are often reluctant to offer degree credit for graduate school courses. Students have long been fighting for curriculum overhauls, beginning with the 1968-1969 strike at San Francisco State College, which led to the creation of the country’s first ethnic studies department. Three years later, the first proposal for a similar field at Harvard was put forward by Harvard History professor John Womack Jr. Despite over five decades of student and faculty organizing, only recently have tangible strides been made toward the formation of an ethnic studies concentration. Pressure from Harvard’s student organizers led to the establishment of an Ethnicity, Migration, Rights secondary in 2009 and an Ethnic Studies field within the History & Literature concentration in 2017. Disability advocates must work alongside the ethnic studies movement and increase pressure on administration to address the paucity of courses on disability and continue to push for the formation of a disability studies department. Granted, disability studies has not always lived up to its stated goals. The overrepresentation of white scholars and advocates in the disability rights movement makes this cross-disciplinary framework all the more timely and essential. Both ethnic studies and disability studies connect theory with community and knowledge with action, challenging the ways we are trained to see the world. At Harvard, it’s time we give both the attention they deserve. Andrew Q. Kang ’27, a Crimson Editorial comper, lives in Grays Hall."
stanforddaily_2024_30,"At the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford University stands as a beacon of progressive values. Many international queer students envisioned finding a utopian community — a place where the complexities of their identity would be celebrated, not just tolerated. For those who come from countries with restrictive or seemingly homophobic laws, Stanford appears as a haven, a dreamlike escape from the harsh realities back home. But the reality here is more layered and, in some ways, unexpectedly disorienting. Upon arrival at Stanford, I expected a culture of inclusivity and acceptance. However, as days turned into weeks, months and then entire quarters, I started to grapple with new challenges that have reshaped my understanding of queer spaces. Back home, despite oppressive laws and societal norms, there was a sense of solidarity and authenticity in the fight for queer acceptance — a straightforward battle against external prejudices. However, at Stanford, the struggles are more complex, especially for those of us who identify as people of color. At Stanford, fetishization and exoticization often became disturbing undercurrents in my romantic interactions. Whether through dating apps or in social spaces, I’ve noticed that aspects of my identity are often objectified, reducing the complexity of who I am to mere fantasies of my partner. More specifically, as a Black international student, my queer interactions often entail being reduced to the perceived size of my penis or being thought of as exotic. This issue is not unique to me. A queer international student I spoke to said that, “Using dating and hookup apps on campus, and then being blocked by peers after sending a face pic, is truly one of the most humbling experiences one can endure. What’s worse is that my body is racially ambiguous in a way my face is not. So, people who initially express interest in my body often block me after seeing my face.” Another student shared a sad and embarrassing experience where their date admitted to not being genuinely interested in them. The date revealed having a preference only for Asian and white men. They commented that they only came on the date with them for amusement. The fact of the matter is that Stanford is no utopia. There exist deeply entrenched problems within its queer community — all of which are rooted in “sexual racism.” Coined by Charles Herbert,sexual racismentails the exclusion, rejection and devaluation of individuals based on their race or ethnicity in romantic and sexual relationships. The queer community at Stanford is marked by implicit rules that deem certain races as more desirable than others. This establishes a racial hierarchy of attraction, where whiteness is seen as the highest echelon of attractiveness, thus making those who resemble this standard more favored. While some queer international students possess Eurocentric features that allow them to be subservient to this racial hierarchy of attraction, many of us don’t. Accordingly, fetishism and exoticism have become the prevalent means by which we are included in the queer romantic space. And if we don’t align with the stereotypes associated with our respective racial identities, we are excluded. It is no surprise then to often find queer students of color actively combating sexual racism on their dating profiles. This reality for queer students of color, domestic and international alike, not only undermines the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion that Stanford claims to strive for, it also shows the internalized racial hierarchies that challenge the very notion of unity within the Stanford queer community. Researchindicatesthat sexual desires are often influenced by larger social constructions of race, which make up the very foundation of American society. Therefore, I don’t think the sexual racism in Stanford’s queer community will end anytime soon. However, I do believe in being the change you want to see. Thus, to tackle sexual racism in Stanford’s queer community, I think that students should adopt the Kantwon Rogersapproach, which entails the following three things: I’ve reconciled with the idea that my Stanford experience is a lesson in the complexity of queer spaces. I do love the queer community here; however, I’ve come to understand that no community, no matter how seemingly progressive, is free from contradictions. Therefore, while the challenges queer international students might have faced at home were more overt, there still exist many problems that plague the queer community at Stanford. Our struggle transcends geographical and cultural boundaries, and because of this, regardless of where we are, we need to come together, stand united and strive for meaningful change. Knowing this has deepened my perspective on queer rights. It is up to us to change the way we approach each other. Let’s step up and try to make a real difference."
crimson_2024_15,"President Claudine Gay has failed.Her resignationreflects that failure. Gay held two basic obligations as the executive of Harvard: to administer over an academic institution and to speak on behalf of that institution in its interactions with the public. Revelations of plagiarism — politically motivated as they may have been — shattered her credibility as an academic and administrator. They hollowed out her authority and bellowed in the flames of media scrutiny. Her now-notorious, certainly calamitousperformance before Congressproved President Gay an incompetent public face for the university. Free speech on university campuses is vital, but her inability to defend Harvard’s values convincingly, relatably and decisively — both in and outside of Congress — was unacceptable. Perhaps there was once a time when a purely academic leader may have excelled in this position. That time was when an insular, ivy-fenced Harvard catered to the tastes of a homogenous American gentry — when students chafed under thetyranny of subpar butterand campus tumult mirrored the folly of the playground. Perhaps, in this age, a sober, smart, respected professor was enough to keep students trained on their textbooks, to keep the walls up, to keep the status quo. But Harvard has changed. Over the last century, we have evolved from a mere university into an intellectual engine with a distinct social purpose and heightened social sway. We brand ourselves as an institution with a sacred mission of “contributing through scholarship and education to a better world.” Even if President Gay had preserved her academic credibility and brokered peace on campus, the professor-president archetype is outdated. A thoughtful leader adept at coping with internal issues is insufficient. This university has squarely placed itself at the heart of American public discourse. I welcome that. The nation needs a forceful institutional voice advocating on behalf of the academic project, and elaborating that commitment in inclusive and pioneering terms. But with that stature come new responsibilities, and those new responsibilities require a new sort of leadership. To successfully maneuver Congressional hearings, partisan assaults, and media smear campaigns, a president must brandish superhuman charisma, media savvy, and oratory skill. As sympathetic as I have been toward President Gay’s very human struggles since October, I can confidently state she was no such president. She displayed neither the charm, nor the know-how, nor the PR-support infrastructure to analyze and respond to unrest on campus and across the nation. It is for these reasons that she tumbled down a rugged cliff of impersonal, uncoordinated statements and testimony into oblivion. Let her serve as a lesson. If we are to persist as an active national ideological force, to continue to embrace the image of Harvard as an institution of the nation, we must accept the burden of unparalleled public scrutiny and select a leader capable of not just bearing it, but using it. Our next president must be everything President Gay should have been but failed to be. This individual must be seasoned, connected, academically unimpeachable. Must be — akin to President Derek C. Bok — an educational visionary capable of unifying the university behind institutional goals, and of melding a potent institutional agenda with a national one. That president should be passionate and convincing, and should be able to exploit the University’s pulpit — not to apologize or react to national fervor — but to shape it. That president should buck convention. Should be remarkable and novel. Should be a spectacular amalgam of intellect and charisma armed with the media and strategy staff of any national political entity. The precedent is dead. Long live “The President.” Lorenzo Z.

state_press_2024_7,"Cities are not perfect — but when I m faced with the flaws of Phoenix, I can imagine that life there would give me a smoother transition to the real world. Growing up in Phoenix, I remember experiencing the wonder of downtown. As early as fourth grade, my elementary school class and I would take the light rail from the Encanto stop to Van Buren Street for our monthlyYMCA field trip. We opened the doors, making our way through a sea of weightlifters. After a few hours at the indoor pool, we made our way out through the cafe, towels around our necks. I saw the surrounding Downtown Phoenix campus as a grown-up extension of the city I knew, and I thought one day I could be a part of it. I admired the way my hometown had a different side to it, one that was vibrant and bustling. 20 year olds looked like businessmen through my fourth-grader eyes. They made a young area seem very grown up. A decade or so later, my major has banished me to the Tempe campus. We have everything from a renovated five-story library tower to a nine-acre recreational field you can see from an airplane. We have countless on-campus restaurants and dining options. It s a sprawling university metropolis where you can have anything you want, whenever you want it. But there s one catch — everyone here is a student. I m immersed in a so-called cool and youthful setting that is supposed to be a good thing. Being surrounded by people my own age makes the educational experience relatable and fun. Living on campus issupposedto feel like a nine-month sleepover. But as I approach my senior year, I m starting to feel suffocated by my own people. On the Tempe campus, I live and breathe amongst people my age, and worse, people almost three years younger than me. Walking to class through a parade of loud, cliquey freshmen is not for the weak. This leads me to remember my first ASU football game, almost three years ago. I was completely engulfed in sweaty undergrads wearing gold t-shirts, many of them being men studying business. They screamed and chanted every time our team scored as I watched in awe, completely unaware of what was going on. It was a culture shock for an arts high school transplant. Everything about that experience screamed Tempe Campus — the overwhelming amount of pride all students had was expressed boldly through the fireworks, Sparky running freely on the field, and the slightly obnoxious group of random freshmen I was with. During a moment of mental silence, I began to realize how formulated my college life was. I lived in this tiny bubble of people my age who had the common goal of going to school. In this bubble, we had our own financial systems, our own restaurants, and, as my surroundings suggested, our own sports team. It was like a fake fairy tale, and lying outside was a very real world filled with problems that were bigger than crappy dining hall food and hangovers. It felt inauthentic. Flash forward to this year, when the State Press has made downtown Phoenix my second home. The commute is about 50 minutes using the light rail, but I still haven t gotten sick of it. When I enter the Downtown Phoenix campus, I see the part of Phoenix that feels the most like a city. I see grad students, babies and dogs, and families going for a stroll. The students on the campus blend in with the city landscape. The real world isn t pretty. Maybe that’s why a lot of students enjoy the security that ASU s Tempe campus brings. But others, including myself, feel a sense of freedom the moment we arrive at Central Avenue and Polk Street and see an elderly man pushing his walker down the sidewalk. With that said, the Downtown Phoenix campus is far from perfect. There are two places to get coffee on a good day, and the only library they have is in a basement with unreliable Wi-Fi. But the beauty of downtown is that you can go over toBurton Barr Library, which perfectly captures the essence of life in a city. Cities are not perfect — but when I m faced with the flaws of Phoenix, I can imagine that life there would give me a smoother transition to the real world.

thetech_mit_2024_28,"In Fall 2023, Bavaria attracted over 7.2 million visitors, solidifying its status as a dream destination. These figures set a new milestone for theMunich Wiesn, the internationally acclaimed Oktoberfest. Equally record-breaking, and a hot topic for study abroad programs, is the ascendance of Bavaria s Technical University of Munich (TUM . For several years, TUM has been heralded as Germany s leading university,consistently securing top spots in the Shanghai Ranking, QS, and THE, with its graduates being ranked 13th worldwide in employer esteem.DespiteGermany s innovation economy having a hard time, TUM students have consistently produced successful high-growth startups, prompting a question: What s going on in the land of Dirndl, Lederhosen, and why does it matter to MIT? Since becoming TUM s president in 2019, Thomas Hoffmann has been a lucky duck. He was named German University Manager of the Year in November 2023. Soon after, he secured funding from the Dieter Schwarz Foundation for 41 new professorships over 30 years, closely tied to the wealthiest German and his Lidl supermarket chain. What is likely the largest private investment in a public university in Germany s history is also an anomaly for its egalitarian higher education system. Anne MacLachlan of the Berkeley Center for Studies in Higher Education predicted in 2018 that the emergence of a German elite university akin to those in the United States was improbable. Yet, if TUM were a franchise, it would already be an export hit with four German spin-offs in different regions, a Singapore campus, and liaison offices in Brussels, San Francisco, Sāo Paulo, Beijing, and Mumbai. This expansion somewhat mirrors formerStanford President Gerhard Casper s 2015 call for German universities to evolve into foundation universities. TUM s latest donations mark yet another stride in an ambitious journey dating back to 1990. The initial spark was in California, whereTUM graduate student Helmut Schönenberger undertook a study comparing his alma mater with Stanford University, which led to the recommendation of creating a startup center in Munich. By 2002, with prominent support from BMW heiress Susanne Klatten, TUM foundedUnternehmerTUM(Eng: EntrepreneurTUM . Dedicated to fostering entrepreneurship, the spin-off averages 80 startups annually, launching notable scale-ups like Flix and Celonis. With a workforce of over 400, UnternehmerTUM stands as Europe s largest startup accelerator, offering comprehensive support across various growth stages, including a three-month digital product school, the XPlore go-to-market program, and an incubator for validating business models. The organization also spearheads cooperative ventures like the Digital Hub Mobility, focusing on technology scouting for SMEs, and the Circular Republic funding platform, initiated with BMW. Additionally, it runs BEFIVE, catering to construction and real estate firms, and FamilienUnternehmerTUM, which fosters innovation within the family businesses of the renowned GermanMittelstand. Today, a as a vice president on Hoffmann’s executive team, Schönenberger plays a pivotal role in redefining entrepreneurship as a crucial link bridging research and teaching, basically positioning it as the third foundational pillar. Regarding teaching, a key component of TUM s entrepreneurial formula is its in-house Management & Technology degree. This program, especially favored by international students,enjoys great popularity in the student-based CHE survey. Its interdisciplinary frameworkaligns with Stanford empirical studies recommending integrating business and engineering education to nurture entrepreneurial mindsets. Sheri Sheppard, a corresponding study author, was named a TUM Honorary Professor in 2023. Her collaboration with the TUM School of Management has previously facilitated opportunities for students, e.g., from the Center for Digital Technology and Management (CDTM , to undertake research in Silicon Valley. In partnership with Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich s oldest university, CDTM is another part of TUM s focus on entrepreneurship. This center offers a joint honors degree in technology management, similar to Boston s Cross Registration, enabling students from MIT and Harvard to take courses at multiple universities and utilize all of the regional ecosystem s resources. Comparable to FC Bayern Munich s distinct status in soccer, this study model is in a class by itself. Across Europe, TUM’s Champions League profile extended its influence by establishing a distinctive entrepreneurial ecosystem. Since 2011, UnternehmerTUM has managed its nearly $400 million venture capital fund, UVC Partners, setting a precedent in the academic world. While East Coast startup founders might reference MIT s The Engine, it s noteworthy that UVC Partners predates it by around five years. Despite The Engine s larger fund, surpassing $1 billion in 2023, both funds concentrate on seed and early-stage investments. In Munich, UVC Partners is crucial in mitigating theGerman bottleneck problem, where risk capital availability diminishes at each successive financing stage. TUM s focus on deep-tech startups, withone in ten founded at the university, pairs well with its Industry Engagement Program launched in 2023. This program partners with companies like BMW and Siemens, offering them customized access to the Academy for Innovators and Entrepreneurs for intrapreneurship training and consulting by TUM students and researchers. On the academic front, TUM s twelve Venture Labs provide specialized support, e.g., for artificial intelligence to biotechnology startups, akin to the interdisciplinary innovation initiatives fostered by organizations such as the MIT Media Lab. It is fair to say that Cambridge startups significantly gain from local ties to large companies, exemplified by the MIT Industrial Liaison Program started in 1948, alongside over 50 accelerators in the Boston area and global connections like the Cambridge Venture Café. However, unlike Silicon Valley s,Cambridge s tech scene has a relatively short history, beginning about 65 years ago with the exit of the Lever Brothers soap factory, leading to a drop in city tax revenues. In response, Mayor Edward Crane leased the empty factory spaces to the MIT Corporation, catalyzing the transformation into a technology hub to boost city finances. Today, Kendall Square hosts around 2,000 companies, including leading biotech firms and over 600 startups. While Munich s scale is different, it boasts over 450 large companies with at least 250 employees and recently expanded startup opportunities with the 118k square feetMunich Urban Co-lab, initiated by UnternehmerTUM and the city s economic development agency. Support for TUM s initiatives also comes significantly from the Bavarian state government. Starting from the upcoming term,the university will soon charge tuition fees to new non-EU students, albeit much lower than those of prestigious U.S. institutions like MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, the Ivy League, orStoxbridge in the United Kingdom. These additional funds will likely help TUM compete more closely with its Swiss counterpart, ETH Zurich, which benefits from higher public funding. Further legislative reforms to speed up hiring processes for top scholars.Highlighted by Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti, such initiatives not only enhance the academic landscape but also bolster the urban economy by generating five additional non-sector jobs for every high-tech position. At MIT, one is well-versed in legislative efforts to boost innovation ecosystems. TheRegional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP emphasizes the role of government policy, university initiatives, committed corporates, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. Munich s approach, encouraging collaboration among all key players, mirrors MIT s contribution to Greater Boston s economic growth,where, as of 2014, more than 30k startups founded by MIT graduates employed 4.6 million people and generated nearly two trillion USD, surpassing half of Germany s economy. On the one hand, replicating this success in Munich may seem exaggerated even with its GDP consistently above the national average. On the other hand, Kendall Square was not built in a day either, while TUM has clearly been proactive in unraveling the intricacies of its regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. With experience spanning over 80 regions from 30 countries since 2010, REAP understands that governments across the globe see this effort as a Rosetta Stone to translating innovative entrepreneurship into tangible economic growth. The absence of German regions from REAP may reflect the disability at which the public higher education sector forms strong ecosystem partnerships. TUM stands out as an exception. Despite its size, with over 45,000 students as of 2023, making it the largest technical university in Germany, its demonstration is that even the biggest tankers in the higher education sector can navigate swiftly. This capability suggests that robust transformation is achievable within Germany s educational landscape. Observing the similarities between the logos of TUM and TIM’s home leads to an inevitable conclusion: Against all odds, Munich is on its way to establishing Germany’s first elite university for entrepreneurs and innovators. Its blueprint is obvious. Said D. Werner is affiliate project lead at Professor Fiona Murray’s Lab for Innovation-Driven Entrepreneurship & Geopolitics. Before, he advised the Parliamentary State Secretary to the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and spent a term as Vice President of Student Affairs at Zeppelin University Friedrichshafen in Germany."
stanforddaily_2024_26,"Stanford recently faced a scandal-ridden presidentialresignation, selected a newprovostand confronted resignations in critical roles inundergraduate educationandstudent life. Throw a figurative stone at a Stanford office and it is likely you will hit one that is currently seeking or has recently sought new leadership. Across all leadership searches at Stanford, the Presidential Search Committee’sworkcomes at a uniquely difficult time. Other prestigious universities are also holding presidentialsearches, with the work morescrutinizedthan ever before. Worries about the financialbenefitsof college, the Israel-Gazaconflict, ideological culturewarsand navigatingadmissionsfollowing the end of explicit affirmative action have taken higher education by storm. Stanford is confronting a series of leadership vacancies and a broader social context that strikes at the core of its educational mission.UnlikeThe Stanford Daily’s Editorial Board, I believe the person best qualified to serve as the next Stanford president would be someone with experience centered around a strong commitment to the values of and policy initiatives that advance diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI . DEItracesback to the 1960s when a series of legislative victories pushed schools, workplaces and other institutions to prevent discrimination against protected classes, such as race, gender and age. DEI initiatives include “addressing discriminatory hiring practices, pay inequity or rectifying issues that cause poor employee retention rates among marginalized groups.” While DEI can look different across organizations, what remains constant is its efforts to go “beyond avoiding discrimination and to actively changing organizations so that they are more welcoming and more inclusive,” according to NYU professor Erica Foldy. Stanford’s very own Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in a Learning Environment (IDEAL initiative, for example, aims to represent all communities in the University’s “education and research enterprise,” ensuring a sense of belonging “regardless of one’s background, identity or affiliations” and giving everyone in the campus community “broad access to the opportunities and benefits of Stanford.” In furtherance of a vision ofacademic excellencethat recognizes the value of every community and confronts the ongoing challenges posed by historic injustices, IDEAL serves as the “north star” of the University. The right-wing zealots that want to rid education of DEI are having their way. States like Florida haveshut downtheir LGBTQ student centers andissueda review on lessons that are “based on theories that systemic racism, sexism and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States.” The absence of DEI initiatives and curriculums tells marginalized communities that they do not belong in society, deserve no dedicated resources at school or in the workplace and have stories and struggles that ought totakesecond place to the placating of white guilt in this country. It is plain as day that DEI’s critics value white comfort more than any truthful retelling of U.S. history. They portray bringing minorities into the institutions they have historically been excluded from as a harm to white people. There is a culture and policy war being waged against classroom discussions, student resources and the very ideologies that uplift society’s most marginalized people. That makes the stakes of the presidential search and Stanford’s broader leadership transition the most critical inflection point in its 133-year-long history. Stanford needs to be where DEI goes to thrive. DEI is often made out to be an existential threat to what Stanford has professed an“unwavering commitment”toward: free speech. This concept was on full display when the Stanford Law School’s (SLS then-associate dean for DEIdisruptedthe SLS-sanctioned event featuring a Trump-appointed federal appellate judge. Her disruption, after which she resigned in disgrace, caused her to become “a lightning rod for criticism of campus wokeness and suppression of free speech.” She used her University position to disregard free speech in the name of illustrating how the judge’s work“has caused harm”to marginalized communities. To undo the ways in which her actions have stained the reputation of DEI at Stanford, the University’s commitment to DEI should be viewed in ways that reflect its unyielding commitment to First Amendment principles. The core value of DEI — correcting for the ongoing impacts of historic discrimination and giving everyone the fair shot in society that they deserve — should be viewed in ways that do not degrade but instead embolden Stanford’s free speech values. After all, the Supreme Court issued what are nowinvaluable First Amendment decisionsduring the Civil Rights Movement.Garner v. Louisiana(1961 overruled the “disturbing the peace” charges levied against five African American college students for staging a sit-in at a whites-only lunch counter. The Court alsoruledin the 1963 caseEdwards v. South Carolinathat the forcible removal of peaceful protesters against segregation violated free speech rights that were being exercised in “their most pristine and classic form.” The gold standard institution for defending free speech, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE , has evenacknowledgedthe importance of those very cases in its First Amendment work. Empowering unpopular, oppressed voices in society birthed DEI during the 1960s, and it can continue to serve that kind of a purpose again at Stanford — nearly 60 years later. The profound relationship between the values of DEI and free speech should be noted by the Presidential Search Committee and whoever it chooses to next lead Stanford. The next president will need to make their decisions in accordance with the Leonard Law, which holds Stanford accountable to most of the sameFirst Amendment protectionsthat any public college in California would need to comply with. This principle would require Stanford’s next leader to take a close look at cases likeGarnerandEdwards. For Stanford and its leaders, free speech is not something that needs to be seen as contradicting efforts to uplift marginalized communities but instead empowering them. With that in mind, the search committee must not shy away from picking a president with profound experience in uplifting marginalized communities. This experience could take the form ofpromotingmedical school curriculums that significantly reduce the often fatal healthcare errors that women and minorities face on a daily basis. It could include a nuanced policy background ofcombattingthe discriminatory impacts of policies like redlining and the mark they have left on the racial wealth gap. It could involve efforts tostamp outbiased hiring practices in the tech industry. Stanford’s next president having that kind of experience would signal their own strong commitment to the values of DEI.A Stanford president displaying this kind of commitment would best position the University to take bold policy action to strengthen Stanford’s DEI initiatives. This commitment means financial support for thedepartmentalizationof Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CSRE . This commitment means written support for graduateworkers’right to guaranteed protections on the basis of “race, gender, nationality, caste or disability.” This commitment means support for theUG2 workerscurrently being harmed by Stanford’s workplace culture of “surveillance, intimidation, favoritism and discrimination.” This commitment means support forfaculty diversityso that the Stanford professoriate is more representative of thetruly global societythat the University serves.This particular momentcalls for a president that emboldens Stanford’s commitment to DEI. DEI certainly stands to strengthen the free speech and academic excellence of the University. Sebastian Strawser ‘26 is an Opinions contributor. He also writes for Humor and The Grind.

These rights should be the bare minimum for all MIT community members, and they are protected for bargaining unit members of MIT GSU under the Collective Bargaining Agreement. I raised concerns about this matter informally in February of 2024. Without any movement through that route, MIT GSU filed a formal step 1 grievance on my behalf in March. Each step of the way, my union stewards and I have clearly demonstrated the contract violations and have proposed possible solutions. Now in July, with the grievance at step 3 in the process, MIT has yet to commit to a timely solution that resolves the contract violations. I write this letter reaffirming the need for said solution, with support from other members of the trans and gender-expansive community. Unknown to many, each student and employee has a “legal sex” listed in their personal information. This field currently serves two purposes at MIT: it is used to represent one’s gender in MIT systems (such as in housing, in MIT recreation, and by academic departments and it is used as the sex listed on a MIT health insurance plan. These fields do not align for many trans and gender-expansive folks; the sex listed for health insurance purposes is different from their gender. Therefore, many of us who need health insurance through MIT, as many students and employees do, are forced by MIT to have inaccurate personal information for gender across campus—systemically misgendering us. Why should we have to make the choice between a “legal sex” that gives us health insurance or one that more accurately represents our gender? You might ask, “Why can’t you change the ‘legal sex’ to be one that represents your gender? Is that not a solution?” For trans and gender-expansive folks, it’s not that simple. Changing legal sex for health insurance has huge and complicated implications. If the sex listed on one’s health insurance policy does not match the sex listed on one’s medical record, claims cannot be processed properly. In other words, in order to functionally have health insurance, one’s health insurance sex must match the sex listed on their medical records. It can be difficult or impossible to change the sex listed on one’s medical records, even in the Boston area, so many trans and gender-expansive individuals are stuck with the sex that they already have listed. In order to have functioning health insurance at MIT, the “legal sex” field in one’s personal information must be the sex listed on their medical records. This means that we are stuck with “legal sex” as our gender marker in MIT’s systems, viewable by other MIT employees, even though it is not representative of our gender, nor did we consent to that information being used as such. I am not writing this letter because I want to. In fact, I would rather focus my energy on my research and communities I hold closely within MIT. But I feel the need to write this after months of working with MIT and their failure to come up with a clearly defined, timely solution to this urgent and important matter for the trans and gender-expansive community. Since the onset of this grievance where we have been trying to remedy this very problem, we have emphasized the need to decouple the two purposes of “legal sex” as they currently stand. Namely, allowing the option for one’s health insurance sex to be specified separately from one’s “legal sex”. We have also discussed and seen implemented much-needed improvements to sex and gender information at MIT. In addition to the previous M and F options, an X option was added for the “legal sex” field as a result of this grievance. MIT Health now also has a process to update sex and gender identity fields in one’s medical records. These changes are improvements. However, they do not fix the issue at hand: I still have to select the “legal sex” option that gives me health insurance, not the one that accurately reflects my gender. In attempting to resolve this grievance, the work of the Gender Identity Initiative (GII has been proposed as a solution. Specifically, phase 3 of the GII recently implemented gender identity and pronoun questions for students and employees in Atlas. This phase of their work also involves educating MIT employees about best practices on using sex- and gender-related data. Phase 4, as presented to us during the grievance procedure, “will address the use of gender-related information in downstream and local systems, including sharing pronouns more widely and clarifying the use of directory and legal names.” More importantly, Phase 4 does not have a clearly defined scope of “downstream and local systems” nor a timeline for implementation. It does not even have a stated intention of removing the propagation of the “legal sex” field as a “gender” data-field in downstream systems. This is, frankly, not a solution to the issue at hand. Even if it were a solution, an undefined timeline for implementation is unacceptable. The current use of “legal sex” data fails all six guiding principles of the Gender Identity Initiative,reproduced below. Inclusiveness:People deserve to count and be counted. Precision:Use precise terminology that reflects the constructs of interest. Autonomy:Respect identity and autonomy. Parsimony:Collect only necessary data. Privacy:Use data in a manner that benefits respondents and respects their privacy and confidentiality. Transparency:Share relevant information in a clear, accessible, and timely manner. Trans and gender-expansive students and employees, at best, cannot have their identities be accurately reflected in MIT’s systems of record. At worst, the current use and solutions proposed by MIT continue to forcibly out trans and gender-expansive folks to employees all across campus, from housing employees to PE instructors to academic administrators. I have been unknowingly and forcibly outed to fellow students and co-workers. Students in my residence have been unknowingly and forcibly outed as transgender to me in my role as a graduate resident advisor. We, trans and gender-expansive MIT community members, urge MIT to treat this matter with the urgency, care, and resources that it deserves. We have proposed a solution for decoupling the two purposes of “legal sex” by adding a new “health insurance sex” datafield to WebSIS for students and SAP for employees. This would simply provide the option for individuals to specify the sex listed on their health insurance policy separately from “legal sex”, which gets propagated as “gender” to downstream systems. Fortunately, we have technical precedence for this solution; the “directory name” is an optional field in the main systems of record, which if filled out, masks one’s legal name in many instances downstream. In fact, the “health insurance sex” datafield would only have to mask “legal sex” in its propagation to MIT health insurance, making it a technically simpler solution than the “directory name” option that is already implemented. Like “directory name” is an optional field, “health insurance sex” would be as well, defaulting to “legal sex” if left unfilled. This entirely optional field meets the GII guiding principles for all individuals, including trans and gender-expansive folks, while requiring no action to be taken by unaffected community members. By meeting as a community during the grievance process, we have already communicated urgency around this issue and strong support for the above-mentioned solution. We are writing, now in the last stage of the union grievance procedure, to reiterate our messages of urgency and broad support for an optional “health insurance sex” datafield to be added. We underscore that the work of the Gender Identity Initiative, while much-needed, does not provide a timely or clear path to resolving the forced misgendering that is currently required of trans and gender-expansive folks to access health insurance. At the heart of this grievance, we need a solution where everyone at MIT is able to exercise their rights to health care coverage at no cost to their right to accurate gender representation. We, as members of and allies to trans and gender-expansive communities, must stand up together to let the Institute know that we will not settle for any less. The only way we can pressure the MIT administration to put forward a real resolution to this issue is through taking collective action together now. If you would like to help in demanding the Institute to resolve these issues with the timely and urgently needed solution we propose,we urge you to sign onto our open letter here.

ubyssey_2024_15,"March 12, 2024 Written byEitan Feiger Eitan Feiger is a fourth-year history student and the Vice President and Treasurer of UBC’s Chabad Jewish Student Centre. Last November, I interviewed my grandmother for an oral history project — one I had been meaning to do for a long time — about her experience surviving the Holocaust. As the grandson of two Holocaust survivors, I can affirm the reality of intergenerational trauma. Yet, as I listened to her story, I realized she was teaching me valuable, timeless lessons from which our UBC community can apply on campus. That is why I am obligated to share her story with you — so that we avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. My grandmother was 13 years young when her parents and most of her family were taken away from her and deported, either to be shot on their way to Bergen-Belsen or exterminated in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. My grandmother, my safta (as I call her in Hebrew , was a little girl, orphaned, vulnerable and left all alone. She had every right to be bitter and resentful, to identify herself as a perpetual victim and to rightfully blame the Nazis for her suffering. But she did not. She couldneverforgive nor forget the evil perpetrated by the Nazis. However, with this in mind, she had to move on with her life. The way she redeemed tragedy was not to define herself as the victim of the past, asking “Who did this to me?,” but rather by taking responsibility for the future, asking “Given these circumstances, how can I help to put this situation right?” This was the greatest eternal lesson I have learned from my grandmother and all the Holocaust survivors I have ever met: never internalize a victim mentality. Otherwise, you will not only become consumed with hate but also enslaved to the past. As Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacksonce said, “To be free, you have to let go of hate.” My grandmother took that negative energy and elevated it toward a higher purpose: toward marrying my grandfather, toward raising a family, toward giving back to her community. Her all-encompassing identity, attitude and purpose in life has been not based on thehateof others. Rather, her identity is based on theloveof her fellow Jews, of being grateful for her heritage and everything else she had. “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent,” Eleanor Rooseveltonce said. There was one thing from my grandmother that even the Nazis could never take away: her will to be proudly Jewish. For my grandmother, the Hamas massacre that took place on October 7, 2023 triggered painful memories from the Holocaust. “Never again,” the lesson we learned from the 6 million Jews murdered in cold blood, has now become “everagain.” The amount of toxic hate I have seen on my campus (and other universities as well since October 7 has been both disheartening and overwhelming. Fromdisrespectful comments on social media poststoprovocative posters on campus demonizing the other sideto verbal and physical harassment of students, there is a small, yet vocal minority of students who create a highly flammable atmosphere on campus. At UBC, I have witnessedstudents chanting the phrase “globalize the intifada,”a term which has historically been used in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict not for “peaceful resistance,” but for terrorizing Jews with suicide bombings, shooting attacks stabbings and other means of armed violence. I have witnessed studentsblacklisting other studentsbecause they do not agree with their opinions. I have witnessed students rudely spamming hateful comments (which are now taken down on UBC’s social media page to take advantage of International Holocaust Remembrance Day to push a political message. When I hear that“hate has no place on campus,”I unfortunately continue to observe the opposite. This is also the reason why I dropped my Middle East studies minor. Every time I walked into the classroom, the negative energy was palpable. I was walking on eggshells bringing up my Jewish identity or even mentioning the word “Israel.” Every day,I had to hide my kippa under my hatso that my classmates with different viewpoints would not identify me as Jewish and publicly shame me. In short, I did not feel welcome. At a university, a safe space shouldnotbe a place where you are protected by those with whom you agree from those with whom you disagree. That is called groupthink. Rather, a safe space should be a place where youmake spacefor those whodisagreewith you so that each canlistento the other with respect. Whether or not you agree with Israeli, Jewish, Palestinian, Arab, Muslim oranyclaims, there is no justification whatsoever to scream, silence or slander others with whom you disagree. Right now, our university needs more civility and calm for all students. Yes, we must acknowledge that there are a significant amount of casualties on both sides of the conflict. Yes, we must acknowledge each other’s suffering. At the very least, we can all agree that every human life is sacred with equal dignity. While we cannot control external circumstances halfway across the world from us, wecancontrol how werespondto it. We can choose to wallow in misery and demonize the other (asking “Who did this to me?” ,orwe can take action to recognize each other s suffering and elevate it to something positive (asking “Given these circumstances, how can I help to put this situation right?” . Now, how do we do that? Opening yourself up to someone whose colour, culture, class or creed is different from yours can seem daunting. In an age of echo chambers, filtered media and narrowcasting, we all have a tendency to tune in to that which aligns only with our own viewpoint while tuning out others. However, it is precisely the peoplenot like usthat make us grow. From clubs tabling on campus to classmates sitting next to you, there are plenty of opportunities to actively seek out diverse perspectives. We need to learn how to listen for the sake oflearning, notlabelling. If one has a monopoly on the truth, then why bother listening to others? Because, as a mystical Jewish saying goes: “A full vessel cannot receive.” It is only by acquiring humility, the sense of opening ourselves up to something beyond ourselves, that we realize our own perspective is merely one finite fragment of an infinitely fractured truth. Thus, I’ve reflected on three ideas worth sharing: First, there is no justice for any person or people withoutlisteningto the other side. Second, that true peace, in our relationships with others and toward ourselves, comes as a result of active listening. And third,in the words of C.S. Lewis, “Humility is not thinking less of ourselves, but thinking of ourselves less.” Listening to the other is the first step toward recognizing the“dignity of difference.” Hate, like COVID-19, is a virus. Viruses do not distinguish between different types of people, but rather rapidly fester and grow into an infectious force that threatens us all. Historically, for example, the Nazi regime may have started with Jews, but it never ended with Jews. Nazis not only targeted Jews but also Roma, Sinti, LGBTQIA+, people with disabilities and political dissidents. Hate knows no bounds. With this in mind, I offer three practical suggestions for what each of us can do on an everyday level to bring more hope to campus. First, take a moment to unplug your AirPods or headphones. Just do it! Whether it’s while sitting on the bus or walking on campus, withdraw from your isolated world for five minutes and acknowledge someone you don’t know by saying hello with a genuine smile. Give them your full, undivided attention and start a friendly conversation. Humanizing starts withacknowledging the other. Second, take a class from a perspective you have never heard from before. I am a history major; I never considered taking an environmental history course before simply because I was not interested. But it is precisely for this reason that I am taking the course. Now, I realize how I could see my pre-existing knowledge and interests from a new, oblique angle I would have never seen otherwise. And third, follow social media accounts of people with different viewpoints from your own. Just like our earbuds, we are constantly using our phones. Every time we open Instagram or Twitter, we are training ourselves to focus on our interests and are quick to judge other accounts as not worth our time. Instead of judgment,be curiousand interact with accounts to train yourself to learn from others,notlabel them. We are first and foremost a community, of students and professors, of friends and family, of human beings with human emotions. Divided, we are more susceptible to hate. United, however, we have the potential to become force multipliers of hope over hate. Each one of us should ask ourselves: Are we taking action to further fracture our world, or heal it? If we areto heal our fractured world, we must first recognize that each and every one of us has the power and influence to turn negative energy into positive energy, just like my grandmother did. If she could continue to spread light after going through the darkest chapter in human history, how much more so can every one of us dispel the darkness of hate by becoming beacons of light in our community here at UBC. It all starts with one positive thought, one friendly compliment, one good deed. It all starts with you. This is an opinion article.

crimson_2024_112,"Protests happen, from time to time, in all societies. They are, almost by definition, messy. They often disturb and inconvenience people. They make noise, block roads, shut down buildings, and force event cancellations. Some deface or destroy property. And nearly every protest violates some existing rules. Protests thus force a choice between upholding rules and protecting freedom of expression. In authoritarian societies, the choice is simple. Governments often crack down on protest with severe punishments. They almost invariably justify these measures by appealing to the law: Rules are rules, and they must be enforced. Penalties are often vastly disproportionate to the offense (gathering without a permit, blocking traffic , but autocrats insist they are simply enforcing the law. Democratic societies handle protests differently. When forced to choose between tolerating short periods of disorder and taking action that threatens the basic rights (or lives of protesters, democratic governments usually opt for the former. They accept some degree of inconvenience and rule-breaking. Sometimes the best outcome is muddling through a period of discomfort and even distress in order to avoid greater damage to the community. Since the 1969 police crackdown that left dozens of people hospitalized, Harvard has consistently handled such protests and rule violations with restraint. This commitment to administrative restraint — a willingness to tolerate modest disruption in the name of free speech — is codified in Harvard’s Free Speech Guidelines, which state, for example, that, in the face of inconvenient protest, “hard choices regarding appropriate time, place, and manner should have a presumption favoring free speech.” This makesyesterday’s announcementthreatening mass suspensions for all students involved in the encampment in Harvard Yard all the more shocking. How have these hard choices played out in the past? We sourced The Crimson for reporting on historical protest movements and have spoken with a number of alumni about their activism as students. Here’s what we found. In April 1986, The South African Solidarity Committee erected ananti-Apartheid encampmentcalled “Shantytown” that remained in the Yard through Commencement. Dean A. Michael Spenceapologized to familiesfor the disturbance, but didn’t forcibly remove the tents. While the anti-Apartheid movement may seem uncontroversial today, it faced significant opposition at the time. “This is not civil disobedience. This is disobeying the law to create a nuisance,”said Kris W. Kobach ’88,then-President of the Republican Club. When some faculty held classes in the Yard so that protesting students could attend, the FAS Faculty Councilcalled the practicean “unacceptable” form of “coercion” for students who didn’t support the protest. We don’t know for sure what the disciplinary consequences for the Shantytown protesters were because individual disciplinary outcomes are confidential. But alumni who participated in the encampment told us they couldn’t recall anyone being disciplined beyond “suspended suspensions” — discipline without any effect. In fact, the University allowed the shanties to remain in place, saying they were an expression of free speech. In April 2001, dozens of members of the Progressive Student Labor Movementoccupied Massachusetts Hallfor weeks to demand a living wage for Harvard workers. Their action required a police presence both inside and outside the building. Staffers later testified that they were terrified by the students as they entered Massachusetts Hall waving flyers. A few days later, student protesters established a “tent city” in the Yard, which eventually grew to 100 tents. At the time, then-College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 announced he would oppose suspending the students involved. In the end, the college students involved were only handed three weeks of disciplinary probation, and four participating law studentsreceived reprimands. In 2011, hundreds of activists — including Harvard affiliates and external protesters — set up an encampment in Harvard Yard as part of the broader “Occupy” movement. The Yard wasshut down, the gates closed, IDs checked. An alum told us that those employed in campus jobs — like resident tutors — were threatened with termination. But a participant in the protest told us she never heard of any actual discipline, and reporting from the time does not mention student suspensions. In 2015, Divest Harvardorganized a week-long occupationand blockade of Massachusetts Hall and also temporarily blocked University Hall and the Alumni Association on Mt. Auburn Street, to pressure the Administration to divest from fossil fuels. Top administrators, including former University President Drew Gilpin Faust,had to relocate, and protesters refused entry to all staff located in University Hall — everyone from deans Michael D. Smith and Rakesh Khurana to custodial staff. Despite the disruption, the administration responded pragmatically. “It’s an inconvenience, but it’s not stopping us from doing what we need to do,”said Stephen Lassonde, Dean of Student Life at the time. An alum who participated in the civil disobedience told us she wasn’t aware of Harvard disciplining any of the participants, and we could find no reporting on student discipline from the time. In 2016, Harvard Law School studentsoccupied a loungein the Caspersen Student Center and renamed it “Belinda Hall” after a woman enslaved by the Royall family, whose crest was used as the Law School seal. The occupationlasted forweeks. Again, however, no public reports of disciplinary action exist, and one HLS alum who participated in that protest told us she was not aware of a single Ad Board case being filed. Although the protesters we spoke to had (at best mixed reviews of the administration’s response to their calls for change, they all agreed that the threats levied against them pale in comparison to what today’s protesters face. So what has changed? It is not a matter of “time, place, and manner.” We find no evidence that the current encampment has been any more disruptive than earlier protests. Previous protests have gone on longer. They have been more disruptive. They have employed the same methods — loud chants, controversial signs, tents — in exactly the same places. Indeed, a good case can be made that the latest generation of student protesters have been unusually restrained. And yet only today’s student protesters face a mass suspension. Such disproportionate penalties for relatively minor rule violations break sharply with more than 50 years of Harvard practice. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is an instance of “the Palestine exception”— a markedly lower tolerance for pro-Palestinian speech than for other speech. The administration’s heavy-handed response also flies directly in the face of our core mission, which is to teach our students, not throw them out of school for speaking out on a matter they consider to be of great moral importance. We may legitimately — even strongly — disagree with the protesters, but we should do so using the tools we teach them to value: discussion over threat, reasoned discourse over coercive discipline. Any other course of action will not age well. Alison Frank Johnson is a Professor of History.

wildcat_arizona_2024_5,"With celebrities being exiled from Hollywood left and right, many musicians have fallen victim to the effects of cancel culture. Artists are being canceled for various things, like resurfaced racist, homophobic and sexist tweets. However, regarding more minor incidents, has cancel culture gone too far? I recently went to the 1975 show in Phoenix, and the frontman,Matty Healy, is no stranger to controversy. He has mademultipleracist and sexist comments but still has a platform. I have loved their music since my 2014Tumblrphase. However, I have been at odds with whether I should stop listening; Healy has apologized, but he has repeatedly made questionable comments. I am conflicted. The internet and social media have definitely played a part in the advancement of cancel culture; almost everyone has access to it, and information spreads rapidly. Even if the original posts are taken down, screenshots remain on the internet forever. Sometimes, the internet correctly holds people accountable, but once people set their minds on something, it is hard to change their beliefs. Also, many people are quick to judge and won’t hear the other side of the argument. Matty Healy isn’t the only musician who has been under fire.Kanye Westhas made severalanti-semiticremarks, whichresultedin Instagram and Twitter suspending his accounts. However, he is still garnering over57 millionmonthly listeners on Spotify. He was known for pushing limits, and usually, fans praised him for it, but his recent posts have had people deciding to cancel him entirely. Don’t get me wrong, he deserves to be canceled, butGraduationis one of my most streamed albums of all time. I know of many people who still listen to him but hate what he stands for, which is what I think people should do with problematic musicians. Another musician who has been under fire isR. Kelly.When R. Kelly was found guilty of sexual exploitation of a minor, his streamsincreasedby22%, and his album sales increased by 500%. Since“Surviving R. Kelly”was released, he still profited from his streams and sales. Yes, his documentary brought light to the victims, but it also caused his streams to increase dramatically. I have never listened to his music or planned on it. Celebrities also have had their privacy breached and have been canceled for things said in the privacy of their own homes. Morgan Wallen was under fire when avideo, taken by one of his neighbors, leaked of him saying a racial slur. He then publicly apologized via hisInstagramwhile his album,Dangerous: The Double Album,brokerecords, and his salessoared.Wallen wasn’t properly canceled because he publicly apologized and his fans don’t seem to care what he does outside of making music. He shouldn’t have said it in the first place, but he should be able to have privacy inside of his home. Resurfaced tweets are also a huge part of cancel culture. In 2020,5 Seconds of Summer’sMichael Cliffordexpressed support for theBlack Lives Matter movement, and in doing so,screenshotsof past tweets surfaced. He apologized quickly and said he was not the same person as when he was younger. The question with resurfaced tweets is: do they still accurately express the artist’s feelings currently? Many people posted whatever they wanted without thinking when they were younger. People grow and learn from their mistakes. An earlier example of cancel culture is the cancellation ofThe Chicks, formally known as theDixie Chicks. In2003, one of the band memberssaidshe was“ashamed” that President George W. Bush was from Texas because they disagreed that America should have troops in Iraq. One comment tanked their career as country music stars. Their music stopped playing on country radio stations, ticket sales plummeted andLiptonpulled their endorsement. They stood by their comment and 14 years later, they released new music and embarked on a world tour. Even though canceling them hurt their reputation and sales, they stuck by their comment and didn’t change their views just because they lost followers. When anyone gets famous, they are subject to more scrutiny as their lives are seen under a microscope. Anything deemed “bad” by the public will be brought to light and be used against them. Musicians are targeted, and while some artists deserve to be canceled, some apologize and make changes that the public can see.

stanforddaily_2024_4,"Recently, I grabbed dinner at Arillaga. The special was chicken fried rice. Being pescetarian, but a big fan of fried rice, I went in for a closer look to see if any alternatives were available. Unfortunately, there was only chicken. Annoyed and disappointed, I continued my inspection of the main counter to find a beef entree, and then a lamb entree, and finally, a large bowl of plain-looking tofu at the very end of the counter. This is not uncommon at Stanford dining halls — meat is always centered on menus and given the best preparation, particularly for specials — but I think this time stood out to me because of how easily it could have been remedied: Why not simply prepare portions without chicken? In the current system, plant-based meals appear to be an afterthought, and are given much less care than meat-based options. Unfortunately, meat has much larger environmental impacts, especially beef and lamb. This includessignificant embodied emissions, with beef producing over 20 times the emissions from the same quantity of tofu (and 6-7 times those from pork, chicken, or fish . The meat industry also occupies huge amounts of space. Currently, agriculture occupies half of the planet’s habitable land, a truly staggering amount; if the world switched to fully plant-based diets, we would decrease that footprint by75%. To meet its climate commitments, Stanford will have to reduce its purchasing of meat. In fact, R&DE isalready aimingto reduce its scope 3 emissions from food purchases by 25% from a 2019 baseline by 2030. This will be done through a reduction in meat and dairy across dining halls. However, this will only result in backlash if the meat alternatives offered don’t improve. A sizable portion of campus likely already abstains from meat to some extent or another. According to statistica, as of 2023,5%of the U.S. is pescetarian,5%vegetarian and another4%is vegan. That is around 14% of the national population that does not eat meat. These numbers are likely even higher within our age group. For these groups, non-meat options should be appealing and available so Stanford can be an easy place to continue this lifestyle. People shouldn’t feel like they are missing out because of this choice. This article isn’t written for people like me, though — we’ll suffer through watery tofu if it’s the only option (though I will continue to publicly complain about it . Instead I’m writing this to encourage RD&E to support people who are on the fence, and considering a more plant-based diet. That means putting plant-based options on the main counters, right next to the meat-based entrees. It means ensuring a tasty-looking plant-based special is always available where specials are being served, so people have the choice. It means putting real effort into plant-based entrees so people are drawn to these options. The salad bar should never be the only place to get a plant-based meal. Finally, wherever possible, dining halls should avoid direct meat substitutes like chick’n and instead put forward true plant-based options. These steps are not big ones, and they don’t force people to change their diets, they simply help bring plant-based options to the same level. If people are choosing plant-based options now, when alternatives are available, then it will be much easier to gradually decrease meat. College is a time of transitioning to life in the real world and food is a key part of that. The meals people eat in college will influence what they prepare and expect later in life. By making plant-based options desirable here, Stanford has a chance to encourage students to go on in their lives making plant-based meals as well. Just one meal a week more without meat, compounded over a lifetime, is an enormous environmental win. If students know what good plant-based food tastes like, and realize it doesn’t have to all be Chick’n and Tofu, it won’t even be a sacrifice."
crimson_2024_54,"In 2003, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers revealed his vision for Harvard’s long-term growth. At the heart of his plan to propel the institution into the twenty-first century? A decades-long campus expansion into the up-and-coming Allston neighborhood just a short walk across the Charles River from Harvard Square. Today, Harvard owns 360 acres of land in Allston — about a third of the neighborhood. Two decades after Summers set the project in motion, we are finally beginning to reap the rewards of Harvard’s development. In 2021, the Science and Engineering Complex opened its doors, and just last semester, the University began construction on the Enterprise Research Campus, which will include state-of-the-art laboratories, apartments, and more. Although the expansion signifies a promising new chapter in the institution’s future, Harvard’s projects have frustrated Allston residents, who link the University’s development schemes with rapidly rising housing prices. Pundits have alsopromulgated this narrative, suggesting that Harvard has significantly contributed to the neighborhood’s rapid gentrification. But that conclusion — as appealing and logical as it may seem — is not supported by the data. That’s not to say that Allston isn’t gentrifying. Median income has more than doubled since 2011, and rents have risen dramatically, too, suggesting either that high-income earners have moved into the neighborhood or that poor residents have moved out. But can we really blame Harvard for this changing economic landscape? To answer this question, I looked at housing data provided by Zillow, a popular real-estate website. For each region in the country, Zillowcalculates an indexthat measures the value of a “typical home,” allowing for easy cross-sectional comparisons across zip codes. I used this index to measure housing values over time both in Allston and in nearby neighborhoods in the Boston metropolitan area that were unaffected by Harvard’s land grab. These other neighborhoods served as a “control group” — a benchmark against which to compare Allston’s prices. Using the data from these other neighborhoods, I created a “synthetic” Allston, which estimates what Allston’s housing values might have looked like had Harvard not announced its development in the neighborhood. The precise process for constructing this “synthetic” Allston is a bit in-the-weeds, but it is essentially a weighted average of the control neighborhoods that best replicates Allston’s housing price trajectory. The results are striking. In the above figure, the red solid line represents Allston’s real housing value over time. The blue dashed line represents the value of our “synthetic” Allston absent Harvard’s development plans. The two paths are very similar, indicating that Harvard may not actually have significantly affected housing values. In fact, the price differences between “real” Allston and “synthetic” Allston are quite negligible, too small to suggest that Harvard’s development plays a crucial effect. I looked at median income, too. With data from the United States Census Bureau, I plotted Allston’s median income over time as well as the median income of the control group over time. Here too, Allston doesn’t appear to be gentrifying any faster than nearby neighborhoods in the Boston area. At worst, Harvard’s development might be responsible for median income rising just a few thousand dollars, if anything. My analysis does presume that Harvard’s developments in Allston don’t have spillover economic effects into neighboring areas. But this assumption seems reasonable, especially considering that the control group contains over 200 zip codes from across the Boston metropolitan area. It also seems unlikely that construction in Allston would affect, say, Revere. Nevertheless, the trend is clear: Allston is gentrifying, but no more quickly than the rest of Boston. Gentrification is a painful reality for Allston, and rising living costs place huge burdens on low-income residents. As we increase our involvement in the neighborhood, Harvard must continue to build and maintain affordable housing. The city, too, should allow for more high-density developments and end restrictive zoning practices. But let’s not scapegoat Harvard for Boston’s housing crisis just because the University has big dreams for Allston.

crimson_2024_6,"This past semester, Harvard has looked foolish. After the University’sinadequate responseto antisemitism on campus, our institution’s former president facednitpicky plagiarism accusationsused strategically to further a right-wing agenda and defame Harvard and higher education as a whole. We were reminded that our academically free institution is still constrained by the interests ofpowerful alumni,donors, andeven Congress. Still, it was plagiarism that ended Gay’s tenure, and it could not have done so if our policy was specific, extensive, and unambiguous. These bad-faith attacks on our institution have exposed the vagueness of our plagiarism policies. While vague language allows plagiarism to be treated with nuance on a case-by-case basis, it evidently also increases Harvard’s vulnerability to these attacks. In order to bolster our commitment to academic integrity and fortify our academic freedom, Harvard must make serious changes to our plagiarism policies now. While Harvard has a number of resources describing the institution’s stance on plagiarism, like theHarvard University Plagiarism Policy, it does not have a definition of plagiarism applicable to every Harvard school. In lieu of such a standard, individual schools and resources — including the Medical School Student Handbook, the School of Public Health Student Handbook, and the Interim Policy and Procedures for Responding to Allegations of Research Misconduct for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — have relied on the same definition: “the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.” Even though the uniformity of this definition is reassuring, it is very short and leaves room for varying interpretations. In comparison, the University of Oxford provides an extensive, clear, andprecise definition of plagiarism, which it understands as “p resenting work or ideas from another source as your own, with or without consent of the original author, by incorporating it into your work without full acknowledgement.” The definition leaves little room for ambiguity, specifically addressing authorial permission, intent, artificial intelligence, and other forms of media like computer code, illustrations, and graphs. The page also answers frequently asked questions and provides examples of plagiarized and non-plagiarized text. The second issue with Harvard’s approach to plagiarism is that it lacks a clear policy for faculty plagiarism outside the bare-bones FAS research misconduct policy. The long history of allegations that faculty enjoy the more permissive half of a plagiarismdouble standarddemonstrates the insufficiency of this policy. In 2004, it was discovered that professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 had copied a nineteen-word sentence from another source without attribution. He did not face formal consequences. The year before, Harvard Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr. lifted six paragraphs from another professor’s work in his book “All Deliberate Speed,” which then-Law School Dean Elena Kagan deemed a “serious scholarly transgression.” While Ogletree told The Crimson that he would be disciplined, it was never disclosed whether that happened or how. By elaborating the faculty policy, Harvard can combat this seeming-double standard. To further ensure consistency — and recommit to academic integrity — the University should also adopt a strict zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism. All instances of plagiarism by students and professors — even those that lack malicious intent — should receive meaningful retribution. This policy should not, however, be applied retroactively. While plagiarism has always been intensely discouraged, it is unfair to uphold past work to a newly precise and rigid standard that did not previously exist. The flexibility afforded by unclear policies is not worth leaving Harvard vulnerable to attacks of the kind that brought down Gay. While I wish grace could always be given to individuals who did not commit plagiarism with malicious intent, this past winter has shown that this is a dangerous game. So, Harvard, take initiative. Learn from our disastrous fall semester. Reaffirm academic integrity and protect academic freedom now. Calvin D. Alexander, Jr. ’27, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Wigglesworth Hall."
rice_thresher_2024_25,"ByNathan Horton1/30/24 10:17pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Student discourse in the aftermath of Night of Decadence has frequently taken a defeatist character. A muted “I guess that’s what we get” has risen in response to the cancellation of publics, without any form of organized protest. This passivity in the face of blatant paternalism ignores a major systemic issue: the loss of student autonomy in maintaining traditions. NOD is not new, and neither are the problems that led to last year’s iteration being shut down. At NOD 2012, or “NOD-gate,” there were 32 students cared for by Rice EMS and 10 alcohol-related transports by ambulance to local hospitals, eclipsing the over two dozen sent to REMS and seven transported at this past year’siteration. The 2012 story gained traction in local media, but those outlets failed to account for the fact that the transports “occurred nearly universally out of anabundance of caution,” evidenced in part by the fact that all 10 who were hospitalizedwere released early in the morning. While I am not certain if that abundance of caution was the case at this year’s iteration, the reason given in Dean Bridget Gorman’s message to undergraduates implies a similar strain on caregiving resources caused by the quantity of intoxicated students, not the severity of individual cases. “NOD-gate” in 2012 sparked the imposition of a new round of alcohol restrictions the following spring, but of a much less drastic nature than those imposed this year with the cancelation of several publics. A key reason for this was then-Dean of Undergraduates John Hutchinson’s focus on treating Rice students like adults,emphasizing individual responsibility. Such reasoning appears dead today. Further, with every imposition upon students and residential colleges by administration, I fear that Rice will lose a piece of its unique culture. As is required by Texas law, the Undergraduate Alcohol Policy bans the consumption of alcohol for any student under the age of 21. This simple fact lies at the heart of why the residential college system has been so important to Rice’s unique culture. Any sphere which Rice University Police Department or the administration touch must enforce this rule. Publics such as NOD which used to be run entirely by students are now forced to spend massive chunks of their budget on security, the very presence of which ironically has an adverse effect on student safety. The presence of RUPD at, inside and around publics means that there cannot be any drinking on the premises, giving students the option to either not drink or to pre-game. It is this context that places publics today in such a precarious situation. Perhaps I am ignorant, but I have yet to hear of REMS being stretched thin as a result of any private party or residential college-wide party, even those explicitly centered around alcohol. The difference lies in leadership; those events often have no on-site oversight from RUPD or administration, making pre-gaming a non-issue. Yes, there is occasional overdrinking by individuals, but that is where personal accountability and the culture of care come into play. Such isolated incidents are an entirely different issue from the mass transports at NOD — it would be foolish to conflate the two. Excessive intoxication from pre-gaming is the main reason for admin’s worries with publics of late, but in taking action we should look at the root cause. Events which are truly student-run face no such issues, so does the fault for the decay of publics really lie in the hands of students, or is it a systemic issue with how publics are operated? This is a narrow criticism, but falls within a broader trend of power being taken away from residential colleges in the name of safety. Wherever admin or RUPD assumes responsibility, stricter regulations and a loss of student government autonomy follow. In the case of NOD (or any public recently , if RUPD decides who can get in, when the party shuts down, what the baggage/container policy is, when capacity is hit and how many officers need to draw from the budget to be there, then who has the real power? I am by no means criticizing RUPD’s conduct, but this issue necessarily results from them taking responsibility for student safety at publics. A huge part of Rice’s appeal is its unique culture created by the residential colleges as opposed to fraternities and sororities. If this trend continues, and campus-wide traditions lose the student direction that has defined them, I fear Rice will gradually become akin to the majority of other universities where every party is a private and inclusivity is an afterthought at best. To maintain the unique traditions that define Rice, it is critical for students to take the lead in creating responsible environments. Yet this cannot happen without the administration being willing to return some autonomy to the residential college governments, restoring individual responsibility and student governance as the dominating forces behind a safe environment at Rice. What happened at NOD this year is unacceptable, but not unprecedented. In response, we should not forget what we stand to lose. The burden of maintaining traditions at Rice should ultimately fall upon the shoulders of those who live them: the students. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

rice_thresher_2024_6,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/19/24 10:10pm Jae Kim has assumed the role of Student Association president, having led hisfirst Senate meetingMonday night. We hope that Kim will foster serious deliberation within the SA and make meaningful change through concrete initiatives. Here are the changes that we want Kim and the new SA cohort to focus on during the 2024–25 term. Explore raising the Blanket Tax The Blanket Tax has remained $85 since 2015 — equivalent to $112 today with inflation. Rice had 3,800 undergraduates in 2015; 10 years later, we have 1,000 more. A larger student body means existing organizations need proportionally more money, but it also fosters new initiatives to address broader interests. There is a need for increased funding to support activities and services for the whole student body. The SA should determine how much more students would be comfortable paying. Get student input on whether students want more Blanket Tax Organizations, and if so, which ones would serve them. Gain student input for campus construction projects The construction of colleges 12 and 13 and the redesign of the RMC, among other upcoming projects, provide an opportunity to shape Rice buildings to fit the needs of the current and future student body. It will be critical to know what stakeholders need so that these buildings can best serve them. The SA should represent its constituents in meetings with the administration. Stress accommodations for transgender and gender non-conforming students in the new residential colleges. Ensure that temporary relocations during the construction of the RMC are just as accessible as the new building will be. Make sure the administration can’t ignore student voices. Expand late night dining options We commend Kim for the work he has done so far to provide more healthy dining options outside of servery hours and his promise to keep working on this issue. Talk to students to learn what hours and types of food would best fit their needs. Increase student engagement Every year, SA candidates promise to improve their relationship with the student body, yet student engagement remains dismally low. To make this change happen requires effort from everyone in the SA: Host the town halls. Publicize resolutions on social media. Actively seek out input from students who don’t already engage with the SA. We believe that Kim and his executive committee can reach more students if they think creatively and put their energy into it.

crimson_2024_78,"This past week, I have watched unnerving scenes from my neighborhood plastered across the national news. Even more jarring was texts from friends of mine back in New York City about the police-laden scene unfolding along Columbia’s college walk. Growing up, there was a persistent tension between Columbia and Harlem — the neighborhood I was raised in, that lies at the base of the hill Columbia sits on. Fear of police brutality was common in my neighborhood. Incidents such as the wrongful conviction of the Central Park Five and disproportionate surveillance under New York City’s “stop and frisk” policy have persistently frayed trust between Harlem residents and the New York Police Department. Throughout the 1960s, Harlem residents mobilized in the streets in support of the civil rights movement, including during the Harlem Uprising of 1964, in which hundreds of Harlem residents protested the killing of an unarmed Black teenager. These incidents were often quelled by harsh response from the NYPD, resulting in the injuries of thousands of Harlemites. Activist demonstration and the disproportionate police brutality it engenders are ingrained in Harlem’s history. This is why I am vehemently opposed to Columbia University President Minouche Shafik’s decision to call in the NYPD to clear protesters on Columbia’s campus. It is also why I hope Harvard President Alan M. Garber ’76 does not repeat Shafik’s callous decision at our own school. Garber has refused to rule out thepossibility of calling in the policeto forcibly disperse Harvard protesters. But we must avoid this step not only for the safety of students in the encampment — including many of my friends that I love deeply — but also for the safety of Black and brown Cambridge and Allston residents. Given the larger history of American police disproportionately targeting Black and brown people, calling a significant police presence to any location endangers the neighboring broader Black and Brown communities of a given area. When police are called to a central location, officers do not just remain in that one place. They linger, instilling fear, in the surrounding areas. Shafik’s decision to rely on the NYPD to disperse a peaceful protest was reactionary and foolish at best. Combined with the notable militarization of the NYPD under New York City Mayor Eric L. Adams’ administration, Shafik has gone against the wishes of Columbia affiliates and drawn national derision for her decision making. While concerns over agitators abusing the pro-Palestinian movement to perpetuate antisemitism are undoubtedly justified, they cannot be used as a carte blanche excuse to unnecessarily use police force on dozens of peaceful protestors. Encampments are a strong, effective, and non-violent form of protest. From the last six days of Harvard’s encampment, many passersby have described a peaceful scene — something that the Harvard University Police Department’s current captain alsonoted on Friday. So far, encampments for Gaza have successfully drawn public attention to Israel’s ongoing bombing of Palestinians. Garber has asserted that he remainsstaunchly opposedto divestment from Israel. Yet, his reluctance will not change the fact that students remain outside on Harvard Yard, from morning through night, steadfastly advocating for Palestinian liberation. Perhaps their resilience is an indication that Harvard administrators should at least grant protestors serious conversations regarding their demands, instead of perpetually shying away from discussion. Harvard not only has a responsibility to protect its affiliates, but also to remember its surrounding community in its decision making process. To President Garber, my message is simple: Remember Black and brown Cambridge and Allston in your decision making. Jasmine N Wynn ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Thayer Hall."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_5,"I’ve been around UCI since 1996, as a grad student, TA, GSR, student government leader, conference organizer, alumnus, lecturer, interpreter, UROP mentor and judge, internship supervisor, … heck, one summer I even packed up, moved and unpacked several professors’ offices in a brand-new building. I’m on my fourth chancellor now; they get bored, or retire, or climb to a higher office. As the Associated Graduate Students’ president, I used to have lunch with Chancellor Michael Drake. Over 28 years, lots of protests, rallies, strikes, meetings and lunches, bills and resolutions, somehow Chancellor Howard Gillman is the first person to insult me publicly to my fellow Anteaters, including my dean, my course director, all of my colleagues, even my current and former students. I was arrested during the police raid on campus on May 15. You may have seen my frog-march TV interview or the May 16th LA Times front page photo, if you weren’t there watching in person. Hours later, Gillman claimed to have summarily barred all students, community members and faculty — that is, me and one professor, both quite prominently — arrested during the police action. In official terms, to bar someone summarily requires that he “reasonably find” them to be “a substantial and material threat of significant injury to persons or property.” Except that he did NOT bar me from campus. Whether he claimed to do so but did not, or tried and failed, he falsely smeared me as a violent threat to all of my colleagues and current and former students as I went about teaching my seminars, holding office hours and other duties. I learned of this supposed ban from my course director, who was surprised and concerned to see me on campus, based on a blast email from my dean, who had parroted Gillman’s false claim to all of my humanities colleagues. Feeling compelled to leave campus or risk arrest or citation, I drove home, forcing me onto Zoom at the last minute, wrecking a day of teaching and student conferences. While harmful to me in a specific way, with real material, emotional and career consequences, that act of his was only one drop in eight months of campus-wide trickle-down calumny and cruelty, incompetence and cowardice from the fifth-floor C-suite in Aldrich Hall, which culminated in a cascade on May 15. I offer a few examples of each: Calumny Cruelty Incompetence Cowardice In his 2022 UC Community Safety Plan, UC President — and former UCI chancellor — Michael V. Drake’s introduction acknowledges that “t oo often, the same systems charged with providing protection have become a source of great distrust and fear. This plan to re-envision safety at the University of California starts by acknowledging that reality.” The plan later emphasizes respecting “existing guidelines that minimize police presence at protests, following de-escalation methods in the event of violence and seek non-urgent mutual aid first from UC campuses before calling outside law enforcement agencies.” By the chancellor’s own account, he chose not to de-escalate in the event of violence, to the degree that he could reasonably make that call, relying on social media accounts to do so. ZotALERTs initially blared that “several hundred” protesters had occupied PSLH, only later in the dead of night muttering that there were only “several,” drop the hundred. Not so much invading the building — they just stood around it, he admitted. These actions provoked serious reflection about their foundational moral causes. What is it in a man that would cause him to fail in some of his most solemn administratively and ethically clear obligations to ensure our safety and rights and privileges as Anteaters? What sort of man uses his powerful position to belittle, insult and threaten students, faculty, academic programs, beloved community members, free speech itself, on our campus? In formal settings, Gillman wields his ceremonial mace–a bludgeoning weapon that symbolizes his executive power to smite anyone beneath him at UCI. However, behind closed doors, he wields an axe–a budget axe that strikes fear into deans, department chairs, program directors and beyond, for so many believe him to be biased in his interests and vindictive in his responses to things he dislikes. Sitting in jail with my newfound friends, and later at home, checking in on other arrestees as we recovered, talking about it with my wife — also a UCI alumnus with a teaching credential and MA and PhD in History, I have sometimes turned to the field of moral philosophy, specifically to the work of Professor Aaron James, an honored member of our Department of Philosophy, with whom I have taught in Humanities Core. I have returned to some of the texts we read together, and his later publications. For the non-specialist, I recommend especially his bestselling book from Doubleday,Assholes: A Theory(2012 . Chancellor Gillman has shown himself to be an equivocating, petty, dishonest man in this whole affair since October — to me, to my fellow arrestees and I firmly believe, to students, staff and faculty. The damage he has wrought on our campus is clear, as is his unsuitability to be the person we look to as we begin to repair it. —- Brook Haley, PhD (UCI 2007 Continuing Lecturer"
ubyssey_2024_6,"April 11, 2024 Written byElena MassingandTova Gaster Tova Gaster is the Science Editor forThe Ubyssey. Elena Massing is the Culture Editor forThe Ubyssey. Every April, the courtyard outside the Nest transforms into an EDM music festival, complete with a confusing maze of chain link fences, an ear-splitting sound system and frat guys vomiting in the corners. It costs $89. This is Block Party, and it s been consistently losing the AMS money for the past seven years. Last year, Block Party ticket sales brought in an estimated$250,000 lessthan anticipated, and we’re paying for it out of our student fees. The year before was a similar story. Even pre-pandemic, Block Party was criticized for charging too much forticketsto see artists that most students don’tknow or care about. Who are they marketing to that would pay upwards of $60 to see French Montana? (If that’s you, congratulations! Genuinely, happy for you. But, surely you can appreciate that you’re in the minority . The current Block Party scene is dominated by first-years and guys in fraternities — which leaves out a lot of campus. But how many girls in Doc Martens do you see everyday? Hanging from their shoulders are tote bags covered in Lord Huron and Phoebe Bridgers pins, and in these bags are wads of cash just waiting to be spent on concert tickets. The current Block Party model isn’t working. To revive student life, AMS Events can do two simple things: reduce ticket costs, and start booking local acts that more people actually want to see. It may seem like a paradox that to make money, you have to become indie. But, in Vancouver, on a college campus, this is what you must do. Vancouver has a thrivingmusic scenethat UBC students are central to. Rather than flying out artists with little or no connection to this city or this campus, why not support better-loved (and probably cheaper local talent? These local acts prove, year after year, that they actually candraw in a full house. Case in point: Goosehunt, Blank Vinyl Project’s annual concert, sells out in minutes. This year, Goosehunt early bird tickets were $17 — general admission was only about $10 more than that. If finances are a barrier to students wanting to get in on the fun, BVP is also willing to help out by offering a limited number of pay-what-you-can tickets. Block Party tickets this year are $89 to see Don Toliver. Don Toliver is cool and people like him, but $89 for tickets? For an audience of students? In this economy? CiTR hosts a similar annual initiative calledShindig, which is set up as a battle of the bands, rewarding the winner with a label, publicity and studio access. Block Party shouldn’t compete with existing music initiatives, but it could learn from them. This isn’t to endorse the epidemic of every Vancouver band being four white guys with three guitars, two brain cells and one Strokes cover between them. But, it’s clear that, despite its shortcomings (a lot of bands that basically look and sound the same , the local model sells. Block Party could build on it by spotlighting a wider array of genres and bands. Local also doesn’t just mean indie rock — why not highlight local EDM DJs that the frat crowd, or even the bisexual docs crowd, will like? UBC students are hungry for connection, culture, a sense of pride in our community and an accessible way to get fired up on the last day of classes to good live music. Block Party doesn’t provide that, but it could. This is an opinion article.

state_press_2024_10,"The Novus Parking Structure on ASU s Tempe campus is pictured on Sunday, May 2, 2021. One of the most common complaints you’ll hear is that there s no parking on campus. It s the reason students are late to classes, meetings and events. Finding parking on campus can be a nightmare. That doesn t even mention the cost of getting a parking permit on or near the Tempe campus, which can cost anywhere from $280 to $780. Some have no choice. Many students commute from home, have families to support or have jobs where the only option to commute is by car. This opinion is not for those folks for whom parking is needed. But students on or near campus who constantly drive should reconsider how they get there. The metro Phoenix area is incredibly car-centric, with only very recent and limited improvements to the existing infrastructure. However, existing in Tempe and downtown Phoenix is not only possible but also presents a better lifestyle for students with the ability to ditch the car for a semester. Students also may not feel safe on the light rail, streetcar or buses, a complaint I have heard from particularly women who feel unsafe at night while on public transportation. However, our parking is at a premium. These spaces are money pits, and unless you live elsewhere in the Valley or have a job to commute to, there is little to no reason to have a car on the Tempe or Downtown Phoenix campus as a resident. An ASU spokesperson said in a written statement that Parking and Transit Services reviews parking availability and use throughout the year and plans accordingly. They said that although some lots are crowded at certain times, there is sufficient parking on campus currently. They gave the example of the acquisition of the EVB Parking Garage near the Downtown Phoenix campus at 460 N. Third St. by ASU to respond to the growing campus population and increasing demand. David King is an associate professor of urban planning at the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning. He said it costs a lot to build parking at ASU, and prices are fairly cheap. Building parking is very expensive to ASU, King said. Parking is very cheap to ASU students, faculty and staff. Even though they don t think so because they want to, they want it for free because we expect free parking just about anywhere we go. He said surface parking is the cheapest kind of parking infrastructure, but building that kind of parking in a dense city like Tempe and on an even denser University campus is difficult. A surface parking lot is the cheapest way to go where you re going to just put asphalt down but that s also a terribly inefficient use of that land and the ASU campus and Tempe overall have very scarce land, there s no more land to build, King said. King said you can only build up or down in Tempe. According to King, some parking structures are being built on campus, notably between Mirabella and the new Omni Hotel on Mill Avenue and University Drive. He said underground parking structures are also possible, but each spot is worth money in the high five figures. ASU has to comply with parking standards laid out by Tempe and Phoenix for whatever they are building, which vary, and the University has to go through a joint committee for approvals for those projects, according to a Tempe spokesperson in a written statement. It s not that they re saying it s expensive compared to building a building that you would use to live in or work in or whatever. It s not those other buildings are more expensive than parking structures, Deborah Salon, an assistant professor at the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, said. But considering you have to pay a lot of money to just store your cars, then it starts to sound like that s crazy and really expensive. King said that, past what is being built now, he believes there is no intention to build any more parking with what little land is left to build near campus. Part of this, he said, is because parking capacity has gone down since 2020 as a long-term result of hybrid learning. There s just not as many people coming to campus every day, King said. If all of your meetings are by Zoom. Why would you show up other than when you have to be there for class or (to go to the library or do some of the other physical things that you have to do on campus when you could stay home and you can save the cost and the time of commuting? Parking demand is low, and the University can use its money for other student accommodations.Also, by not having a car, students eliminate gas, insurance costs and repair costs. Tempe has gone to extraordinary lengths to increase the walkability and accessibility of its infrastructure. If you think driving around Tempe is difficult, it is by design. On the light rail corridor, from Mill Avenue to Apache Drive eastward, high-rises are springing up where students can live off campus and not have to drive to campus or anywhere else where they might go, including Mill Avenue and downtown Phoenix. READ MORE:Valley Metro rail extension to bring more riders, housing along the public transit line The city and the University are both trying to not just reduce parking, they re trying hard and investing a lot of money into reducing demand so that people are able to live near campus and be able to walk or bike, King said. King said many people don t take public transportation because they don t know how to use it properly. He said the University should educate new students, especially students from out of state, about the alternatives to getting around campus and the surrounding cities. Those types of interventions with when you can catch somebody just as they re moving or they re changing jobs, King said. People are open to changing their mode of travel, but they often don t know how. So there s outreach, things like that, that can happen. Regarding public transportation safety, King said this was a problem that needed to be addressed, and the issue extends beyond Phoenix and is a larger humanitarian issue. The lack of feeling safe on public transit is somewhat related to the increase the dramatic increase in homelessness, that there (are more interactions on public transit between unhoused people and police who are who are enforcing it, King said. In June 2023, Valley Metro beganOperation Blue Ride, which increased Valley Metro s security presence in conjunction with an increased police presence in station and rail cars in Mesa. He said the most important thing to make people feel safer in transit is more ridership, which can take a few years. He said he hopes more people use transit to make it feel more safe for everyone. If you live on Apache Boulevard and only go to class and back, you should walk or take the train. It s a safe, active way to get around, and makes you a larger part of the community. It s also much cheaper than having to spend money on gas. There are things you need to drive for: grocery runs and other errands, doctor s appointments, going outside of Tempe and many others, but classes close by don t need to be one of them. Tempe is a diamond in the rough for walkability and accessibility, and downtown Phoenix is the exact same. Take advantage of the ease of transportation as a student, and don t spend the time or money securing a parking spot. Edited by Angelina Steel, Walker Smith, Caera Learmonth and Sadie Buggle.

crimson_2024_81,"“The Corporation Must Go.” Sowrote The Crimsonon April 11, 1969, in the aftermath of the occupation of University Hall and the subsequent police raid that cleared the building. “The Corporation,” the editorial continued, “as it is now constituted cannot legitimately act as the principal governing body of the University … A restructured University would require the participation of Faculty, both in the new governing bodies and in the efforts to secure them.” Harvard was then in a crisis more dramatic and violent than that of today. But in both 1969 and 2023, issues of governance were at the heart of the crisis. Harvard is unusual among universities in its governing structures. It has two governing boards, not one board of trustees. Its boards, unlike those of public universities, are not accountable to government bodies. Nor are the boards accountable to faculty or students — or, in the case of the Corporation, even alumni. The Board of Overseers, the larger body, is at least elected by alumni. The Corporation, by contrast, remains among the smallest and most secretive governing bodies of any major university and with a governing culture far removed from the norms of modern university or corporate governance. In the aftermath of the 1969 crisis, the Overseers asked Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean John T. Dunlop to review the University’s governance. Dunlop convened the University Committee on Governance, which met from 1969 to 1971 and issued a series of reports and recommendations. The question, then as now, was whether 17th century forms of governance were adequate for contemporary times. The committee’s 1971 report on “The Organization and Functions of the Governing Boards and the President’s Office” concluded: “The commonest reaction to inquiry into Harvard’s ancient forms is a somewhat defensive: ‘They have worked, haven’t they?’ To this question the answer may be, ‘Yes, until lately.’” Well, lately, again, they have not worked well. In less than two decades, the Corporation has overseen two presidencies cut short and, in 2009, monumental financial mismanagement that left the world’s richest university bereft of cash and shorn of reserves. Few corporate boards would survive such performance. If one were to reconstruct the events of the past year simply from the pages of the New York Times, we see the continuing limits of Harvard’s governance. President Gay’s deliberative approach to responding to the Hamas attack on Israel was openly criticized by a former University president. Outrage from groups of alumni followed. Congressional inquiries followed, with the president being advised on her testimony by the Corporation. Then came accusations of academic malpractice, to adjudicate which the Corporation apparently followed none of Harvard’s internal procedures. All that done, the Corporation met in person to voice unanimous support for the president on Dec. 12. Two weeks later, phoning each other from ski resorts and vacation homes, its members changed their minds. Any external observer would be forced to conclude that big donors and congressional critics now had the power to force out Harvard’s president. I personally doubt that was the case, but how do we know? At present, the only way Harvard’s faculty, students, and alumni will learn what really happened in the Corporation’s deliberations is by congressional subpoena. That’s not good enough. The Dunlop Committee found the Corporation “the principal enigma of the University’s governance.” The committee established that the Corporation had published neither minutes of its meetings nor accounts of its deliberations in 30 years. Perhaps it never had. When, as Dean of FAS, I gave Robert N. Bellah ’48, the eminent Berkeley sociologist, permission to review archives relating to the McCarthyist harassment of him by FAS Dean McGeorge Bundy and the Corporation, he was told that minutes of Corporation meetings were not even taken. The Dunlop Committee issued a series of reports on the role and structure of the governing boards; the election of the president and need for term limits; the possibility of a University Senate, with both faculty and student representation; the role of money in University governance; and other matters. All were forgotten in time. When the Corporation planned its enlargement in 2010 — the first major reform to the body since 1650 — I asked a member if they had reviewed the Dunlop reports and the voluminous correspondence about them. He had never heard of either. As Dean of FAS, I met with the Corporation more than most deans: to review FAS academic plans, to approve building projects and architecture, and to set tuition. (By comparison, the late John H. McArthur told me he met with the Corporation precisely twice during his 15 years as dean of Harvard Business School. The Corporation members I worked with certainly sought to be good stewards of Harvard. Yet only one member at any given time had leadership experience in higher education. Some were not quite clear of their role. One asked, “When does the Corporation vote on the undergraduate curriculum?” I had to tell him: “You don’t. That’s the faculty’s job.” I found the Corporation to be less like a board of directors and more like (as described by the Dunlop Committee the “president’s cabinet.” Perhaps that is why, in the crisis over Lawrence H. Summers’ presidency, it was the Board of Overseers, under President Patti B. Saris ’73, that took rare initiative in pressing for change. John Dunlop provided Harvard with strong and skillful stewardship in the immediate aftermath of 1969. Today, we are fortunate that the experienced leadership of interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 has given the University time to pause and to reflect. We must make use of that time — as the Dunlop Committee did more than 50 years ago — to take a hard look at Harvard’s governance. This time, however, we really must act, if we are not to repeat this drama a decade or two hence. Taking the Dunlop Committee’s findings as guidance, here is how we might proceed today: First, create a new University-wide Committee on Governance chaired by the provost. Review best practices at other U.S. and international universities. Second, be prepared to restructure our bicameral governing boards into one, with a higher percentage of individuals who know from experience the industry they’re overseeing. Explore the role of faculty and students on the board. Third, establish a University Senate, perhaps on the model set forth by the Dunlop Committee, as a powerful advisory body to the president and board, composed of faculty and (in lesser numbers students from each school of the University. How can there be “one Harvard” without a University-wide voice for faculty in governance? Fourth and finally, explore means to establish a more transparent governance. The Office of the Governing Boards is the administrative arm of the Overseers and the Corporation. Its mission has been to maintain stability and secrecy. It is not a crime, however, to publish agendas and edited minutes, or to meet with the press. Other boards of leading universities do this. As someone who has written on the governance of modern research universities from Germany to America to China, I know there is no perfect model. But many work better than ours. I agree with Henry Rosovsky’s first principle of governance: “Not everything is improved by making it more democratic.” Yet we must strive for more open and accountable governance at Harvard.

thetech_mit_2024_12,"An approaching anniversary date of former MIT Chairman and Dean of Engineering Dr. Vannevar Bush prompts me to write today. As his sole biographer has justhighlighted in IEEE Spectrum, this Friday will mark 50 years since the Jun. 28, 1974 passing of this individual whose footprint looms large on global history 1 . Two decades into a business-technical career since graduating provide me the perspective to take stock of the engineering institution I trained in, leading inevitably to studying Vannevar Bush s undeniable influence on that institution. The recent Oppenheimer film, which featured Bush in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos, also piqued interest. What I learned about the man at once impressed, intrigued, but also dismayed me for reasons that will become clear below. It seems most Institute stakeholders (going by the responses of fellow alums I have spoken with on it know as little about who Vannevar Bush was as I did at the outset of my studying. Nor are they aware of the enormous impact he has had on society and on the Institute—at the curriculum level and also at the research organization level (both directly and via Institute Presidents Compton and Killian he engaged with . In 1999–2003, most of what we saw of the man’s legacy as students was a large picture in an Infinite Corridor display case highlighting his association with the Rad Lab (i.e. radar, rather than the even more impactful Manhattan Project that he uniquely enabled , a room named after him next to Lobby 10, and a wall engraving in Lobby 13 (of the building named after him . I feel the reason for this lack of familiarity is that the Institute hasn t collectively introspected during the intervening decades over what it means to be so closely associated with this pivotal individual, even while it was irrevocably transformed by him in practice. Why might the story of Vannevar Bush fail to be propagated from class year to class year? To put it simply, his accomplishments and legacy may be seen as controversial in many circles. While he built the Allies’ much-needed military-industrial weapons innovation complex brick by brick during WWII, that same complex would grow into a source of foreboding from Eisenhower just 16 years later. The counterfactual analysis of whether the Manhattan Project should have ever been initiated, based on the fission chain reaction feasibility studies Bush commissioned, remains the source of much hand-wringing today. He certainly led impressive accomplishments, like radar, but only thrived in attaining them by operating in the secrecy context that wartime imperatives afforded. He formed part of the nascent superstructure of cold war hysteria, generally accommodating HUAC/red-scare activity until it finally reached home with his colleague J Robert Oppenheimer as depicted in last year’s blockbuster film. The work of NSA academic historian Colin Burke portends a still-classified legacy of the man, stories that remain to be told. As his staunch 1945 advocacy of abortive Atomic Energy Commission legislation demonstrated, an unchecked committee of technocratic experts appeared to be his preferred agency governance form. On the positive side, we have his proposal of the Memex which inspired the first recognizably modern graphical user interface from SRI s Doug Engelbart. Bush made federal funding of peacetime science a reality, something that was barely a pipedream pre-war. However much we might see the edifice of centralized research funding creaking today, we do so from a much more scientifically advanced place today than if there had been no such funding. Reading his works and the examples he set, I find myself positively guided by his: We can readily see, with some good and some not-so-good (in full awareness of judging from hindsight, benefiting from lessons learned that Bush and his contemporaries could have only set the stage for , it seems we re looking at a mixed-bag legacy here. Bringing focus back to Cambridge, it s simply a matter of history that Vannevar Bush fostered collaboration between the defense complex and the tute to unprecedented degrees in WWII and post-WWII. Fast-forward nearly 60 years, and the Institute that I graduated from, and probably through today, seemed to struggle with ambivalence over its relationship with defense funding of research, while maintaining a keenness for defense employment prospects for graduating students. This amid our laudable context of being open to students from all over the world (one of the qualitative features of the school of which I m most proud . Upon studying the man’s legacy, I marvel that Vannevar Bush s name, whether spoken in warm or in despondent tones, isn t a household one at the same level as Edison or Musk. I think that should be otherwise, if for no other reason than for people to start the conversation on just where they should be placing this unique man within their pantheon of history. A good place to start would be the Institute s coming to articulate how its identity has been shaped by this unique individual. Friday’s commemoration of 50 years since a world with Vannevar Bush’s presence in it should serve as an opportune moment to reflect. Monumentally impactful yet controversial, Vannevar Bush s legacy continues to shape the landscape of scientific research and national policy. Juxtaposing his undeniable contributions to technological advancement with the ethical questions raised by his work presents a complex portrait of a pivotal figure in American history. One or two generations from now, historians and ethicists may still grapple with the far-reaching consequences of Bush s legacy, as we continue to navigate the intricate relationship between science, government, military, and society.

crimson_2024_39,"After a tumultuous semester defined by pro-Palestinian activism, a dramatic congressional hearing, and former University President Claudine Gay’s resignation, the political tension on Harvard’s campus is palpable. In the wake of one of the most tense periods in Harvard’s history, the anticipated announcement of aworking groupconsidering a policy of institutional neutrality might finally allow the University to exit the political spotlight. While I can understand how political exhaustion might lead one — including the Crimson’s ownEditorial Board— to endorse such a position, Harvard is an unavoidably political institution. With right-wing outrage pointed at education in recent years, it should come as no surprise that such a famous university is often implicated in conservative political discourse. If many conservatives discard higher education writ large as worthless “indoctrination,” then it’s predictable that those same conservatives decry the most culturally recognizable figure of higher education. Yet, as much as I disagree with the criticisms conservatives levy against Harvard, they share something in common with my own leftist critique of the University: Each recognizes that Harvard’s choices have political impacts, regardless if they label these choices as political. For example, pundits on both sides correctly understand Harvard’s curriculum choices — both what they chose to include and exclude — as having political significance. Though I wholeheartedly disagree with the causes these conservatives aim to advance, there is some broad truth to gain in their critiques of the University: It is politically significant for Harvard to house so few self-identifying conservative faculty, just as it is politically significant for Harvard to resist calls for an ethnic studies department for over 50 years or to maintain an elitist policy of legacy admissions. Actions speak louder than words, and inaction too, is certainly an active choice. The political interpretations of each of these choices illustrate why true institutional neutrality is impossible — even should Harvard decline to comment on every last issue. The broader, more worrisome implications of neutrality policies is that institutional neutrality effectively freezes a university in time, protecting the status quo from political critiques and social movements. A blanket acceptance of the status quo is far from politically “neutral” — if anything, it’s conservative. I fear that such a policy will become nothing but a false pretense at the University’s disposal — an excuse to hinder progressive choices and not engage with student movements. Consider how an “institutionally neutral” Harvard might navigate student demands for it to divest its endowment investments from fossil fuels. Should the University follow students’ lead, its choice would clearly represent an endorsement of left-leaning politics. Similarly, if the University fervently defends its fossil fuel investments, this would reflect the conservative position. If Harvard were institutionally neutral, it might ignore such demands altogether, claiming they could not engage with the issue out of an interest in remaining “neutral,” if questions arose. But, the outcome of this supposedly “neutral” stance is no different than the conservative stance. This hypothetical was a reality at the University of Chicago only a few short years ago, when the university used its “Kalven Principles” of institutional neutrality to justify inaction on climate change. Students still accurately recognized this inaction as a political choice and have continued to push for divestment from fossil fuels and transparency in endowment. This scenario reflects a reality that Harvard, just like every other university, must face: There is no such thing as a truly politically neutral stance or course of action. Universities can decline to openly engage with the political world, but everything from their course offerings to their endowment investments are inherently political. Rather than falsely portray the University, its faculty, its students, and its pedagogy as apolitical, Harvard ought to focus on doing the right thing. The University should engage with its students, reflect on its values, and make administrative choices and statements with transparency and conviction — not cower behind the faulty guise of neutrality. It may sound nice for Harvard to exist free from political controversy, but that simply is not possible. The question should not be “how can we remove ourselves from politics,” but rather, “what is the right thing for our institution to do?” Joseph W.

rice_thresher_2024_33,"ByIbrahim Al-Akash4/9/24 11:04pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The recent tabling ofS.RES 02showcases the blatant hypocrisy of the Rice administration and sets a dangerous precedent of silencing students’ intellectual discussion. The resolution called for the SA’s creation of an Ethical Advisory Board, which would monitor Blanket Tax spending on companies deemed complicit in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. The resolution was tabled at the request of an unnamed student who filed a discrimination complaint alleging antisemitism with the Office of Access, Equity and Equal Opportunity.Studentsandfacultyclaim the resolution is antisemitic, but no quotes from the resolution or cited evidence have been brought forth to support this claim. The reason for this lack of evidence is that the resolution is not antisemitic. The resolution does not mention or single out Jewish people anywhere in the document and extensively cites reputable sources (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,Amnesty International,Desmond Tutu to substantiate the crimes attributed to the Israeli regime. To extrapolate this criticism to mean discrimination against all Jewish people is preposterous, as many Jewish organizations (Jewish Voice for Peace,IfNotNow andJewish studentsaround the world support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement andoppose Zionism. Furthermore,350 Holocaust scholarssigned the Jerusalem Declaration On Antisemitism affirming that critiques of Israel, even those perceived as excessive or contentious, or deemed to reflect a “double standard,” as well as calls for BDS, are not antisemitic. Painting all criticism of the Israeli regime with the brush of antisemitism is an attempt tosilence and delegitimize criticism of Israelby attacking the interlocutor rather than the content of the argument. In arecent Letter to the Editor, a student baselessly claims that the resolution falsely accuses Israel of genocide and colonization; however, the findings of theInternational Court of Justiceand theUN Special Rapporteurconcluded that “there are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating Israel’s commission of genocide is met.” The Israeli regime’s genocidal intent is “not hard to prove” with500 statementsproviding ample evidence according to Holocaust and Genocide Studies professor Raz Segal. Moreover, any basic reading of the history of Zionism will show that Israel was created as a colonial project, as stated in theBritish Mandate for Palestine, thePeel Commission report, and even by Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, in his paper “The Jewish State” in which he refers to the Zionists as “our colonists.” When responding to the tabling of the resolution, a Rice spokespersonsaidRice is “not legally required to honor the First Amendment” since it’s a private university, which essentially indicates that the Rice administration believes it can suppress student discourse with impunity. The Rice administration is selectively applying rules and laws in a biased manner that neglects the intellectual development of its students and the core values of the university. While claiming to uphold principles of education, conversation and inclusiveness, General Counsel Omar Syeddefendedthe suppression of the vote without considering the impact on Palestinian, Arab and Muslim students and their families, whose killing in the tens of thousands is being enabled by the companies that the resolution calls for boycotting. Is it inclusive to conduct business as usual with companies who are enabling the murder of children at such a massive scale? Is it not discriminatory to aid in the Israeli regime’sapartheidand genocide? If Rice is inclined to suppress discourse solely based on accusations of discrimination without waiting for verification, Zionists will continue to cry wolf about any resolution criticizing Israel as being “antisemitic.” By seemingly turning a blind eye to the potential consequences of its actions and setting this precedent, Rice is perpetuating discrimination and suppressing legitimate discourse and intellectual debate. According toAmnesty International, labeling groups, such as BDS, that use peaceful means to end human rights violations against Palestinians as antisemitic “violates freedom of expression and is a gift to those who seek to silence, harass, intimidate and oppress those standing up for human rights around the world.” The tabling of the resolution shows the Rice administration’s failure to uphold the integrity andvaluesof the university, and is without a doubt discriminatory. We, as students who embody these values, need to read between the lines of Rice’s empty statements and scrutinize their actions. Rice’s mission statement emphasizes a commitment to the betterment of the world, yet the administration’s actions in blocking the resolution raise questions about this commitment. Is the murder of over40,000 people,starvation of innocent childrenandobliteration of homes, mosques, hospitals, churches, schools and every university in Gazawhat Rice views as a better world? I am not asking Rice administration to adopt a stance on the BDS issue; rather, I am demanding that they refrain from interfering with our student-led democratic process. Rice administration should reconsider the tabling of the resolution and must demonstrate a commitment to its stated values and take responsibility for its actions. This includes fostering an environment where intellectual discussion and dissent are encouraged rather than stifled, and where the university’s role in promoting social justice and human rights is upheld. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

You can also call theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 988 or text theCrisis Text Lineat 741741. Last Thursday, a jury found Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services employee Melanie G. Northropnot liablein a civil case pertaining to the suicide of Luke Z. Tang ’18. I am not a member of Tang’s family, nor did I ever know him. I am neither a legal scholar nor a psychiatrist. I cannot pretend to ascertain whether the decision was just. Instead, I urge us to seize this moment to reflect on how Harvard’s mental health system has failed — and continues to fail — its students. In turn, we must demand reform to reduce the chances of such a tragedy ever happening again. At the center of Harvard’s mental health system is an ethos of distrust, paternalism, and surveillance. This ethos is exemplified by Tang’s case. Tang attempted suicide on April 11, 2015, while a first-year. His attempt was followed by a seven-day hospitalization at McLean Hospital — a teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Several weeks later, a contract was established between Harvard and Tang, with Tang’s signature a prerequisite for his return to campus. This contract required Tang comply with the recommendations from his treatment providers (including prescribed medications , prohibited him from changing this medication regimen without permission, mandated he submit to psychiatric evaluation upon the request of any “College official,” and permitted the College to contact his parents if any terms of the contract were violated. Failure to comply would constitute a threat to Tang’s continued enrollment at Harvard. Tang tried to modify these terms prior to signing. He was refused. He died by suicide on Sept. 12, 2015. There is a simple explanation why Harvard’s “care” is centered around contractual obligations. It seems students believed to pose an imminent threat to themselves are, in the eyes of our administration, a legal and public relations liability. Harvard does not wish to be the school known for its student suicides, nor does it wish to spend its (over $50 billion endowment on lawsuits and settlements. While the University’s financial and reputational motives are understandable, these motives must not affect their approach to mental health care — not if it comes at the cost of its students’ wellbeing. Sadly, it’s possible that the terms of Tang’s contract and the context surrounding its signing had an adverse effect on his health. The fact that his contract was non-negotiable negated Tang’s personhood, denying him autonomy with respect to his care. The only choice he had, in fact, was to comply or unenroll. The terms of the contract were similarly suffocating. To encourage treatment is one thing; to mandate it under threat of removal is another. The contract’s terms suggest a deep distrust of students struggling with mental health issues. This approach sends a clear message: Harvard doesn’t trust you. Preventing students from changing their medication regimen without consent of their treatment team is a clear infringement on bodily autonomy. Responses to psychiatric medication are varied and can range from dangerous side effects to unwanted changes in mood that may be justified as a “necessary evil” by the wrong provider. Harvard’s arrangement amounts to a forced administration of medication to students. In broadening the scope of who could demand a psychiatric evaluation of Tang to the highly ambiguous category of “College officials,” Harvard unfairly subjected a student to undue scrutiny and observation. When any College official has this power, there are few safe authorities to turn to without risking removal from the College. To speak about one’s experiences becomes dangerous. By reserving the right to contact students’ parents about their mental health, the administration overstepped its authority, meddling in family affairs. Such a reach can be particularly insidious for students with unsupportive parents, or worse — as is the case for many queer students with unaccepting families — it can be a blatant violation of student privacy. We may be young, but we are still adults, and we have the right to decide who is involved in our care. When Harvard treats students as liabilities, it sends a clear signal to those who need care: There may not be a place for you here. Harvard’s current system reinforces stigma around mental health; it must be reengineered to actively combat this stigma. If the University truly cares about mental health, it must begin to see its students as full persons — persons with dignity, persons capable of reasoning and decision-making, and persons who have a right to bodily autonomy. Resistance to change renders Harvard complicit in today’s mental health crisis. Allison P. Farrell ’26, a Crimson Editorial Editor, is a Philosophy Concentrator in Leverett House.

rice_thresher_2024_13,"ByBrandon ChenandRiya Misra4/21/24 11:51pm Jeremy Zucker’s arms, like most of his body, host a scrapbook of tattoos — a faded clementine peel, his childhood pets (Rusty and Susie , a Pinterest doodle of Sonic the Hedgehog with a bouquet of flowers. His middle finger is etched with a single tooth, hanging off a thin branch that curls around the rest of his hand. After graduating in 2018 with a degree in molecular biology, he got matching tattoos with his three Colorado College roommates — a house, stick-figured and the size of a stamp, on his right bicep. “It cemented my home,” Zucker said in an interview with the Thresher, just before he headlined Moody X-Fest on April 19. It was his first-ever tattoo. Just four months later he would release “comethru,” his breakout song that would eventually amass over 800 million Spotify streams. Now, he has over 9.5 billion global streams and too many tattoos to count. Editor’s Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Rice Thresher: Welcome to Rice. How s it treating you? Have you been here before? Jeremy Zucker:Never been here before, no. It s awesome. I didn t expect it to be so green. And humid. RT: You went to Colorado College and you’ve performed at colleges before. How does it feel to be back on campus? JZ:It feels great. I’m trying to think of the last college show that I did. Honestly, I can t remember. I do a couple of them every year. But Rice reminds me a lot of Tulane … It s the same long sidewalks with big trees lining the sidewalks. And the whole campus under a canopy. RT: How s it different from your normal venues like House of Blues? The actual concert-concerts? JZ:I mean, super different inside, for sure. I really love playing shows outside, though. All the college shows are usually on a lawn, depending on the weather. But if they re not on a lawn, then they can be kind of weird, because then there ll be like, a gymnasium or an auditorium. RT: Shifting gears a little bit, happy five-year anniversary of “you were good to me.” It came out April 19, exactly five years ago. JZ:Oh, my God. Today? I wonder if my team knows that. What s crazy about it is that “you were good to me” just wentdouble platinum. RT: That was with Chelsea Cutler. You ve done an EP with Chelsea, you ve toured with The Kid LAROI. You did a song with blackbear, and “Heavy” and “make daddy proud” have the same melody … Can you talk a little bit about how your collaborations throughout your music career have shaped where you are now, shaped your music? JZ:When I work with people, it usually happens one of two ways. When I was first starting out, I would have an idea for a song that wouldn t fit in my main stuff. I would leave an open verse and be, “Oh, so-and-so would sound good on this.” The blackbear thing, that s how “talk is overrated” happened. That was after he remixed my song “Heavy.” Since he did that, we were like, “Hey, we did you this favor. You want to get on my song?” and he was like, “Sure. That s awesome.” These days, collaborations exist very separately. My process is very solitary. My state of mind and my emotional state at that moment matter a lot. Bringing another person in just means bringing another unknown factor, when there are already a lot of unknown factors. RT: Speaking of vibes, I m going to list the names of some of your songs: “cry with you,” “therapist,” “we re fucked, it s fine,” “all the kids are depressed.” Your Apple Music bio describes you as a “sad-boy troubadour for the extremely online age.” JZ:Woooow. RT: What are your thoughts? Is that accurate? JZ:I don t think it s accurate anymore. For that era, it was super accurate for two reasons. One, I definitely used to be way more hopelessly sad and hopelessly romantic. During that time when I was making music, the Tumblr vibe was still alive online. The “sad boy” aesthetic was a thing. You don’t really hear that much anymore. These days, I m much happier. There s less hopeless melancholy in my music, for sure. RT: What do you think changed? Was it more so the music industry, or was it personal for you? JZ:The industry changed so much, and that really made me reevaluate why I m doing this and it made me come back to it with a bit more intention. Things just got faster. Music got supersaturated and I didn t want to be another voice competing for noise. RT: Your career actually started on SoundCloud, a platform that has launched so many other careers of big artists: Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Lil Uzi Vert. Now, you re talking about change in the industry and how TikTok has risen so much. Where do you think the SoundCloud era of music is going? Is it going anywhere? Is it dead? JZ:I think the SoundCloud era is kind of dead. I think people don t want to — I mean, I definitely don t — put in energy to find your music. The easier it is to discover music, that s what catches on. That s why radio was so big for so long. I think that s why TikTok is catching on, because it s so easy for people to discover music. That said, I don t really know what comes next. It stinks for someone who doesn t want to make music for TikTok. I’d like to think I m curating something deeper. But I would love to have a song blow up on TikTok again, for the record. RT: So what do you make music for? JZ:For the longest time, I was making it for myself and to understand myself. It still is this way, just less hopeless because I do understand myself way more than I used to. It s like therapy, it s like understanding my place in the world and contextualizing things that I ve been through. Sometimes tossing in things that can help people and make them feel less alone. RT: To jump a few years back to the music industry, how’d you get into it? And how’d you balance it in college? JZ:It s funny. For some reason, I really didn t have a hard time balancing music and school … My school kept me so humble. If I was at a big state school and I was this kid picking up music, releasing stuff and going on tour, it probably would have gotten to my head pretty fast. At my small school, people were like “Oh, thinks he s too good for us now,” and I was like, “No!” But yeah, I didn t have any free time. My free time was when I would make music. That d be my alone time. That’d be how I’d process emotions. It became a necessity to do that. RT: You were pre-med, then obviously switched gears a little bit. You re in good company, since so many people here are pre-med. What advice would you have for a Rice student, or really any college student, who is pre-med and is considering going in a different direction? JZ:If it doesn t feel right, it s probably not right … I worked at an optometrist for summer, but I didn t do any of the things you re supposed to be doing. I was not thinking about it because at the front of my mind, I was like, “This is my backup. I want to be making music.” RT: Okay, we have a few minutes left. I have a few rapid-fire questions. Physics or orgo? JZ:Orgo. RT: What s your tattoo with the biggest story behind it? JZ:Probably my first two, which is this house and the world. I got this house with all my roommates in college when I graduated. It was the first time that I lived with a bunch of friends and it really felt like a home. Later, I got this world map. Even though I have a lot of roots in my home, I want to see the world and get out there. RT: You told TMRW Magazine in one of your interviews that you takea bunch of photos. How many do you have in your camera? JZ:Oh, good question. Let s see. I got a two-terabyte phone, so I don t have to think about it. 42,000. RT: One of Rice s mottos is “unconventional wisdom.” What do you think that means? JZ:That s a motto? For a school? RT: Another one is “home of intellectual brutality.” It’s the athletics motto. JZ:That’s weird. Someone was either cynical or had a good sense of humor. The Super Smash Bros. Club held their second annual ultimate tournament Friday, April 12. Club president Jashun Paluru said all Smash players were welcome, regardless of ability, experience or involvement in the club. The event was held in collaboration with Owls After Dark, a late-night activity series headed by the Rice Student Center, at the Rice Memorial Center’s Grand Hall. Last Thursday, the halls of the RMC were graced with smooth melodies and funky grooves courtesy of “Suede Hedgehog,” Rice’s very own tribute band to “Silk Sonic,” a musical duo made up of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak. Although the tiny desk concert only lasted about 20 minutes the atmosphere was electric, and Coffeehouse — their venue — was packed with listeners. “Opia,” the title of this year’s visual and dramatic arts senior showcase, is defined by the artists as “the intense vulnerability of looking someone in the eye, and the beautiful discomfort of seeing yourself reflected in their gaze.” These concepts of introspection and interpersonal connection resonate powerfully across the diverse bodies of work produced by a class of 17 artists, who will open up their showcase to the Rice community on Thursday April 18.

crimson_2024_19,"For over a century, a red oak stood on Harvard Divinity School’s campus. In 2018, it was announced that the tree would be chopped down.Enraged and impassioned, students of all backgrounds came together and protested the decision for months. When the decision to cut it down became final, dozens of students from different religious communities came together in a mourning ritual for the tree. They shared its stories, recited poetry, joined in song, and — in its final days — mourned. On the day of the tree’s removal, they returned to saya final goodbyeto their beloved friend. The life and death of this oak can teach us two important lessons about our capacity for empathy, as individuals and within our communities. The first lesson concerns the preservation of our own humanity through recognition of others’. Harvard students could empathize with a tree but, if recent campus events are anything to go by, can’t extend the same empathy to their human peers. As we protest wars across the world — from the Middle East to Ukraine — some students forget that many of their peers, myself included, experience these conflicts on a deeply personal level. We go to bed praying that our friends and family will still be alive tomorrow, and when we open our eyes the next day, we rush to our phones, hearts in our throats, to dispel our worst nightmares. All those affected by these tragedies deserve unconditional empathy, regardless of their views or nationality. As a Jewish-Israeli student, the past few months on Harvard’s campus have been some of the most difficult I’ve ever had to endure. As I experienced grief like never before for the roughly 1,200 of my people killed on Oct. 7, many of my classmates, even ones I considered friends, turned their heads the other way in what they saw as acts of political protest. They forgot that I am not my government or my country, but a person who has never needed a hug more. One of my classmates refused to look at me and, I later learned, was happy to hear of my departure from our course, which I left because it had become a hostile environment. After I interviewed on Israeli national television about the state of antisemitism on campus, another student posted the following on Sidechat: “Blondie pro-doxing, pro-genocide sophomore really thinks she is the shit for going on israeli media a couple days ago. She looks just as dumb as her nose is crooked.” This hatred is, of course, as ironic as it is offensive and false. For speaking publicly about the antisemitism I had experienced at Harvard, I was met with even more blatant antisemitism. In acknowledging my struggle to be safe and accepted on Harvard’s campus, I have been pushed further away. The second lesson we can learn from the tree regards our ability to come together as a community when we experience loss. If campus turmoil over the past few months has revealed anything, it’s that our student body is fragile and easily divided. In times of strife, we must resist the temptation to become further entrenched in our beliefs and grow further divided. Instead, we must strive to support each other, find solidarity in our mutual grief, and endure together. Rather than denying others experiences of bigotry, we need to fight all forms of hatred together. Our dearth of empathy results from — and exacerbates — our unwillingness to even listen to opposing views. We espouse the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion but let them fall by the wayside when it comes to those we disagree with. We avoid these conversations because they would make us confront the reality that the person on the other side is a human just like ourselves. Just like that, nuance disappears: One side is made wholly right, and the other wholly wrong; one side is deemed deserving of mercy, while the other must accept pain. When we view individuals as nothing more than their religion, politics, or ethnicity and rush to mark them as the enemy, we forget that pain is not a competition and grief is not mutually exclusive. The only path forward is to step outside of the comfort of our echo chambers and truly talk to one another. Ask someone you think you will disagree with to grab a meal and receive their views as well-meant and sincerely-held, just as you doubtless view your own. You might not leave the conversation as friends, but such an experience will serve as a reminder of a truth too easily forgotten: We are all human and deserve empathy, especially when we’re hurting. If we hope to leave here as the leaders Harvard claims to produce, we must commit to an education that extends beyond the classroom. The poems we analyze or equations we solve will not serve us unless we learn the value of empathy, humility, and critical self-reflection. The unfortunate truth is that, until then, Harvard’s students will continue to work tremendously hard to achieve academic excellence, all while failing to meet a basic standard of human decency. I am only left to hope that, one day, students on this campus will be treated with the same empathy and care as a tree.

ubyssey_2024_19,"Feb. 28, 2024 Written byRabbinical Association of Vancouver Editor s Note: After this article was first published, AMS Councildecided during its February 28 meetingto remove the referendums discussed here for failure to comply with the AMS Bylaws. The Rabbinical Association of Vancouver represents the unified voices of local rabbis. Dear Mr. Du and AMS Council Members, We are reaching out to you as rabbis of synagogues in the Vancouver community. We are gravely concerned about some of the recent developments at UBC that affect Jewish students and we write to ask you to please reject the recent referendum that poses a significant threat to the inclusivity, diversity and fairness that define UBC. This referendum, which seeks to call on UBC to terminate Hillel BC s lease, support BDS and sever academic ties with Israel, affects not just a segment of our student body but strikes at the very principles upon which our university stands. As rabbis who went to universities in North America, we remember fondly the diversity on our campuses, as well as the safe spaces that our Hillels provided, including religious, cultural and social programming for not just Jewish students, but anyone interested in connecting. The fact that Hillel Houses at UBC and around the world engage in frequent interfaith and intercultural programming and dialogue, and have done so for many decades, only brings more irony to the suggestion that Hillel should be kicked off of campus. This is a stark reminder of the antisemitism that Jews have faced for centuries as we’ve been driven from prohibited from public spaces and even forcibly removed from countries themselves. For a lot of our history, and even until recent times in Canada and elsewhere, Jews were not allowed in large numbers, or at all, in universities. Will this be one of the next steps for UBC and the AMS? Another part of the referendum, which proposes the removal of Israel from the university s exchange program roster, is frankly quite disturbing. Many of us studied at universities in Israel, for a semester or year, or even longer, thriving in the sea of ideas and knowledge that should be present in an institution of higher learning. But more than that, we interacted with and befriended, fellow students, and professors, from a large multitude of backgrounds: Christian, Muslim, Arab, Druze, Bedouin and Jewish. Shutting down academic exchange does the opposite of what is vital and needed in this divided world. By allowing this referendum onto the ballot, the AMS risks sanctioning an environment where antisemitism can flourish under the guise of political discourse. This is not the legacy that UBC should aspire to. A university must remain a beacon of safety and support for all its students, including its Jewish population. Also, the proposed by-law amendment to alter council representation clearly aims to exclude certain voices, particularly those of Jewish students, from our community s dialogue. This is not merely a departure from UBC s commitment to equity and inclusivity; it is a step towards a divisive and exclusionary governance model. The stakes of endorsing these referendums are high, with long-lasting implications for the AMS s reputation (as well as UBC’s reputation and the cohesive fabric of our UBC community. They represent more than policy changes; they are a test of our collective resolve against antisemitism and exclusion. We count on your leadership to do the right thing. The integrity of our treasured local university and the welfare of its entire student body are in your hands.

thetech_mit_2024_24,"Colonizers write about flowers. I tell you about children throwing rocks at Israeli tanks seconds before becoming daisies. –Noor Hindi, “Fuck Your Lecture on Craft, My People Are Dying” Today I learned my former host-brother is sleeping on the cold, cratered streets of Deir al-Balah in Gaza – his house destroyed by an Israeli missile, his cousins and uncle assassinated, his family surviving off animal feed and a plant calledkhoubiza, or mallow, which grows wild between the gutted concrete and shorn rebar. We’am, a host-sister, told me four months ago the bread lines grow long. I wake up every day wondering if she is dead. Fadi, a dentist student I met in Cairo is now trapped in Rafah with his elders, his family home destroyed by an Israeli bomb, ‘fighting to preserve the humanity that remains,’ he told me.Ma bdi akl. Bdi aish – ‘I don’t want food; I want to live.’ At least30,000people have been killed by the Israeli military since October – among the highest rates of killing in any war of this century. About 1.9 million or 85% of Gaza’s population are displaced, and the World Health Organizationprojectsanother 74,000 will die of starvation and disease in the next six months. The Israeli military, with American arms and taxes, has destroyed levels of civilian infrastructure on par with the Nazi and Allied bombing campaigns of Guernica, Dresden, Warsaw, Hiroshima, and Tokyo. The horror is palpable in the mass graves, the ruins of churches, mosques, schools, hospitals, and libraries, the cries of children buried under rubble which we hear on Instagram every day. This war is also driven by clear genocidal impulses. “I am personally proud of the ruins of Gaza”saidIsraeli minister May Golan last week, “that every baby, even 80 years from now, will tell their grandchildren what the Jews did.” This retributive sentiment is not limited to Golan’s mainstream Likud party or MIT alumnus Benjamin Netanyahu, who sits at the helm of the Israeli government. It is shared by cabinet ministers, the major parties, military brass, and common soldiers. The sentiment is obvious in the smiles of Israeli soldiers who jeer at and humiliate their hostages, in the pride and impunity with which they livestream their favorite collection of dead women’s underwear, in the glee of Israeli counter-protestors whoblockthe few aid trucks into Gaza and eat cotton candy and slushies while Gazans on the other side starve. The sentiment is also shared by the broader Israeli public,two-thirdsof whom oppose “the transfer of humanitarian aid to Gaza residents.” This festival of horrors did not begin with the Hamas attack on October 7. Societies do not disfigure into fascist revelry overnight. What is happening in Gaza is the dark fruit of over a century of settler colonialism and apartheid in the Holy Land, consecrated by American firepower, ideology, and institutions. Agenda Setting and Things Left Unsaid MIT plays a unique role in this unholy alliance. It is a prestigious academic node of the U.S. military-industrial complex and the head of $23.5 billion endowment. When my comrades and I in the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA challenge this node, we face a withering campaign of sanctions, hate speech, and misdirection. This is partially manifested in the way MIT chooses to define the relevant issue space. In my field of political science, there is an old insight by E.E. Schattschneider that “some issues are organized into politics while others are organized out.” The people who set agendas, who decide the rules of the game, and define the terms of debate have a special kind of authority. They decide, in other words, the institutional arena in which popular contention happens. This agenda-setting is sometimes called the hidden, “second face” of power. At MIT in 2024, a core issue organized intouniversity politics is the “question” of free speech over campus safety and order, particularly in view of protests against Israeli apartheid and the ongoing, mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza. By the lights of President Sally Kornbluth, Provost Cynthia Barnhart, and Chancellor Melissa Nobles, the twin obligations of campus order and free speech are imagined as a trade-off – one that requires a delicate “balance” and lends itself to obsessive scrutiny into such high-stakes affairs as whether the MIT CAA properly filled out an event form or met with administrators three business days in advance before a vigil. According to President Kornbluth’sletter, the CAA was suspended for violating these “normal permission processes.” Its MIT-hostedwebsitewas shut down and 13 of its student organizers were sanctioned presumably for the same reason. Now isn’t the enforcement of reasonable, ‘rules for the road’ for campus protest always a good thing? No. As Martin Luther King Jr. explained in hisLetter from a Birmingham Jail,a law can be “just on its face but unjust in its application.” As he explains: “I was arrested Friday on a charge of parading without a permit. Now there is nothing wrong with an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade, but when the ordinance is used to preserve segregation and to deny citizens the first amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and peaceful protest, then it becomes unjust…I hope you can see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law as the rabid segregationist would do. This would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do it openly, lovingly...” MIT uses its rules to preserve ties with an Israeli apartheid state and de-mobilize students of conscience toward less political fora. It’s also clear we should be skeptical of MIT’s framing. Universities do not threaten students with suspension over jangled doorknobs or event forms, any more than the Confederacy went to war with the U.S. North over abstract theories of federalism and states’ rights. In W.E.B. Du Bois’ words, slave-holding Virginia fought “for property and privilege.” Similarly, MIT suspends its anti-apartheid students not out of an abstract commitment to rules about permits; Fossil Free MIT held asit-inaround the clock in the Infinite Corridor for four straight months in 2016, despite violatingregulationsin force at the time against after-hours activity. The Black Graduate Student Association have righteously disrupted the peace with protests in and around Lobby 7 over the 2019/2020 year, while groups like MIT Students Against War and Democratize MIT havemarchedthrough the halls of the School of Architecture and Planning in protest of the institute’stieswith convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, libertarian oil baron David Koch, and the autocratic Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Do you think they worried about permits? Nor are the admin’s sanctions exactly about safety; both actions in Lobby 7 on November 7 and February 12 as well as all events in between were peaceful, non-violent, allowed egress, and gave public notice. No organizer incited harassment or hatred against any individual or ethnic group. I know because I was there and because the reports by MIT’s own admin andfacultysay so. Instead MIT administrators, under pressure, shut down anti-apartheid students and cancel their events to preserve a particular status quo of power and reputation. This pressure comes from sections of the U.S. Congress, donor class, faculty, trustees, and staff, who see the CAA and our peers at Harvard, Brandeis, and elsewhere as an unruly and potentially bigoted mob that must be taught a lesson. These sanctions are emblematic of a new red scare in national media, whose hysteria about wide-spread antisemitism in the pro-Palestine student movement is exceeded only by the dull tranquility of general MIT student life. According to two orthodox Jewish studentswritingin November, “campus life has, for the most part, remained the same.” MIT remains a place where students go to class and struggle over p-sets, where the dining halls offer kosher and halal options, where Hillel, Chabad, and the MIT Israel Alliance run rallies, speaker circuits, and inter-collegiatekumzit,where “Jewish and Muslim students peacefully coexist” at MIT’s Religious Activity Center, “as they have for decades,” where campus initiatives such as Standing Against Hate and Dialogues Across Difference trundle along, but where most students, for better or worse, are stubbornly apathetic toward political and human rights causes they don’t think immediately affect them. What then are the issues ‘organized out’ of university politics? First, MIT receivesdirectfunding by the Israeli Ministry of Defense for surveillance and ballistic targeting research. Consider the project names from MIT’s financialdisclosures: Algorithms for Underwater Persistent Monitoring, Multifunctional Fiber System for Magnetic Wave Sensing, Heterogenous Multiagent Systems for Perimeter Defense Problems, and Rapidly Scanning Random Trees for Pursuit Evasion Games. Should we not be disturbed? “Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power,” said Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., “We have guided missiles and misguided men.” Second, MIT hosts venues such as the Startup Exchange to connect its students and faculty to weapon manufacturers like Elbit, Raytheon, Caterpillar, Inc and BAE system. These firms are the raw suppliers of Israeli occupation hardware – its drones, D9 bulldozers, fighter jets, and artillery.Lockheed Martineven sponsors a $150,000 seed fund, administered by the MIT International Science and Technology Initiative, to connect students with its weapon laboratories and offices in Israel. Third, the MIT Corporation dynamically manages a $23.5 billion endowment. In a world of increasingly complex asset securitization (ETFs, hedge funds, and private equity , the specifics of MIT’s opaque portfolio are difficult to fully chart. But ifinvestigationsat Harvard are any guide, endowments as large as MIT’s likely hold assets of companies which the UN, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International believe to support the Israeli settler enterprise in the occupied Palestinian territories. Does MIT also invest in Israeli bonds, like Norway’s sovereign wealth fund did until a few weeks ago? We don’t fully know. Finally, MIT holds the unique distinction of being the only American university to host a weapons lab entirely bankrolled by the U.S. Department of Defense; the Lincoln Laboratories currentlyholda $20 billion contract over the 2015-2025 period and conduct classified research in ballistics, surveillance, reconnaissance, cyberwarfare, and “war games.” The dark fruits of these innovations are ultimately routed not just to the U.S. military itself but re-packaged in the form of aid to American client states and allies. The state of Israel receives thelion’s shareof such Foreign Military Financing (FMF grants. Of course, none of these issues are on the table when MIT sends campus-wide announcements about the CAA or organizes a seminar on antisemitism. Why would it? There are no institutional incentives absent a vigorous, disruptive anti-war movement among students and faculty. And so the tension between what’s said and unsaid slides into a bizarre kind of Orwellian doublethink: MIT condemns the incitement of violence, but then hosts a research lab to perfect state violence. It talks endlessly about a safe campus but collaborates with the Israeli military to make a very unsafe Middle East. It stands against hate but not against genocide. It extols free speech but then sanctions the students who use free speech. Its President introduces a principle of “institutional neutrality” on world crises while MIT collaborates with a principal party in said crisis. Whose Rules? In the end, MIT asks the CAA to follow rules. Very well. Must institutions follow rules? When universities – their endowments and weapon research labs – provide material support to a foreign government engaged in the ethnic cleansing of a civilian population, are they breaking the rules? Rules like the Geneva and Genocide Conventions, the Material Support clause, the Leahy Laws? Or do rules just mean that students fill out event forms? Instead, students of conscience are encouraged to de-mobilize toward less political fora, to refocus their passions toward the question of whose feelings are hurt and why, to subordinate the causes of justice to the more worthy goal of a “smooth functioning of the campus community,” to protest but only in ways that are inoffensive, undisruptive and easily ignored, and to engage in civil ‘Dialogues across Difference’ – a worthy activity, but far from an activism that challenge power and vested interest. Do you see the subtle shift? The political is evacuated of its moral urgency. The material erodes into the discursive. The solidarity of ‘We’ collapses into the attention-seeking of ‘I’. The demand for justice and equality is abandoned in favor of a preference for order. No. Conscience requires that MIT reinstate the CAA, retract its threats against student organizers, and remove bureaucratic obstructions to protest. These are intermediate steps, of course. The long-term goal is that the MIT Corporation capitulates to a rising tide of student and faculty power; that it stops accepting money from the Israeli military, ends partnerships with arms companies like Lockheed Martin that sell to the Israeli military; divests its endowment and declares it free of Israeli bonds and the stock of companies that facilitate the occupation of the Palestinian territories; and announces clear redlines to the U.S. federal government that Lincoln Labs research should not benefit the Israeli government so long as it engages in policies of apartheid, occupation, and genocide. This agenda invites a list of ignorant and cynical complaints. Aren’t we missing the main villain? Aren’t universities soft targets? Why not protest at the local, state, or federal capitol instead of in Lobby 7? Or just call Congress representatives? Why not be satisfied with campus teach-ins, vigils, charity events, and raising awareness? Why waste energy punching at walls that won’t budge?Studiesshow for instance that the divestment campaigns for Free South Africa in the 1980s had no long-term impact on company share price. Why attempt pressure tactics on MIT that will not seriously impede Israel’s ability to procure weapons or MIT graduate labor? Why be so focused on Israel anyway while Indonesia occupies West Papua, China, Tibet, and Russia Ukraine? Aren’t you just cosplaying revolutionary for your own psychological benefit? The answer is that universities like MIT do matter as targets of student activism; they are complicit in a regime of Israeli apartheid but espouse public commitments to equality and human flourishing. These contradictions can be challenged by students and faculty who do not enjoy such unique leverage in other arenas. And because of Israel’s unique and historic dependence on American public finance, arms, and diplomacy, students at American universities have leverage over Israel to a degree we simply don’t have for the people of West Papua, Tibet, or Ukraine. It is true that divesting MIT of Israel, like the divestment campaigns against apartheid South Africa, may have no long-term impact on company profits or the Israeli bond market; less scrupulous actors buy up the divested shares. Same story for arms embargoes or consumer boycotts. But this critique misses the point. To divest a university like MIT, or strip it of ties to Israeli military, or announce a majorstrike pledgeto withhold our labor from firms complicit in the Israeli occupation sends a costly signal about our values. The struggle against oppressive regimes is a struggle against their legitimacy as much as their material capabilities. If Israel can oppress Palestinians with our science, let them do it without us. We do not need to participate. MIT should, instead, affirm human life. Of course, MIT is just one front in generating momentum for a mass movement and making inroads into state power. It is the beginning, not the end. It is not limited to campus direct action. Members from the MIT CAA have protested at the Capitol twice, on November 4 and January 13. We show up in Boston and at the Cambridge City Council regularly. We hold teach-ins, withLeila Farskh,Les Field, andMiko Peled, and these complement the events organized by coalition members – the teach-ins byMIT Black Student Unionon Black/Palestinian solidarity, shabbat dinners byMIT Jews for Ceasefire, the political readings ofReadings for Revolution, and fundraisers byPalestine@MIT. The CAA is a broad coalition; it contains the multitudes of the MIT student fabric – Christian, Jewish, Muslim, secular, Black, White, Arab, Desi, Hispanic, Queer, graduate, undergraduate, and so on. It is united by the principle that the fight for Palestinian liberation occurs within a broader movement for the liberation of all oppressed peoples and that every human being has the right to a life of dignity. Motives We are each moved to support Palestine for different reasons. For me, the Holy Land is a place of profound meaning to my Christian faith. It is where I discovered Oscar Romero’s “violence of love” that beats weapons into sickles for work. Palestine is where my friends live under apartheid and occupation. This Israeli occupation is a brutal and degrading regime I have seen with my own eyes over my time living in the Palestinian territories and in Jerusalem itself. I hear it in the stories of Gazan children who stayed in my family home over the years with the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund to receive medical treatment. I support the Palestinian people because I am tired of watching old men and women on video show me scabs and bruises from when they were detained and beaten in Israeli military. I am haunted by the orphan in Gaza who tells me in Arabic that all his family were killed and that he sleeps on the unlit road hoping someone would run him over. There are at least 17,000 orphans now in Gaza. I support the end to apartheid because Mahmoud Darwish said “the occupier and myself – both of us suffer from exile. He is an exile in me and I am the victim of his exile.” Because in the state of Israel today, about 2 million Arab citizens of Israel live under surveillance, many in communities suffering under organized abandon by the state and planned “judaization.” Because in Jerusalem, my friend Ahmed lives in annexed Israeli territory, but he and his wife do not have full voting rights. There are 372,000 of them. Because Iman in Ramallah has never seen the Mediterranean or the Sea of Galilee. To do so requires a permit, like the old South African pass laws. Should she fall in love, she cannot easily marry a Palestinian from Haifa, Nazareth, or Jerusalem (or a Jew for that matter , without leaving the country. I support the end to apartheid because my mother’s friend Samir lives with his three children in Bethlehem enclosed by checkpoints, walls, watchtowers, and ever-growing Israeli settlements. An Israeli citizen in the same physical space falls under Israeli civil law; Samir falls under Israeli military law. There are 2.7 million such Palestinians in the West Bank. I support the end to apartheid because my colleague Dana lives in the diaspora, cut off from the land of her grandparents who were expelled by Zionist militias. Anyone born of a Jewish mother can easily visit or obtain residency rights in the land of Israel and historic Palestine. The Palestinian diaspora cannot, and there are 6 million of them. I support the end to apartheid because in 1948, more than 90% of Palestine’s Christian and Muslim Arabs within the borders of the declared state of Israel were expelled as stateless refugees. The few who remained, many in northern cities such as Nazareth and Haifa, lived under military rule until 1966. Upon winning the 1967 war against its Arab neighbors, Israel then occupied the Sinai, Golan Heights, Gaza and the West Bank – subjecting large, urbanized populations of Palestinians in the latter two regions to a regime of military rule that has lasted now more than half a century. In 1980, Israel formalized its annexation of East Jerusalem, conferring on Palestinian residents of Jerusalem a special ID status short of full citizenship and voting rights. With the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, Israel outsourced the governance of major Palestinian cities in the occupied territories to the newly-created Palestinian Authority but retained about two-thirds of the land, called Area C, for its own military and settler enterprise. I support the end to apartheid because these settlers live under different laws, hold different IDs, drive on different roads, attend different schools, and vote in different elections than their native Palestinian neighbors. Their most influential voices in Knesset politics (Tkuma, Otzma Yehudit, Jewish Home, Likud parties embrace an irridentist, messianic, theocratic, and far-right vision of Jewish supremacy at any cost. Since 2003, Israel has built a massive Separation Wall through Jerusalem and the West Bank. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005, swapping a direct land occupation for a crippling blockade by air, land, and sea. Some of my fellow MIT students take issue with the chant “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” But do you know what actually exists from the river to the sea? A fractured patchwork of different political jurisdictions, within which about seven million Palestinians live without the same basic rights as seven million Jews. Human rights groups call it apartheid. It is an apartheid of walls, concrete, checkpoints, housing demolitions, settler attacks, censorship, confiscated land, and imprisonment without trial. Inevitably, this regime inspires armed and at times brutal resistance. As Thomas Paine wrote of the uprisings against the French plantation colony in Haiti in the 1790s, “It is the natural consequence of slavery and must be expected every where.” The last few decades have been punctuated by periodic, devastating wars in Gaza, where Hamas organizes the last hold-out of serious Palestinian armed resistance to Israeli rule. Tareq Baconicallsthis cycle the “violent equilibrium.” Since the early 2000s, Israel created a security architecture that would allow Israel to divide-and-conquer the West Bank and Gaza, prevent the emergence of a Palestinian state, and repress any serious resistance to its rule. The implicit wager of Israel’s right-wing rulers was that the cost of these wars would be small enough to be ignored by the Israeli public. That the Palestinians, entombed behind concrete and fences, could be ignored forever. One wonders if the October 7 attacks have torn asunder this illusion. These wars of course reflect a colonial double standard: that any Palestinian violence is thesui generisact of a savage, not of a severely constrained political actor operating in the Manichean divisions of the settler-colony. That Palestinian violence justifies Israeli violence of any form – hospitals, mosques, churches, schools, apartment buildings, power plants, civil infrastructure are all valid targets. That no Israeli violence ever justifies any Palestinian violence (one must suffer occupation with saintly resolve, even gratitude ; that Israel has an iron-clad right to self-defense, but that Palestinians have none. I support the end to apartheid because this unholy and precarious arrangement is underwritten by American weapons, justified publicly by American politicians and diplomats, bankrolled by American taxes, shielded by American military assets, sanctified by American pastors and rabbis, and ignored by the American public. It is an arrangement papered over by MIT itself, which refuses to divest its $23.5 billion endowment from Israeli companies or end its partnerships with the Israeli government and US-based weapons suppliers. Instead, the administration prefers to represent itself, deceptively, as a neutral midwife of higher education. This is a lie. I follow Noam Chomsky, Willard R. Johnson, the MIT Physics Department and other former lights of the MIT community who took a principled stand against war, nuclear armament, and apartheid in their own time, and who connected that stand with the policy of the university. It requires me to say, along with the Palestinian Knesset memberAyman Odeh, “Cursed be they who cry out: Revenge. We choose life.” We choose life in Palestine. This principle also requires us to recognize that basic tradeoff between war and human flourishing which Dwight D. Eisenhower once identified in his Cross of Iron speech: “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.” We want our science and engineering to affirm all human life, not death. Finally, I support the end to apartheid because I am moved by my Palestinian and Israeli comrades: Amjad Iraqi, Mosab Abu Toha, Yuval Avraham, Daniel Boyarin, Gideon Levy, Noura Erakat, Rashida Tlaib. I am guided by the witness of Aaron Bushnell. By leftist Jews in the United States. By the US Civil Rights movement and the black radical tradition. And by the legacies of Irish unification and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. I also recall the 1995 Dayton Accords, which however imperfect, stopped the Bosnian genocide, ended the Balkan war, and established a multi-ethnic, consociational democracy in Bosnia which has held for three decades. These legacies convince me that a meaningful off-ramp to Israeli apartheid and its genocidal war in Gaza requires a permanent and immediate ceasefire, a release of all captives held by Hamas and Israel, an end to the siege on Gaza, a return of refugees to their homes, a war crimes tribunal, and a global campaign to compel Israel to end apartheid in favor of mass enfranchisement, equal rights, and the creation of progressive, secular, social democracy in a free Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean. This is not a utopian or alien position; it is quite possible and rooted in the oldest political visions of the Palestinian national movement and Jewish tradition. The coalitions exist to achieve it. In fact, it’s the only future that does not preserve Israel as an ethnic supremacist state or lead to mass population transfers, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing. To do this, the anti-apartheid coalition must gain leverage into the American state. This process of course starts locally, in places such as MIT or Cambridge. It is what guided me and my partner to support the MIT CAA and participate in the sit-ins, which I understand as a disruptive and conspicuous act of protest and civil disobedience against the will of the MIT administration. We will likely continue to attend and support the coalition at future direct actions. Hamas and Zionists Supporters of Israel may continue to see us as unruly bigots, committing vile acts of anti-Israeli or anti-Jewish hatred that make students feel unsafe on campus. So did white southerners think that integrated bussing made their communities unsafe. “When I criticize a system, they think I criticize them” wrote Thomas Merton. “And that is of course because they fully accept the system and identify themselves with it.” Zionists like to object to a particular means of contention – this or that chant, the defiant tone, a lack of enthusiasm for the depoliticized venues of dialogue. But how do you dialogue in good faith with an ethnic supremacist? “We can disagree and still love each other” said James Baldwin, “unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.” No anti-apartheid student should be obligated to engage in morally exhausting exercises unless they want to. Moreover anti-Zionism – that is, opposition to the establishment and maintenance of a Jewish state by force – is quitekosher. It is rooted in mainstream Jewish tradition and spans Reformed, Conservative, Orthodox and Hassidic sects. Its roots lie in Biblical scripture and the Hebrew prophets, the writings of Rashi, Maimonides, Mendelssohn, Teitelbaum, and Judah Leon Magnes. In secular circles, we see its progressive values at work in the historic Israeli Matzpen and Communist parties, the Hadash, and Israel’s beleaguered human rights community – B’Tselem, Breaking the Silence, Yesh Din, and Adalah. In the United States, we have IfNotNow, Jewish Voices for Peace and MIT’s own Jews for Ceasefire. Frequently it is said these groups do not represent the Jewish community. Neither did the Jews who took a stand against apartheid South Africa or volunteered for Freedom Summer in Mississippi. “People who demand justice when they have the luxury of indifference are rarely representative,” Peter Beinart once observed. “That s why we remember their courage.” Zionists in the press and on campus sometimes tar us as Hamas apologists and to that end harass and dox students by putting their personal information on blacklist sites like Canary Mission. This is the tactic of bullies and cowards, but it is likely driven by a sense of insecurity. “I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly” wrote James Baldwin, “is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.” Indeed, it can be painful to see the dead bodies of one’s kin in Sderot and Be’eri; it was painful for me, and I am not Israeli. But to go beyond vapid condemnations of Hamas, one must ask why Hamas’ call to arms resonates among the young orphans who make up its brigades. As a scholar of Islamist politics, I point to the classic studies of Hamas by Khaled Hroub, Jeroen Gunning, Sara Roy, and Tareq Baconi, who locate the overriding answer to this question in the intransigence of the Israeli occupation. Put yourself in their shoes. If you watched a foreign people take your grandfather’s land, torture your uncle, shoot your cousin, imprison your sister, invade your holy site, and subject your nation to a humiliating siege in a calorie-counted ghetto while the world watches and does nothing, would it not also be tempting to take up arms? It was so in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. It was resentment against British rule, not bigotry against the Protestant, that propelled Irish youth to join the Irish Republican Army struggle in Ulster. To end the cycle of violence in Palestine, one needs a Good Friday Agreement. One must show the world that mass, civic non-violence also can make material gains, that it carries dignity and ennobles. This is precisely what the MIT CAA is trying to do. Finally, the cynics might see us as deluded peaceniks – utopian, cringe, stupid. Yet I am similarly struck by the pessimism of those who until the very last moment could not imagine the Berlin Wall falling, who saw “one man, one vote” in South Africa as a pipe dream, and who believed Jim Crow was etched in stone. For this reason, I think we must commit to an irrational, radical hope – to a solidarity that is global and indivisible, that is founded as Robin Kelly oncewrote, “not on shared experience but shared principles.” No one can fully grasp what lies beyond the moral horizon. But we can continue the long march to that horizon, undaunted by the world’s grief – committed to “mourn the dead” as the protest slogan goes, “and fight like hell for the living” – from the river to the sea to every mountain top. I hope you join us. People are dying. Richard Solomon is a PhD student in the MIT Department of Political Science where he studies Middle East politics and the political economy of trade.

crimson_2024_58,"The United States is on the prospect of electing a twice-impeached and many times-indicted politician as the 47th president of the United States. In light of the threat Donald J. Trump’s reelection would pose to the stability of democracy and civil rights, it’s easy to miss another item on his hit list: higher education. The former president has pledged to heavily tax the endowments of large universities like Harvard in order to create an online “American Academy,” which he’s framed as an alternative to the schools “turning our students into communists and terrorists.” Speaking to The Crimsonabout what this means for Harvard, Government professor Steven Levitsky predicted that the University willcave to political pressure, choosing someone uncontroversial — likely, a moderate white man — as former president Claudine Gay’s successor to appease conservative critics. They should not. In this upcoming search process, the Harvard Corporation must choose a president with the will, might, and passion to defend the institution of higher education and its values. Harvard is facing internal turmoil, attacks on DEI, and questions regarding antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other grave threats to student well-being. The next president should be ready to address these concerns. But these concerns cannot dictate our next president. Caving to external political pressure when choosing the next president would violate principles of scholarship, belonging, and truth. Setting the precedent for a politically chosen president would undermine Harvard’s commitment to its fundamental values and its ability to be a catalyst for innovation and research. The mission of Harvard University is to “advance new ideas and promote enduring knowledge.” We don’t need a president to be a field-leading scholar to attain that goal. Throughout history, this institution has affected our society through innovation. From Jennifer Doudna pioneering CRISPR gene editing to Claudia Goldin’s award-winning research on the gender pay gap, Harvard affiliates have made profound impacts on a number of our society’s practices. At least as valuable as research experience in a leader is representation and true devotion to diverse scholarship. Despite the controversy surrounding her scholarship, President Gay brought extensive administrative experience to the role and provided important representation to many students on campus. While the ongoing congressional investigation into antisemitism on campus must not be ignored, we cannot allow the unfair attacks lodged by conservative critics against DEI to cause us to deviate from our commitment to diversity. A potential Trump administration re-do would be unpredictable and unprecedented. Harvard and other private universities would suffer losses under some of Trump’s proposed policies. Still, Harvard can survive. In fact, they’ve sent a clear message to those targeting the University: prepare for battle. Harvard has taken a number of defensive measures to protect the institution against right-wing attacks on higher education. Just last week,The Crimson learned that the University had retainedformer Deputy Attorney General, Sally Q. Yates, to represent Harvard in the congressional antisemitism investigation. Her firm, King & Spalding, also employs former Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who worked under the Trump administration for two years. Yates and Rosenstein seem to make King & Spalding a strategic pick. Still, to prepare for the oncoming attacks on higher education requires more than a good choice of attorney. Harvard must continue repairing its image, strive to limit turmoil on campus, and recruit allies across the political spectrum to counteract conservative educational proposals. Through these steps, Harvard will prepare for the onslaught of policy changes that may occur. No matter who the next president is, higher education will remain under attack. The assault on elite universities is not new, and it will likely continue for decades. To weather them, it is in the best interest of the Harvard community to select a president who will move our institution forward — not temper criticism from outside forces. Correction:A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the University had retainedformer Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates in the week preceding its publication. In fact, The Crimson had merely learned that she had been retained in that week. M. Austen Wyche ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Canaday Hall."
stanforddaily_2024_8,"After six months of bargaining, Stanford Graduate Workers’ Union (SWGU reached a tentative agreement with the University for a grievance procedure, which will be the enforcement mechanism for the forthcoming first contract. However, the University proposed to exclude sexual harassment, sexual assault and other prohibited sexual conduct as grievable from the contract. “Any determination pursuant to the University’s Sexual Harassment policy shall be final and not grievable under this Agreement.” This exclusion could have been predicted from Stanford, the institution that employedJay Fliegelman(accused of assault, deceased andFranco Moretti(accused of harassment and assault, retired , and currently employsVincent Barletta(who violated Stanford’s sexual harassment policy in the early 2010s . The DailyinvestigatedBarletta in June 2022, but he quietly returned to teaching this winter in spite ofcallsfor his termination. The latest proposal says nothing about power abuse and bullying. Our colleagues at MITsaidit best: “protected class … does not cover cases of power-based harassment, more commonly called bullying.” Like MIT graduate workers, Stanford graduate workers deserve comprehensive protections that will allow them to effectively secure their persons and their labor against illegal infringement including harassment and discrimination in all its forms. Reporting rates for harassment and discrimination of all types are abysmally low at Stanford. OfIDEALrespondents,only 6%of graduate workers who experienced discrimination and/or harassment made a formal report. That means 94% resolved to not make a formal complaint. Yet43%of them did seek out resources for advice, support, or information. These numbers suggest that graduate workers do not see the University’s existing procedures as capable of providing meaningful recourse. In bargaining with SWGU, University representatives admitted that low reporting stems from lack of trust in existing procedures, and argued that trust takes time to build. They also argued that protections offered by the union against sexual harassment, sexual assault, other prohibited sexual conduct, power abuse, and bullying would be redundant to existing procedures under the University’s Sexual Harassment policy, and not improve reporting outcomes. Trust will not arise from procedures that are both wholly inadequate and lacking oversight from the start. Under the current system, graduate workers report sexual misconduct to the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response & Education (SHARE Title IX office or the Stanford Police Department. But advocates for survivors of sexual violencedecryexisting reporting processes as confusing and lacking transparency. Besides, SHARE Title IX is simply not equipped to adjudicate for power differentials across academic ranks. Take for example the fact that only11%of graduate respondents to the IDEAL survey “strongly agreed” with the statement, “In my department or work unit, it is easy to discuss difficult issues and problems.” This finding alone tells us that fear of retaliation is an everyday reality for most graduate workers at Stanford. But SHAREreporteda grand total of zero—nil!—reports of retaliation in AY 2022-2023. As it stands, the University directs graduate workers to their dean if the complaint involves power abuse, bullying, and/or an allegation of sexual misconduct that does not trigger a SHARE Title IX investigation. (Little known fact: the University’s human resources department does not process complaints against faculty. The dean individually and subjectively judges the complaint as meeting an undisclosed threshold of requiring an investigation. With or without SHARE Title IX investigations, the dean is the last stop for graduate workers dealing with— or simply suspecting — sexual harassment, sexual assault, other prohibited sexual conduct, power abuse and/or bullying. Once a Title IX investigation concludes, SHARE Title IX typically issues recommendations to the Dean of the respondent, which might include sanctions of the respondent. The University’s Sexual Harassment policy does not guarantee the implementation of these recommendations. As a result, bad actors behave with impunity at Stanford, because they know that they will likely never face sanctions or public scrutiny. Recall the case ofBarletta. The pseudonymous Rachel told investigators that she went to her dean to ask for institutional support on how to navigate her working relationship with Barletta. She recalled Dean Debra Satz “laughing and telling her, ‘The only thing I can think to offer you is advice from an older, wiser woman, which is when a man is acting in a way that makes you uncomfortable, you just have to tell him to stop.’” Then Satz showed Rachel the door. Rachel was not the first graduate worker to be impacted by Barletta and the University’s callous betrayal. Barletta had “sexually had harassed his student a decade ago” and “his inappropriate behavior had never stopped.”The pseudonymous Jeanne said of Barletta’s continued behavior: “it’s all a riff on the same story … he has refined his techniques.” The story is a glaring example of how — when survivors lack real recourse and perpetrators lack accountability — perpetrators are emboldened to continue their harassing behaviors. Graduate workers need union-backed channels to process all grievances, including those that fall under the University’s Sexual Harassment policy. Moving forward, the possibility of filing a union grievance will serve as a deterrent against all forms of discrimination and harassment acknowledged in the contract. Union-supported grievance processes will not only provide a means to challenge misconduct, but also encourage resolution. Under union-backed grievance processes, cases are typically resolved before reaching arbitration, because the prospect of arbitration encourages parties to settle disputes. Additionally, the threat of outside arbitration will further dissuade bad actors. Everything would have been different for Jeanne and Rachel had they had real recourse. Jeanne had neither a union nor a union-backed grievance process, and was left alone to navigate the complex landscape of SHARE Title IX and University administrators, some of whom acted like bullies, “appearing to be looking for a narrative that she “wanted” to be intimately involved with Barletta.” If sanctions following Jeanne had been effective, Rachel might have not faced Barletta’s harassment in the years to come. Instead, “while sanctions from Jeanne’s Title IX case were still in place … Rachel’s case … emerged .” Going forward, the primary point of contact for graduate workers facing misconduct must be SGWU, and not University administrators. The Union must be able to empower graduate workers to seek real recourse regardless of the nature of the mistreatment. With full provisions for non-discrimination, SGWU will play a crucial role in securing the workplace against all illegal infringement through codified procedures. Every union member will have the right to request the presence of a union representative at a disciplinary meeting or at any meeting where disciplinary action is anticipated. Should a graduate worker suspect a violation of their contract or any illegal infringement of their labor rights and decide to take action, their case will be assigned to a union steward, who will be trained, experienced, and legally protected, and will leverage every available resource to address the concern. Moreover, if the graduate worker experiences retaliation after complaining, they will also have full protections because retaliation is not just power-based harassment, but illegal in the state of California. Finally, if cases cannot be resolved through this mediation, the union will have the ability to escalate adjudication to a third-party neutral arbitrator. The only way graduate workers will ensure the safety of their workplace is with a strong contract that includes a union-backed process with full, unrestricted protections.

crimson_2024_23,"Every weekend, without fail, I cannot help but feel a deep sense of FOMO — fear of missing out — when I open social media and see what my friends from home are doing at college. They go to college bars, darties, open parties, tailgates — you name it. I often cannot help but wonder: “What if I didn’t get into Harvard?” When I chose Harvard, I knew that I would not be getting the traditional college experience I had always envisioned. I assumed that I might not have nearly as much of the classic college fun as my family and friends would at their state schools. I accepted this because I knew that the opportunities that would be afforded to me at Harvard would exceed anything any other school could offer me. Perhaps hopefully, in the weeks before I arrived on campus, I thought to myself “how bad could the social life be?” After all, we are (for the most part still a bunch of teenagers and twenty-somethings who should be hard-wired to break rules, make mistakes, do stupid stuff, and — most importantly — have fun. I was wrong. I quickly realized that our campus culture is needlessly averse to fun — thesocial scene is exclusive, students are preoccupied with their professional futures, andadministrative restrictionsoften make things even worse. For those like myself, who expected to have a relatively normal college experience, this can be disheartening. While my friends at other schools are going out to bars, parties, socials, or date nights, I have to cajole my friends to go out with me — that is, on the off chance that I even find an event both accessible and fun. Even days that are supposed to be rowdy — Yardfest, Harvard-Yale, Housing Day — are tainted by strict policies, tailgate bans, and conflicting class times. Friends at other schools are often shocked to hear that readings, papers, and problem sets keep Harvard students in on a Saturday night, but I have heard these excuses more times than I would like to recall. When I tell friends here at Harvard this, they rarely seem surprised — and often sympathize with the party-pooper. Therein lies the problem. We have accepted a culture on campus where perfection comes at the expense of fun. It’s no wonder we are one of themost stressed-out colleges in the country. The University itself reportedin the 2020 “Report of the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health” that normal collegiate levels of stress and pressure “appear to be amplified at Harvard.” This is due in part, it found, to students feeling “pressure to make the most of their time at Harvard” and “taking on too many commitments, feeling guilty if they are not as busy as everyone else seems to be.” There are a number of underlying factors that contribute to these pressures, and many are not specific to Harvard. I am not suggesting that we can make all of our stress suddenly disappear by throwing caution to the wind on Friday and Saturday nights. As students, there are factors affecting the social scene that are outside our control, but we cannot allow this reality to bring us to nihilism. If we collectively decide to lessen the pressure that we put on ourselves and act our age, would we not be happier? I know I would. This could take a variety of forms. Host the kinds of gatherings you want to see — from open and energetic parties to more intimate gatherings with friends — or try new things, like a trip into Boston or attending a Harvard sports game and encouraging friends to join. While this change starts at the level of the individual, a real culture shift will require a group effort. The atmosphere of stress and anxiety — much of it self-imposed — permeates our campus so totally that these straightforward prescriptions are not nearly as realistic as they should be. We don’t need to have our entire lives figured out. One night out will not erase the effort, passion, and care you put in every other evening that week. In any event, a not-quite-perfect GPA from Harvard will not lead you into financial ruin — the world will keep on turning. With a new semester upon us I am begging: Can we please take a step back and start acting like kids? Henry P. Moss IV ’26, a Crimson Editorial Editor, is a History concentrator in Eliot House."
rice_thresher_2024_29,"ByAbhi Jain,Carolyn SuradejvibulandJiya Bhatia1/9/24 11:06pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Access to the internet plays a central role in almost everyone’s lives, especially as we enter an increasingly digitized world. Unfortunately, however,170,000 households in Houstonlack access to the internet. While many of these individuals are adults, a significant portion comprises students of college age. Can you imagine not being able to access Google or Canvas at your every whim? At Rice, we’re incredibly privileged to have internet access provided to us. Admittedly, we often take it for granted, with groans echoing across campus when the “Rice Owls” Wi-Fi goes down for mere minutes. It’s almost incomprehensible to imagine a world without access to Wi-Fi. This is the jarring reality that hundreds of thousands of Houstonians, and over two million Texans, face every day. So, what strides are being made to increase internet access, both across the country and in Texas? One program of relevance is theAffordable Connectivity Program, a federal initiative that provides internet access to qualifying households through a subsidy of $30 per month (and $75 per month for people living on tribal lands with participating internet providers. As of late 2023, the FCC has registered approximately 16.6 million people; however, nearly 35 million eligible households have yet to sign up. Unfortunately, the program is at risk of ending in April, putting millions at risk of losing internet access. This poses the question: What can we do to make a difference? First, we can raise awareness about the ACP to friends and family, who may qualify through federal benefits like SNAP, Medicaid or the Pell Grant. Alternatively, you can consider contacting members of Congress. Currently, the White House is urging Congress to extend funding for the ACP, but discussion has stalled. Efforts to expand broadband access have been bipartisan as President Joe Biden, a Democrat, helped engineer the ACP, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, created the Texas Broadband Infrastructure Fund, putting $1.5 billion toward broadband expansion efforts. If we hope to ensure that the ACP remains funded, we must urge our senators and representatives to push their support behind this initiative. This is especially relevant in Texas, where1.7 million Texans just lost access to Medicaid. Since April 2023, states have been reevaluating Medicaid recipients’ eligibility for the program, following a three-year pause on eligibility checks due to COVID-19. Texas’s Medicaid eligibility requirements are extremely stringent, and because Medicaid is one of the main ways that individuals qualify for the ACP, many households are simultaneously losing access to healthcare and the internet. Hence, it’s vital that we show lawmakers the large impact the ACP has on the community. Students can advocate for continued ACP funding on social media to rally their peers into demonstrating widespread public support. Many organizations are also working to connect individuals to the internet, including EducationSuperHighway and OnlineForAll. One organization, Link Health, is a nonprofit initiative spearheaded by students from Rice, Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Houston, who have witnessed firsthand the impact that internet access has on Houstonians. Today, those without the internet find themselves cut off from friends, family and community. Conversations with diverse patients have revealed stories of missed family milestones and frustration toward the inability to stay connected during challenging times. Without this digital bridge, we lose sight of our connectivity, exacerbating mental health challenges and divisions within society. In addition to impacting mental health, internet access can also dictate physical health. Since COVID-19, telehealth has become a much more accessible means of delivering healthcare; as Rice students, we are lucky to have the Texas Medical Center right at our doorstep, but for many, the nearest clinics or hospitals are over an hour away. Unfortunately, however, telehealth is inaccessible for communities that lack internet access. Hence, by promoting awareness of the ACP, broadening the reach of organizations like Link Health and furthering efforts to bridge the digital divide, we can impact the lives of thousands of Houstonians. This would not only supply internet access, but also improve our collective mental and physical health. We encourage Rice students to contribute toward combating the digital divide by actively advocating for continued ACP funding and spreading awareness of the resources available to improve internet access across the country. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_74,"Joining other universities across the United States, Harvard students protesting the ongoing war in Gaza and their institution’s investments in that war, have constructed an encampment in Harvard Yard. This development follows events at Columbia University, where administrators used the heavy-handed tactics of arrest and suspension to dismantle an encampment constructed by their students. Hours later it reappeared in full force, accompanied by faculty protests against the treatment of students. While the Columbia protesters have made clear that they will face arrest in order to further their cause, others, including donors and Congressional Republicans, have demanded that these protests be brought to an end. Now Harvard faces a similarly difficult choice: Attempt to clear these encampments by disciplining or arresting students or let the encampments remain, perhaps in defiance of University policies, and face the scorn of those who would like to see these protests shut down. But just because university administrators can shut down these protests doesn’t mean they should. History shows quite plainly that using coercive force to close encampments won’t eliminate protests — it could very well strengthen them. People in power, whether administrators at universities, teachers in the classroom, police on the street, prosecutors in the courtroom, or members of Congress, often have a range of powers legally available to them that they can use in any situation, but prudence says they should not. Some may say that rules must always be enforced for the sake of fairness and order. As a college professor dealing with everything from classroom policies on electronic devices to requests for extensions on assignment due dates, I appreciate this perspective. But every teacher also knows how the slavish enforcement of every rule can become a distraction that undermines the greater goal of learning. Teachers and other leaders don’t just robotically enforce rules; they’re people chosen for their wisdom about how and when to judiciously apply them. Political scientists refer to the practice of leaders wisely showing restraint in not maximally exercising power or enforcing policies as “forbearance.” A congressional leader practicing forbearance might seek compromise with the other party even though they have the votes to pass laws on their own because they know that one day the other party may be in power. As the recent history of American politics shows, with Congress deadlocked by endless filibusters, courts languishing without judicial appointments, and the threat of tit-for-tat impeachments, a lack of forbearance can lead to a cycle of escalation and, eventually, ruin. The events on college campuses recently have shown the same pattern of escalation. When leaders at Columbia, seemingly in an attempt to appease grandstanding members of Congress, didn’t practice the restraintused by previous college presidentsfaced with similar protests, student demonstrations only grew. As a result, Columbia has faced even more turmoil and has been forced to move to hybrid instruction. Why would anyone be surprised at this outcome? When protesters are angry at authority, a heavy-handed use of authority is only going to make them more likely to protest. One only needs to look back to the George Floyd demonstrations in 2020 to understand this. And, of course, the arrest of peaceful protesters did little to appease the cynical politicians who are now calling for the removal of Columbia’s president. What happened at Columbia makes the immediate case for forbearance on college campuses clear: Coercive force will not make anybody happy because it will not accomplish anyone’s goals, even those who most want to see the protesters gone. But the case for forbearance isn’t only one of immediate expediency. We practice forbearance for a greater good. Just like a member of Congress should ask whether they are elected only to pass legislation that will help with their reelection or whether they serve a higher purpose for the good of their country, a university leader must ask whether their role is merely to keep their job or nobly serve the higher goals of the university. Would ending these protests allow all voices to be heard? Would ending these protests allow for a free exchange of ideas? Would ending these protests bring us closer to the truth? It’s hard to see how. The alternative for our leaders is to simply wait these protesters out — even if it means life on campus is disrupted a bit because people have to show an ID to get into Harvard Yard or see and hear things they disagree with. But being exposed to controversial views is not only the price of living in a free society — it’s also the great benefit of attending college and having your perspectives challenged. And eventually, as public attention will inevitably shift elsewhere, the reduced spotlight will make things easier on everyone. Of course, leaders could also talk to these student protestors and heartheir demands— many of which, like disclosing the University’s financial ties to companies aiding the occupation of Palestinian territories and the war in Gaza, are eminently reasonable. Why should the financial holdings of universities, places built not to maximize profits but rather to promote truth, be kept secret from their stakeholders? Moreover, a fog of disinformation has covered these protests. Some claim that universities are overrun with antisemitic hordes, while others, including myself andmy colleagues, have seen only peaceful actions from diverse student protesters, including many Jews, earnestly challenging what they see as a grave violation of human rights. University leaders must be clear about what is happening on our campus, rather than letting social media and opportunistic politicians manufacture narratives. There are no easy decisions here. But leaders are exceptional, not because they competently make routine decisions, but because of the qualities they bring when the times are exceptional. Even when they are under extreme pressure to take action, it is leaders who proceed with forbearance who are most often judged kindly in the history books. Ryan D. Enos is a professor of Government."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_9,"Writer’s Note: This article has been edited to reflect accuracy. It has been 13,291 days since an Israeli truck drivercollided with a carcarrying Palestinian civilians. Dec. 9, 1987 is now recognized as the First Intifada. 36 years and innumerable slaughtered Palestinians later, students are calling for university divestment from thegenocidal regimeoccupying the West Bank and Gaza. For the last two weeks, protests, hearings and demonstrations have rung out across the country, and these calls now ring loudly at UCI. Students are demanding UCI’s full divestment from Israel and the United States military’s occupation of native Palestinian land; part of the demands also calls for full financial transparency from the University of California (UC , with an emphasis on their wealth fund management. UCI students, at the time of writing, are staging an encampment in the Physical Sciences Quad. The UCI Police Department (UCIPD , Westminster Police Department, Irvine Police Department, Newport Beach Police Department and Orange County Sheriff’s Officehave been dispatchedto halt the progression of the encampment. Deputies briefly practiced riot formation in the face of a peaceful protest. Students are being denied water, access to restrooms and other support coming from outside the encampment. April 29, 2024, will go down as a day of infamy at UC Irvine — the university has failed its students, and we refuse to back down. The history of student protests reveals how quick institutions are to eliminate students’ rights to free speech. Thelargest student protestsever were held in the 1960s against the Vietnam War and the 1980s against South African apartheid. The anti-Zionist protests we see today are much smaller, despite being the largest student movement so far in the 21st century. In prior movements, protests often escalated to full occupations of buildings, riots and physical combat with police. However, despite appearing even more nonviolent and not damaging school property or harming individuals, today’s protests are facing suppression much sooner than their predecessors. At the University of Texas at Austin, policearrived on horses in riot geardespite there being no signs of violence at the protest. While charges were later dropped, 57 people were arrested. This is a clear sign that administrations are not sending in police because they’re concerned about the safety of their students — it is because they want to silence them. It’s also happening here, at UCI. In situations such as this, legality takes a backseat to morality. What is moral here? Does Chancellor Gillman, UCIPD and every other university department assisting in the containment of the encampment truly believe that they are helping student safety? It is clear that they are actively harming students and their right to freedom of speech and expression by conducting encampment and protest suppression. In the supposed “Year of Free Speech” at UCI, that sentiment has never appeared so dystopian. Now that Chancellor Gillman haslocked down Aldrich Halland refused to speak to UCI Divest lawyers, students have been effectively shut out of conversational approaches to creating change with their own administration. How many more dollars must be invested in companies that do business with the Israeli war machine? Students, as they have for nearly a century, refuse to be complacent with their universities acting against their interests. Universities are nothing without their students and the tuition and labor they receive from them. If schools refuse to serve their students, they have every right to withhold funds, labor, academics and normal university operations. Irvine Mayor Farrah Khan’scallfor the Irvine Police Department to “stand down” is a sign that Orange County leadership knows what is just. This is a call for Chancellor Howard Gillman to stop his cowardice and follow Mayor Khan’s lead. Hisrecent statementclaiming the university will help find a place for protestors to camp out was as performative as it was tasteless. Chancellor, what do you think the purpose of encampment in a populated place such as Physical Sciences is? Public universities are designed to be safe havens for ideas, research and social change. How much longer are we as students supposed to be complacent with the utter disrespect from the UCI administration and the UC system as a whole? Applying pressure to a publicly funded and supposedly public-serving university is a right, and the UC refuses to acknowledge that. Students should never be complacent about genocide. We will not stand down in the face of intimidation by any entity, whether it be law enforcement or university administration. The decision to uphold the supposed “Year of Free Speech” is in your hands, Chancellor Gillman — do right by the students who pay for your salary. Jacob Ramos is a 2023-2024 Opinion Editor.

crimson_2024_62,"To the Black students of the newly admitted class of 2028: Congratulations! Seriously, congratulations. You may hear that word a lot from your family and friends. Still, I have not experienced many moments on campus where the difficulty and achievement of getting into this school as a Black student is acknowledged. As much as you might want to teleport to freshman fall as fast as possible, try to live in the moment. Take the next few months easy. You’ll soon find that feeling pressured into ultra-productivity here is not uncommon. Things can get competitive and exclusive real quickly, so I urge you to celebrate and take pride in your acceptance. I’m not going to harp again on the constant discourse around affirmative action, but I do want you to know this:You belong here. You deserve to be here. This school is yours as much as it is any other student’s. Though I believe the suggestions in this piece will be valuable to the next class of Black students, take them with a grain of salt; I can only speak to the experiences of myself and those around me. For starters, be prepared tobe in the public eye. It is clear that people outside of our campus, unrelated to me or you, will still — forone reasonoranother— focus more on us because we go to Harvard and our skin is black. Because of this, you might already be worried that embracing your racial identity at Harvard is draining. Admittedly, I was unprepared for this unique year, but I have found myself leaning further into the Black community when our value is contested. I have learned to separate the narratives in the media from our community’s worth. No wannabe social media demagogue or leering legislator gets to dictate your value for you. But while the Black community is often a source of support, don’t expect the administration to go out of their way for Black students. I cannot say that I was surprised by their prolonged and unresponsive process ofaddressing Black demandsaftera terrible swatting incidentlast year. The reality is, I don’t believe Black student life is a priority for the Harvard administration. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a priority for Black students. Frustration with the administration is no new obstacle. Black Harvard has a proud history of activism, and it is incredibly special to learn about that history. From campuscivil rights activism, to theLegacy of Slavery Report, to the creation of anAfrican American studies department, students have shown and embraced that being Black at Harvard is inherently political and, often, they’ve succeeded. In my African American Studies tutorial, I have relished the opportunity to explore the Harvard archives, engaging with old posters and newspaper clippings from events like the 1972 student occupation ofMassachusetts Hall, the office of the University’s president. Like those who came before you, I urge you be an engaged member of the community and challenge the institution when you feel overlooked. With that said, there is a delicate balance between engagement and burnout. Remember to take it in, take things slow, and take care of yourself first and foremost. But taking care of yourself can be hard here, too. The pressure to be productive combined with difficulties accessing school-provided mental health support, especially Black providers, is not easy. Again, however, students pull through for each other: There is an extensive network of peer counseling groups on campus. Groups like Room 13, ECHO, Indigo, and more are always available as a resource, and I encourage you to try them if you are feeling alone on campus. That was a lot, I know. But Harvard is more than a dream for you now — it’s a reality, and you deserve some honest thoughts. Two years after my Visitas experience, I cannot imagine myself anywhere else. This Visitas, I hope you appreciate how truly special you are — and how special your Black experience on our campus will be. Zion J.

crimson_2024_124,"It felt like the inevitable ending: Harvard’s interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 has shed his “interim” tag and officially become President Garber. I welcome this development. Indeed, after seven months at the helm with no presidential search process yet begun, it was easy to forget that Garber was still only an “interim” president at all. But ironically, despite the change in title, the Harvard Corporation, the University’s top governing board, has only made it more clear that they view him as simply an interim president, announcing that they will search for his eventual successor at the end of the 2026-2027 academic year. Though I applaud Garber’s three-year extension — not an insignificant amount of time — I wonder why the Harvard Corporation would limit Garber’s presidency at all. Garber has masterfully steered Harvard through some of its most difficult times. Following the tumultuous fall semester of 2023, it was abundantly clear that Harvard needed a steady hand on the tiller. Between the resignation of former President Claudine Gay amid serious accusations of plagiarism, congressional investigations, donor revolt, and a deeply divided student body, Garber had much to do. In the face of these challenges, Garber proved himself to be not only a capable leader, but exactly the leader we needed. He made numerous trips to assuage donor concerns. He made needed clarifications to the rules governing student protest — to the chagrin of protestors, but to the relief of those of us who wish to go to college without the constant national spotlight. He committed Harvard to a policy of institutional neutrality, which should help prevent campus divisions like we saw in the wake of Oct. 7. And he handled a pro-Palestine encampment in the Yard far more deftly than many of our peer institutions and their non-interim leaders. With these resounding successes, it is puzzling that the Corporation is already planning on — nay, expediting — a post-Garber Harvard. I fear the Corporation is selling Garber short in pursuit of someone younger, fresher, or flashier. I will be the first to admit that a Garber presidency is not what many would think of as exciting. But after all the excitement of the past year, would some tranquility and time out of the spotlight be such a bad thing for Harvard? It is far from clear that Harvard needs transformational leadership. If anything, his actions have shown that such a change is not only unwarranted, but unwise. It is the students, faculty, researchers that make this institution great — not Massachusetts Hall. Due in no small part to Garber, Harvard is in a significantly better position to tackle the challenges of the coming decades than it was mere months ago. His steady leadership has quelled the media storm, giving us space to make decisions about the future with less of the pressure of public scrutiny. Just compare how often Harvard appeared in the headlines during the fall of 2023 with the spring of 2024, even with the encampment. The contrast is quite stark. No doubt there were many circumstances entirely out of Gay’s control as she attempted to steward Harvard, among them the attacks targeting her identity as a Black woman. This does not change the fact, however, that her presidency — one that promised transformative change for Harvard — was an abject failure. I fail to see any reason to paste an expiration date on a Garber presidency just as it begins. He has proven himself to be exactly what Harvard needs: stability, not reinvention. Garber should be allowed to lead Harvard for as long as he is able to do so effectively, whether that be three years or ten. In other words, Harvard should refrain from forcing change, for a change.

crimson_2024_35,"Over the last few years,a conversation hasemerged on campus aboutrenaming Harvard buildings,most prominentlyWinthrop House, for its namesakes’ slave-holding and violence against Indigenous peoples. For many current students and alumni alike, the name Winthrop carries cherished memories of home at Harvard. For many others, however, it also represents the United States’ original sin, a constant reminder to community members of Harvard’s shamefulconnections to American slavery. As a former Winthrop House Committee chair and recent alumnus, respectively, we believe a just and simple solution can do it all: keep the name Winthrop, powerfully rebuke Harvard’s white supremacist founders, and imbue the house’s title with the ethos of service and sacrifice Harvard students and Black soldiers made together in the name of freedom. Harvard should rename Winthrop House to Winthrop Perkins Boynton House. Winthrop Perkins Boynton, Class of 1863, represents the commitment to the fight for racial equality that Harvard should strive for. Boynton, a highly educated member of the then-all-white Harvard College student body, could easily have avoided military service in the Civil War. Instead, in 1863, Boynton volunteered immediately after graduation to serve as an officer in the 55th Massachusetts Regiment, the second Black military unit in Massachusetts history. Boynton and his fellow soldiers offer the best example of the dedication Harvard students can make to the United States’ shared struggle for the cause of freedom and equality. When the Black enlisted soldiers of the regiment protested Congress’ decision to pay them less than their white peers, Boynton made clear that he sided with his men. An 1866 profile of Boynton records that “his sympathy was entirely with them, and in his letters he frequently praises the spirit and persistency with which they demanded their rights, and their performance of their duty under so great discouragement, and speaks with indignation of those who withheld their dues.” Boynton committed himself fully to the United States’ crusade for equality until the last. In 1864, the 55th Massachusetts lost nearly 100 men in the Battle of Honey Hill in South Carolina. Boynton, leading his men from the front, was one. Alongside him that day fought Andrew Jackson Smith, a runaway enslaved person who posthumously received the Congressional Medal of Honor in 2001 for his gallantry at Honey Hill, as well as James Monroe Trotter, one of the first Black military officers during the Civil War and later a prominent advocate for Black rights. These Black men surely overcame far greater obstacles than Boynton to serve in the 55th regiment, but all fought together to more fully realize the founding principles of the United States. Both should be recognized as well in the renaming process. One-hundred-sixty years later, the United States’ struggle toward freedom continues. Harvard — and its monuments — should remind the student body that each generation must, like Boynton, commit themselves anew to the pursuit of justice. To rechristen Winthrop, the University should hold a ceremony wherein they rename Winthrop house in honor of Winthrop Perkins Boynton, transforming the Winthrop name from a blemish on the University’s honor to a monument to one of its finest students. Whether people choose to call the house Boynton, Winthrop, or Winthrop Perkins Boynton, the new name would offer a constant reminder of the 55th Regiment’s values. Harvard can also take this opportunity to replace the Winthrop family crest with a new flag dedicated to the 55th Massachusetts Regiment of Volunteers, Black and white soldiers alike. May this new meaning inspire new students who carry the immense privilege of the Harvard education to volunteer for the cause of justice, as Winthrop Perkins Boynton did. Philip A. Geanakoplos ’21 was in Mather House. Karina Ascunce Gonzalez ’22 was in Winthrop House and served as Winthrop House Committee chair."
ubyssey_2024_23,"June 17, 2024 “In this political climate, that students are willing to face the risk of retaliation for using their voices to speak for the voiceless — the innocent children and families of Gaza — is nothing short of commendable,” writes Harleen Kaur. Written byHarleen Kaur Harleen Kaur (she/her is a third-year psychology student who is passionate about social justice and advocacy. On April 29, UBC students and faculty beganan encampment on MacInnes Fieldin solidarity with the people of Palestine, with their primary demand calling for the University todivest from companies complicit in the genocide in Gaza. This action was part of many student-led encampments that spread across North America this spring, beginning at Columbia University. Last month, UBC President Benoit-Antoine Baconcame out with a statementthat UBC s Endowment Fund does not directly own any stocks in the companies identified by the movement. While the encampment has sparked both outrage and support, as an observer and a student following this movement, I d like to propose that we should be proud of this movement in light of its members’ willingness to accept great personal risk to stand up and voice support for Palestine, despite the condemnation and scrutiny they face for doing so. In a time where politicians, world leaders and the bulk of celebrities have shied away from speaking up about whatexperts say there are reasonable grounds to believe is a genocide being committed in Gazafor the supposed fear of being publicly shamed or ostracized, students have risen to condemn the actions of the Israeli government and called for change through these encampments. Over these past few months, there s been an influx of racism and harassment towards pro-Palestinian advocates. Anopen letter signed by over 600 members of the Canadian legal communityoutlines the harmful and chilling effects on the freedom of expression being felt by anyone, particularly those in the legal community, condemning Israel’s atrocious subjugation of Palestinians. Despite being well within their rights when forming a political opinion and critiquing the Israeli government, manyhave faced repercussions at work or school for voicing their views. Last November, theUnited Nations issued a statementsaying that calls for a ceasefire have, “in too many contexts been misleadingly equated with support for terrorism or antisemitism. Canadian universities have levelled various hostilities against the encampments on their grounds, from legal action to public statements of condemnation against the movement to the use of police force. In early May, the University of Calgary hadriot police show up with shields, batons and flash-bang explosivesto forcibly remove student protestors from encampments on the basis of trespassing and camping on campus grounds after they refused to leave. On May 10,McGill University applied for an injunctionto remove their encampment due to supposed safety concerns, which the Quebec court later denied. The University of Toronto followed andapplied for an injunctionon May 27. Last fall, Toronto Metropolitan University launched an external review against their students for signing an open letter calling for the support of Palestine and opposing the Israeli government’s actions. Despite facing heavy backlash, the letter was ultimately found by a retired judgenot to violate the student code of conduct. In this political climate, students are willing to face the risk of retaliation for using their voices to speak for the voiceless — the innocent children and families of Gaza — and this is nothing short of commendable. My generation Gen Z is perpetually laden with negative stereotypes and is often referred to as the snowflake generation. The comparison insinuates us as fragile, overly sensitive and easy to melt under pressure. To those who have or still do view us this way, I urge you to look around and observe the age demographic the encampment predominantly comprises. Who is willing to risk their careers and degrees and speak up? If UBC and other institutions want to proudly headline that they are the home of future leaders, then give those students a chance to be heard and freely express themselves rather than booting them for engaging in these expressions. Thus far, UBC has not made any official statement on removing the encampment, and I urge the university to continue to allow the encampment to reside in MacInnes Field. Those who oppose the movement’s views have pointed to incidents like theadmission of Charlotte Kates— who praised Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel as “heroic and brave,” — into the encampment as evidence that it is a place for resentment that will foment hateful speech or spark physical violence. Those critics need to note that one person s comments do not define the encampment at UBC or globally, and should not be seen as reflective of pro-Palestinian advocates as a whole. Our speculation about further hate speech does not warrant us suppressing these encampments altogether. In my view, it is important to understand that the encampment at UBC has done its part to avoid undue confrontation, such as avoiding talking to counter-protestors as stated in theircommunity guidelines. Further, this encampment has an educational basis. It serves to discuss not only the genocide in Gaza but also the long-standing conflict between Palestine and Israel s occupation of it. And with education comes understanding and the avoidance of situations that foster hate speech. Additionally, some may argue that this encampment does not make them feel safe to be on campus; to them, I merely ask: what about it makes you feel unsafe? It is important to recognize that some members of the Jewish community may feel threatened by the encampment, due to its use of phrases like “self-determination by any means necessary” and its perception that demands for a free Palestine and necessitates violence against Israeli citizens. The concern around some language is legitimate. I would however like to point out that while the universal meaning of phrases like “self-determination by any means necessary” is uncertain, what is certain is, in the case of the encampment at UBC, the goal of demonstrators is not to endorse violence against any group but to stand against the horrors the people in Gaza are currently facing by calling for solidarity and action on a global scale. If you have not already, I implore UBC faculty and my fellow students to support those at the encampment because these people deserve your pride, love and respect. There are various ways to show your support besides attending the encampment — although organizers have just posted an invitation for more to attend. Spreading the word through social media is crucial for garnering further support and shedding light on the events transpiring at the encampments. There is also a link onpeoplesuniversityubc, the official Instagram page for the student-led encampment, listing the supplies needed, prioritized by the number of asterisks beside each item. Each May, I tune in to watch the Met Gala, but this year, I didn t. Both my TikTok and Twitter timelines, however, were a mixture of the extravagance and splendour of the outfits worn by celebrities and influencers, contrasting the horrific destruction of Gaza with harrowingly bloody images. The disparity between both and the mere fact that both events are even happening simultaneously is unbelievable, yet it is the reality of today. After that night, I thought long about why I had ever idolized people whose selfishness allows them to indulge in lavishness while children are being brutally murdered. It is daunting to realize that someone you may have adored or looked up to is devoid of any principles at all, and yet it was a necessary wake-up call to think about who we put on a pedestal. Upon reflection, I felt immense pride in the encampment held by the students at UBC. We all have things we are fearful of losing. And yet the difference is thousands of kilometres away from us in Gaza, where children have lost everything, their voices will never be heard again, and they will never graduate or have a future. Oftentimes, the harder things in life are the ones that bear the best fruit, and this encampment, like many others, is the start of that. I m proud of my fellow students and their movement, who are unafraid to stand on the right side of history. When I look at our encampment at UBC, I see the students exude bravery, courage, resilience, integrity and empathy. All these are core values that any university should be proud of its students for displaying. This is an opinion article.

On Oct. 9, the same day Israel began carpet bombing Gaza, the then president of our university, Richard Saller, sent us alettersaying that he was deeply saddened and horrified by the death and human suffering, without going into much detail. Just two days later, he seemed to change his mind on how much detail he could give, and wrote asecond letter— this time condemning Hamas, the ruling political party in the Gaza Strip, for terrorism and mass atrocities, while saying nothing against the government or ruling political party in Israel. I wondered:How many dead Palestinian children would it take for Saller to speak up? To just say one word in condemnation of Israel’s attacks? Surely one innocent child killed is one too many. Over the next few days, as Israel relentlessly bombed the northern half of the Gaza Strip, dozens more children were killed. Still, no word from Saller. I asked myself,what will his threshold be? Perhaps, I thought,Saller’s threshold would be on the order of hundreds of dead children. After all, Israel had killed 600 children in its 2021 attack on Gaza, so dozens was not unusual… On Oct. 17, we reached over 1,000 children killed, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. Still, nothing from Saller. If 1,000 American children had died, he surely would’ve said something, right? If it was 1,000 Ukrainian children or 1,000 Israeli children, he would have said something… I’m sure of it. What exactly is Saller’s threshold? I thought,maybe we’re all just desensitized to Palestinian suffering. As recently as 2014, over 3,300 Gazan children were wounded by Israel in its Operation Protective Edge. Perhaps Saller’s threshold is actually on the order of thousands. Twelve days later, on Oct. 29, it wasreportedthat 3,324 children had been killed in Gaza by Israeli airstrikes. You know what, forget condemning Israel, maybe that would get him in trouble with the Board of Trustees. But how about just one word of support for Gaza? One word of sympathy or compassion? On Nov. 6, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “Gaza is becoming agraveyard for children.” Fast forward to Nov. 22, and the child death toll has reached5,500. What is Saller waiting for? We have students from Gaza attending this university! Are we just going to pretend 5,000 Arab children weren’t just killed in the past month? What is his threshold? On Dec. 4, the number of children Israel killed reached6,600. Finally, Stanford posted something related to genocide on theirInstagrampage: “In the context of the national discourse, Stanford unequivocally condemns calls for the genocide of Jews or any peoples. That statement would clearly violate Stanford’s Fundamental Standard, the code of conduct for all students at the university.” It’s good to know that Stanford is against the genocide of Jews or any peoples. I hope Palestinians count as people. But how did they forget to explicitly name the Palestinians? The onlygenocideI see happening right now is in Gaza… On Dec. 21, the number of Palestinian children killed by Israel reached8,000— more than the number of undergraduates enrolled at Stanford. This is madness. How is the world watching this and not doing anything? Saller — say something. It won’t change the number of children dead but it’s better than staying silent. I once again wondered, what is our president’s threshold? Is it 10,000 dead children? 20,000? 100,000? After the winter break, President Saller sent us a welcome back letter. The letter began: “As classes resume, we know that many in our community continue to experience deep pain and concern about events related to the Israel-Hamas war.” That’s a good start. Maybe he’ll mention the Palestinian lives lost this time! He didn’t. Instead, he says, “In 2024, there will be differing views in our community on many issues – on the Israel-Hamas war; on the candidates in this year’s U.S. presidential election; and on numerous other matters.” Oh. I wonder if there will be differing views in our community on the tragedy of 8,000 dead Arab children. On Jan. 10, the number of Palestinian children killed by Israel reached10,000. Another 7,000 were reported to be under the rubble. Later that month, President Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez attended anevent on antisemitismhosted by the Blue and White Tent and shared a stage with Michal Cotler-Wunsh, Israel’s special envoy for combating antisemitism. Cotler-Wunsh hascalledfor Israel to let in less humanitarian aid to Gaza and for Zionism to beprotectedunder DEI frameworks. By the end of January, the number of children killed in Gaza reached11,500. Stanford decided it was a good time to shut down thehistoric Sit-In To Stop Genocide. Hundreds of people mobilized to protest this decision. The sit-in students tried to negotiate with Saller. None of their demands were met, and the sit-in was eventually shut down, just in time for Family Weekend. As a response, students interrupted Saller and Martinez at the Family Weekend welcome session. Eighteen of them weredetained and cited. Still, no comment from Saller on the dead children of Gaza, the number of whom has now reached12,660. At this point, one million children in Gaza are starving. Every child has either died, been injured, orphaned, traumatized, or is displaced and hungry. On April 4, the University announced that thenew president of Stanford will be Jonathan Levin, who has the same position as Saller on institutional neutrality and silence toward “divisive political” events. But how are you neutral when you already condemned the government of Gaza? How are you neutral when you acquiesced to Zionists and explicitly condemned the genocide of Jews, even as genocide is ongoing in Gaza? How are you neutral when you share a stage with a government representative of the state that is currently committing a genocide? What does it mean to be silent when the University is currently investing in Israeli companies that directly contribute to Israeli apartheid and the genocide of Palestinians? I have no hope that Levin will speak about the13,800children who have been killed in Gaza and the over 12,000 injured. Saller: I want you to know that it’s not too late. You can and should still speak out about what’s happening. Perhaps you have more latitude now that you’re not interim president anymore. Which leaves me with just one question for you …Do you even have a threshold? Hamza El Boudali ’22 M.A. ’24 is a master’s student in computer science.

ubyssey_2024_28,"June 15, 2024 Written byCollective of Concerned Asian Studies Faculty Editors Note: This article was submitted by Dr. Christina Laffin on behalf of a collective of concerned faculty members in the Department of Asian Studies who contributed equally to the drafting of this piece. It is adapted from anopen lettersent to President Benoit-Antoine Bacon on May 17, signed by faculty members in 41 academic units and programs. On May 15, we witnessedpolice with guns in our library— a phalanx of tactically armed, black-clad intruders surveilling and taunting a group of peaceable students and other protestors who chanted and drummed plastic bottles to make their demands heard. While the demonstrators took care to enable ongoing access to offices and workspaces and the continuation of work in the library, police officers shut down entry to the building and repeatedly threatened them with arrest. Over the past few weeks, we have seen police presence increase, including the arrival of a paramilitary force on campus. Alarmed by this militaristic response to students’ rightful protest of UBC’s complicity in genocide, on May 17 we composed aletterto UBC President Benoit-Antoine Bacon which was endorsed by faculty members from 41 units and programs. Our plea to the President was for police to be removed from our campus. In our letter, we stated: “The presence of police leaves us less safe and endangers those on campus, particularly UBC community members who may be vulnerable to racial profiling including Black, Indigenous, Arab, Muslim, and Middle Eastern communities. We demand that all police immediately leave campus and that Campus Security stop targeting student activism.” President Bacon responded to our letter of concern regarding police on campus, indicating in a short May 22 email that the administration has chosen to ally with “law enforcement authorities” as a means of securing a “safe” campus environment. Following his assurance of a “measured approach,” on June 1,police arresteda hijab-wearing Muslim UBC alumna following a peaceful protest. We ask, whose safety is the University claiming to protect, and why is it that certain lives, including those of our community members, are treated as exceptions? Over the past month, many of us have spent considerable time with members of the People’s University for Gaza at UBC, including our students, and have stood alongside them at protests. The UBC encampment has been created with a great deal of thought and careful organization, from the setting up of tents and a medical station, to the development of a library and archives, artwork and a small flower garden. Those in the encampment have worked in tandem with some Indigenous members of First Nations, in solidarity with Palestine. All of this has been accomplished while enduring bouts of windstorms, heavy rain and cold weather. We have been deeply impressed by their dedication in calling for just demands. Students have legitimately protested our complicity as UBC continues to support the Israeli war machine through investment in companies that fund weaponry and war technologies, and the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. As faculty members at UBC, we are disturbed by the so-called “neutral” stance claimed by our institutional leadership, which willfully ignores our role in the financing of the ongoing Nakba inflicted on Palestinians. We are appalled by the use of policing as the university s communication strategy and the mobilization of our campus as a laboratory for shared tactics of violence across police forces (RCMP, VPD, C-IRG/CRU-BC or Critical Response Unit, partnered with Campus Security in the name of “safety” and the “protection” of “community.” Students and community members involved with the encampment have been targeted by police on our campus. Through his actions, President Bacon has made clear the voices he is open to hearing and the members of our UBC community he values. It speaks volumes that he is willing to engage with Zionist politicians and lobbyists for Israel in Ottawa yet is unwilling to genuinely listen to his own students. Students have voiced their demands clearly, building on the tenets of decolonization and anti-racism our institution claims to foster. If we all took heed, we would recognize that those who built the People’s University for Gaza at UBC are not the enemy but are forging a path based on knowledge and justice. We hope that the Palestinian flags which have been planted by UBC students across campus are appreciated for what they truly represent: not threat or danger, but emblems of Palestinian resistance, resilience and fearless hope.

rice_thresher_2024_34,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/9/24 11:03pm At 7 a.m. sharp on Beer Bike morning, students gathered in a line (if one can call it that stretching nearly to McMurtry College commons, in hopes of attending Martel College’s iconic morning party. Upon entry, students would discover that the historically packed public boasted the attendance of, well, a large FITQ. This shift arrives in light of new capacity limitations and a closed sundeck,recommendedby the Alcohol Policy Advisory Committee. As we await the last public of the year, capacity policies for Bacchanalia should return to a reasonable medium. The stringent Martel capacity limit, which required checking each student’s net ID against a massive spreadsheet of ticketed students, was an administrative overstep that harmed Rice’s beloved student self-governance and traditions. This year’s Beer Bike was relatively controlled, likely pointing to efforts on the part of college leadership to encourage safe drinking practices and students for monitoring their own drinking. Fun yet responsible publics exemplify Rice’s high degree of student autonomy and traditions, which remain a key selling point for potential students. We hope administration can respond in kind with more reasonable policies for Bacchanalia and upcoming years, preserving these traditions that make Rice, Rice. The ticketing process of Martel’s morning party, which has been the same used for many post-COVID publics, is inefficient and unnecessarily burdensome for volunteers. Instead, as we’ve advocated for in the past,let students show upand close entrance to the public once capacity is reached, removing the need to note down individual net IDs and deal with thousand-row spreadsheets crashing. Believe it or not, there was a time before Google Form ticket drops and freshmen reselling wristbands for 10 times their original cost. Coming off a five-month dry spell of publics, we understand the need to monitor Beer Bike more strictly this year. But by no means should the success of this year’s Beer Bike imply that overly stringent ticketing and net ID checks are the correct path. If Martel’s morning party was just a test, we hate to see what’s next. Last year, our editors-in-chiefvoiced their concernsabout the slow death of campus traditions. Their sentiment still rings true. We’ve had our slap on the wrist — now, we ask that Rice traditions aren’t sacrificed in the name of overdone safety procedures. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Riya Misra, Spring Chenjp, Maria Morkas, Prayag Gordy, Sarah Knowlton, Sammy Baek, Shruti Patankar, Juliana Lightsey, Arman Saxena and Kathleen Ortiz. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

thetech_mit_2024_15,"Dear Tech Editor, We readRichard Solomon s op-ed in the March 7th 2024 edition ofThe Techover lunch and discussed it over dinner. We found Solomon s portrayal of the Palestinians plight deeply motivated and moving, impassioned and yet utterly rational. In December, Steve Carhartwhined and opinedabout CAA protests and DEI initiatives in your pages; Solomon s op-ed doesn t whine. It strikes at the heart of MIT s all-too-easy embrace of dehumanizing technologies and their monied constituencies. After reading Solomon s articulate, well-documented exposition, it would not surprise us when some will call him an alarmist, naive radical, and much worse. But they have to admit that he s been there, seen it firsthand and through the eyes of victimized Palestinians. Propagandist! Hamas Apologist! you might yell at this man who calls himself a Christian who served as a diplomat; then, close the newspaper and look away because none of this is your problem. Unless, however, you work or teach or learn at MIT, in which case consider the ways he enumerates the Institute complicity with state violence and, yes, genocide. Do not be bothered by its sanitized bureaucratic rationales for suppressing dissent when it challenges MIT s complacent complicity. Ladies, gentlemen, and others: dare to expose smug beliefs to the brutal facts scattered about the shattered ground before us. Beat swords into plowshares, as the US military seems to be doing to deliver urgent aid to Gaza while Israeli leaders say things like “I am personally proud of the ruins of Gaza” (Israeli minister May Golan , “that every baby, even 80 years from now, will tell their grandchildren what the Jews did.” Is that how you feel? If you still unconditionally support Israel s right to defend itself after witnessing the heartbreaking scenes Mr. Solomon described plus those that news media has reported, then ask your conscience if it s okay to dismiss it as the price of statehood. And MIT powers-that-be, remember that it s just as easy to support students idealism and commitment as it is to dismiss or suppress it, so do the right thing. As Mr. Solomon says, the balance to be struck is not between free speech and safety, it s between supporting human rights, no matter whose they are, and suppressing dissent, however inconvenient to the institution it may feel. We offer these thoughts to promote dialog and would like the favor of a reply.

crimson_2024_69,"While many were upset when the U.S. Supreme Court curtailed Harvard’s use of racial preferences, Isuggestedthat the decision might eventually serve working-class students of all races. For decades, Harvard has broughttogether wealthy students of all colors, but limiting the use of race could prompt the University to reach out to more low-income and working-class students, indirectly creating racial diversity without violating the law. When Harvard announcedits admissions decisions for the Class of 2028last Thursday, it provided some evidence that it is headed in the right direction. Although it disclosed no racial data and only scant information about socioeconomic status, one number suggests continual progress in an important area: the percentage of first-generation students. According to data released Thursday, the percentage of first-generation college students for Harvard’s Class of 2028 has risen to 20.5 percent, nearly tripling the seven percent representation of first-generation students Harvard admitted in the Class of 2019. Last year, Harvard reported this number being nearly 20 percent. Despite impressive long-term progress, Harvard will need to push even further if it wants to draw upon talents from students of all socioeconomic backgrounds, preserving racial diversity. Harvard should continue to diversify by metrics such as the education level of parents, income level, and other indicators of socioeconomic status. As an expert witness in the affirmative action litigation, I worked with Duke economist Peter S. Arcidiacono to model what Harvard could do to ensure high levels of racial and economic diversity and maintain superb academic standards. In the simulations of workable plans to achieve racial diversity without racial preferences, we demonstrated that Harvard’s first-generation student numbers could increase to25 percent— substantially higher than Harvard’s numbers for the Class of 2028. (The simulations also assumed that Harvard would end preferences for legacies and children of faculty, something the University has not announced. The other socioeconomic data Harvard released on Thursday is of limited utility. Harvard said that 20.7 percent of the admitted Class of 2028 is eligible for federal Pell grants, for which families in roughly the bottom socioeconomic half qualify. While significant, scholars have shown that Pell data can be a misleading proxy, since it includes many students that are squarely middle-class, just within the range of eligible family incomes. As a result, Pell rates may not track genuine representation of low-income students. For example, Paul Tough concluded in his book “The Years That Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us,” that Princeton University doubled its Pell representation from 2004-2013 “while only barely increasing the number of actual low-income students on its campus.” Moreover, Pell data also tells us nothing about the socioeconomic distribution of the more than three-quarters of the admitted class of 2028 who are above the Pell cutoff. To fill this gap, David J. Deming, a Harvard professor, has argued that colleges should report more detailed income data, including the share of students coming from the top one percent. Raj Chetty ’00, another Harvard professor, has broken down Harvard’s income data by quintile for the Class of 2013, but I believe this information should be reported annually. I would even go further, requiring colleges to provide a breakdown of student body populations by wealth — that is, net worth — and by neighborhood poverty levels. Wealth and neighborhood poverty are significant predictors of opportunity in America, and Black and Hispanic students are much more likely to be disadvantaged than white students from the same income level. Harvard should be rewarding talented students who overcome these obstacles, and without the data, we cannot know whether Harvard is doing so. Harvard should also release the number of students who are legacies or the children of faculty and staff. Harvard’s expert witness, professorDavid E. Card, showedthat under the simulations of economic affirmative action in which preferences for legacies and faculty children were removed, the percentage of legacy students in the class of 2019 would have dropped by nearly 70 percent. The share of faculty and staff children would have dropped by a slightly lower proportion. Release of data would show the extent to which preferences remain. Despite its shortcomings, the data Harvard did report are encouraging. The College deserves credit for significantly increasing the share of first-generation college students during the legal fight over the use of race in admissions. Still, as an institution whose motto is Veritas, Harvard should be willing to lift the veil even further. Richard D. Kahlenberg is the director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute. He was an expert witness for Students for Fair Admissions in its lawsuit against Harvard. This piece is the second installment in a series that will provide analysis and commentary on the culmination of Harvard College’s first admissions cycle following the United States Supreme Court’s curtailment of race-conscious admissions.

crimson_2024_86,"On Monday, interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 announced that, after two weeks of extraordinary forbearance and repeated warnings, the University wouldtake stepsto end the Harvard Yard encampment and discipline the students involved. In response, anumber of faculty colleagueshave suggested that the University should instead enter into negotiations — or what is euphemistically called “meaningful dialogue” — with the students in question, as several of our peer institutions have done in the face of similar behavior. The idea, as I understand it, is that such a course of action would demonstrate respect for “reasoned discourse” over imperious dictates. Those, like myself, who support the president’s decision, tend to argue in contrast that offering concessions to students who willfully subvert our norms and rules would simply incentivize similar conduct in the future. But that rejoinder begs the question. Why, after all, would it be so bad for the University to function in this way? Students, faculty, or staff who feel strongly about a given issue could routinely disregard our rules and occupy buildings and community spaces until the administration “comes to the table” and gives them some portion of what they want. This would be far from pretty, perhaps, but what exactly is wrong with it? Part of the answer, of course, is prudential: It is difficult to imagine the University being governed in any sort of reasoned or coherent way under such circumstances. But the deeper objection, I want to suggest, is a moral one. Quite simply, allowing community members to leverage their noncompliance with our rules in order to extract concessions from the University is deeply unfair. It denies the rest of us — those upholding our collective norms — the equal standing we ought to enjoy to have our voices heard on matters of common concern. To be sure, not every member of the Harvard community has, or ought to have, precisely the same role in governance. Faculty members, for instance, ought to have a greater say over curricular matters than their students. But no faculty member is entitled to more of a say than any other — nor should any individual student’s voice count for more than that of a peer. For this reason, we have created a dizzying range of structured opportunities for shared decision-making and consultation: voting meetings of each faculty, the elected Faculty Council, student-faculty committees, the various elected student governments, and so on. Those who urge the president to negotiate with the “encampers” seek instead to circumvent all of these institutions, effectively replacing them with a wholly unaccountable and unrepresentative ad hoc committee composed of individuals invited to the “meaningful dialogue.” The consequence would be to disenfranchise the vast majority of our community who would be excluded from these negotiations. Consider the case of Northwestern, regarded as exemplary by those who urge a negotiated settlement with the encampers. The agreement reached between the administration and the protesters there included, among other things, the creation of a new university committee on investment responsibility (along with guidelines for its composition , new faculty positions for Palestinian scholars, dedicated scholarships for Palestinian students, and the construction of a new Muslim student center. The issue is not whether any of these is a good idea, but rather why major questions of University governance, faculty hiring, and funding priorities should be decided in a manner that assigns no weight at all to the views of the thousands of stakeholders who declined to join the encampment. And then, of course, there is the issue of divestment. The students occupying the Yard feel strongly that Harvard should engage in a financial and academic boycott of the State of Israel, not merely because they oppose the war in Gaza, but because they apparently believe the State of Israel should not exist (the area to be “liberated,” their banners inform us, extends “from the River to the Sea” . Many other Harvard affiliates, myself included, feel at least as strongly that Harvard should do no such thing — so strongly, indeed, that a large number of us would surely leave this place if the University did in fact bow to the demands of the encampers. We have been appalled to witness the encampers and their allies adopting rhetoric and tactics that plainly wound, frighten, and ostracize their Jewish classmates — even if we grant that some of them know not what they do. And we find it shameful that some members of the faculty have likewise sought to gaslight their Jewish students by claiming that the encampment is free of antisemitism — despite the chants of “intifada” and “from water to water Palestine is Arab” that echo throughout it. I do not suggest for a moment that our views are entitled to more weight than anyone else’s. But surely they are not entitled to less, simply because — unlike our opponents — we do not seek to hold Harvard to ransom. Eric M. Nelson ’99 is the Robert M. Beren Professor of Government."
ubyssey_2024_1,"Aug. 7, 2024 Written byIman Janmohamed Dear Iman, I’m lucky to have made many friends and acquaintances at UBC that are really amazing! They’re smart and talented with a penchant for becoming involved in a lot of great work. The problem is that they seem to be doing so many things, while I’m just getting by. I know that I’m also smart and talented in my own ways, but how do I manage everyone seemingly achieving more than me? — Besties, my best isn’t much Well, you’re right! You are smart and talented in your own ways but it’s easy to forget that when you compare yourself to the people around you. I know it’s hard not to compare yourself to others, especially when they’re your friends. You became friends with these people because you thought they were super cool and smart and talented, so it’s natural to want in on some of those attributes. But here is something important to keep in mind: appearances can be deceiving. It can look like your friends — even your best friends — are doing all these cool things while maintaining the healthiest relationships ever, getting 100 per cent in every class and shredding it at the gym every other day. But sometimes, you only see what others want you to. Behind closed doors, your friends could be feeling the exact same way as you do. I mean, that’s what this entire advice column is built off of: the fact that each and every one of us, as university students, share some kind of universal experiences and live by a universal truth, which is that everyone feels the same way you do. It’s like when you’re in your grade 9 math class. Stay with me. You have a question about what the fuck a polynomial is, but you’re too afraid to ask because your classmates are your best friend, that girl who you want to like you, the most hockey guy hockey guy in the world and the president of the mathletes (Mean Girlsreference . You feel embarrassed. You don’t want to seem dumb by asking a question, but really, you don’t want to be vulnerable around people you want to respect you. So you say nothing. You end up failing your test. And so do a couple others in the class because, get this, they also had the same question. And they also were too afraid to ask. What I’m trying to say is that you can talk to your friends about this! Ask them for tips about how they structure their days or find time to tag along to a study or workout sesh, if you have the capacity. These people are your friends, and friends are there to help. Let’s say that you are doing your best and you do not have the capacity to do more. That’s okay. It can seem like others are doing more or doing better than you based off of assumptions of others and expectations we have for ourselves. But if you are trying your hardest — that’s something to be proud of. That doesn’t mean that needing a break is bad (it’s the opposite , but that if your best seems to be “worse” (whatever that means than someone else’s best, who cares! You are doing your best, and that’s all that matters. You’re doing great. Keep it up! Want to get advice from a student journalist? Eww.

rice_thresher_2024_1,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/16/24 10:17pm The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. Between NOD’s early shutdown, the Rice Memorial Center’s redesign and an alleged Student Association “power grab,” we’ve written many editorials expressing our views on pressing issues affecting our campus community. However, as the summer approaches, we want to go in a bit of a different direction. Some of our readers will be graduating and moving beyond Rice. Some will be studying for the MCAT, the LSAT or the GRE while simultaneously undertaking other responsibilities like research, an internship or Orientation Week advising. This summer, set aside some time for yourself in the midst of all of your commitments. Take a break. Develop a new hobby, go on a morning hike, sit in some grass — whatever it is, just take some time for yourself. We’ll follow our own advice, too. In the spirit of summer, we’d like to share some of our own plans. One of us will be exploring catacombs in Prague, visiting the Kafka Museum and being very annoying about it. Another one of us will be chugging hotel breakfast smoothies. Some of us will be attending music festivals, singing karaoke at home in Seoul, camping out outside film festivals, perusing coffee shops, adopting cats, looking at mountains, obsessively updating our Letterboxd and — of course — drunkenly playing golf on the public course. Not that we endorse that, for what it’s worth. Whatever suits you best, please take some time for yourself this summer — you deserve it.

S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement. When I first set foot on the Rice University campus, the contrast with my small hometown of Toomsuba was stark. Moving from a quaint town of 800 people to the big city of Houston, Texas made me realize how large the divide between my experience and that of my peers was.

crimson_2024_90,"Last fall, former Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust published her memoir “Necessary Trouble: Growing Up at Midcentury,” which celebrates the progress made by her generation’s disruptive anti-war and civil rights activists. Faust’s formative years were a time when “ideas and even movements were emerging to challenge assumptions about race, gender, and privilege,” she writes. “And at a time when we see many of those advances challenged or even overturned, it can remind us why we don’t want to live in such a world again.” As Harvard alumni who helped lead the campus’s fossil fuel divestment movement from 2013 to 2017, we know quite a bit about Faust’s attitudes towards activists. We made noise and disrupted events; we occupied and blockaded buildings; some of us were arrested. Despite the hostility of Faust and Harvard’s leadership toward our demands,we ultimately prevailed. And none of us were punished: no probations, no suspensions, no “involuntary leaves.” At a time when Harvard students are again rallying for divestment — this time standing behind Palestinians who are being killed by the thousands by Israel — University administrators should make the same choice. Respect your students. Do not punish calls for justice. And take this opportunity to do the one thing you refused to do with us: listen and engage with thesubstance of student demands. Disclose, divest from genocide, and reinvest in Palestinian life. Our experience with disruptive action at Harvard began after years of asking the Harvard administration to engage on the issue of fossil fuel divestment. In the spring of 2014,we blockaded the doors to Massachusetts Hall, calling for an open dialogue on divestment. After 24 hours,one of us was arrestedby the Harvard University Police Department. Faced with Harvard’s continued intransigence, we made plans to escalate. In the spring of 2015, a coalition of dozens of students,faculty members, alumni, and community members flooded Harvard for a week. Weblockaded Massachusetts Hallfor six days, occupied the Harvard Alumni Association headquarters for two days, and blockaded University Hall several times. After a week of powerful mobilization, members of the Harvard Corporation agreed to meet with us. When Harvard did not budge on divestment, we continued to stage disruptive actions, including asit-inat the offices of the Harvard Management Company in 2016, where four students were arrested by the Boston Police Department, and aone-day blockade of University Hallin 2017. Despite repeatedly engaging in unauthorized and disruptive activities on Harvard’s campus, none of us were ever disciplined from the University against organizers. Now, nearly three weeks after Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine’s encampment in Harvard Yard began, Harvard has placed at least 20 students on involuntary leave, with others facing disciplinary proceedings. We do not view their decision not to arrest students this time as some act of institutional kindness; it simply helped them avoid bad press. Those of us arrested in the fossil fuel campaign were able to return to our schooling and lives essentially untarnished, to continue our studies, commune with friends, and ultimately brush off our encounters with the law (we received no criminal convictions . The shift from empty displays of public reprimand to the substantive punishment of involuntary leave is alarming, denying students procedural protections and the right of appeal in an attempt to silence peaceful student protest. Disciplinary action against student activists is a choice — and the University’s choice of when to discipline student activists is telling. When we occupied and blockaded buildings in protest of Harvard’s fossil fuel investments, the same policies prohibiting “interference” and “obstruction” of the University’s “essential processes” were in place. Then, as now, occupying University property could lead to discipline. But we did not face discipline. In fact, the University engaged us in negotiations and even agreed to a meeting with us and the Corporation — a stark contrast with theirresponse to today’s encampment. We have asked ourselves: Why this differential treatment for these students peacefully occupying space today? The troubling conclusion we’ve reached is that Harvard’s choice is based not on the nature of the protest, but rather the injustice being protested. Harvard is implicitly telling its students — and the world — that protest against climate catastrophe is appropriate, but protest against colonialism, apartheid, and genocide is not. It’s easy to look back at past divestment movements and wonder why it took Harvard so long to catch up with the moral compass of its students. But they did eventually. Harvard partiallydivested from apartheid in South Africaafter monumental student pressure. Harvard alsodivested from the fossil fuel industry, following over a decade of student organizing. Today’s fight is no different. Interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 condemns the protestors for choosing disruption over dialogue; however, both our experiences and the study of history have proven time and again that disruption is an essential tool to catalyze dialogue among parties with disparities in power. Harvard, do not punish your students for standing up for justice, peace, and equality — values that Harvard professes and has followed in the past. Listen to students once again. Follow their lead. Divest from genocide. Ted Hamilton, Jasmine Opie ’16, Brett Roche ’15, and Talia K. Rothstein ’17 were organizers with the campaign to divest from fossil fuels."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_2,"The Miami Heat Summer League squad, with UC Irvine’s own JC Butler, won the NBA 2K25 Summer League championship on July 22. The league was defined by many senior NBA players putting up scorching performances — first-team All-Summer League guards Gregory “GG” Jackson II and Scotty Pippen Jr. of the Memphis Grizzlies come to mind. However, there were also phenomenal performances by select rookies from the draft class. Reed Sheppard (Point Guard/Shooting Guard, Houston Rockets Kentucky alum Reed Sheppard easily had the best performance out of anyone in the 2024 draft class. Over four games in Las Vegas, Sheppardaveraged20 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists. He showed he can create his own shots with offensive craftiness and ball-handling proficiency, and his shooting from a distance was excellent . There are concerns about his positional size, but his 11 steals in four games put to rest any hesitations that he will be a turnstile as he showcased active hands, lateral quickness and an ability to absorb contact on the defensive end. Houston, currently rebuilding, has constructed a promising young core with guards Jalen Green and Amen Thompson, forward Cam Whitmore and center Alperen Şengün. They showcased this by going 16-7 in their last 23 games and ending with a 41-41 record — a massive improvement from their last two seasons. With former Celtic head coach Ime Udoka at the helm and a shifty offensive threat in Sheppard, Houstonites certainly have something to look forward to in the next couple of seasons. Kel’el Ware (Center, Miami Heat Kel’el Ware is another player that stood out in the class. In Miami’s Summer League run, the former Hoosieraveraged18 points and seven rebounds on 61% shooting from the field. In a particular standout game against Dallas on July 17, he recorded 24 points, 10 rebounds and three blocks on 75% from the field. Ware has proven to be good at cleaning the glass, as well as being a fantastic rim protector and runner — all skills that many have seen from him prior to the draft. Previous concerns about his motor and effort resurfaced during the Summer League title game, where he appeared quite lackadaisical and stagnant as the game progressed. However, it’s important to remember that he was drafted by Miami, a team that frequently instills effort and grit into its players, a practice dubbed “Heat Culture” by fans. Ware also profiles as a fantastic fit next to current Miami Heat center Bam Adebayo, another reason the former Indiana center stands out. The recent Team USA games showcase how much more Adebayo can do both defensively and offensively when paired with another big, in this case Lakers center Anthony Davis. While Ware is certainly no Davis, he is the type of player who complements Adebayo’s skill set perfectly and would make an amazing frontcourt partner. Dalton Knecht (Forward, Los Angeles Lakers While the Lakers’ second-round pick, guard Bronny James, made headlines for his up and down play, the Lakers’ first-round pick Dalton Knecht has managed to shine in every Summer League game he played. In three games, the former Volunteeraveraged21.9 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists on 43% from the field and 39% from three, seemingly picking up where he left off at Tennessee. Knecht is very versatile offensively, demonstrating that he is capable of shooting, slashing and finishing at the rim. Knecht’s fit with the Lakers will be interesting to watch. The Lakers have two massive problems: a lack of a competent backup big and a lack of scoring on the bench. While bench players Jarred Vanderbilt (SF/PF , Gabe Vincent (SG and Cam Reddish (SG/SF range anywhere from stellar to decent defensively, they are all negatives on the offensive end, often plaguing LA with horribly inefficient scoring. Knecht has the potential to be a microwave scorer off the bench, similar to forward Sam Hauser in Boston or guard Malik Monk in Sacramento. Knecht is also more ready to contribute than most of the other prospects in this year’s draft because of his experience and already developed athleticism. Although new head coach JJ Redick and the Lakers still have a lot of work to do before they can start contending for an NBA title, picking Knecht was certainly a step in the right direction.

crimson_2024_28,"Navigating adulthood is one thing. However, navigating adulthood while actively striving for long-lasting change — whatever this means to you, dear reader — is another beast entirely. We — the youth — have historically been known for our distinct role in nudging this country towards the expansion of social justice and the confrontation of wrongs. In particular, college campuses have functioned as aunique and integralstage for leveraging the right to protest and free speech. Dwelling on the picket signs and tracks of walkouts that have touched my own institution’s soil, I think ofthe University Hall takeover of 1969.But I also reflect on the recent demonstrations of my peers, such as the“die-in”last October and theoccupation of University Hallthe following month. Indeed, the spirit of late Congressman John R. Lewis’ “good trouble” continues to flicker, running deep in the blood of my generation. Nevertheless, does students’ spunk ever run dry? I must confess that this passion can unquestionably dwindle, a phenomenon that is different from the burnout faced by activists. Identified by social scientists, burnout encapsulates an array of clear-cut emotional, and even physical, symptoms of exhaustion. As scholarship on activist fatigue continues to take shape, there is another conversation that must be had — especially regarding those on the other side of the picket line. I am pointing to those that simultaneously observe demonstrators while advocating from afar: the quiet, yet certainly not voiceless, individual. Their hearts lie with those at the frontlines, but their actions remain miniscule in comparison to those of whom they admire. Surely, they find themselves in a state of privilege — not facing the same risks of safety of those on the front lines of protests. Still, this state of motionless support breeds a distinctive burnout. It is the burnout of these observers that jeopardizes the sustainability of a social movement. Like many Harvard undergraduates, I frequently find myself bustling across campus to class. And often, especially this year, this venture meant walking past the notorious John Harvard Statue, and consequently, the occasional masses of my peers leveraging their freedom of speech. Whether they are protesting distinctly campus-related issues, or larger conversations concerning the state of our nation and world, there is a sense of apathy that manifests itself in this “passing.” In a matter of seconds, many work through the mental calculus of deciding what to prioritize and, in turn, what to overlook rather than overcome. In these moments, I find myself at odds with my principles. I’m weighing the Harvard student’s anal type-A attitude in fear of missing lecture against a moral compass that resonates with the protest in front of me — but suddenly, the tension ceases to be as a wave of apathy washes over me. Yes, this is injustice, I tell myself. Tempted by the all too common notion of things never changing, I am inclined to believe that it should simply be left as such. Yet it is this demagnetization of the needle in one’s moral compass that prevents a movement from flourishing. The bystanders, the observers, the watchers, and the whisperers need not feel guilty in the face of this reality. It is not their silence in the face of adversity that raises a moral red flag — it is their loss of hope. It is overwhelming to just look at injustice — to name it. I am certainly not placing the expectation of others to miraculously join nearby protests and demonstrations. Nor am I stating that it is essential for one to partake in a demonstration to truly stay true to one’s moral compass. Such expectations would be unrealistic, even for myself. But, I do believe that we have an obligation to verbalize our principles into existence by acknowledging the protesters. It is these discussions of the very real issues to which they draw our attention that will ensure our principles survive. For we are the quiet embers, a community, that are essential to the upkeep of the flame — one of justice and historical struggle for change. Lauren A. Kirkpatrick, a Crimson Diversity and Inclusion Chair and Editorial Editor, is a philosophy concentrator in Mather House."
rice_thresher_2024_22,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/13/24 9:56pm A recent study conducted by Bowen Cho examined top universities’ accessibility and disability infrastructure, ranking them on the basis of support, inclusion, safety and critical pedagogy, among other factors. Each university was graded — and Rice placed 35th, with a whopping F. Our peers didn’t do much better. The highest-performing universities, Harvard University, Yale University and the University of Idaho, only received a D. The study laid bare many of Rice’s — and arguably universities’ as a whole — gaps in disability resources. For starters, Rice’s Disability Resource Center is largely helpful under the conditions that students can self-advocate. According to theDRC’s website, which outlines the general process of receiving accommodations, the onus falls on the student to contact the DRC, complete preliminary notification forms, deliver accommodation letters and initiate communication with instructors. For students with disabilities that may limit executive function, such as depression or ADHD, the process of obtaining accommodations may be a barrier in and of itself. “When you struggle with depression, you don’t always have the individual capacity or bandwidth to advocate for yourself, not to mention a sense of proactivity to pursue the help that you need,” a student at Harvard told Cho — and their university scored well, all things considered. Students should provide disability documentation and make efforts to advocate for themselves. But that effort doesn’t need to be so immense it becomes restrictive. The University of Idaho, which ranked third in Cho’s study,offers an access portalthat serves as a centralized location for students to review and renew accommodations.Northwestern Universityand theUniversity of Chicago, the latter of which ranked fourth in Cho’s study, utilizes a similar portal system that notifies instructors of accommodation requests. At California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Disability Resource Center Access Specialistsfacilitate communication with instructorson behalf of the student. This is far from the first time students have noticed the DRC’s gaps in coverage. Disability accommodations are required training modules for Orientation Week advisors every year. In September 2022, anSA resolutionwas introduced advocating for Rice to adopt a similar online portal system. Through the portal, students would request the DRC to send accommodation letters to instructors; students would then follow up with their instructors to implement the requests. A few weeks later, the resolution passed. Over a year later, no such system has been implemented. Of course, disability services don’t start — and certainly don’t end — there. Only three universities in Cho’s sample of 106 reported full physical accessibility. Indeed, students at Rice have long noted our campus’ infrastructure failures, fromHamman Hall’s lack of ADA complianceto a flooded Inner Loop many times it rains. Our sidewalks are (marginally better than the city of Houston’s, though that bar is somehow lower than Rice’s accessibility grade. The Thresher’s own temporary office, which was slated to be on the fourth floor of Lovett Hall after the RMC’s now-delayed demolition, would have been inaccessible by elevator. People from both inside and outside the hedges have noticed our school’s lack of comprehensive disability support systems, and we urge Rice to act. Several construction projects are ongoing or looming, such as theacademic quad reconstruction, the RMC’s eventual rebuild, the upcoming construction of Sarofim Hall and, of course, colleges 12 and 13. We hope that the architecture firms and Rice administration design these new buildings with these issues in mind, prioritizing, among many things, accessibility. We hope that, as the student body expands, the DRC and Wellbeing & Counseling Centers keep up with the potential increase in demand, mitigating long wait times and advocating for their students. We want to match our demands with our own promises, too. Cho’s report highlights the gaps in our coverage, saying “there is practically zero coverage of disability in The Rice Thresher.” Improved disability support begins with increased visibility of disability, and we promise we’ll do our part.

wildcat_arizona_2024_2,"Margot RobbieandGreta Gerwigwere both snubbed in their respective categories for anOscar nominationdespite the impact“Barbie”had on women and girls across the world. On the other hand, Robbie’s film counterpartRyan Goslingwas nominated for an Oscar in his feature role as Ken for Best Supporting Actor. The entire point of “Barbie” was to show men what it’s like to feel inferior, to be a woman in a man’s world. While these complex themes were represented in the simple fantasy of Barbie world, in the real world, misogyny is still very real and painful for women. Gerwig and Robbie’s lack of recognition ironically displays everything the “Barbie” movie was trying to exemplify; no matter how powerful you are as a woman, you still are just a woman, to many men in the same industry. “Barbie” connects generations of women and girls who not only played with dolls, but lived the not-so glamorous parts of womanhood: cat calling, diet culture, fear of aging, cellulite, the list could go on. Gosling released a statement showing his disappointment in the academy considering the two women’s vital role in the creation of the film. “But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally-celebrated film,”Gosling wrote in a statement. He said it best, there is no Ken without Barbie. It’s really that simple. Although both Robbie and Gerwig were left out of the nominations, “Barbie” still stands a chance at claiming glory for itseight total nominations:Gosling’s nomination, America Ferrera’s nomination for Best Supporting Actress, Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design and two separate nominations for best Best Original Song. Clearly, the academy understands a taste of the significance “Barbie” had on box offices this year with its other eight nominations, although you can’t help but wonder why there was a slight on arguably the two most important people who went into the creation of “Barbie”: Robbie and Gerwig. “Barbie” created over $1 billion in revenue, ranking alongside some ofthe most popular movies of all time, like, “Star Wars,” “Titanic” and “Jurassic World.”However, this is the first time that a film grossing $1 billion hasa woman as the sole directing credit, according to theNew York Times.It seems as though that’s worth some accolades. It’s not like these two are strangers to the academy.Gerwighas been up for Best Directorfor her movie “Lady Bird” in 2017, andRobbie was nominated for Best Actressfor her role in “I, Tonya” as Tonya Harding in 2017 as well. The five women who were nominated for Best Actressthis year are well renowned and deserving of their praise, no doubt. Although, these actresses’ roles were nowhere near as highlighted by the media as Robbie’s work in “Barbie.” Popularity of a movie does not mean the work is better. There are many incredible films that release each year and barely hear a peep of praise. “Barbie” was more than just a popular movie for many people, myself included. “Barbie” takes a simple concept of “plastic dolls with big boobies,” (Jo Koy’sreduction of the film’s premise in atasteless joke at the Golden Globes and highlights the misogyny embedded in our society. Barbie, the doll, shows girls they can be more than just a mother; they can be career driven and succeed alongside their male counterparts. Well, not in Robbie’s case this year. At theGolden Globes, “Barbie”won thefirst ever award for cinematic and box office achievement,due to the energy and ambiance viewers created at the theaters. Millions of young girls went to the movies wearing pink; girls so young they probably don’t understand the significance of being a part of this global phenomenon. Julian Shapiro-Barnum, known for his interviews with children on his social media accountRecess Therapy,was a celebrity interviewer at the Golden Globes this year. During the Globes, he brought two young girls to stand alongside him as he talked with celebrities.In one clip of him and the girls talking with mermaid Barbie, akaDua Lipa,he asks which of the Barbie’s the two 7-year-olds would be. One of the girls responded with “I want to be … the president!” referencing the Barbie who was played byIssa Rae. “Barbie” let’s young girls dream of being the president. “Barbie” allows young girls to see themselves represented in roles where society has fallen short. This is something that has never been done before so obviously yet tastefully in a movie, proving Gerwig and Robbie deserve real recognition and accolades for their innovation and empowerment of women. “To say that I’m disappointed that they are not nominated for their respective categories would be an understatement,” Gosling said. “Their work should be recognized along with the other very deserving nominees.” I think the snub despite the movie’s societal impact is wrong and offensive to women and girls everywhere who felt seen by Robbie and Gerwig’s work. But then again, to many like Koy, “Barbie” is just a movie about “plastic dolls with big boobies,” whereas other nominations, like “Oppenheimer,” are “based on a Pulitzer-Prize winning novel.” FollowtheDaily WildcatonInstagramandTwitter (X Annabel is a University of Arizona student studying journalism and studio art.

crimson_2024_1,"Right now, for what may be a brief and shining moment, I am proud of Harvard’s leadership. On Friday, interim University President Alan M. Garber ’76 announcedthe formation of two presidential forces: one dedicated to combating antisemitism and the other to combating Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias. Outrageously, it took three months, a horrificdoxxing campaign,a congressional investigation,fierce campus organizing, and apresidential resignationto arrive at this point. Still, I commend Garber’s simple, profound acknowledgement that both groups have suffered and deserve their university’s support. No, a gesture will not solve all of our woes. Neither Jewish nor Muslim and Arab students will experience immediate relief from harassment, anxiety, and marginalization. Yet the very act of establishing these task forces may tell of a larger process underway. It could signal the beginning of a new age of leadership at Harvard: a (hopefully more measured and adept administration plotting a confident course forward for itself and the institution. The name“Alan Garber”is not yet saddled with personal baggage and — at least to the broader public — the man behind it is anonymous and inoffensive. In the interim, this will do just fine. After Gay’s tumultuous tenure, President Garber afforded us a clean slate. Now, with the creation of these task forces, he indicates that he could be more than a placeholder. Garber appears ready to learn from the failures of an administration which modeled precisely what not to do. On two fronts, Garber’s approach seems poised to improve on Gay’s. First, former University President Claudine Gay’s responses to Oct. 7 were mostly reactionary, often to their detriment. Her initialvague condemnation of Hamas’ violencewas a reaction to criticism of two days of silence. Her subsequentrebuke of Hamaswas in turn a reaction to criticism of that first statement’s vagueness. Herformation of an advisory groupon antisemitism was a long-delayed reaction tostudent fearand national outrage. This was an administration caught playing catch-up, forever stumbling one step behind and failing its community in the process. Second, Gay’s piecemeal attempts at managing competing interest groups failed to give them equal consideration. Immediately after Oct. 7, it was clear that events in Gaza and Israel would shake Harvard’s campus. Both combatants bore close ties to an array of religious, cultural, and ideological factions well-reflected in the diverse Harvard community. Campus friction was inevitable, but a national war of words with Harvard at its center was not. A more strategic administration would have used foresight: mass violence abroad will invariably produce a ripple effect on our campus. Islamic and Arab as well as Jewish students will be most affected by the unrest. Gay’s administration should have immediately established two parallel task forces designed to alleviate fear, mediate discourse, and ease tensions. Had Gay sought to assure, with parity, that all students would be safe and heard and that dialogue would be compassionate and controlled, these last few months may have unfolded quite differently. To borrow a truism, hindsight is always 20/20. But sharp vision — backward and forward — is precisely what we need right now. President Garber has to thread the needle, managing all manner of interests clamoring for attention. His predecessor waited and deferred and, on acting, did so without parity. We saw how that ended. So, at least on paper, the path forward for Garber is simple: Act early and fairly. We cannot predict what the future holds — for the war abroad or for the political landscape at home. But our president can, to an extent, control how Harvard reacts. I am hopeful that the Garber administration, however long it lasts, will continue on the path these task forces suggest. A leader does not walk one pace behind the pack. A leader marches at the fore, and responds to an uncertain world with reason, balance and strategy. As for the sibling task forces: One for me, one for you is a good start. To be seen now is whether they are more than just a gesture. For the students they are intended to support — and for the Garber administration — they better be. Lorenzo Z. Ruiz ’27, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Greenough Hall."
stanforddaily_2024_3,"There is a real possibility that pro-Palestine students faceconductchargesdue to their involvement in the People’s Universityencampment. The University is addressingacademicdishonestyin a time of rapidly advancinggenerative artificial intelligence(AI tools. New security cameras on campus have prompted students to raiseprivacy and criminal justice concerns. Stanford has also facedmultipleleadershiptransitionsover the past year. To say that the Office of Community Standards (OCS faces a unique campus climate would be the understatement of the century. OCS is an office for which student buy-in is critical.University policydictates that the Hearing and Appeals Panels that adjudicate conduct cases against students have student members. Students cannot be expected to cooperate as witnesses regarding conduct investigations if they do not trust OCS to enforce rules fairly and transparently. Yet the selection of the current OCS director involved no serious student input. While the University understood the importance of student representation in theVPSA and VPUE,provostialandpresidentialsearches, there was nothing for the OCS search. The University solicited student input when it came to undergraduate advising, academic accommodations, residential life and the campus community centers. It failed to do so for the office at the heart of issues as pressing ascampusprotests,identity-targeted discriminationandcampus surveillance. The OCS directorpreviously workedin Stanford’s Office of the General Counsel (OGC . There is perhaps no office more isolated from the students themselves than that. The OCS director’s complete absence from open meetings withstudents’ elected leadersand their attendance, albeit occasional, of Faculty Senate meetings gives students little reason to believe that OCS is being led by someone that is responsive to student views. Now more than ever, OCS must earn students’ trust, and students must use every tool at their disposal to force the office to do so. To earn student trust, OCS could hold town hall listening sessions to hear directly from the student body. OCS would engage with student concerns on the specifics of its access to surveillance footage on campus. OCS would engage with student concerns on the tensions between free speech and campus safety, especially due to the possibility ofviolent outsidersgiving student demonstrators a bad reputation. OCS would engage with student concerns on how fairness in Honor Code enforcement can be ensured despitewide variationin faculty implementation of AI policies. More intimate, closed-door listening sessions with student groups like the Jewish Student Association, Muslim Student Union and Black Student Union would also be a great step forward. OCS seriously recognizing the student body reduces the perception of administrative red tape stifling student voices. OCS committing to this increased accountability would introduce much needed policy transparency to address surveillance abuse and distinctions between protected and unprotected forms of expression. Secrecy on these matters causes students to speculate on what the true intentions of OCS are and whether or not its duty to protect students is a genuine one. Students approaching OCS with an us-versus-them mentality would destroy the foundation of trust that OCS, in theory, relies upon. The first step towards students trusting OCS again is them feeling that the office takes their concerns seriously, rather than having a top-down imposition of mandates from an administrative ivory tower. I call on the ASSU president, Undergraduate Senate (UGS and the Graduate Student Council (GSC to pursue the extreme response that this situation calls for: stopping the panelist nominations process dead in its tracks. Panelists cannot beconfirmedwithout the approval of the ASSU president, the UGS and the GSC. This is crucial because, as required by the Charter, panels overseeing charges against an undergraduate student are required to include an undergraduate student panelist, and the same goes in the case of graduate students. This unprecedented response is well within the powers of the ASSU. To even consider confirming the next slate of panelists, the ASSU should demand the presence of the OCS director at an open meeting to answer questions on free speech, hate speech, academic integrity, panelist training and more. The ASSU should demand that the OCS director, because of their work with the Board on Conduct Affairs, make serious pushes for transparency when issues students care aboutprotected speechand theHonor Codeare discussed. If there are no serious efforts taken to earn the trust of students back, then the ASSU should undergo a vote of no confidence in OCS — much like how the GSC initiated their ownvote of no confidencein University leadership on issues of affordability. Long before the People’s University was established, the Blue and White Tentreached Congressor even theSit-In to Stop Genocidewas founded, students already harbored serious mistrust. Last year, the Faculty Senatethreatenedto force proctoring on students in defiance of not only the UGS’soppositionto proctoring but also a 102-year precedent of deferring to students on academic integrity. This wasdescribedby senators at the time as “a disregard for undergraduate student voices” and “the democratic process.” This has only been exacerbated by concerns ofadministrative inaction, the remote possibility ofcommencementbeing canceled and the presence ofviolent agitatorson campus. These issues cannot be left to some administrative ivory tower. Students cannot naively assume that OCS will suddenly see the light and better itself the next day. Students know all too well about the constant ASSU campaign promises of advocating for students in the face of administrative bureaucracy and unaccountable decision making. OCS is the embodiment of both. The ASSU must act now to finally live up to its promises. Sebastian Strawser ‘26 is an Opinions contributor. He also writes for Humor and The Grind.

crimson_2024_53,"The stage was set: Selfies were carefully curated, expectations were on the rise, and pick up lines were rehearsed. Harvard’s 2024 Datamatch results had been released. This year,over 4,000 Harvard studentsprepared for the day by filling out profiles and completing Datamatch’s quirky questionnaire. The platform’s “secret” algorithm then curates ten romantic and/or platonic matches that are released on Valentine’s Day. There are a number of reasons why one might create a Datamatch profile. Some try to match with their existing friends in order to receive some of Datamatch’s free food perks. Others sign up for the possibility of finding new friends, or even — gasp — love. Still others flock to the site out of pure curiosity, interested in seeing who the algorithm matches them with, not intending on acting on this information. While Datamatch paints itself as a reliable matchmaking service, we should not view it as such. Rather, we ought to view it as nothing more than a casual platform, where one can be as serious or unserious with their questionnaire responses and matches as desired. Whomever the algorithm matches you with should not be viewed as your only chance at true love — a reality that seemingly eludes many Datamatch users upon opening their matches. Granted, the occasional Datamatch success story does exist. However, the platform’s algorithm undoubtedly has room for improvement. Datamatch’s flaws were exemplified by last week’snow-infamous leak, in which a student breached the site’s security and published a list of freshmen’s Rice Purity Test scores. Yet the leak only scratches the surface of Datamatch’s deficiencies. On Valentine’s Day, I heard complaints from Datamatch users dissatisfied with the quality of their matches. The overwhelming negative consensus underscores some of Datamatch’s deepest flaws and the superficial nature of online dating. Since Datamatch’s algorithm is purely based on user input — and relatively narrow user input at that — it assumes that users have a small set of strict preferences when it comes to prospective partners. What’s more, Datamatch reduces individuals to short public bios and their responses to comedic questions hardly indicative of anyone’s true personality. When surveying their matches, students are then forced to judge books by their cover. Datamatch’s creative questionnaire, pleasing aesthetics, and ultimately, provided matches, are great if you’re looking for a laugh and a good time, but not for love. To find true love, we must look beyond a curated profile selected by a computer algorithm, and instead see the humanity in the people around us. Let’s stick to skimming through questions with friends and grabbing free Joe’s Pizza on Datamatch’s dime. Carly E. Ramos ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Weld Hall."
crimson_2024_115,"Last July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed, with bipartisan support, a resolution stating that “Israel is not a racist or apartheid state.” At the beginning of May, a bipartisan majority of the House voted through the Antisemitism Awareness Act, a bill requiring the U.S. Department of Education to use the definition of antisemitism articulated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance when addressing allegations of discrimination on university campuses. According to the IHRA definition, arguing that the state of Israel is a “racist endeavor” would constitute antisemitism. If the bill is passed into law, the Department of Education will presumably issue regulations about what speech is forbidden, and it may withhold federal funds from offending universities. It seems certain that this legislation will generate intense pressure to characterize accusations of Israeli apartheid as per se antisemitic. Opponents of the bill argue that the First Amendment protects political speech no matter how hateful, and that accusations of racism taking aim at the Israeli government’s policy decisions are not inherently antisemitic. But the House opponents of the bill don’t, that I’ve seen, address the claim that Israel is an apartheid state on the merits. The reasons are obvious — why make the most provocative possible argument against the law? And because the apartheid accusation is rarely discussed in the mainstream media, the facts I outline here comparing the West Bank to apartheid South Africa are rarely presented as a group to support it. The accusation may now be forbidden on campus without ever having received a fair hearing in public debate. This is all the more likely because media attention is rightfully monopolized by Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza and the Hamas massacre that provoked it. For decades, Palestinian scholars and activists have made the case that Israel is committing apartheid and have been routinely ignored. The mainstream media has also had little or no reaction to the recent turn of international and Jewish Israeli human rights organizations, including the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, the Israeli equivalent of the American Civil Liberties Union, to the conclusion that Israel practices apartheid at least in the West Bank. (Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic reached the same conclusion in 2022. The Netanyahu government and vast swathes of the Israeli public have denied and denounced the apartheid accusation as part of their campaign against liberal Israeli NGOs, creating a rational fear of reprisals for any American academic and any student activist who might think to get involved. If the House bill were to become law, the chilling effect would be multiplied many times over. No one has ever been prosecuted for apartheid, which is a crime against humanity under international law. But even if Israel’s leaders are never criminally charged, the facts I present here show a striking similarity between Israel’s regime in the West Bank and South African apartheid in its fully developed form. The current South African government has already formally announced its agreement with the comparison. Of course there are differences between the two regimes, but I don’t think they undermine the basic point. There is also a case, albeit a complex one, that Israel practices apartheid against its Palestinian citizens within Israel proper. I stick here to the simpler case of the West Bank. First, both Israel and South Africa appropriated large land areas and reserved them for the exclusive use of the dominant group. Approximately 42 percent of the land in the West Bank is, according to Israeli sources, occupied by settlements housing approximately 700,000 Israeli settlers. The settlement territory and population is still expanding, along with sustained settler violence against their Palestinian neighbors and Palestinian violent resistance. Second, the West Bank, split into settler and Palestinian areas, is similar to the white and Black areas in apartheid South Africa. In both cases, regulations restrict new residence in the dominant area to the dominant group, and a pass or identity card system restricts the freedom of movement of the dominated population from their zone into the dominant areas. In the case of Israel, Palestinians are forbidden to use much of the network of modern highways that link the settler areas and fragment the Palestinian ones. The West Bank barrier wall further restricts Palestinian movement and also isolates and intensifies Israeli control of the Palestinians and their land on the Israeli side. Third, as in apartheid South Africa, there are massive differences in Israel’s provision of government services in settler and Palestinian zones. Settlers are fully integrated into the provisions for public investment and social services of Israel proper and indeed receive large subsidies. The Palestinian areas, like the townships and Bantustans of apartheid South Africa, are starved for investment and lack the authority or the funding to minimally provide for the needs of their expanding population. Moreover, Israel’s military authority sharply restricts building permits in Palestinian areas, so families become steadily more crowded as the population grows. Fourth, the Palestinian economy is effectively subordinate to the larger Israeli economy, dominated by Israeli firms and financial institutions, with no regulatory or tariff power to resist economic exploitation. Furthermore, Israel disproportionately allocates water, the single most important natural resource in the West Bank, to the point that settler lawns are sprinkled while neighboring Palestinian villages receive barely enough for basic household needs. Fifth, like Blacks in apartheid South Africa, Palestinians in the West Bank have no political voice in the Israeli decisions that control their lives. And compared to the Jewish citizens of Israel who live next door in the settlements, their civil rights are radically restricted. For example, because they are Palestinian, not Israeli, they live under Israeli military security law rather than under the Israeli civilian law regime. As a result, they can be detained indefinitely without trial. As in apartheid South Africa, numerous independent investigations have documented the routine torture of political arrestees. And according to the UN, teenage children arrested for offenses like throwing stones at soldiers are routinely subjected to “some form of violence” while in custody. This is a partial list. But isn’t everything Israel does in the West Bank simply its necessary response to Palestinian terrorism, forever exemplified by suicide bombing in the second Intifada and Hamas atrocities on Oct. 7? The basic legal structure of separation and domination in the West Bank, which is effectively race-based (Jewish vs. Palestinian , has nothing to do with security. It has to do with, indeed it is itself, the (settler colonial project. It is true that protecting the project against Palestinian resistance is about security, including the routine use of detention and torture. But in this respect, the similarity between Israel’s actions in the West Bank and South African apartheid in the years of its violent repression of the (violent resistance, is at its clearest.

stanforddaily_2024_21,"In 1968, President of Milton Meyer & Company Walter H. Shorenstein bought the San Francisco International Hotel with the intention of evicting its residents andreplacingthe building with a multi-level parking garage. Predominantly occupied by elderly Pilipinos, Shorenstein had no issue withevictingthis Manilatown residence because, as he put it, he was just “getting rid of a slum.” Following public pressure and community criticism, Shorenstein gave the Manilatown community a moment of hope with a three-year lease. However, he would later secretly sell the International Hotel (more commonly known as I-Hotel to the Four Seas Investment Corporation, who would continue to work with him. Milton Meyer & Company continued to “act as the hotel’s property manager” and collect rent, even after thetransferringof ownership. Despite an almost decades-long struggle with the efforts of student activists, local community members, and the tenants themselves, the elderly residents were evicted in the late 1970s. By the 1980s, the hotel and many other Manilatown businesses and residences were demolished. “He could have interacted with us positively, but he chose not to. And we got evicted,” said Jeanette Gandionco Lazam, the last living tenant of the I-Hotel. “And if you sincerely believed that Walter Shorenstein was going to give us housing after the eviction, that never happened,” Lazam told The Daily. Manilatown no longer exists due to the aspirations of predatory landlords like Shorenstein. More than two decades later, in 2005, Stanford wouldrenamethe Asia/Pacific Research Center to the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center (APARC . Housed under the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI , the Center acts as Stanford’s hub for contemporary Asia studies. APARCfacilitatesresearch about the Asia-Pacific region, fellowship and training opportunities, public speaker events and publications. “I think that it’s about time that some of these people whose names are on these hotels and schools are looked at in terms of their history in the development of San Francisco and what they did to communities of color and working class communities,” Lazam said. According to the Center’s 30th anniversary program, the name change was made in recognition of APARC’s “greatest benefactor.” The Center celebrates Shorenstein for his significant contributions to Stanford’s Asia-Pacific research, ranging from his $15 million leadgiftto his introduction of former U.S. ambassador to the Philippines and Japan Michael H. Armacost to APARC. According to aUniversity of California, Berkeley report, Shorenstein said he began campaigning for Asia Pacific issues at Stanford when he “became aware that the future destiny of San Francisco and the Bay Area would be pretty much connected with the Pacific Rim.” However, the Center neglects to mention that this “patron saint” of APARC is the same man who initiated the gentrification of San Francisco Pilipino American communities just decades before. “Shorenstein’s reputation has always been one of a progressive because he was aligned with the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party … people don’t look at what he did to contribute to the redevelopment push in San Francisco to make this the Wall Street of the West,” Lazam said. Among the tenant activists, students from San Francisco State College and UC Berkeley joined the fight to prevent the gentrification of Manilatown and the demolition of I-Hotel. It is our job to preserve the legacy of both these student activists and the tenants, ensuring that history does not repeat itself. Therefore, the University and the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies (FSI must remove Walter H. Shorenstein’s name from APARC in order to honor the Pilipinos and other Asian Americans that were wrongfully removed from their communities. When I first heard about APARC’s Southeast Asia program, I was excited for the opportunity to finally engage with active research on the Philippines. When I heard that the namesake of the Center helped gentrify and destroy San Francisco’s Manilatown, I was heartbroken. Isn’t it ironic that Stanford’s sole dedicated space for Southeast Asian scholarship is housed within a center named after a man who destroyed a Southeast Asian community? This is an irony that cannot continue, especially considering the University’s strong Pilipinx and Pilipinx American community. Panahon na,Stanford. Don’t recognize Shorenstein, recognize Manilatown.

thetech_mit_2024_6,"Publisher’s note:This piece was originally released on May 24 in an email to the MIT undergraduate community (“EASTSIDE Paper on Admin Past + Present Actions” . The history of MIT is littered with struggle and change, and nowhere is this more true than the East Side. Once a collection of MIT’s oldest undergraduate residence halls, the East Side has notably attracted low-income students due to low room and boarding costs and artistic folk for the historic muraling policies. From the park where Bexley once stood to the currently empty East Campus courtyard, and from the now quiet and white-washed halls of ‘70 Amherst St’ to the still vibrant but partially covered murals of Random Hall, the humans who reside within these residence halls pride themselves on being part of communities starkly against the grain of society. These residential communities nestled deep in MIT s main campus have served as centers of queer culture since the opening of Senior House in 1916. They have functioned as so much more than dorms, continuously providing sanctuary and solidarity to LGBTQ+ and similarly marginalized students in an otherwise hostile campus environment. From their earliest days welcoming residents to the present day, these communities have been at the forefront of many advocacy efforts, challenging the status quo and demanding recognition and respect. However, their very existence is threatened by institutional policies that have sought to reduce liability and sanitize the campus environment at the expense of diversity and inclusivity. Even now, institutional authorities seek to repress dissent and maintain a veneer of conformity, as evidenced by the administrative response to recent protests. East Side history is not a tale of triumph; rather, it is one of a constant struggle against institutional policies that have sought to suppress the voices of marginalized individuals. Unfortunately, since the early 2000s, students have been fighting a losing battle as East Side dorms have been targeted and systematically dismantled one by one. From the demolition of Bexley to the controversial decision to reform and then close Senior House and the ongoing struggles over East Campus policies, MIT s administration has consistently prioritized the interests of its institutional reputation over the well-being of its students. Drawing upon archived websites, news articles, oral histories, and a personal analysis of contemporary events, I seek to reveal the resilience demonstrated by this vibrant community in navigating and resisting institutional oppression. Bexley Hall was the first victim to fall at the hands of the Institute, demolished back in 2013. According to an anonymous blog post hosted on the EC website, it was “a gateway to the East Side, conveniently situated on the West 2 . The official Bexley website, still actively hosted on MIT’s servers years later, states that “We at Bexley feel that dormitory residents have the right to live in an environment that suits their own tastes, and in that spirit we demand of our prospective housemates nothing at all except consideration for the rights of others 1 . Bexley served as a sanctuary for LGBTQ+ students, students from low-income backgrounds, and other oddballs for whom its culture of absolute personal freedom offered a refuge from the heteronormative and restrictive statutes that permeated many college campuses in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. At Bexley, residents found not only a place to live but also a space to express themselves freely, whether through art, music, gender, sexuality, or activism. The culture of Bexley was shaped by its decentralized government structure and anti-authoritarian attitude. Bexley developed a reputation of doing the exact opposite of what was expected: instead of a rush, Bexley held an “anti-rush” where they would attempt to scare freshmen away from living in the dorm. A Bexley alumnae whom I spoke with said the purpose of anti-rush was to ensure that “...only people who would join would be those who couldn t be scared, rather than people who just wanted to be close to campus.” The social culture is accounted as very tight-knit within the dorm but antisocial to outsiders. Residents fostered a collective spirit of defiance against perceived injustices perpetrated by MIT s administration and the broader legal system. The culture of anti-admin and anti-governance at Bexley was not merely about defiance for defiance s sake, but rather a conscious effort to reclaim agency and autonomy in the face of oppression. A famous (and purposefully hilarious example of organized defiance is Bexley’s response to an FBI raid, spurred by rumors of a drug distribution network run out of the basement. Beginning with a “Welcome FBI” sign and ending with an overly padlocked chest containing none of the evidence the agents were searching for, the raid is a story of creating hilarity in the face of authority and serves as a now classic example of Eastside ethos 4 . By 2013, the building was separating from the foundation, so there was a defined reason for the building’s demolition. The decision to put a park over the remains of the foundation instead of building a new undergrad dorm is harder to attribute to anything structural, especially in the face of a past and current housing crisis. Current community members are under the impression that administration saw a way to ‘be rid’ of a problematic sect of campus culture and ran with it. However, Bexley is the least accessible in regards to information: my account of their culture and downfall is hurt by the fact that it was so far in the past for those on campus now, that we’ve lost connection with the part of the community that was distinctly Bexley. After its closure and demolition, its current residents were absorbed into other East Side communities. As time has passed, alumni have become harder to identify and contact. Thus, I doubt I’ll be able to track down a conclusive answer on the true reasoning for the demolition. Despite its loss, the ethos of defiance present in Bexley s culture lives on throughout the East Side, and it especially took hold in Senior House. The internal organization of Bexley and Senior House were very different, and the cultures of each community were very distinct. Bexley had a pseudo-anarchist government, whereas Senior House had a more typical dorm government. Bexley only took in those that lived without fear, while Senior House was a haven for misfits with an official motto of “A home for Wayward Beavers.” Alumni accounts of the culture describe it as a place where those who had struggled to find acceptance prior to MIT could be understood without question and loved for their differences instead of in spite of them. From the biker bar mysteriously present in the basement to the cozy customized lounges, there was a space for everyone who wished to be there, no matter where they came from. However, a welcoming culture draws in more than just people, and it was this culture that put a target on the backs of the Senior House community. The origin of the Senior House–admin conflict stems from the greater problems that come with institutional memory. MIT is administered, or at least administratively influenced by the MIT corporation. The further up the organizational chain you go, the higher potential there is for the administrator in question to be under-informed about the current culture and community of any given dorm. This is the result of an inherent disconnect between high-level administrators and the student body, aided by the fact that students cycle through the institute and graduate with some regularity, while administrators can remain embedded through lengthy careers. When the culture of Senior House was called into question, it was the result of a survey administered under false pretenses. As far as residents were informed, the survey was centered around student mental health, which was anonymized and administered by another college 7 . Advisory alumni such as Mark Feldmeier encouraged the residents to be truthful in their responses to the misrepresented survey in the hopes that MIT would increase and improve the resources available to a community struggling with mental health concerns. Unfortunately, the description they were given was false in every sense. MIT administration gave the survey themselves, then took the non-anonymized survey results and turned them on Senior House specifically, attempting to use drug use statistics to crack down on the community. Looking back, Feldmeier states that the downfall of Senior House was “Set up like a chess game…and it’s easier to see how residents were played as pawns of the administration.” This ‘smoking gun’ was unusable based on the falsehoods under which the survey was conducted, so then-Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart cited comparatively low graduation rates as evidence for her moralistic viewpoint of ‘doing the difficult yet correct thing and saving MIT from the scourge of Senior House’ 7 . Interviewing residents like Megan Levin and alumni like Feldmeier quickly puts this viewpoint on blast. First and foremost, the draw of this community to queer, low-income, and otherwise marginalized/minority students means that the individuals within start out a rung lower than the ‘average’ MIT student 7 . Additionally, drug use was not only much lower at the time that admin attacked Senior House than in prior years 7 but also a community focus on safety had been adopted and implemented to limit harm to residents and community members 8 . As a student many years later, I’m unsure of what pushed admin to act when they did, seeing as the culture didn’t significantly change and actually was on a path to betterment, but I also wasn’t there to see this sequence of events out. The original administrative response to the survey results was publicly marketed as a ‘rehabilitation’ or reform. Freshmen, the life and energy that revitalize the community each year and pull upperclassmen out of the hell of classes, were banned from living in the dorm. A new house team under a ‘Senior House specific’ contract was brought in, and mandatory reporters were installed to ensure that residents were following the strict rules set upon them. The administration made it clear that if a single rule was broken, the 101 years of history placed on students’ shoulders would be gone forever, and deemed it a reasonable expectation for students to bear. The resident perspective on the 2016-2017 academic year is bleak. Sarah Melvin, Senior House president, stated in an email sent in the Summer of 2016 that she was “...deeply troubled by how this policy was decided without any student input... While I think some of these proposals could’ve been beneficial…. many will be very harmful to the Senior Haus community and to the wider MIT community” 9 . By limiting student autonomy and setting surveillance on them like hawks, the administration robbed them of the freedom to take the responsibility that was simultaneously demanded of them. Over the course of the ‘rehabilitation,’ students fought hard. Near continuous meetings with Chancellor Barnhart, President Reif, and committees of other top administrators left students quite literally in tears. In Feldmeier’s account, Reif and Barnhart called students liars to their faces and offered only cruelty and coldness when students sought negotiation and kindness. This first-hand account lends itself to wondering if rehabilitation was ever really on the table, as the concept implies support. Unsurprisingly, the building pressure on Senior House led the scared, exhausted residents to turn to coping mechanisms to survive the trauma, some of which proved unhealthy. Once administrators had definitive proof of a singular broken rule, they dropped the pretense and sent a dorm-wide email announcing the closing of Senior House in the Summer of 2017. In addition to the profound devastation of residents and alumni, the East Side community as a whole felt a butterfly effect. Amongst the class year of freshmen banned from living in the dorm, the effects were particularly dire. Administrators insisted that once the dorm was dissolved, the community was gone, and the effects could not be felt, but the resulting depression affected hundreds of students. A particularly devastating example involves a freshman on 41W in EC, who was a first-generation college student who had been drawn to live in Senior House during his CPW. The feeling of losing the home he never got to have tragically resulted in his death on 41W. While this is an extreme and particularly upsetting example of the consequences, it is a devastating demonstration of the passion and love that humans of the East Side have for our communities forged in spite of administrative actions. Though the threat of closing permanently has never been leveled at East Campus, there has been no shortage of battles with administration over policy and culture. In 2020, faculty and administration became aware of clothing optionality practiced in some of the halls in EC. Publicly advertised on the website and explicitly publicized to incoming freshmen at Rush each year, East Campus ensured residents comfort and enforced policies created to limit encounters with facilities and other staff in the building on their own for years. However, without the option of plausible deniability, HRS and the general MIT administration pushed for East Campus to implement an official policy. Their initial goal was to ban clothing optionality entirely, but spirited resident pushback and the careful actions of EC exec under President Tesla Wells allowed for an agreement to be made 14 . After over a year of meetings, presentations, and negotiations, the current policy of toptionality was put into place, marking another defined loss of Eastside autonomy, if not a complete one. This policy served as law until renovations, during which every aspect of our culture is to be put on trial yet again: murals, cats, and toptionality are all under fire as the administration attempts to scrub at the ‘stain’ of Eastside culture until there is no sanctuary left for us. I joined East Campus after arriving on campus for my FPOP, and as a student entering as both queer and low-income, I initially struggled to find friends and a place I felt at home. I came out years ago in my hometown, but I faced social backlash and town-wide homophobia from the moment I did to the moment I left. Arriving on the EC build site and unquestioningly being handed a power tool was the beginning of something new. Though it’s only been a year, the community I’ve found is the first place I’ve truly felt able to be myself without fear. There may be inter and intra-hall drama and petty arguments, but when it comes to the things that matter, like identity, expression, and acceptance, EC stands behind community members unwaveringly and without question. The biggest current example is the pushback against the renovation-related change. While each hall prides itself on individual culture, and historic rivalries between halls dictate day-to-day interactions, every active hall has representatives on the renovation committee. The admin team working with us stalls on policy issues of toptionality, customization, and cats, but we speak as a united front. As students, recognizing that EC will be the last East Side dorm is something that we’ve had to accept, and we’ve gone so far as to hold student-only meetings to nail down talking points and make our concerns more easily heard. At this point in the fight and facing so much pushback, it feels like we’re holding onto the shreds of something that was once so much bigger. We currently have two out of the original four eastside dorms remaining, and MIT has expressed plans to eventually demolish Random Hall as early as 2016. As Feldmeier shared about his experience with Senior House, this is a fight that it feels like we are meant to lose. Though the world has become more welcoming to queer individuals and there is more cross-campus representation, the demographic data doesn’t lie. The East Side still holds the majority of queer and marginalized students on this campus 13 . As these communities are systematically disassembled by a cruel and uncaring administrative body, that leaves the question: where will we go if MIT succeeds in dismantling this vibrant community that we’ve built? As much as mainstream culture lends itself to “wishing away” counterculture and alternative sects of people, we can and will continue to take up our place in society. In very recent history, queer existence was and can still be a contentious subject, yet we continued to love and exist in spite of the opposition. I can only hope that the East Side as a whole will be able to do the same. Feldmeier had a particularly inspiring statement on why the East Side exists in the first place: “The East Side is like the sewer drain of MIT, where all the refugees and students starting a rung below the ‘normal admits’ end up for their betterment because it understands where they come from and can help them in a way that no one else can.”"
ubyssey_2024_12,"June 27, 2024 Written byUBC Graduate Students for Palestine Editor s note: This article was submitted by Yara Ahmed, a PhD candidate in the Institute for Gender, Race, Sexuality and Social Justice, on behalf of Graduate Students for Palestine. On Monday, June 3, the UBC Vancouver Senate rejected a motion to suspend academic ties with Israeli governmental entities, including public universities, directly involved in the ongoinggenocideof Palestinians. While senators debated the motion over Zoom, Israeli forcesbombardedhomes in al-Bureij refugee camp in Gaza,slaughteringat least 11 Palestinians, including Rewan Ghanem, her husband and their baby daughter. The motion itself was modelled on two former academic suspension motions passed by the Senate. Thelatest, which ended six UBC partnerships with Russian public universities, was swiftly and almost unanimously approved within two months of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. That motion specificallycondemnedthe targeting of civilians and “civilian facilities, including hospitals and universities.” Yet eight months into the livestreamed extermination of Palestinians in the Gazaconcentration camp, and with the full knowledge that Israeli Occupation Forces* (IOF have murderedmore than 36,000Palestinians, most senators could not bring themselves to defend Palestinians’ lives, human rights and academic freedom. Out of step with over a decade of UBC organizing for Palestinian liberation as well as months ofglobal student protests, our senators’ dismal failure to hold UBC’s Israeli partner entities equally accountable to international law reflects both their own moral and intellectual inconsistencies as well as the depth of institutional anti-Palestinian racism at UBC. Indeed, themotioncited the International Court of Justice (ICJ ’s January 26rulingthat the Israeli settler-colony is plausibly violating Article III of the Genocide Convention of which Canada is a signatory. It referenced the ICJ’s May 24orderthat the Israeli government immediately halt its military offensive and other attacks on Palestinians in Rafah. It included the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court’sapplication to issue arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallantfor war crimes and crimes against humanity, notably the use of starvation as a weapon of war. It reported the United Nations Human Rights Council’sfindingsthat the IOF is committing crimes against humanity by systematically and intentionally destroying housing, services, and civilian infrastructures, includingevery single university in Gaza. In short, the motion came with rigorously researched receipts that made clear that anyone serious about UBC’s self-professedcommitmentsto human rights and equality would support it. By instead breaking with the precedent set in previous academic suspension motions, and making an exception for Israeli institutions participating in the genocide of Palestinians, senators proved that human rights only apply to those regarded as human. Palestinians do not meet their mark. Statementssubmitted by Israeli university presidents and others against the proposed motion repeatedly raised ‘academic freedom’ as a justification for maintaining UBC’s ties to Tel Aviv University, Hebrew University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, which allpartner directly with the IOFand globalarms manufacturersto design and produce weapons used in the ongoing genocide of Palestinians. Specifically, they claimed that suspending UBC’s partnerships with these institutions would ‘limit’ academic freedom. However, the motion itself did not even prevent individual faculty members from participating in independent research or funding agreements with Israeli academics and universities. What themotionactually called for is the severing of academic ties on an institutional level, which was widely supported in the case of Russia as “the only non-violent way we have to respond to these egregious actions in Ukraine .” Why, then, did senators invoke academic freedom against the motion to suspend agreements with three Israeli entities complicit in settler-colonialism, occupation and the global military-industrial complex? As one student senator speaking in favour of the motion astutely asked, “Whose academic freedom is at stake? Who benefits from these exchanges and at what cost? And what efforts has UBC made to defend Palestinians’ right to exercise academic freedom given that all of Gaza’s universities lie in ruins?” What is clear from their questions is that a narrow vision of academic freedom has been used by those opposing the motion to distract from its real purpose: doing what we can from our position at UBC to stand against genocide. Those against the motion wield academic freedom as an individualistic and restrictive neoliberal principle which sanctifies Canadian and Israeli settlers’ ‘choice’ to participate in courses and exchanges, irrespective of their social, political and environmental harms. This appeal to academic freedom dismisses the brutalcrushingof Palestinians’ right to education while wailing at the mere suggestion that UBC students could choose a summer abroad program at a university that isn’t directly involved in an ongoing genocide; such a position is deeply intellectually disingenuous, cynical and exemplary of the kind of racism Palestinian students and faculty endure on university campuses. For instance, the statement submitted by the HU President, waxing lyrical about the institution’s “extensive protection of academic freedom and freedom of speech,” conveniently omitted the universitysuspensionof Palestinian feminist scholar Dr. Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian this March after she publicly condemned the genocide. Hebrew University, whichhostsan Israeli army base on campus, has a long track record of attacks on Palestinians’ academic freedoms, fromthreatening expulsionsfor anyone expressing solidarity with Palestinian political prisoners on hunger strike tosuspendingstudents for singing about the olive harvest. Moreover, it is telling that some of the same UBC senators clutching their pearls at the mere thought of suspending three exchanges with Israeli institutions never raised the same concerns for academic freedom during the Senate discussion on the motion to suspend six academic partnerships with Russian entities. Notably, when severing partnerships with public institutions that were deemed complicit in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this motion was seen as necessary to uphold UBC’s social responsibilities to the global community; taking such an action was also seen as commensurate with their institutional expectations of neutrality. That asking the same commitment of the Senate now is presented as an affront to academic neutrality betrays the racist weaponization of neutrality against Palestinians. The fact that UBC has multiple Israeli partnerships and no partnerships whatsoever with Palestinian universities is proof that it has never been ‘neutral’ when it comes to the settler-colonial occupation of Palestine. By actively maintaining ties with institutions that have directlyparticipatedin land-theft, the racist Israeliapartheidsystem and the ethnic cleansing of Indigenous Palestinians for decades, UBC administrators have chosen to side with those responsible for the ongoing genocide. It is soul-crushing to see most senators remain so staunchly committed to the pretence that renewing these ties with Israeli universities is a ‘neutral’ stance amid the genocide. Doing so requires a wilful dismissal of the well-documented evidence of their central role in settler-colonial violence against Palestinians, an erasure of Palestinians’ vital contributions to knowledge production, and a reinforcement of a system of anti-Palestinian racism at UBC. Perhaps most galling were the statements submitted by people opposing the motion which claimed that they “supported” Palestinian rights, but not this specific motion on the spurious basis that they thought it was an “ineffective” way to advance those rights. Implicit in this dismissal of the motion’s “effectiveness” is the demand that a solution to Israeli settler-colonial violence which does not hold any Israeli institutions accountable be presented. This excuse for inaction on the part of UBC is fundamentally colonial when such partnerships give academic cover to institutions participating in the ongoing genocide of indigenous Palestinians. To those who question the “effectiveness” of suspending academic ties with Israeli institutions, we pose a question that Dr. Maya Wind asks in herbook: “Is there any Palestinian resistance movement that you might ever—or that you have ever—recognized as legitimate?” If senators cannot do the bare minimum to hold Israeli universities accountable to international law, then clearly their actions are not supportive of Palestinian human rights and anti-colonial resistance. The Senate vote will forever stand as a disturbing and defining moment in UBC’s history — one that shows that this institution is not, as it likes to boast, among the world’s leading centres of education. When administrators are determined to embrace genocidaires and frame those partnerships as a meaningful contribution to the academy regardless of the violence they perpetuate, how are we to take their professed ‘commitments’ to human rights and equality seriously? The real academic stewards today are the growing number of universities which have already suspended ties with Israeli entities in the name of Palestinian human rights a more liberatory, responsible and just conception ofacademic freedomand a consistent application of international law. FromSpaintoSouth Africa,Belgium,Norway,Finland,the Netherlands,Mexico,Basque CountryandSlovenia, these universities are modelling what UBC has failed to realize: our intellectual responsibility toward a more just world with a Free Palestine. *Author snote: While the Israeli army has branded itself as the Israeli Defence Forces, we insist on the use of the term Israeli Occupation Forces here to, we believe, more accurately reflect their role as a settler-colonial army.

state_press_2024_0,"When you have these really beautiful songs in the background, you start to feel like it s almost desirable, or it s almost worth romanticizing and taking something away from it that you may not have experienced in your own life. Though countless factors are involved in making a quality film, movie soundtracks should be acknowledged as the principal way to create a memorable experience for fans and foster a new community. Iconic movie soundtracks have existed as long as the medium itself, from original themes and instrumentals to full albums created to accompany a film. However, with production companies commitment to quantity over quality, especiallywithin streaming services, moviegoers find fewer films that take advantage of theemotion-capturingpower of music. (Music makes the other half of the experience, said Brittany Lane, a junior studying art with a focus in animation. The visual is obviously the most important part, it s what you’re going to see on screen, but what you hear around you, it creates the entire rest of the experience. Iconic soundtracks and themes go as far back as film itself, with John Williams Star Wars main themebeing perhaps the most recognizable.Despite being classic, Star Wars is one of many timeless scores that is often not listened to outside of the film itself. But new movie soundtracks have changed the game. Some of the iconic modern movie soundtracks that have made waves outside of the film include Oppenheimer, Call Me by Your Name, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Guardians of the Galaxy and, most recently, Challengers. Some are collaborative albums made by popular artists, some are compilations of already-released music and some are original soundtracks made by composers. What they all have in common is an artistic direction and intentional tie to the film and story within. To be successful, the music has to be complementary to the visuals and story on screen. The success of these soundtracks can be seen in that each of these specific films cultivated some sort of community and discussion about the music itself and allowed listeners to use their imagination. Call Me by Your Name,directed by Luca Guadagnino, and other peaceful films, use music to amplify the coziness presented on screen. When you have these really beautiful songs in the background, you start to feel like it s almost desirable, or it s almost worth romanticizing and taking something away from it that you may not have experienced in your own life, said Taylor Underwood, a 2024 ASU graduate. Challengers, another Guadagnino film, has utilized a completely opposite aesthetic in itssoundtrackthat has been a key element in the movie’s relevance and success. The techno, groovy and synth-heavy score created by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross was in stark contrast to what most viewers were expecting after the cozy atmosphere cultivated in Call Me by Your Name. My whole group, we listened to the soundtrack the whole way back from the theater, said Josie DeBord, a junior studying film and media production. It really elevated the movie because it felt to me like a bit of a tone shift. The way that they went about the soundtrack really, really, really helps the movie to stand out. At the height of the film s popularity, the soundtrack left a large mark across social media platforms.The official score has over 20 million combined streams on Spotify, and users on TikTok have posted tens of thousands of videos using these songs. Online communities carry so much of the conversation, Underwood said. My Twitter was flooded with people talking about the soundtrack, or even, I m going to go buy a tennis skirt now. In jest or not, movies like Challengers have an incredible influence on the audience and film industries standards of a high-quality movie. The characteristics of music and its collaboration with visuals amplify the longevity and values of beautiful films today.

stanforddaily_2024_37,"This past week, current undergraduate students selected their housing for next year. But “selected” is a bit of a euphemism — in reality, most students were scrambling to find spots, and many did not receive a housing allocation at all. The disastrous housing draw this year has seen rising seniors ending up in one-room triples and quads, with dozens of rising juniors being left unassigned — meaning that they may not have confirmed housing for months up until move-in. All the while, Stanford has actively reduced both the number and quality of available rooms byslashingavailability in EVGR andconvertingdoubles — living spaces intended to fit two people — into triples and quads in Roble and Toyon. Roommates have been separated and more students than ever are being crammed into smaller spaces, creating dissatisfaction and uncertainty for much of the student body. This situation has led to the creation of Swapford, an unofficial dorm room marketplace where desperate students are buying, selling and trading rooms for thousands of dollars on top of existing room prices. While serving a student need, secondary marketplaces like Swapford can exacerbate inequity where students who need the money will trade for a worse room from a student who has the cash to spend. Yet amid this mess, Stanford has justannounceda proposed 7% increase in room and board fees for the 2024-2025 academic year. This is a 7% increase on top of last year’s 7%increase, and compounded by the 4.25%increasebefore that. This isa nearly 20% increasefrom the room and boardfeesin 2021-2022, outpacing inflation in the same period — and Stanford already owns all of the dorms. Stanford is charging students and their families exorbitantly more for objectively worse living conditions. Provost Jenny Martinez, uponannouncingthis budget, said that the University will “make sure that we’re spending the money in the best way possible to address those affordability issues and building some capacity in the long term.” But these increasing feescreate and exacerbateaffordability issues for current students, who are living on a campus withlesscapacity, in order to construct buildings that we will never use. If the extra budget is indeed being used to construct more living spaces, that funding should be withdrawn from the $36.5 billionendowment, rather than adding to the financial burden of students who will not benefit from these future improvements. The rising prices for worsening housing affect all students. Students who earn enough income through part-time jobs or internships must contribute to their Stanford bills, even if they are on substantial financial aid. Additionally, students must pay taxes on the portion of scholarships applied to room and board costs, so when room and board costs go up, so does the tax contribution out of students’ pockets. Many students and families also take out loans to cover the cost of attending Stanford. And no matter how you pay, the declining quality of housing hurts everyone. Stanford’s student housing is in crisis for the coming year. The very least the University could do is to not make it more expensive. The Board of Trustees should reject the proposed rise in room and board fees while the shortage of quality student housing remains unaddressed.

rice_thresher_2024_18,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/20/24 9:38pm In a rather rare contested election, the Student Association has two candidates on the upcoming ballot for secretary: Chelsea Asibbey and Calla Doh. Due to her fresh perspective outside of the Student Association, willingness to take initiative on her own ideas and emphasis on serving Rice communities, we, the Thresher Editorial Board, endorse Chelsea Asibbey for SA secretary. Both Asibbey and Doh are running on similar platforms of transparency, accessibility and bridging the gap between the SA and the students. Each cited the need for more interactive social media and working to increase dialogue on resolutions outside the SA. We feel, however, that Doh stakes her own campaign too heavily on presidential candidate Jae Kim’s platform, neglecting to form many secretarial goals of her own. While we acknowledge that Doh has admirable goals for the SA, such as initiatives to support campus sustainability and Rice PRIDE, we feel she could be more successful pursuing these goals through other positions. For the record, we think Doh would make an excellent college senator or committee chair. Asibbey, on the other hand, has made explicit her hopes to better connect SA with various clubs on campus, increase SA outreach through existing avenues and connect with Rice’s diverse communities. Social media also plays a large part in the secretary’s platform, and Asibbey has solid plans for changing and improving the SA’s current social media strategy. Largely through Instagram, she plans to make the SA social media more interactive, with public surveys to garner student opinion and frequent updates on Senate meetings and resolutions. As a business management major, she says she has the social media savvy to do it. Asibbey’s dedication is evident. Despite lacking an official SA position, she said she regularly attends weekly Senate meetings of her own volition — a feat in and of itself. Despite having less experience within the SA, we believe her dedication and visions will serve her well in the role. Throughout her campaign, Asibbey has consistently emphasized her goal of “leaving things better than she found it.” We’re confident that, for the SA, she will do just that.

crimson_2024_12,"Just over a year ago, as the news broke that Claudine Gay was to become Harvard’s 30th president, I prayed that from the mountaintop she could see a promised land — one that the arduous journey up the mountain has made difficult for me, for us, to envision. Becausewhen Black women win, the dream for a promised land — for liberation and life — is alive. Or so I thought. Once upon a time, I was just another Harvard applicant. Just another Harvard admit. Just another Harvard student. I naively thought that I had arrived at the bottom of a mountain whose top wouldintroduce me to legacy, a potential for freedom, and belonging. As I started the climb,my strengthwas shaky and I wrestled with the fact that the odds of having my ownhappy (living and human endingwere stacked against me. Coming to Harvard gave me a hope for the future, one that the world too often robs from Black women — that we can succeed, we can breathe, we can be. But as we fight to the mountaintop for a view of the promised land, what will we see? As the institution s first Black and second female president, the stakes of scrutiny for Claudine Gay were raised. Her testimony before Congress on antisemitism resulted in political and campus uproar, the integrity of her scholarship has been called into question, all the while she faces looming racialized threats and attacks on her character. Many doubt her dedication to combating hate and to sustaining the pedagogical mission of the university — but the irony is that the bedrock of being Black and woman is to know nothing more intimately than fighting and surviving when thestudies of your storiesare deemed unimportant, andhate and violenceare your everyday reality. As the years have gone by, the world and the University have shown me that I am not just another Harvard student. And no, it’s not because I am determined, nor is it because I am exceptional, but because I am Black and I am a woman. Throughout my ascent, I have been met with the sharpness of framing my ownpainful resignationsas powerful acts of resistance, the slippage every time Ilose a scholarly ancestor, and the stream of blood, sweat, and tears poured into a rebirth of acultural rhythm. Not to mention simultaneously trying to keep my balance as the world rocked when Covid-19 took our loved ones at disproportionate rates, whenBlack women diedand the world didn’t cry, and whenconflicts at homeand abroadchallenged our senses of safety and community. But the way up the mountain almost seemed worth it as I watched Claudine Gay ascend to the highest Harvard chair of all last year. And for a moment, I — andmy Black sisterson Harvard’s campus and beyond — rejoiced. We went to tell it on the mountain, over the hills, and everywhere. We knew that the higher (now former President Gay went, the colder the world would be. That’s often how it goes for Black women. She would continue to face, on a bigger and more public scale, the frigidity of a racist, sexist, imperialist, inequitable world. So, I asked for nuanced considerations of the responsibilities and legacies she carried. I called for love, grace, and protection on her behalf. I wanted more for her, as I wanted for the rest of the world. But for a second I forgot that the multilayered texture of the Black woman’s life meant that even when we are crippled by the cold, we face a scorching heat — a fire from within and around that requires us to move seamlessly through rocky terrain. Just over one year after that prayerful rejoicement, as Claudine resigns from her chair, I am confronted with the fact that most of the world did not pray alongside us all those months ago. Because these places, and those high up spaces, are simply not made for Black women to win. Today is not just about a Harvard president and the position’s shortest historical tenure. It is not about disagreements over geopolitical correctness nor honor in scholarship. The resignation of Claudine Gay is a heart-wrenching display that at the mountaintop for the Black woman, there is no promised land. No liberation, no forgiveness, no love, no protection. As if surviving the cruel cold misogynoir of the world while simultaneously being burned by the heat emanating through the intensified pressure Black women constantly face isn’t enough to conquer; the higher up she goes the thinner the altitude gets. At the mountaintop, the world robs the Black woman of her breath such that the only option is to let the suffocation kill her or to let it kill her dreams. And as she falls from the peak, the spirits and dreams of success, liberation, progress, and livelihood of the Black women she carries with her — across generations and diasporas — fall too. Today, I do not rejoice at Claudine Gay’s resignation. Instead, I fall to my knees at our collective resignation in the Black woman’s fight to climb to a mountaintop from which we might truly be able to see a promised land. Kyla N.

crimson_2024_45,"With Housing Day now decidedly in the rearview mirror, it’s time we step back and take a gander at the Harvard housing system. As we all know, every year on the Thursday before spring break, eager freshmen awake to hoards of upperclassmen banging on doors and chanting the name of their assigned House, where they’ll spend much of their next three years at Harvard. Each House has its own reputation — some more well-founded than others — that elicit reactions ranging from delight to despair (sorry, Quadlings . Nowadays, these reputations are mostly due to tangible characteristics, like proximity to the Yard, unique amenities, renovations (or lack thereof , and so on. Before the housing system was randomized, though, Houses were far more than how far you had to walk to get to them. Until 1996, freshmen were able to rank their preferred Houses, a system that was cherished by the overwhelming majority of the student body at the time. It was so revered, in fact, that this Editorial Boardlamented its abandonment. In large part, students loved the old system because it gave Houses a sense of personality: It established Adams as an inclusive home for queer students, Lowell as an oasis for the studious, and Mather as a home for the athletically inclined. If the House ranking system wasn’t broken, why would Harvard try to fix it? Put simply, administrators were concerned that students were self-segregating through their housing selections, causing them to lose out on the diverse student body our campus boasts. Undoubtedly, this argument holds some truth. If all students of a certain background chose to congregate in a select few Houses — like Black students did in the Quad, for instance — then both they and others might not be exposed to the diversity that is so central tothe Harvard experience. The argument would be more convincing if the ranking policy forced students of the same identity to live in a certain House, or if the entirety of one’s Harvard experience revolved around House life. Neither of these things, however, are the case. The same was true then as it is now: Students have never been institutionally mandated to delve into their House community and traditions headfirst. Then as now, students actively chose the spaces they wanted to spend their time in and were free to engage with their House as much — or as little — as they desired. Just like today, students then participated in a myriad of extracurricular activities, ranging from social clubs to athletics to pre-professional organizations. They, like us, attended classes with peers from across the College, not just within their House. In other words, despite their ability to choose a home they felt best reflected their interests and values, they nonetheless remained exposed to all of the richness of diversity that Harvard had to offer. God forbid we students wrest even the tiniest sliver of personal autonomy from the hands of University administrators, who seem to relish in regulating every aspect of our college experience. Instead of siloing students, ranking Houses provided an opportunity for students from different backgrounds to find a shared sense of community in their living space. Far from harming the college experience, distinct House cultures in fact engendered asense of belongingfor many students. If you don’t believe me, listen to the words of these students themselves. Black students, for instance, said that the Quad, being “the center of a Black community,” was a “really important and a very valued, treasured community and space.” One queer student claimed that ending the system “would be like taking all the gays and lesbians in San Francisco and New York and relocating them in even numbers throughout the United States … at the expense of the vibrant gay adult community in New York and San Francisco today.” Unfortunately, such fears proved true: There are very few — if any — true vestiges of the former House identities remaining. This, in turn, has led to aprecipitous declinein House pride on campus, dampening a social scene where fun remains stubbornly elusive. House choice has been made into a bogeyman of self-segregation. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Instead, the previous system was a pathway to a deeper sense of belonging at Harvard that the administration slammed the door on. Hopefully, this door won’t be closed forever. Henry P. Moss IV ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a History concentrator in Eliot House."
crimson_2024_103,"When I set foot on Harvard’s campus in 2019, I identified as cisgender lesbian and never would have claimed disability. Today, I graduate as a transmasculine, Autistic, physically disabled athlete and activist: a truer version of myself than I could have dreamed of my freshman year. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action, Harvard has come under scrutiny for its admissions model, which reduces diverse students to numbers and checked boxes — x percent this and y percent that. If Harvard hopes to develop us into leaders though, they must account for us as whole, changing people. We must be made to feel like we belong throughout our time on campus. Throughout my time at Harvard, the most challenging barrier to belonging here were the endless meetings, emails, and advocacy required to communicate my needs. As a chronically ill and trans person, I constantly needed to remind the University that my needs are not static. I have had more conversations than I can count with administrators, faculty, staff, and students, trying to convince them that I — and all neurodivergent people — are entirely capable of learning. In my five years at Harvard, I was constantly reminded that my disabled, queer, and trans communities were not known about — and thus, not properly cared for. I was asked to sit on councils, committees, and advisory groups — contributing feedback not with, but for my communities. It is, perhaps, the strongest throughline in my undergraduate experience: watching our University, which touts its diverse student body, struggle to truly understand and create a space where those very students feel they belong. Though some might point to cultural centers as evidence of Harvard’s efforts to create inclusive space, these efforts have been insufficient. Those centers that do exist are largely underfunded. Some only serve the college and some rely on only one overworked full-fledged staff member Harvard is neither recognizing nor acting on the best practices for building places where students can actually be themselves. While I have tried my best to advocate for my communities throughout my time here, Harvard cannot continue to tokenize and exploit the singular perspectives and efforts of multiply-marginalized students — or students who identify with multiple marginalized groups — as they have done with me. It must seek out accurate and detailed data about queer, trans, and disabled people at Harvard to truly understand our needs and experiences. Right now we have a dearth of data on acceptance and belonging at Harvard. In a recent meeting of the Inclusion and Belonging Student Leadership Council, President Alan M. Garber ’76 touted a small white book from 2018 outlining the University’s diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives. That very book comedically touted data referencing “female,” “internationals,” and “minorities” as the only three markers for diversity. The most recent data on belonging we have stems from a 2019 University survey. It showed that the two groups with the lowest reported percentage of belonging, at less than 50 percent, were a “genderqueer or nonbinary” group and an “aggregated gender identity” category — a label that includes intersex, agender, and genderqueer people, among others who may or may not identify as transgender. Even worse, some relevant groups, like disabled people, were not reported on at all. Despite finding a low belonging percentage for transgender students, there have been no meaningful University-wide efforts to support transgender students since this data was collected. This survey and the lack of response it elicited highlights the lack of multi-marginal approaches to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging work at Harvard. As a trans and disabled person, being excluded from data is an all-too-familiar experience that perpetuates a cycle of exclusion: Marginalized groups are excluded from data, and therefore receive fewer funding opportunities and attention, making them feel less at home at Harvard. Students from these marginalized groups are not admitted in critical mass, and so they will not benefit from community-driven support or alumni pressure for inclusion and funding. Prioritization of legacy students will continue to disproportionately exclude students of color and disabled students, making community support for marginalized groups even weaker. Thus, their exclusion will continue. Without internal efforts driven by data on acceptance and belonging, our community’s needs will never be seen nor respected. As I leave Harvard behind, I want to offer advice for creating a more inclusive future to University leaders, my fellow alumni, and current students. The University must continue gathering data on the student experience and investing in initiatives that marginalized student communities are demanding, like a multicultural center, representation in faculty and staff, and expansion of academic commitments. I have never felt more seen as a disabled person at Harvard than in the transgender spaces my peers and I have built. Many of my friends have similarly expressed comfort in spaces designed to affirm their womanhood, transness, disability, race, and ethnicity. Similarly, alumni should recognize when their words, advocacy, and donations can be used to increase student belonging, and should not hesitate to hold Harvard to account. If those efforts fail, we are left with one option: marginalized and multi-marginalized students have to support each other and themselves. According to forthcoming results from a survey and publication I led, transgender people at Harvard are disproportionately low-income, and often from states facing substantial anti-trans legislation, creating additional barriers to success. Two of the largest transgender focused projects in Harvard history are the Trans Task Force and TransHarvard, which has been operational for the past three years. Both are staffed by students who are largely not paid for their labor, overworked as they develop often-unsustainable systems to support their basic community needs, and who may not be able to access staff support given the political stigma around simply being transgender. Still, conferences like those that TransHarvard hosts bring Harvard a good name. Harvard benefits immensely from student initiatives, exploiting the free labor of students on various councils, leadership committees, and feedback forms. While I am proud of the work done by students, Harvard must pick up the slack, critically re-examining its treatment of marginalized people as a box to check during the admissions process. Just because we got in, doesn’t mean we are treated as though we belong. Kris King ’24 (they/he is a joint concentrator in History of Science and Women and Gender Studies in Kirkland House."
thetech_mit_2024_19,"While I agree with their intent of fighting injustice in the spirit of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in many cases the authors statements, or conspicuous absence of statements, contradict what Dr. King publicly said. The authors labeled Israel a colonizer. Dr. King said in 1968 I see Israel as one of the great outposts of democracy in the world, and a marvelous example of what can be done, how desert land can be transformed into an oasis of brotherhood and democracy.” The authors condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza, with no recognition that the invasion was in direct response to an attack on Israeli territory by an organized armed force. Dr. King said Israel s right to exist as a state in security is uncontestable and “...peace for Israel means security, and we must stand with all our might to protect its right to exist, its territorial integrity. The authors condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza without mention of the horrific atrocities against Israeli civilians, and the continued holding of hostages, many of them women and children. Additionally, they did not mention how Palestinians are mistreated by their own government, which uses them as human shields, withholds food, fuel, and medical supplies, and publicly declares that the wellbeing of their citizens is not their responsibility. The authors themselves quoted Dr. King, He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it. They also quote injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere”. The authors demanded that students who violated MIT policy have their punishment rescinded because they believed the policy was unjust. Dr. King said One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law. Let’s all agree on this quote: Nonviolence does not seek to defeat or humiliate the opponent, but to win his friendship and understanding…The end is redemption and reconciliation.” The purpose of this letter is not to defeat or humiliate the authors of the piece. It is to help them and their supporters recognize that the situation and history are complex, that both sides have legitimate grievances and shameful behaviors, that actions have consequences, and that calls to fight injustice should support everyone, not just those you agree with. Only when this recognition occurs, on both sides, can we start discussions about how to resolve the issues. Steve Cohen ’88"

He is interested in climate science and sustainability along with the physiology of healthy aging. Rowan has recently founded an organization on campus called Pick Up UBC dedicated to keeping the campus litter-free and hopes to inspire like-minded individuals to be stewards of the environment. Amid losing a war to Sparta in 416 BCE, the Athenian state entered several chariot racing teams into the upcoming Olympics. Athenians, known at the time for their skill in the sport, used the games as an opportunity to divert their citizens’ attention away from their military downfalls and towards their Olympic successes. In this way,sport was used by political leadersto enhance their legitimacy while promoting nationalism and distracting their audience from ethical violations on the home front. More recently, news reports drawing attention to thesystematic subjugation and persecution of Uyghur Muslims in Chinaand ofmigrant labourers in Qatarwere drowned out by coverage of the2022 Beijing Olympics and the 2022 Qatar WorldCup, respectively. Just like in antiquity, these sports mega-events were used to gain viewers conscious or unconscious consent for human rights violations through what sociologists of sport callsportswashing. The entrenchment of sport in our world and the emotional attachment we have to our favourite teams or players can allow us to be exploited by governments’ issue management schemes. This leaves us vulnerable to lending dangerously unquestioning support to sponsors or event hosts solely due to their positive association with a sport. Corporations use these same tactics. For example, in the 20th century,cigarette companies were prominent sponsors of sports leaguessuch as the NFL, MLB, and NBA. These companies sought to be associated with the joy of sport and the vitality of athletes rather than the discussion of serious negative side effects associated with their products. Today, ethically and morally questionable corporate sports sponsorships have taken a new form. In September 2021, while sitting on MacInnes field I was approached by an activist who was handing out pamphlets on theirresponsible use of coalin power plants used by Lululemon to manufacture their products. At the time I didn’t think much of it, but when I learned ofLululemon’s sponsorship of UBC athleticsthe memory of this interaction returned. Given the opportunity to write about a sports-related subject for one of my classes, I decided to investigate for myself what this environmental activist had shared about the Vancouver-based athletic apparel company. After some research, I now hold the opinion that Lululemon is exploiting the sentiments and experiences of UBC varsity sports as a distraction from their unethical and unsustainable practices. In my view, there are two places where Lululemon falls short when it comes to responsible manufacturing. The first is their unjust labour practices and the second is their lacklustrecommitment to sustainability. Lululemon has a history of these issues going back several years. In 2013, after the Rana Plaza garment factory collapse in Bangladesh which killed over 1200 people and injured approximately 2500, the company was criticized for being one of the last companies to sign the new Bangladesh Safety Accord. More recently,a 2022 reportfrom McMaster University s Governing Forced Labour in Chains research group said that despite Lululemon being lauded for their supply chain transparency, significant, pressing human rightsconcerns within their manufacturing networkremain. TheUnited Nations defines sustainabilityas “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. On sustainable manufacturing, Lululemon is far from meeting its own goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The companyclaimsto have reduced the percentage of absolute greenhouse gas emissions in all owned and operated facilities by 82 per cent since 2018. However, absolute greenhouse gas emissions area measure of emissions per dollar of revenue— so if total revenue rises then total emissions may increase. And to quote Lululemon’s2021 impact report, owned and operated facilities are “facilities where lululemon has direct operational control such as stores, distribution centers, and offices. This does not include manufacturing or transportation and logistics along our value chain.” This narrowed definition indicates a refusal to take full responsibility for sustainable practices along the full supply chain in areas where emissions are the highest such as manufacturing and power plants. By contrast, Patagonia, a Lululemon competitor, operates aSupply Chain Environmental Responsibility Programthat seeks to reduce its negative environmental and social impact from the retail store level all the way to raw material suppliers. Moreover, evaluations of Patagonia bythird partieshave demonstrated the company’svery real commitment to sustainability. Lululemon’s impact reports are a step in the right direction to full accountability, however, after sifting through the fine print I find there is not much substance behind their words. Lululemon’s2021 impact reportshows that the company has made significant progress in both increasing the percentage of products made with sustainable materials and the percentage of sustainable materials procured for their products. Lululemon defines sustainable materials as “materials contributing to improved environmental and/or social impacts compared to conventional versions.” So far so good. However, their definition of sustainable products is “products made with at least 25 percent sustainable materials.” Under Lululemon’s terms, products can be made of 75 per cent unsustainable materials and still be considered sustainable. Their2022 impact reportgoes on to show that the company updated its definition of products made with preferred materials (formerly sustainable products to “products containing at least 25-50 per cent or over 50 per cent preferred materials” which looks like a step in the right direction, but is just their old and uninspiring definition rephrased to appear more impactful. Late last year, Climate action group Stand.earth said in areportthat Lululemon was “travelling dangerously in the wrong direction” on emissions, and criticized the company’s most recent impact report, writing “greenhouse gas emissions from Lululemon’s global supply chain are projected to be as much as nine times higher than its 2030 target”. I care about the UBC community and I don’t want to see the integrity of our student population exploited by a company that promotes what I see as faux-sustainability, while positioning themselves as leaders in sustainable fashion. Lululemon’s products have a reputation for quality and comfort. However, should those properties outweigh Lululemon’s disappointing record on workers’ rights and climate action whenour university chooses who to partner with? My view is that the company is not as interested in claiming responsibility for the social and environmental issues entangled in its manufacturing and raw material supply chain as popular belief may suggest. As such, we should not let our support for UBC sports be manipulated into consent for Lululemon’s practices. Share this articlecopied!

crimson_2024_32,"On Monday morning of what was supposed to be a restful long weekend, I woke up to a WhatsApp message with a screenshot of a cartoon posted on Instagram by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee and African and African American Resistance Organization. The message read “this looks antisemitic to me.” It was. The cartoon isold news by now, and it evoked a torrent of condemnation from every corner. Later that day, down it went, and up came an apology from the PSC and AFRO: “Our mutual goals of liberation will always include the Jewish community — and we regret inadvertently including an image that played upon antisemitic tropes.” Their apology came alongside another apology, this time from Harvard Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine, which had reposted the cartoon to their Instagram story: “It has come to our attention that a post featuring antiquated cartoons which used offensive antisemitic tropes was linked to our account.” All of them just made me angrier. This time, the “apologies” are simply not enough. How does one “inadvertently” stick a blatantly antisemitic cartoon into an infographic? What could make a person look at a hand etched with the Star of David, containing a dollar sign and holding a noose, and say ‘yep, this is fine’? This image didn’t just flutter into your slides by itself. No, someone put it there with purpose and intent. And that someone won’t even come forward, or have their organizations publish an apology that doesn’t use the passive voice. In his book “Jews Don’t Count,” David L. Baddiel writes about how antisemitism has transformed over time from overt to nearly invisible. Throughout history, antisemitism was highly visible; it manifested in multitudes of ways, from the clothes and badges Jews were forced to wear, to restrictions on where they could live, to the jizya tax they had to pay. It was in the pogroms and the Talmud burnings. For centuries, antisemitism was loud and proud. Modern antisemitism, however, is the antisemitism of inattention and silence. It’s the antisemitism of not giving a damn. It’s the antisemitism of a blatantly racist cartoon sneaking its way into a carefully-crafted Instagram post without culprits having put it there. It’s the antisemitism of half-baked apologies. These days, nobody can issue a direct apology, one that doesn’t insist on obfuscating language about symmetry and universal inclusion. The PSC and AFRO’s apology made sure to note that they share “fundamental values of justice and liberation,” as do we all (I hope . But it wasn’t an Islamophobic, anti-Black, or anti-LGBTQ+ cartoon they posted — it was an antisemitic one. Why, for once, can they not just apologize to the Jewish community without ifs, ands, or buts? Because, as Baddiel writes, what you hear most when it comes to modern antisemitism is the silence. If nothing else, the cartoon has been enlightening. It illustrates the reason that antisemitism can tacitly flourish on campuses, notwithstanding their ostensible liberalism: Antisemitism assumes that Jews are simultaneously both inferior and powerful, controlling, and inherently oppressive. If Jews really are all that, is showing a Jewish hand holding a noose really antisemitic? Or is it just speaking truth to power? For those who believe them, consciously or not, dismantling the antisemitic myths of the powerful Jew, the malevolent Jew, or the Jew Who Cares About You Enough to Harm You, is difficult. Because if one does that, then one might have to contend with the fact that Israhell — the devil state — is, ultimately, just a state. That it is doing what any state in the world does: Trying to survive, and thrive, in a nasty set of circumstances, without having to prove anything to anyone. So, instead, the myths remain intact, and people go on not caring. Because to care would mean that, suddenly, antisemitism becomes as important as all other forms of racism. It would mean that Jews need to be protected; that Israelis — the prime manifestation of the powerful evil Jew — deserve to be protected. To many, these thoughts are anathema. Scratch that — not even anathema, but entirely unthinkable. But you, reader, must start thinking them. If you ever want to confront your antisemitism — the antisemitism you continue to assure us you reject — you must come face-to-face with the cartoon of the noose-holding, money-hungry Jew. Theoretically, I’m supposed to end this piece on a constructive note. But I won’t do that. The onus of change, in this case, is not on me. You, the non-Jewish majority, must understand that you have a problem that runs deep in your cultural consciousness, look that problem straight in the eyes, and strive to solve it. That’s what antiracism is all about. Have fun, and in the meantime, don’t say sorry and then move on until something is, once again, bad enough to cause a ruckus. Do something now; change yourselves. If you do change, I don’t need your tepid, passive-voice apology. And if you don’t change, I certainly don’t want it.

crimson_2024_123,"Kristen T. Faulkner ’16 won gold in the women’s road race at the 2024 Paris Olympics on Sunday, shocking the world of cycling as the 31-year-old American raced past the medal favorites in a competition she was not supposed to participate in — much less win. Faulkner, making her first-ever appearance at the Olympics, pulled away late from the three other cyclists in medal contention to breeze to a gold medal. The Alaska native was in a chasing group with Belgium’s Lotte Kopecky for most of the race’s final stages but an acceleration ahead of the final kilometer left Faulkner all alone as she crossed the Seine to reach the finish line. Faulkner’s victory earned the U.S. its first gold medal in the event in 40 years, and became the first-ever Harvard alumnus to win a medal in road cycling. The medal also brings Harvard’s overall tally this Olympics to eight — the second-highest medal count in school history behind only the 1896 Games, where Harvard alumni won 12 medals. Marianne Vos from the Netherlands, who won gold in the event in 2012, finished second with Kopecky of Belgium behind her. Both women finished nearly in line with the fourth place finisher Kata Blanka Vas of Hungary. The extraordinary circumstances behind Faulkner’s participation in the event only added to the drama behind her stunning upset. She was initially not supposed to race in the event and scheduled only to compete in cycling’s team pursuit race later this week. But Faulkner earned a spot in the competition after fellow American cyclist Taylor Knibb pulled out to focus on the triathlon. At Harvard, Faulkner was a student-athlete — just not in cycling. She participated on the lightweight rowing team and only began cycling after graduation, when she decided to pick it up as a hobby in New York’s Central Park. Faulkner enjoyed the sport so much that she eventually decided to quit her full-time venture capital job in 2021 to train professionally. Faulkner said in an interview before the Olympics that the discipline she learned as a Harvard rower — especially the early morning practices and dealing with the weight of expectations — helped her when she began training in cycling while working in New York. “The pressure to perform, it’s something I think a lot of Harvard kids know how to manage quite well,” Faulkner said. “And at this level of elite sport, there’s a lot of pressure to perform.” When Faulkner eventually left her job, it was to pursue her dream of getting to the Olympics that began when she was a child watching the Sydney Games. “I think for me, this was like the culmination of my biggest life dream I’ve ever had,” she said. Faulkner spoke about the risk she took in leaving her “dream” job to try to get to the Olympics — saying there were people “who were really questioning my decision.” Faulkner said making the Olympic team made “the sacrifice and the risk all worth it.” “To have it all worked out, I think just reinforces that it’s important to take risks when you believe in something and you’re passionate about something,” she said. Now, she’s a gold medalist — and Faulkner’s Olympics dream is still not over. After she finishes celebrating, Faulkner will turn her attention to the track track cycling team pursuit event on Aug. 6. —Staff writer Jo B. Lemann can be reached atjo.lemann@thecrimson.com.

crimson_2024_65,"As I write this piece, Israeli bullets pierce anything in Gaza which breathes life, which has yet to be obliterated, which signals Palestinian existence. As I write this piece, settlements in the West Bank fracture Palestinian lands. As I write this piece, Palestinian citizens of Israel are systemically discriminated against, a punishment for their people’s resilience. As I write this piece, Palestine is still not free, and it currently suffocates as Israel bombards its cities, people, and life. And yet, on this campus, silence resounds. This silence is a testament to the indifference that enables Gaza’s suffocation. As news of no-hire lists and doxxing trucks quiets down, and University-wide statements are no longer a weekly occurrence, complacency consumes our campus culture. Plunged into aloofness, our community seems to have embraced a dangerous assumption: Just because doxxing has lightened, so, ostensibly, has the genocide. Harrasment of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian voices has certainly underscored an institutional fear of growing consciousness and outrage around the present siege and decades-long settler-colonial project in Palestine. This is clear in the recentdoxxing campaignlaunched against students at the law school, in response to their student government passing a resolution calling for divestment. In general, though, the intensity of doxxing and harassment has declined since last semester, a trend many have taken to mean the genocide in Gaza has slowed, too. That couldn’t be more dangerous or wrong. While efforts at silencing and doxxing pro-Palestinian voices have relatively decreased, the atrocities on the ground are only increasing. As of April 16, the death toll in Gaza has reached over 33,000 people, with over 8,000 missing, according to Palestinian health officials. In the West Bank, at least 465 people have been killed, with over 4,700 injured. Israel continues to attack and raid hospitals like Al-Shifa and Al-Amal, including a two-week siege on Al-Shifa last month that turned the complex into a “mass grave.” Israeli forces are reported to commit sexual violence against detained Palestinian women as self-proclaimed feminists around the world turn their heads away in silence. Currently, roughly 1.5 million Palestinians — over 70 percent of the population of Gaza — seek refuge in Rafah, a city subjected to intensifying attacks by Israel, as world leaders — including America’s very own — grant Israel total impunity. In the unquestionable position of privilege we occupy at an institution like Harvard, silence is complicity in the face of mass death and starvation in Gaza. While we go about our daily lives on what this paper has deemed to be a“calmer”campus, Israeli forces bury the dead bodies of Palestinian civilians with bulldozers, continue to threaten a ground invasion of Rafah, and murder Palestinians seeking aid in the face of forced starvation. We walk on the grounds of an institution which has yet to disclose and divest from its investments in companies that operate in settlements designated illegal by the United Nations. As of 2019, Harvard had also yet to divest from links to the Israeli military, which, for the past 75 years, has stripped an indigenous people of the lands that have rooted their ancestors, their homes, and their memories. In December, a Harvard Management Company officialtraveled to Israelto show support for the state and explore additional investment opportunities. Just last week, the Harvard Undergraduate Associationindefinitely postponeda vote on a student referendum calling for divestment from financial interests in Israel’s occupation. To assume both a physical and moral distance from destruction directly linked to our institution is to be willfully ignorant. To those at Harvard who have grown desensitized: How much longer will you ignore the genocide of a people whose crime is its existence? How much longer will you choose to ignore the moral responsibility intrinsic to living in the United States, a state which promises Israel nearly $4 billion in aid every year? How much longer will you remain silent about violence and occupation bankrolled by our very institution? No matter how hard we try to claim a position of ignorance — of innocence — our silence speaks volumes to the world’s complicity as Israel decimates the once-vibrant and lively lands of Gaza. The occupation and bombardment of Palestine is unfolding before our eyes; the genocide will not cease once the trucks stop driving around campus. It did not stop with the doxxing, just as it did not start with the doxxing. We owe it to Palestinians to continue speaking up, to continue protesting, to continue calling for a permanent ceasefire. We owe it to Palestinians to remain strong in our solidarity until Palestinian liberation transcends chants to become reality. Dalal M.

crimson_2024_73,"This past week, I joined students across the Harvard community in celebrating “Intersectional Earth Week.” The event, hosted by Harvard Climate Coalition, featured teach-ins, affinity gatherings that centered on sustainable consumption, and other activities. The success of Intersectional Earth Week reflects Harvard student support for environmentalist initiatives, but these aren’t the only strides Harvard has made towards a more sustainable campus in recent years. In 2021, the Harvard Management Corporationdeclared it would divestfrom fossil fuels. A year later, the University announced the creation of the Salata Institute — an organization dedicated entirely to the clean energy transition and climate. And recently, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences significantly expanded the number of climate-oriented courses it offers. Such initiatives indicate that Harvard is somewhat dedicated, or at least aware, of the importance of leading on the climate. Despite this progress, none of Harvard’s schools possess an explicit policy for rejecting research funding from fossil fuel companies. One of the events of Intersectional Earth Week — a rally I organized with Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — directly urged Harvard’s schools to disavow these funds. This is crucial because fossil fuel companies have historically funded disinformation campaigns for their economic benefit. After scientists at Exxon routinely presented findings showing a link between carbon emissions and environmental destruction, the company decided to help create the “Global Climate Coalition.” This organization sowed doubt about research indicative of an impending climate crisis, impeding global climate agreements. ExxonMobil has continued to meddle in climate research through the provision of research grants to universities — including Harvard. Before fossil fuels, big tobacco also used research grants to manipulate studies in favor of their products. In 1954, tobacco companies formed a research organization known as the “Tobacco Industry Research Company,” intending to dissuade the public that there was an explicit link between tobacco consumption and lung cancer. This misinformation undoubtedly resulted in significant health consequences given that smoking related illnesses are estimated to have led to the deaths of over 100 million people in the 20th century. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health announced a policy in 2002 barring the acceptance of monetary assistance from the tobacco industry. Two years later, Harvard Medical School followed. Standing firm in their commitments to rejecting the tobacco industry’s research donations is a move that preserves the independence of their health research. The lack of such a policy regarding fossil fuels similarly undermines our reputation as one of the world’s premier research institutions, and stalls Harvard’s ability to be a leader on climate. Research studies that receive grants from fossil fuel companies tend to produce results that praise the benefits of non-renewable energy sources like oil and natural gas. However, research studies that do not tend to receive such funding paint a contrasting picture that more closely aligns with the scientific consensus on the detrimental effects of fossil fuel usage. In order to ensure that researchers can remain objective in their scholarship, Harvard has an ethical imperative to reject grants from fossil fuel entities. The climate crisis has significantly widespread health implications, similar to big tobacco. Take for example, higher rates of respiratory illness of communities located near major highways, or the myriad of deaths that have resulted from natural disasters in recent years. The evidence is clear — the climate crisis is actively damaging our health and livelihoods. By this logic, it is a moral imperative to create a similar funding policy for energy companies that rely on fossil fuels. Despite no institutional policy, Harvard’s individual schools, departments, and researchers have a unique opportunity to lead the way on rejecting fossil fuel company grants. While many researchers have already taken this pledge, my message to everyone, but especially students pursuing research at Harvard is clear: reject funding offers from fossil fuel companies.

crimson_2024_24,"On Wed. afternoon, Bill A. Ackman ’88 issued an uncharacteristicallyshort statement on X: Pershing Square USA, Ltd. — a new Ackman hedge fund — had filed with the SEC for an initial public offering. Unlike his firm’s existing stock offerings, which trade on stock exchanges in London and Amsterdam and cater primarily to high-income investors, this new IPO lists no minimum investment and no steep management fee. Ackman’s latest financial venture angles itself toward the masses. Of course, there is nothing inherently unsettling about a renowned financier launching a general audience hedge fund. But with Ackman, we have to remember the context. After months spent building a zealous audience on X and beyond, it seems like Ackman is going to cash in. The IPO filing, which apparently refers to Ackman synecdochally as “The Adviser,” says it plainly: “The Fund expects that it will have significant liquidity supported by its scale, name recognition and the Adviser’s broad following. The Adviser believes that the Fund has the potential to be one of the largest, if not the largest, listed closed-end funds and expects that the Adviser’s brand-name profile and broad retail following will drive substantial investor interest and liquidity in the secondary market.” Ackman’s fans — once valiant comrades in a grassroots assault on Harvard — seem to have been reduced to a “broad retail following.” The premise of the new firm is, openly, that his growing prominence will translate to investment. Let’s back up for a second. The Bill Ackman Show began in October, whenhe called on Harvardto identify the student signatories of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee’sstatement “entirely” blaming Israelfor the Oct. 7 attacks. Suddenly he was in the spotlight. Since October, Ackman’s X following has increased by more than 400,000; between the beginning of October and former University PresidentClaudine Gay’s resignationin January, national search interest in Ackman spiked to as much as ten times its prior levels. He had stirred the passions of broad swathes of the American public. In his noble crusade against an irreparably progressive Harvard, Ackman had tapped into a deep reserve of anti-elitism, anti-liberalism, and anti-intellectualism. It worked. President Gay resigned. Ackman’s movement won, but this is hardly Ackman’s curtain call. He has amassed a devoted following that prizes his every word. He also runs a successful hedge fund. The combined power of those two assets is undeniable. And for Ackman’s next act, it seems he’ll consubstantiate the two. Ackman’s new fund requires public appeal to succeed. He needs a large group of Americans to vest their faith in his judgment, and he has that. Their wallets will follow. So unfolds a quintessential American story, timeless and poignant. A sharp, intelligent, wealthy man gave the public a show. He played off their insecurity and contempt and optimism. Ackman commandeered the national narrative and made a mark on American politics. But his newfound marquee billing was always contingent on public buy-in. We all — Harvard, his following, politicians on the right and left — gave him the attention he needed. America lent him our eyes and airwaves, our loathing and devotion, our criticism and praise. Alas, it is all quite clear now. Ackman will, like many great populists before him, channel public fervor to his benefit. He joins the ranks of the many powerful men who have ensnared our attention, captured our hearts, and put our hands or votes or dollars to work for them. The Ackman Show channeled America’s hate and hope, pitting the nation against itself. Now it’s time to pay up. Lorenzo Z. Ruiz ’27, a Crimson Editorial Editor, lives in Greenough Hall."
ubyssey_2024_32,"May 20, 2024 Written bySheryl Lightfoot This article was originally published inThe Conversationon May 12. Dr. Sheryl Lightfoot is the Chair and a Member from North America of the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP and professor in political science, public policy and Indigenous studies at UBC. The recent agreement reached between the Haida Nation and the BC government — called theGaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang “Rising Tide” Haida Title Lands Agreement— marks the first negotiated settlement in Canada to recognize an Indigenous nation’s jurisdiction over its traditional territory. The agreement has beenwelcomed by First Nations leaders in BCas a significant breakthrough in the recognition and protection of the inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples. The agreementalso serves as an inspiration to Indigenous Peoples across Canada and around the worldwho share the common struggle to restore a viable and sustainable land base. Historic. Inspiring. But also long overdue, particularly in light of the clear direction provided by decades of rulings and recommendations by international human rights bodies. The United Nations Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples found in a2020 studythat Indigenous Peoples’ connection to their lands and waters is “the defining element of their identity and culture and their relationship to their ancestors and future generations.” Furthermore, as is the case for all people, wise management of land and resources is essential to the health and prosperity of families and communities. The British Crown and other colonial states relied on racist concepts like theDoctrine of Discovery and Terra Nullius, known as the unowned lands doctrine, to seize Indigenous lands and ignore or subvert the laws and institutions through which Indigenous Peoples had successfully managed these territories. The consequence has been cultural loss, alienation, impoverishment, conflict and environmental degradation. These are not simply the wrongs of the past. So long as the determination about who owns and controls what lands is based on such corrupt foundations, Indigenous Peoples will continue to be dispossessed and the state’s claims about justice, human rights and the rule of law will ring hollow. This is whyinternational human rights bodieshave repeatedly called on all states to work proactively — and in partnership with Indigenous Peoples — to respect, protect and restore Indigenous Peoples’ rights to control and benefit from their traditional territories. An example is the 2007UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples(UNDRIP , which Canadianprovincial and federal governments have both committed to fully implement. Significantly, the declaration itself did not create new rights. Instead, it built on decades of progressive developments in international law. Land rights and Indigenous self-determination are a consistent thread through the entire declaration. It affirms that Indigenous Peoples have rights to “the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired.” It also asserts all states “shall give legal recognition and protection to these lands, territories and resources,” giving “due respect to the customs, traditions and land tenure systems of the Indigenous Peoples concerned.” The positive legal obligations in UNDRIP means that Indigenous Peoples shouldn’t have to engage in costly, decades-long legal battles to restore rights that have been wrongly denied. Nor should states abuse their power to press for settlements that diminish the rights of Indigenous Peoples and further entrench an unjust status quo. Canada and the world need more models of what pro-active, co-operative realization of Indigenous land rights can look like in practice. The Haida title agreement provides one of the most promising examples I’ve seen. Significantly, while the settlement recognizes Haida titlethroughout the archipelago of Haida Gwaii, the province and the Haida Nation have also agreed that existing private property rights will be honoured, along with the resource leases and permits that have already been granted. The agreement also provides for a transition period as the Haida Nation begins to exercise their jurisdiction over public lands in the territory. Such an approach echoes UNDRIP’s call for a fair and peaceful reconciliation between the rights of Indigenous Peoples and “the just and most compelling requirements of a democratic society.” Hopefully this approach will also go a long way to address any public concerns over the consequences of this agreement and the precedent it sets. Any time the tide shifts, and a new law or policy breaks with the status quo, there will be voices predicting conflict and ruin.This happenedwhen BC adopted legislation to implement the UNDRIP.We saw it againwhen the federal government adopted similar national legislation. None of these dire predictions have come true. Today, as BC moves forward with legislation to implement the Haida Title Lands Agreement, I hope all Canadians see this development for what it truly is: a positive step to finally live up to the values shared by Indigenous Peoples and Canadians pertaining to justice and respect for human rights.

crimson_2024_119,"When students received notice that Alan M. Garber ’76 was confirmed as Harvard’s31st presidentFriday afternoon, many were far from shocked. “I was not surprised at all. I saw this coming from a mile away,” Gustavo Merino Martinez ’27 said. Garber’s elevation from interim to permanent president — at least through 2027 — seemed like a safe, even predictable choice from the Harvard Corporation. In his first semester in Massachusetts Hall, Garber proved himself able to steer the Universityaway from the national controversiesthat engulfed campus following the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. “Especially considering recent political conflict and turmoil, I think that Garber is exactly the president that Harvard has been looking for,” Merino Martinez added. Still, as Garber continues in the role on a non-interim basis, he will have to contend with a student body whose sentiments range from admiration to apathy to plain disappointment, especially over hishandling of student protestsand the20-day pro-Palestine encampmentin Harvard Yard. “I feel like Harvard is more focused on mitigating negative attention from the outside or certain media outlets or certain donors — groups like that — rather than what its students wanted,” Stella Lei ’26 said. “I was disappointed, but not surprised,” she said. Irati Egorho Diez ’26 said she felt indifferent about the announcement, adding that it seemed like nothing more than business as usual for the University. “To be totally frank, the difference between Garber being president and interim president is not that consequential to me,” she wrote in an email. “I would guess many students feel that way.” Several students said Garber has a long way to go to rebuild trust among affiliates following the end of the encampment in May. Garber wasaccused of renegingon a deal toend the encampmentafter dozens of undergraduate and graduate students weresuspended or placed on probationfor participating in the demonstration. Though the disciplinary actions prevented 13 seniorsfrom graduatingat Harvard’s Commencement ceremonies, 11 wound upreceiving their degreesafter the Harvard College Administrative Boardreversed the suspensionsand reduced probations last month. Still, the repeated flip-flopping under Garber’s leadership left some students with a bitter taste in their mouths. “I think overall, Garber has a lot of work to do in terms of building up his reputation with the students, because at the moment, there’s not a favorable image of him on campus,” Merino Martinez said. Other students said that Garber — the first Harvard College alum to become the University’s president since Nathan M. Pusey, class of 1928 — is well positioned to connect with students and understand their experience. “Harvard has a beautiful and amazing undergraduate experience, and it’s really exciting to me personally to see someone who’s had the Harvard undergraduate experience and gone on to lead the entire university,” said Institute of Politics President Pratyush Mallick ’25. “It’s definitely a benefit, and especially in a time when we’re learning about student experiences and they’re at the center point of campus tension,” he added. “Understanding the undergraduate experience and tailoring towards it is an amazing initiative that I hope President Garber focuses on.” Eunice S. Chon ’26, who took a freshman seminar taught by Garber in 2022, expressed admiration for Garber’s academic abilities and attention to detail. “He’s the smartest person I’ve met here, and that s not an understatement because you meet all kinds of really notorious intellectuals here. He is someone undoubtedly who knows everything. Any particular perspective or side, he has thought about carefully,” Chon said. “He might not agree with you, or might say some things that make you uncomfortable, but he is definitely someone who is incredibly meticulous, and that comes across when you talk to him,” she added. Mallick said he thinks Garber must remain steadfast to his values in order to serve as a successful leader for the next three years. “I hope that he’s keeping those core principles that heshared at the beginning of the semesterthrough his term as president,” Mallick said. —Staff writer Darcy G Lin can be reached atdarcy.lin@thecrimson.com. —Staff writer Cam N.

thetech_mit_2024_23,"Writer’s Note: Some portions of the actual COD statement have been edited or removed. To the Committee on Discipline, I am writing to contextualize my involvement in the Scientists Against Genocide encampment and to provide clarity regarding my actions during the week of May 6. My primary motive for participating in the encampment was an acute sense of moral outrage; for eight months, the civilians of Gaza have faced ceaseless air strikes, manufactured famines, and endless slaughter. This comes in the context of decades of land grabs, surveillance, and movement restrictions. I came to MIT with vaguely-defined ambitions of “making the world a better place,” but I soon faced the reality that the institution I idolized builds tools that destroy the livelihoods of many. I am disheartened that MIT researchers undertakeprojectslike “Autonomous Robotic Swarms” and “Planning and Sensing Algorithms for Underwater Persistent Monitoring” for the Israeli Ministry of Defense when such research is used to prop up an apartheid regime. “Academic freedom” is used to justify the continuance of these projects -- what about the academic freedom of scholars in Gaza, where every university has been bombed? MIT’s acceptance of $11 million inresearch fundingfrom the IDF since 2015 is disgraceful; the notion that I ought to sit quietly and ask politely for change seemed nonsensical. As a student, I have little power other than where I place my body; regardless, I am compelled to act in whatever ways I can, particularly given the urgency of the matter. People are dying as we write polite emails stuffed with academic jargon and insincere pleasantries. The choice of an encampment as a form of protest was not arbitrary; the tents on Kresge Lawn served as a stark reminder of the 1.7 million peopleinternally displacedin the Gaza Strip. The encampment’s visibility was purposeful; MIT should not be insulated from the happenings of the outside. If you are engineering projects that shape humanity’s future, you must bear witness to the state of the world. I emphasize that my usual role in the encampment was ensuring the safety of my peers. I took on many marshaling shifts and I was trained in de-escalation tactics. I connected newcomers with friendly faces and needed resources, I consoled my friends as they faced ceaseless harassment, and I coordinated with community members to arrange for leftover food to be donated to local shelters. I have compiled job resources for student activists and volunteered with local mutual aid organizations because everyone should have what they need. Practicing values like community care is more important than merely professing them. These actions stand in stark contrast to MIT’s administrative choices. Despite the use of “student safety” as a justification, many of these actions, particularly evictions, are clearly punitive rather than protective in nature. I struggle to understand how forcing students into homelessness promotes campus safety; moreover, these kinds of measures necessitate the student organizing they were intended to deter in the first place. If MIT will not protect its students, we must protect each other. Everyone needs a roof over their heads. Cynthia Barnhart’s statement during a faculty meeting on May 17th analogizing interim suspensions issued for student protestors to those issued for sexual assault perpetrators is particularly troubling. Violations of bureaucratic rules do not nearly equate violations of others’ bodies, so this comparison is simply egregious. Moreover, this feels particularly distasteful given the harassment that myself and many female-presenting members of the encampment faced from pro-Israel counterprotestors. I’ve had people scream in my face that I deserve to be anally raped, that they’d like to use my long hair to choke me, that a trip to Gaza would “make me straight”. I disengage and I do not take these things personally, but I do not deny that these experiences were degrading and humiliating. I despise MIT’s narrative of the encampment as a hostile environment -- to be honest, the reason I spent so much time there in the first place was the extraordinary support I received from the SAGE community. Local grandmothers delivered hot meals for us. When I spoke, people did not talk over me. To be frank, most of the hostilities from my perspective came from counter demonstrators; I do not care about personal insults, but some actions reflected a disregard for human dignity that I find inexcusable, and the fact that MIT has not sanctioned any of these acts despite IDHR reports and administrative pleas boggles me. I include the following personal anecdote as an illustration. During the beginning of the encampment, my peers and I created a memorial to the thirty-four thousand Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks since October 7th. Each death was represented as a single tally mark; it took three days and many hands to make. This process was sombering, each tally mark a life as complex as yours or mine. Whether they are mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, doctors, journalists, or students, they are casualities of a genocide so extensive that the loss of their life can only be represented as a small stripe of red paint. On May 8, an undergraduate student defaced this memorial with an Israeli flag. Their group jeered, laughed, and filmed. A later communication from MIT only detailed the fact that someone put a red handprint on the Israeli flag that was over the memorial. Whatever injustices we face as student activists pale in comparison to the atrocities inflicted daily on Gazan civilians. IDF soldiers haveposted footageof themselves riding the bikes of children whose homes were destroyed in air strikes andposingwith the underwear of Palestinian women. I have a friend whose entire neighborhood has been destroyed by air strikes. Scholarsestimatethat the death toll in Gaza could be up to 180,000 once indirect deaths (e.g. disease, malnutrition are accounted for. Destruction on this scale should never be normalized. “The principle that people should not kill other people is more important than notions of freedom to do any kind of research one might want to undertake.”--MIT anti-Vietnam-war protestor, 04/22/1969. I do not see myself as a radical nor my values as particularly controversial. During the Lobby 7 sit-in on May 6, I carried a sign with the phrase “All Children Are Our Children”. The screams and cries of terrified elementary schoolers ringing out into the night air before fading to silence should never be a scene of daily life. I believe that as scientists at one of the most powerful universities in the world, we must hold ourselves accountable for the impacts of our research, and that we are obligated to disrupt the construction of weapons of war. The actions during the week of May 6 reflected these beliefs; stalled negotiations left us seeking other routes. Administrators rejected a proposal to apply the red-yellow-green-light system described in the 2020 Suri Report to research funding without providing a counter argument; escalation seemed necessary. I understand that MIT has the full right to enforce its rules and policies; I do not entertain notions about being on “the right side of history”. This is not about me. Children in Gaza are missing limbs and mothers. My peers are brilliant, insightful, and steadfast. I am honored to know them. They are fully capable of building a liberated world; I hope they have the courage. Kate Pearce ‘27 studies urban planning and computer science and is a member of the MIT Coalition for Palestine.

rice_thresher_2024_14,"ByPavithr Goli4/16/24 10:51pm As I sit down to write this farewell column, I can’t help but feel a whirlwind of emotions swirling within me. It feels like just yesterday that I nervously clicked the “Join Meeting” button on Zoom in early August of my freshman year to express my interest in joining the sports section of the Rice Thresher. Daniel Schrager and Ben Baker-Katz, the sports editors in my freshman year, welcomed me with open arms, encouraging me to write for the Thresher. Little did I know that this initial encounter would mark the beginning of an incredible journey that has shaped my college experience in ways I could have never imagined. When I first joined the Thresher as a wide-eyed freshman, I was filled with enthusiasm and eagerness to share my opinions with the greater Rice community. Writing my first article discussing the pandemic’s impact on freshmen on the football team, I remember clumsily navigating the intricacies of AP Style as my article was littered with suggestions and comments from our editors. However, as I began to write weekly for the section, I overcame these initial challenges and found solace in the constant support that I received from all of the editors and fellow staff members. Seventy-nine articles later and having edited hundreds of articles, I am still by no means an expert in AP style. (Thank you Jonathan and Annika! Over the past four years, the Thresher has been more than just a student newspaper to me — it has been home to a strong community, where I have been able to forge strong relationships and connections with other writers and staff members who share the same passion for journalism and writing as I do. Whether it was discussing the amazing Trader Joe’s haul at the Monday meetings or the InDesign struggles during our Tuesday design days, every moment spent in the Thresher office has been a cherished memory that I will carry with me long after graduation. Not only has the Thresher provided me with a stronger community, but it has given me a great learning environment. As someone who has contributed to various sports publications since I was 15, the Thresher has provided me with various opportunities from discussing Rice baseball with a Hall of Fame baseball coach to interviewing potential future NFL wide receiver Luke McCaffrey. Furthermore, I am so fortunate to have gone to New York to attend the Collegiate Media Conference where I had the unique opportunity to build upon my skills as a journalist and attend and cover the Big East Conference Men’s Basketball tournament as part of the conference. As I look back on my time with the Thresher, I am filled with gratitude for the countless opportunities it has afforded me and the invaluable lessons I have learned along the way. I am grateful for the friendships forged and the bonds formed, for the mentors who have guided me and the peers who have inspired me, and for the chance to be part of a community that celebrates the power of words and the beauty of storytelling. To Riya and Prayag, this year’s editors-in-chief, thank you so much for your exceptional leadership and unwavering support throughout this journey. To Alice, our InDesign god, thank you so much for putting up with my InDesign failures and helping me make the page every Tuesday. To Kathleen, Diego and Andersen, I am very excited about the future of the sports section and have full faith that y’all will be incredible next year. To Daniel, thank you so much for supporting me throughout my first three years at the Thresher. You taught me so many skills that I used as an editor and am so grateful to have learned under your mentorship. As I bid farewell to the Thresher and embark on the next chapter of my life, I do so with a heart full of gratitude and excitement for the adventures that lie ahead. Though my time as a writer for the Thresher may have come to an end, the memories, lessons and friendships I have gained will stay with me forever. So here’s to the Thresher, the place where stories were told and memories were made. Thank you for everything. Three months after the reinstatement of Rice’s diving team, athletic director Tommy McClelland announced a second sport coming to South Main in the near future. Rice will have a women’s golf team starting in the 2026-27 academic year. The Washington Commanders selected Rice wide receiver Luke McCaffrey with the 100th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. McCaffrey was the final pick in the third round, as well as the final pick on the second day of the draft. He’ll compete for a prominent role in the wide receiver room, potentially slotting in as their starting slot receiver alongside Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson.

crimson_2024_49,"Trains on fire, subways derailing, and average speeds of three miles per hour. If someone submitted this to Saturday Night Live, they’d be told it’s unrealistic — but it’s the reality of transit in Boston. The crisis seems illogical. Boston is one of the wealthiest metro areas in the United States — it should be able to build train tracks, which were invented over two centuries ago, theright distance apart. Yet, other wealthy U.S. cities suffer from similar issues. This national crisis in mass transit is not only embarrassing, but it is also separating communities, hurting the economy, and harming the environment. Before our subway stations were flooding, the U.S. was a leader in mass transit. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, steam trains connected vast distances. Electric streetcars were also popular, facilitating intra-city trips. This progress hit the brakes when Henry Ford brought the car to the masses. With personal vehicles, mass transit fell out of favor, and new highways cut across low-income Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, literally segregating communities. Generally, only wealthy areas — like Cambridge, Mass. — had the political will to successfully protest these projects. Car-centered designs dominated the U.S., with large sprawling suburbs being built from Long Island to Orange County. People took on long commutes, spending hours in traffic. Today, following decades of neglect and a lack of funding, transit systems across the U.S. have been left in grim condition. In cities like Boston and New York, trains are often delayed, and accidents like derailments happen too frequently. Stations are dirty and in disrepair, trains are slow, and transit networks fail to cover large parts of some cities. While Back Bay is only 2.6 miles from Harvard, one 40 minute, five-mile trip on the T through downtown Boston is required to traverse the distance by train. Our transit systems also lack basic safety technology found in other developed countries. Platform screen doors would prevent people from falling into the tracks and advanced signaling systems could help increase speeds and reduce wait times for trains. The U.S. lags behind in implementing these critical technologies. The issues that plague our transit systems make them unreliable for daily use, and cause people to rely on other modes of transportation, like cars. When done well, public transit could do the opposite. Consider the journey between Boston and New York City, which currently takes four hours on a train. A high-speed rail line, using existing technology, could slash travel times by over half. This not only has the potential to take cars and trains off of the road, reducing emissions, but it would also bring our cities closer. In Spain, construction of the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line significantly reduced flights and made travel between city centers significantly more convenient. This is the key to good public transit: services that are frequent, punctual, and fast. Because of the costs associated with public transit, achieving this will require challenging a deeply rooted U.S. norm: individualism. This isn’t just about shifting from valuing profit margins to valuing innovation and connectivity; it’s about recognizing that progress in public transit will only come when we view it as a collective achievement that enhances community well-being and environmental sustainability. While it’s true that some mass transit systems like the New York City Subway often operate at a financial loss, their value extends far beyond immediate profitability. These systems enable movement and economic cohesion, and seamlessly connect us to one another. The example set by other countries like France, Japan and Spain shows what a societal appreciation for the mere presence of public transit can look like. This change in mindset is what could get our government – at a local and federal level – to begin properly funding public transit systems. This would not only provide better service on existing routes, but also allow for the construction of new routes entirely. Thankfully, many of these changes are already being implemented. The MBTA is actively eliminating slow zones as the government of Mass. recognizes the importance of public transit, and a new high-speed rail project connecting Greater Los Angeles to Las Vegas has the potential to prove that high speed rail can work in the U.S. While many people in the U.S. like to claim that we are “the best,” the U.S. still manages to fail at tasks as simple as laying train tracks the right distance apart. Bringing our nation forward has to start from within — and mass transit, if done right, has the chance to improve our lives and revolutionize how we live. Roberto C.

crimson_2024_48,"“Let’s cut to the chase: you can afford Harvard.” So claimsHarvard’s website. But that’s not the whole truth. In general, families making less than $85,000 a year pay nothing for their child to go to Harvard. And assuming modest savings of $50,000, Harvard’snet price calculatorestimates a parental contribution of $3,000 for a family making $100,000, and $15,000 for a family making $150,000 per year. So far, so good. But what about a family making $200,000? They have to pay $37,000 a year, not including a student term-time work contribution. For a family here in Massachusetts, that’s 23 percent of their post-tax income — compared with 12 percent for the family earning $150,000 and just 3 percent for the family making $100,000. But worst of all, a family earning $285,000 has to pay a shocking 37 percent of their post-tax income. While less-well-off families face many obstacles to sending their children to Harvard, tuition and fees are thankfully not among them. On the other hand, those making over $500,000 per year can also pay without too much pain, especially given the opportunity to save over time. But what about those in the middle? Some might argue that a family earning $285,000 a year can indeed afford to pay almost 40 percent of their post-tax income — after all, they would still be far from poor after paying tuition. But that isn’t the point. The impact of such a massive cost to their standard of living is life-altering. It’s not a sacrifice a family should have to make to send their child to Harvard. This week, Harvard will finish admitting the Class of 2028. While many high school seniors rejoice when they receive that coveted letter, some — even after reading that they “can afford Harvard” — will need to have a painful conversation with their parents about how they will possibly afford it. At Harvard, which boasts an applicant pool of the best and brightest, cost should never impact a prospective student’s enrollment choice. While conversations on affordability often focus on those in most need of full financial aid, it also must include middle-class families being forced to shift their lifestyles or take out massive loans to attend. For middle class students who do choose Harvard, their sacrifices ironically close doors. A mountain of debt can pull students away from careers in government, non-profits, or academia. When middle class families must give up so much to pay tuition, it becomes more difficult for students totake full advantageof the opportunities this school has to offer. Whether beingstrapped for cashwhen going out with friends or forced to give up a preferred major in the humanities for a course of study that leads to more lucrative employment, the burden of tuition and loans is a heavy one. Cruelly, many middle-class students who do come to Harvard don’t get the same freedom and breadth of experiences as their classmates, despite their family’s huge sacrifice. There are solutions — more financial aid is the obvious one — but let me offer some more novel options. We could also have a different graduated system, where families pay a fixed percentage of their income, with some cost floor and cap. The school could then redistribute who gets financial aid money. Is it really right that some families pay nothing while others pay almost 40 percent of their post-tax income? If families making less than $85,000 were asked to pay at least a small amount that could be easily borrowed and paid off following graduation, Harvard could reallocate that money to reduce others’ burden. Don’t get me wrong. Harvard and its peer institutions do far better with financial aid than most other private schools, increasing broad access to higher education. But its claim to meet“100 percent of our students’ demonstrated financial need”doesn’t tell the full story. Rohan Nambiar ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Apley Court."
rice_thresher_2024_15,"ByAmelia Davis4/16/24 10:24pm Pornhub sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to block the enforcement of a state law that requires commercial websites publishing pornography“harmful to minors”online establish age verification measures and show health warnings on their webpages in 2023. On March 7, 2024, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the portion of the law commanding the institution ofage verification systems(though abandoning the requirement for health warnings because of their status as unconstitutionally compelled speech , creating H.B. 1181. In response to that decision, Pornhub has pulled out of Texas and is currently inaccessible to users in the state. Pornhub and other adult entertainment sites are facinglegal challengesafter years of various misconduct allegations. Since 2020,over 2.3 million people have signed a petition to shut down Pornhubover sex trafficking and other criminal concerns. Sarah Sowell, who is studying political science and social policy analysis, has worked for the anti-trafficking groups Allies Against Slavery and Demand Disruption. Sowell said she believed that porn’s harmful association with trafficking and child endangerment has not been confronted enough in the legislature. “It makes me wonder how much of Pornhub s revenue is coming from children if it s so important to them that they not have ... an arduous age verification process, that they ll just pull out,” Sowell, a Jones College senior, said. Pornhub cited the“ineffective, haphazard and dangerous”Texas law for age verification as their reason for leaving Texas. After Pornhub’s retreat, Paxtoninitiated legal proceedingsagainst the owners of two other pornography websites, Chaturbate and xHamster, for alleged violations of H.B. 1181. They may now face millions of dollars in civil penalties of “up to $10,000 per day, an additional $10,000 per day if the corporation illegally retains identifying information, and $250,000 if a child is exposed to pornographic content due to not properly verifying a user’s age.” However, even this reason brings into question what legal policies can and should be implemented to hold explicit websites accountable without infringing on rights of both companies and consumers, something that Sowell touched on. “I think it s good to talk about these things and to really ask ourselves about how easily accessible video pornography has been around for at least 20 years, and I don t think there s been as much of a policy reckoning as there should be about its normativity,” Sowell said. Harm to actors in the porn industry or those outside the industry who have videos of themselves nonconsensually postedhas been a motivator of the backlash against Pornhuband similar websites in previous years, in addition to the newer concern around the issue of minors’ access to the sites. Previously, in 2021,Pornhub was forced into expanding moderatoration and adding safety measures including a third party systemto verify identity of uploaders after controversy over allegations of monetizing rape, revenge porn and content of children. The 2023-2024 co-director of the Rice Women’s Resource Center, Gillian Gravatt, said she felt that mainstream porn often does not have women’s wellbeing in mind. “Young people, regardless of gender, getting their information about sex via this type of porn is really damaging because it s not what sex is like, and it s not what sex should be like,” Gravatt, a Martel College junior, said. “I think there s a big gap in terms of this — it could be an opportunity for someone to fill in this gap and introduce sex and sexual health to minors in a more productive way in terms of sexual education curriculums that are more comprehensive and inclusive, but that’s not going to happen.” Gravatt said comprehensive sexual education will not likely occur due to the political motivations behind H.B. 1181. “There s this broader political thing that Republicans in Texas are doing with this idea of obscenity and what children are allowed to see. And it s a lot of similar reasoning that they re using to prevent children from being exposed to queer education and drag shows and things that don t fall under my definition of obscenity,” Gravatt said. “So it s difficult, because I have to look at this decision in light of that broader context, but I also don t think that minors should have access to pornography necessarily, but for different reasons than why this law was passed.” “I think it s a very fine line between censorship for safety and health and censorship that impinges on freedom of speech ,” Gravatt continued. The case cited in the Appeals Court’s decision isGinsberg v. New York, which itself upheld a New York statute forbidding the sale of obscene magazines to minors — thus providing a legal precedent to use for constitutionally denying minors access to any material that could be deemed “harmful to minors.” However, ethical and legal discussion aside, motivated people will always find a loophole: Google searches for ‘Texas VPNs’ roseby more than 1,700%in the days following Pornhub’s withdrawal.

thetech_mit_2024_34,"Dear President Kornbluth, Thank you for yourletterto the MIT-wide alumni community explaining your decision to remove the encampment on Kresge Lawn 1 . You did not name the encampment group, but it is Scientists Against Genocide Encampment @MIT (SAGE@MIT . Your letter said that you had exhausted dialogue with the encampment group, and you explained that r eaching a solution hinged on our ability to meet the students’ primary demand, which we could not do in a well-principled way that respected the academic freedom of our faculty.” Your letter never tells us (the MIT alumni community what that primary demand was, let alone why it is in conflict with academic freedom. It is important that you address these issues, otherwise your communication leaves the wider alumni community in the dark on just what the dispute was, and why academic freedom was at stake. The failure to address these issues also leaves open the possibility that you have acted improperly in resorting to force to remove the encampment. We searched to find out what the primary demand of the SAGE@MIT group was. We found statements on their web site and in the opinion article inThe Techby MIT Graduate Students for Palestine that both indicate that the primary demand is to cease all research collaboration with the Israeli military 2 . Please communicate that to the community and explain why it is in conflict with academic freedom, since this is not at all obvious to us. Academic freedom (seemingly defined here as the ability to take whatever funding one chooses does not trump all human rights concerns, and MIT has a long history of rejecting research on weapons when this has been deemed immoral. In a more recent example of research funding being curtailed for moral reasons, the MIT community and our previous President Reif, expressed their views clearly that MIT should not take funding from the convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epstein3 . MIT sSuri reporton guidelines for outside engagements identifies critical issues that would lead to rejection of a gift or engagement with MIT, which includes violation of human rights and the laws of war 4 . The examples of these violations identified in the report includes genocide, slavery and slave trading, murder, enforced disappearances, torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged arbitrary detention, deportation or forcible transfer of population, and systematic racial discrimination fall into this category. Deliberate and systematic deprivation of essential foodstuffs, essential primary health care, or basic shelter and housing may also amount to gross violations of human rights. The Israeli military has committed, and is manifestly in the process of committing, a number of the violations listed here, as documented by theUN Human Rights Council5 ,Amnesty International6 , andinternational relief agencies7 . MIT s support for the Israeli military makes it complicit in their actions in Gaza.The International Court of Justice rulingthat Israel s actions in Gaza plausibly constitute genocide may make you and your board criminally culpable 8 . (Editor’s note: rulings made by the International Court of Justice do not result in criminal convictions; the court also does not have the jurisdiction to enforce its own rulings. Whether or not you are found to be legally complicit, the moral burden falls on MIT and the MIT community. The Israeli military is conducting a systematic destruction of Gazan people and culture, has detonated their universities, blown up their schools and hospitals, destroyed their crops, cut off water supplies, dismantled the entire health support system, heavily restricted or attacked aid supplies, and killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians, many of them children. Yet in your letter to our community, you seem to be seriously out of touch with this reality. You say that o ur community includes people who lost friends and family to the brutal terror attack of October 7, and people with friends and family currently in mortal danger in Rafah 1 . On the one hand, you accurately describe the brutal terror attack by Hamas as a brutal terror attack, such that your condemnation of Hamas actions is clear. On the other hand, Gazans are just in mortal danger from some unspecified source. You do not describe the far more brutal attack on Gazans as terror ; you simply say that Gazans are in danger and make no mention of the tens of thousands already dead and the complete destruction of their homes, infrastructure, and society, and you do not implicate the Israeli military as the agent of this destruction. This characterization is deeply insulting to the victims and community. Why did you not ascribe any agency to the Israeli military here and why did you not mention in your letter to us that the encampment demonstrators’ primary concern was MIT s research collaborations with the Israeli military? Your letter to the MIT community lacks critical context that seems designed to frame your case to us as if you had no choice. Those omissions raise concerns for us of the actions you have taken, the failure to communicate openly with the alumni community about the reasons for those actions, and of the ongoing impact of your actions on the demonstrators and the MIT community. After you sent your letter to the MIT community, your administration provided anonline FAQon campus events 9 . Crucially, that FAQ was not broadcast to the wider alumni community that your letter addressed, and the vast majority of external alumni almost certainly don’t know about it. The chancellor’s FAQ purports to justify why your administration could not possibly end MIT s research support for the Israeli military without violating academic freedom. Your argument is essentially that the research is for grants with individual PIs (not the Institute more broadly 9 , that the two remaining grants are compliant with US law, that the grants are small (about $4 million by your estimates 9 , and that termination of them would breach the academic freedom of the PIs. None of these issues are identified in the Suri report as factors that would overcome the need to be compliant with the guidelines in that report. Clear guidance on the relationship between academic freedom and MIT principles was provided by former President Reif in hisletterto the MIT community regarding the $800,000 received from convicted sex offender Epstein by the MIT Media Lab and MIT Professor Seth Lloyd 10 . Reif explained: MIT offers faculty great freedom in conducting and building support for their research; that freedom is and always will be a precious value of our community. Yet it is important to understand that faculty are not “on their own”; their decisions about gifts are always subject to longstanding Institute processes and principles 10 . In other words, individual faculty (PIs do not have academic immunity to take money wherever they can get it if it violates MIT principles. Imagine if President Reif had said instead about Epstein s funding to MIT: well, it s not much money, it was legally given, and we couldn t possibly violate the freedom of those individual faculty who want to take it. Of course, he didn t say that because it would sound grotesque and it would be a betrayal of all our principles. The MIT community deserves better from you and your administration, and we call on you to reference and follow the Institute s own guidelines and principles on engagements with MIT. In the Epstein case,President Reifregrets that MIT did not have sufficient policies and procedures in place to guide senior administrators, and he wished these administrators had taken to heart the concerns others brought to them and simply put a stop to the Epstein funding 11 . President Kornbluth, MIT now has those policies in place, and the concerns of your students, faculty, staff, and alumni have been conveyed to you to stop MIT research contributing to the Israeli military s destruction of Gaza and its people.

thetech_mit_2024_22,"Since the day George Washington met with members of a Rhode Island synagogue, Jews in the United States have enjoyed relative freedom and safety. Although discrimination was common in America in the second half of the twentieth century, the US was still considered a haven for individuals escaping persecution in Europe. At a time when other institutions of higher learning in America did not welcome or even admit those from the Jewish community to their universities, MIT was an exception. Numerous notable Jewish scholars, blocked from access to most prominent American universities, found a scholarly home at MIT. For the many fleeing antisemitism abroad, late 20th century MIT seemed like a dream come true: a place where academic freedom, honest intellectual pursuit, and student equality — regardless of nationality, race, or religion — was respected and achieved. As evidenced by recent events on the MIT campus, however, it is unfortunate but clear that for the Jewish community, this atmosphere of safety, inclusion, and peaceful scientific study has ended. Jewish students currently enrolled at MIT now facebullying and hateful antisemitic rhetoric. Some, fearing for their own physical safety,feel they must hide their Judaism and themselves. It isnow common on campus to hear calls for antisemitic violenceand the spread of bigoted anti-Jewish misinformation and slander against the Jewish community–both in person and in writing–is everywhere, including the pages of this newspaper. The Techrecently published two Guest Opinion columns by members of the Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA , each arguing for reinstatement of this organization, which has been temporarily suspended by the MIT administration for repeatedly violating MIT’s code of conduct. On behalf of the MIT Jewish Alumni Alliance (JAA Executive Committee, we state here strongly that CAA should not be reinstated. Instead, it should be permanently suspended. Not only has CAA demonstrated a total disregard for the MIT code of conduct, it has also engaged in a protracted campaign of antisemitic bullying and harassment of the MIT Jewish community and created a persistently intolerable atmosphere for Jews on campus. The antisemitic behavior of the CAA predates October 7, 2023. In October 2022, CAA co-hosted Mohammed El-Kurd, who,according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL , “has accused Israelis of eating the organs of Palestinians and of having a particular lust for Palestinian blood. He has compared Israelis to Nazis, negated the historic Jewish connection to the Land of Israel, and vilified Zionism and Zionists.” El-Kurd made numerous fallacious and defamatory allegations at the October 2022 MIT event,asserting for example, that MIT students who served in the IDF had tied up and gassed Palestinian children. There, he also stated that, “I hope every one of them IDF veterans dies in the most torturous and slow ways.” By inviting El-Kurd, the CAA strove to humiliate, and to incite, encourage, and promote, a now growing culture of Jew-hatred, which today has created a threatening environment at MIT specifically directed against one specific identified group of MIT students: its Jewish students. The October 7 attack on Jewish civilians by Hamas was a modern version of the Holocaust. Like the Nazis, the Hamas terrorists deliberately targeted Jewish civilians for murder because of their Jewish identity, perpetrating upon them acts ofextreme butchery and brutality. Thousands of terrorists from Gaza and their allies in this mission massacred Israelis, gunning down party-goers at a peace music festival and burning alive whole families in their homes. Hamas engaged in violent leg and pelvic bone-breaking rape of Israeli women, and paraded naked, broken, and twisted dead bodies of their female victims throughout the streets of Gaza. They kidnapped hundreds of people, including non-Jews (Arab Israelis, Americans, Africans, and Asians . Over 100 hostages currently remain in captivity, including a entire family with a 1-year-old infant and his 4-year-old brother. This unspeakable violence perpetrated on Israeli civilians was cause for celebration for the CAA. The day following the massacre, on October 8, CAA sent an email to the entire undergraduate MIT population blaming “all unfolding violence” on the “settler colonial regime”,i.e., Israel, and inviting everyone to a“Victory is Ours” rallythe next day. Just a few days after the attacks, on October 13th, heeding calls from a former Hamas leader,CAA participated in the “Global Day of Jihad”by organizing a large protest. All this was happening as Jewish and Israeli studentswere reeling from the awful newsand were still learning about the fates of their family members and friends killed in the attacks. The activities by the CAA, focusing on harassing and dehumanizing Jews at MIT, only got worse. During the CAA-held rally of October 19, protestersdirectly calledfor the elimination of Israel, chanting “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” and “One solution: intifada revolution.” Some protesters directly and individually harassed and threatened Jewish students who were standing nearby. CAA members interrupted classes, staged walkouts, and disrupted lecturers with chants of “Free Palestine.” CAA membersstormed officesof the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI , harassed and intimidated the staff, and later protested outside the office of the MISTI faculty director, accusing him personally of genocide. This faculty member felt so personally threatened, that for weeks after this incident he did not feel safe returning to campus. The now-infamous CAA-organized blockade of Lobby 7 on November 9 involved direct violations of MIT protest policies, while another protest of November 12, 2023 involved a direct incitement of violence with language such as “i t is our duty to fight,” “history requires trouble,” “resistance is resistance…it is not enough to exist passively…not enough for us to come out and march…” and “resistance requires sacrifice.” On social media, CAAalso declared supportfor the Houthi pirates, whose slogan includes Death to America, Death to Israel, a curse upon the Jews. The above represent only a few selected examples of the CAA activities that continued through the 2023 fall semester and continue unabated in the spring semester of 2024. Lack of a meaningful response to this behavior from MIT administrators has only made members of the CAA and others on campus feel more emboldened to openly express their antisemitic views and more brazenly bully Jewish students in social settings. Many Jewish students continue to experience fear and social isolation. As an example, Talia Khan, a graduate student who testified before the Congressional Committee investigating campus antisemitism, described to them the circumstances that forced her to quit her doctoral exam study group because some study members claimed to her directly that people killed at the Nova music festival deserved to die. One Jewish student who appeared in a video of the Lobby 7 blockade faced direct online threats to his life that forced him to stay locked up in his dorm room for weeks. Jewish students have been fearful of revealing their Jewish identities or expressing their political opinions, while non-Jews have been required to disavow their Jewish friends or express their personal support for Palestine to maintain their social standing. An Israeli studentconfided to Mauricio Karchmer, an MIT professor who himself resigned from MIT due to pervasive antisemitism, that he was returning to Israel, an active war zone, because he needed to escape the toxicity of the MIT campus. The atmosphere on MIT s campus became, and continues to be, intolerable for Jews. Ifany minority groupother than the Jewish community was subjected to the bullying, harassment, threats of violence, and intimidation currently experienced by MIT’s Jewish students on campus,immediate measures would be taken to address, to correct, and to mete out appropriate discipline. MIT’s current leadership and administrators, however, continue to turn a blind eye to the mounting evidence of hatred on MIT’s campus that is perpetrated on Jews by their fellow students, by numerous faculty members, by junior and senior administrators, and by MIT’s highest leaders. The profound failure of MIT’s President and administrators to address widespread and profound antisemitism on its campus has prompted the congressional House Education and the Workforce Committee to launch a formal investigation into the deeply embedded antisemitism and Jew-hatred on the MIT campus, and has resulted in personally-affected Jewish MIT students filing a lawsuit against MIT over claims of antisemitism. It is time now for the MIT administration to take urgent and immediate steps to protect its Jewish students and to ensure their long-term safety. The temporary suspension of CAA is a small step towards accomplishing that objective. For the suspension of CAA to have any real or lasting worthwhile effects, however, it must be made permanent.

crimson_2024_118,"Harvard professor John L. Comaroff retired without emeritus status on June 30, an abrupt ending for the once-respected anthropologist whose career unraveled after four years of battling sexual harassment allegations and callsfor his termination. Comaroff, who held dual appointments in the Anthropology and African and African American Studies departments, has not been granted emeritus status — an unusual delay in conferring an honor that most tenured Faculty of Arts and Sciences professors receive as a formality upon retirement. Ruth K. O’Meara Costello ’02, a lawyer for Comaroff, wrote in an email that the “understanding is that his emeritus status has not been determined” and that the decision lies with FAS Dean Hopi E. Hoekstra. But Harvard’s delay in conferring the emeritus status may not be a delay at all.Government professor Jorge I. DomínguezandAnthropology professor Gary Urton— two other professors who faced allegations of sexual harassment — were stripped of their emeritus status by former FAS Dean Claudine Gay. Comaroff, 79, wrote in a post on his website that the allegations against him and their aftermath had “no bearing on my decision to retire.” He notified Harvard of his intent to retire on March 8 after the FAS offered its faculty members a one-time retirement program to those aged 73 or older. African and African American Studies and Anthropology professor Jean Comaroff, John Comaroff’s wife, retired alongside him and is now listed as a professor emerita in her departments. While Comaroff’s retirement means Harvard will no longer have to handle controversy among students over his continued employment, it leaves the FAS with thorny questions about his legacy at the University. An FAS spokesperson declined to comment on Comaroff’s emeritus status. The chairs of the Anthropology and AAAS departments also did not respond to requests for comment. At Harvard, emeritus status has traditionally been offered to tenured faculty over the age of 60 upon their retirement. Department chairs decide whether to recommend retiring professors to the FAS dean to receive the title. The dean, in turn, makes a recommendation to Harvard’s provost, who issues a final decision. In 2022, two additional requirements for emeritus status were added to the FAS appointment and promotion handbook: “a minimum of five years of continuous service immediately preceding retirement” and “faithful service,” defined as “service in keeping with Harvard’s fundamental institutional values.” The changes were made after Domínguez and Urton were stripped of their emeritus status and appear to give the FAS broader latitude to withhold the honor from faculty who retire amid controversy. The allegations against Comaroff first came to light in a2020 investigation by The Crimson, which found a pattern of sexual harassment allegations against three senior Anthropology professors: Comaroff, Urton, and Theodore C. Bestor. Gay first put Comaroffon paid leavein August 2020, before placing himon unpaid leavein January 2022 after University investigations found he violated the FAS’ professional conduct and sexual harassment policies. Comaroff’s return to teaching in the fall 2022 semester was marked by calls for his firing or resignation, with Harvard studentsstaging a walkout,launching an email campaign, andoccupying University Hall. Prior to his retirement, Comaroff was on medical leave and had not taught courses since fall 2023. In anOctober 2023 interview, Hoekstra said Comaroff was still barred from teaching required undergraduate courses. An FAS spokesperson declined to comment on whether Comaroff still faced sanctions at the time of his retirement. Three graduate studentssued Harvardin February 2022, alleging that the University knew of sexual misconduct allegations against Comaroff at the time of his hiring and inadequately responded to harassment complaints from his students at Harvard. In November 2022, the lawsuit moved to aconfidential mediation process. —Staff writer Neil H. Shah contributed reporting. —Staff writer Tilly R.

crimson_2024_25,"While I pretended not to see a little-cousin-shaped mound underneath a blanket on the living room floor, it struck me that he believed that if he could not see me, I could not see him. He was five years old then. Object permanence is a little tougher at that age — it’s what makes hide-and-seek all the more fun. As Harvard has dominated headlines in the past few months, I’ve found myself wondering: What’s the Harvard community’s excuse? Lately, I have seen too many of my peers acquiesce to a mindset of “if I don’t acknowledge it, it doesn’t exist,” falling into a habit of willful ignorance. I’ve heard people unabashedly profess that they have little to no knowledge of the crises, abroad and on campus, that have made headlines for months now. Students bemoan how often they have to scroll past TikToks or click through Instagram stories to avoid anything political. I see people carefully avoid glancing at our campus’ many posters containing political messages and advertisements for advocacy-related events. This particular form of ignorance — current events hide-and-seek — is insidious because it’s quiet. It requires intentional inaction. We students are products of the Information Age; we grew up on Google searches that would take less than 0.5 seconds to provide us with billions of results; we spend, on average, about 1.6 hours using social media daily. Roughly three-quarters of college students get their news from these platforms. For a generation this exposed to information, if one wants to remain huddled under the warm and comforting blanket of ignorance, one must hold it tight over their head. On this campus, especially, you have to do everything you can to avoid learning. That so many of my peers do makes a mockery of Harvard’s mission to “advance new ideas and promote enduring knowledge” — of Veritas. Now more than ever, it is vital for us to remember that we are not just students of this school but engineers of its culture and proprietors of its mission. This isn’t to say that all students are neglecting to acknowledge our difficult realities on campus, especially in the face of intense media scrutiny. How could we entirely avoid the controversies when we have to dodge reporters on the way to Joe’s Pizza or when the New York Times publishes more than 50 articles mentioning Harvard between November and January? Everybody can feel the unforgiving gazes and harsh words of elected representatives, pundits, and billionaires as they band together to excoriate our college. But we cannot let the harsh light of the national stage blind us to our responsibility to our fellow members of the Harvard community. We control how we conduct ourselves during times of crisis and injustice. We determine how these old brick walls hold up against the infernos that rage during the worst of times. Will we cower with our hands tightly pressed over our eyes? Or will we open them, stand up, and build something better? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to redefine the culture of an almost 400-year-old institution — a culture that can, in turn, influence the millions, if not billions, of people who tuned in to watch our Icarian fall from grace. Is being a Harvard student breathing out a sigh, teeming with vexation, and turning up your music when you hear the chants of protestors in the Yard? Is being a Harvard student trying to avoid all conversations that have even the slightest possibility of becoming political? Is it a culture of shutting your eyes to issues that, for a privileged few, are easy to ignore? I promise that does not have to be the case. It is not too late for this community — our waxen wings have more lift in them yet. We can still be better to ourselves and each other — better to those who look to us, deservedly or not, as an example of everything beautiful, worthwhile, and sacred in higher education. It starts by recognizing that hiding won’t save us. Peek your head out of that blanket and lower your hands away from your face. Issues do not become less pressing, injustices do not become less unjust, and atrocities do not become less atrocious once you stop paying attention to them. It ends with a Harvard whose mission does not lay tattered at our feet by hypocrisy, willful ignorance, and the tacit acceptance of the worst our world has to offer. Harvard students, we have an unshirkable duty to this community and the larger world to be people who give a damn about tomorrow and care enough to use the incredible privilege of our education to serve the world around us. Enough of the hiding. Sarah Rose F. Odutola ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Pennypacker Hall."
ubyssey_2024_33,"May 15, 2024 Written byKareem Hassib The Senate meets monthly to discuss and vote on UBC academic matters. But Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and the agenda docket can be super long and dull to read. Senate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. Here’s what to expect at the May 15 Senate meeting. Dr. Arig al Shaibah, associate vice-president, equity and inclusion, will be presenting on the progress of the Strategic Equity and Anti-Racism Framework. Here’s some things we found notable: Progress on Strategic Actions:The StEAR typo Framework outlines strategic actions, such as building more multi-faith prayer spaces and creating an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Education Hub. Out of the 93 institution-wide strategic actions,50 per cent of the actions are in progress, 2 per cent are pending confirmation, 27 per cent are completed/ongoing, 17 per cent are not yet started and 4 per cent on hold. Out of the 41 strategic actions at UBC Vancouver, 44 per cent are in progress, 5 per cent are pending confirmation, 32 per cent are completed/ongoing, 19 per cent are not yet started and 4 per cent are on hold. Executive Demographics:The report outlines the demographics of the UBC executives and UBC executive senior leadership and compares it to the demographics of senior managers nationwide. The UBC executive group had a higher representation of women and racialized people, but no representation of Indigenous, disabled, non-binary, Transgender and 2SLGBQIA+ people. The executive senior leadership group had aligned representation of Indigenous and racialized people but a lower representation of women, no representation of non-binary and transgender people and less than five 2SLGBQIA+ people. Student Survey Responses:In 2021, 31 per cent of respondents agreed that “UBC is committed to the wellbeing of its people, place, and community.” That fell to just 24 per cent in 2022, with the answer being a shockingly-low 10 per cent for Transgender and non-binary students. Twelve new endowed awards, 16 new annual awards, and onenew internal award are being voted on for approval. Some of the largest include: The provost is presenting a document called “Draft Principles and Guidelines for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI in Teaching and Learning”, a comprehensive 1-page document of proposed rules for the use of AI at UBC. Some notable guidelines include: Based on the recommendation of the Curriculum Committee and the Admissions Committee, the Student Senate Caucus will ve oting to approve the creation of a new partnership and a dual degree with the University of Helsinki, the Master s of Forestry in Green Business (UBC and Master s of Science in Agriculture and Forestry (Helsinki . Additionally, the Admissions Committee released a report of all international partnerships that they approved and renewed via their delegated authority. It is important to note, due to the current geopolitical context and theongoing protests, that this report included the renewal of partnerships with Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, (approved November 2023 , Tel Aviv University (approved November 2023 and Hebrew University of Jerusalem (approved March 2024 .

crimson_2024_72,"The nationwide movement in solidarity with Gaza continues. As Israel’s assault on Gaza worsens — it has already killed over 34,000 Palestinians — people across the country, including student groups, have taken a stand. These students have bravely supported Palestinian liberation, echoing a long history of student movements challenging universities complicit in oppression. This movement escalated last Thursday when Columbia University, breaking long-standing norms, suspended and arrested over 100 students for protesting. While the robust, diverse group of Muslim and Jewish protestors at Columbia underscored the power of nonviolent coalition-building, the university’s president deemed their protest encampments a “clear and present danger to the substantial functioning of the University.” In the following days, faculty members expressed disagreement with the university’s harsh response, rallying in support of student organizers and free speech. Similar encampments have since appeared at schools likeMIT, Emerson College, and the University of North Carolina, and administrators have sent police to break them up at Yale University and New York University. Now, on our own campus,Harvard has suspendedthe Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, the center of pro-Palestine organizing at this university. We’re witnessing more than just the clashing of differing viewpoints. These confrontations display a deeply worrying nationwide trend where administrators are increasingly comfortable cracking down on peaceful pro-Palestine protest, including by summoning police. To students, demonstrations are necessary toprevent genocide in Gaza. To administrators, student protests severely disrupt campus life. These encroachments raise profound questions about the role of university administrators: Will they safeguard free speech or stifle it under the guise of maintaining order? Historically, campuses have served as incubators for movements that have reshaped society. From the Vietnam War to South African apartheid, student organizing for justice has driven significant changes in public policy and societal norms. Rarely have universities proactively responded to student demands. Instead, often to their embarrassment, they send police in riot gear to punish students urging peace. In 1969, for example, Harvard sent in the police to aggressivelyclear studentsprotesting the Vietnam War in University Hall. In 1985, University of California, Berkeley police arrested 159 anti-apartheid demonstrators forblockading two campus buildings. Although many viewed these movements as contentious or disruptive at the time, they later gained recognition as essential for making progress. This fact is especially evident when one considers that several of these universities, like NYU, market their history of student activism to prospective students. It appears history is repeating itself, and the hypocrisy of those in power is again on display. The response to current movements has grown increasingly repressive. Universities, supposedly bastions for academic freedom, now marshal police violence,silence valedictorians, andveto student democracy. We are facing a dangerous return to an era where we treat nonviolent demonstration as criminal activity. When universities emphasize rules and order, they often also overlook the safety of those expressing dissenting views. Pro-Palestinian students — myself included — continue to face doxxing, threats, and online harassment. There is a necessary balance between ensuring physical safety on campus and respecting our rights to free speech and protest, but that balance is currently lacking. University crackdowns only serve to stoke student opposition. Given time, they can alienate a school community — faculty, students, and alumni alike, including those without a stake in the conflict. If universities wish to de-escalate tensions, the solution is straightforward: Engage with students and negotiate meaningful policy changes. It is simply inadequate to acquiesce to far-right donors and pundits at the expense of legitimate student advocacy. That is not the way to address rising antisemitism and Islamophobia. I fear that Harvard, like many other institutions of higher education, will persist with a misguided focus on “safety-ism.” Prioritizing an end to discomfort over challenging, necessary conversations, including about genocide in Gaza and the atrocities committed on Oct. 7, is a failing strategy and a moral failure. We can protect all students. We can address injustice. We can avoid an unproductive administrative response. A poor stance from Harvard at this critical juncture will not endure the test of time. We cannot lean into an academic police state where speech is monitored and muzzled. The consequences of such a shift are dire for both the university and the larger society. Veritas is something to practice, not just preach. We must call on universities to uphold the principles of free speech and democratic engagement, even — especially — when it involves challenging or radical ideas. While contentious public speech and protest help kick-start debate, classrooms and other academic settings offer a forum for students to move beyond disagreement, eliciting deliberation and understanding. Our campuses should elevate free speech as a form of active, engaged citizenship — not just reacting to change, but shaping it, aiming to create a more inclusive, dynamic society. We students will never be silent in the face of oppression. It’s time our universities recognize it. Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government concentrator in Adams House."
crimson_2024_64,"In 1987, Walid Daqqa was convicted of commanding a terrorist cell that kidnapped and murdered a 19-year-old Israeli Jew, Moshe Tammam. According to Tammam’s niece, the terrorists castrated him and gouged out his eyes before shooting him dead. When Daqqa died last week in prison, The Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee posted a tribute to him on Instagram: “Rest in power.” (Daqqa denied his involvement in the killing. The commemorations of Daqqa came just a few days after pro-Palestinian groups at Harvard marked Al-Quds Day. The African and African American Resistance Organization, whose members identify as “militant,” honored Al-Quds Day with an Instagram post declaring, “ZIONISTS ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!” The PSC held a rally outside Harvard Yard, proclaiming “Palestine Shall Prevail. Resist During Al Quds Day” in another post. Al-Quds Day, an annual event held on the last Friday of Ramadan to express opposition to Israel, was first celebrated in 1979 by Islamic revolutionaries in Iran. When Ayatollah Ruhollah M. Khomeini marked the inaugural Al-Quds Day 45 years ago, he prayed for “the victory of the Muslims over the infidels.” But Quds Day celebrations are no longer limited to Islamic fundamentalists in Iran chanting “death to Israel, death to America.” On Al-Quds Day 2024, pro-Palestinian activists commemorated the Ayatollah’s holiday at Harvard too. When Harvard students proudly praise alleged torturers, you know that there is something deeply wrong at this institution. Columbia just suspended four students for organizing an unauthorized “Resistance 101” event, but even as Harvard faces afederal investigation into antisemitismon campus, it refuses to take similar action. Harvard has, however, taken steps to protect other groups on campus. When the PSC erected its annual “wall of resistance” in the Science Center Plaza, the University provided it with a dedicated security guard. The wall accused Israel of genocide and included a quote from a founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. The response could not have been more different from Harvard’s dealings with the Jewish community: Chabad claims the University refused to provide protection for the menorah they erected last Hanukkah — an inoffensive religious symbol that somehow ranked lower in the school’s priorities than the heinous speech they ardently protected. Pockets of Harvard are rife with what can only be called an obsession with Israel. The Bell Collective for Critical Race Theory at Harvard Law School, for example, recently hosted a conference on “censorship & consciousness.” Of the seven events the conference advertised, three were about Palestine. At a “repression and resistance” panel, the featured speaker was Ryna Workman, a New York University law student caught on video defacing posters of kidnapped Israelis. Workman was nonetheless deemed deserving of an invite. None of the conference’s events appeared to center on any non-domestic topic other than Palestine, begging the question: Why, exactly, would the Bell Collective devote almost half of its conference on race to attacking the only Jewish state? The answer may lie with people like the Lowell House tutor who studies antisemitism and yet bragged about his score on a “Zionist or Nazi” quiz on X. Sickeningly, it seems that, in his eyes, the overwhelming majority of Jews who support the existence of a Jewish state appear to be comparable to the Nazis. And while many will claim anti-Zionism is not the same as antisemitism, the two certainly have much in common. Gustavo A. Espada ’96, an employee of the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, wrote on X, “How about instead of saying Zionists are abetting genocide we use their own preferred terminology and say roughly 95% of Jews are abetting genocide? Would that be better?” When Harvard’s students are calling themselves “militant,” honoring a convicted terrorist, and celebrating the same hateful holiday created by the ayatollahs in Iran, something has gone seriously awry. This is not pro-peace activism. Harvard must do better. Charles M. Covit ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Holworthy Hall."
crimson_2024_122,"When I received the email from Senior Fellow Penny S. Pritzker ’81 announcing Alan M. Garber ’76 will drop his interim title andserve as Harvard’s 31st president, I was, ironically, finishing up a letter of my own to the Harvard Corporation with my thoughts on the presidential search. While the letter will forever remain unsent, I can’t help but notice several ways in which the outcome aligns with my own recommendations. Let’s not mince words: Harvard is in choppy waters, and the Corporation bears ultimate accountability for bringing us to this point and navigating these turbulent times. The past year has been a perfect storm of controversies, leaving our beloved institution’s reputation battered and its community divided. To emerge stronger from the current parlous state, the Corporation must undertake a deep and honest assessment of the nature and causes of its past failures. In the meantime, pending such a necessary review, Harvard needs a steady hand at its helm. Enter Alan Garber. I am delighted that the Corporation has given him the opportunity to operate as president with full authority. He has the essential characteristics required of any Harvard president — academic distinction in an important discipline, a reputation for integrity, and success in his prior leadership roles, including 12 years as Harvard’s provost. In the few short months of his tenure as interim president, Garber has proven his mettle and leadership skill. He approved a much-needed set of policies on “institutional voice” — directing the University and its leadership to refrain from taking official positions on controversial public policy issues — which could easily have been consigned to years of delay and internal dispute had a leader not taken the reins and stood behind it, as Alan Garber did. Garber has also demonstrated his commitment to academic freedom and the related requirements for a vibrant academic culture characterized by open inquiry, intellectual diversity, and constructive disagreement. In his message to the community, he wrote that “excellence is made possible by the free exchange of ideas, open inquiry, creativity, empathy, and constructive dialogue among people with diverse backgrounds and views.” While these values might seem to be fundamental and unobjectionable at Harvard, they have often been absent,undermined, or weakened without clear and visible support from the Corporation and the president. The importance of these values became glaringly apparent in the wake of Oct. 7. Their absence fueled a campus crisis, in which many faculty feared expressing unpopular views, and discourse among students holding differing perspectives was severely chilled. This atmosphere of intellectual fear and timidity suppressed scholarly advancement and must be addressed head-on. That’s why I was so thrilled to see Garber vociferously endorsing these values, and I am hopeful that his statement reflects the Corporation’s similar views. As Garber said: For Harvard to lead — in both research and pedagogy — we must address these current problematic cultural realities and stand up with vigor and passion for open inquiry and constructive dialogue among people with diverse opinions. Achieving these goals will require a president with a deep understanding of the issues, dedication to effectively countering expected opposition from various quarters, and willingness to exert leadership. Garber’s skills will soon be tested. New campus protests over the war in Israel and Gaza, demands for politically motivated divestments, congressional investigations into campus antisemitism, and the concerns of many alumni and donors that Harvard has lost its way will invariably continue plaguing his tenure. But by seizing the moment to set Harvard on a path to regain its reputation as preeminent among the world’s universities, these same tests create a unique opportunity for Garber to emerge as a great leader. The clock is ticking, President Garber. You have three years to leave an indelible mark on one of the world’s great institutions. Make them count. Jeffrey S. Flier is the Higginson Professor of Physiology and Medicine and was the dean of Harvard Medical School from 2007 to 2016."

Asfederal interest rates and inflation have risen, so has theaverage rent price in Vancouver. Many landlords feel the pressure of increases in their mortgage payments, as well as increases in maintenance, utilities, and insurance costs. These increases in costs might partially account for the fact that asking rents for vacant units were an average of 43 per cent higher than those of already occupied units based upon the 2023 Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s (CMHC annual rental market report. Inflation and interest rates can’t be the whole story here. According to the Bank of Canada, the average inflation from 2020-2023 was 4.87 per cent per year, so what rent control policy–or lack thereof–might affect the average price of rent in Vancouver? What policies can renters advocate for to protect access to housing for people who might not be wealthy enough to rent a one-bedroom apartment for $2500 or more per month? Let’s look at the last few years before looking forward: In 2023, BC landlords were allowed to increase rental prices for pre-existing tenants by 2.0 percent, which is a reasonable increase for tenants and falls below the rate of inflation. All good, right? Wrong. Despite theResidential Tenancy Actgoverning rent increases in already occupied units, landlords can increase rent however much they want to whichever price they might desire once a unit is vacant. With regulations protecting tenants in occupied units and the absence of legislated rent control for vacant units, it is no surprise that BC continues to be theeviction capital of Canada— with Statistics Canada reporting BC’s average rate of eviction as being almost double the national eviction average from 2016 to 2021. Furthermore, between 2016 and 2021, 9 per cent of renters in BC were evicted with no-fault — either for renovation, sale, demolition, or the moving of a family member into the unit — compared to the national average of 4 percent. CMHC data also showsthat eviction disproportionately affects marginalized groups, with 13 percent of Indigenous respondents and 12 percent of Black respondents reporting that they had experienced eviction, compared to 7 percent of respondents who are not a visible minority. BC has avacancy tax, which should help to increase the supply of rentals within the market, but in Vancouver, it’s just not enough. Rentals that do exist just don’t remain vacant for long enough for this to de-incentivize aggressive increases in rent prices. People are renting these units despite significant average asking rent increases price increases in vacant units due to a general shortage of housing in Vancouver that a history of restrictive zoning has perpetuated. Regardless of policy already in place, the supply of rentals is just not enough to significantly drive market prices down. In BC, we tax owners of vacant homes to incentivize rental, we protect tenants against unreasonable rent increases, but we do not regulate the rental price of units once a tenant has been evicted or has ended their tenancy. The bottom line is, without vacancy control from tenant to tenant, landlords can set rental prices at whatever they want. This gap incentivizes eviction by giving landlords the opportunity to raise rents to whichever number our supply-hungry market might allow for. If you think your average tenant, or average UBC student, can afford to pay 43 per cent more rent in one of the world’s most expensive cities, you’re either more optimistic—or more delusional—than the average bear. As rental prices continue to soar into the stratosphere, like that helium balloon we all fumbled as children, I remember the advice of my father: “Tie it to your wrist.” Such advice applies to vacancy control policies. By tying rental rates to units, not allowing them to vary significantly between renters, and capping rent increases on these units, we protect the average price of rent in our communities and foster a more diverse community. This is a model that is already in place in provinces such asPrince Edward Island, and one that our province could easily build off of. Given this, it is one that our province maybe should not entirely mimic, as tensions have nevertheless continuedbetween PEI tenants and landlords. As incentives rise for BC landlords to issue no-fault evictions to tenants, such as challenging economic circumstances, lack of protection provided to renters, extreme demand for rental units, and lack of vacancy control and average rent in Vancouver, like a helium balloon, will continue to soar. The only difference is, that without some form of vacancy control, it will be a long time before this balloon returns to earth. Changes in zoning and increases in the supply of rental units are slow; eviction of tenants and the rent-gouging is fast. This is an opinion article.

crimson_2024_33,"“You’re the whitest Black person I’ve ever met.” These words ring in my ears even to this day, but I’ve never quite understood them. Their racism is pernicious because it’s indirect, implicitly reinforcing stereotypes about what a Black person should be: classless, uneducated, and complicit. Throughout high school, this sentence, and others like it, forced me to question my identity. I thought I had to fit into certain, unspoken criteria in order to be accepted by others. Everywhere I turned, it seemed, there was this pressure. I hoped that Harvard — diverse, brainy, liberal — would offer an escape. I wanted to be unabashedly proud of who I was and not let others’ opinions hold me back. I was wrong. At Harvard, especially after the fall of race-based affirmative action, I face the same impossible dilemma, but with a twist: This time, I am not white enough. My opinions are met with intense scrutiny, and I have to constantly fight to be respected. I am stuck in the same place as I was in high school. So this Black History Month, in hopes of breaking free from this pressure, I’ve given myself a new challenge. This Black History Month, I am challenging myself to own all aspects of my identity. I had the idea at the start of the month, as I was studying great Black figures in American history. One man captured my eye in particular: Max C. Robinson. Robinson was an American broadcaster in the mid-20th century, a time when the world of mass media was overwhelmingly white. In 1959, Robinson landed a job as a newscaster, but was hidden from the public eye while on air, forced to sit behind a projection of the news station’s logo. One day, Robinson broadcasted without the projection. The next day, he was fired. This setback, while indefensible, was only temporary. Ten years later, he would become the first Black anchor on a local television news program. He would go on to co-anchor for ABC. Robinson fought to be seen, to be heard, and to be valued, and he won. His life and legacy have taught me many things, most of all the value of not hiding my identity or purpose from others. This fight begins with self-acceptance; only from there can we pursue progress for ourselves and for society. As for me, this Black History Month means owning all aspects of my identity. I’ve taken concrete steps this month to foster this sense of self-confidence in my identity, from joining the Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal to chairing a committee for the Harvard Model United Nations conference. As I’ve taken these steps, though, I’ve also realized that the journey of taking pride in my identity will never be complete without some intense soul searching, too. And I must admit, this journey has been painstakingly slow, and I am still sorting through some parts of my identity. What does it mean to be a person of color in a predominately white institution? How does my Christian background come into play? How do I reconcile my upbringing as a South Floridian with my political views? These questions have not been easy to answer, but, slowly, I am figuring myself out in the process of answering them. After years of feeling lost in high school, I felt outsized pressure to fast-track this process of finding myself. I had forgotten that college is precisely the place to deconstruct the identities that have been placed upon ourselves by others and reconstruct new ones, allowing ourselves time to make mistakes along the way. Getting more in touch with our identities does not mean changing who we are. And not all of the changes we do make will be apparent to others. Getting in touch with my creative side has led me to journal more often. This process of self-reflection and processing my emotions is not something others see, but I know how impactful it’s been. We have our whole lives to figure out who we are; we don’t need to rush. In fact, the internal search takes time and this time is an integral part of figuring out who we are. I still don’t understand those racist words I was told in high school. But that doesn’t matter now. I no longer strive to conform with others’ stereotypes or impressions of what a Black person should be. I call on each of us to follow in Max Robinson’s footsteps and view this Black History Month as a launchpad to begin — or to continue — taking ownership of our identities. Even if some parts of them are still undiscovered. Dalevyon L.J. Knight ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Canaday Hall."
stanforddaily_2024_16,"Jonathan Levin, current Stanford Graduate School of Business dean, will serve as the University’s next president from Aug. 1, 2024. His appointment,announcedin early April, will follow interim President Richard Saller’s short but tumultuous term and former President Marc Tessier-Lavigne’s leadership which came to anabrupt close. As an Editorial Board, we’re excited to see how Levin’s relatively unique background will shape his tenure as Stanford president. As the first president toearnhis undergraduate degree from Stanford since 1948, Levin is our first “home-grown” president in decades. At 51, Levin is also be the fifth youngest Stanford president and a world-renowned researcher in microeconomics and industrial organization. With degrees in English, math and economics, Levin brings an expansive intellectual background that crosses many different disciplines. The Presidential Search Committee and other stakeholders previously emphasized Levin’s early commitment toacademic freedomon campus, aligned with principlesadvocatedforpreviouslyby The Daily’s Editorial Board. “As I look to Stanford’s future, I’m excited to strengthen our commitment to academic excellence and freedom; to foster the principles of openness, curiosity, and mutual respect,” LevintoldStanford News. There are, however, many pressing issues facing Stanford in the years ahead that deserve our consideration as we transition to a new era of leadership. Affordability As The New York Timesreporteda few weeks ago, some American private undergraduate institutions will soon cost $100,000 per year. While Stanford offers excellent financial aid provisions for students who are U.S. citizens, our University is an outlier among peer institutions for its refusal to introduce need-blind admissions for international students. Harvard, MIT, Yale and Princeton provide need-blind admissions for all applicants, regardless of nationality. With anendowmentthe same size as Sudan’s GDP, continued year-on-year hikes ontuitionandroom and boardthat far exceed the annual rate of inflation, and anexplosionin the number of administrators, Stanford needs to justify the massive financial barrier it imposes on international students. Additionally, Stanford-owned stores selling necessities charge prices ill-suited for students. Munger Market and Tresidder Marketplace, the only on-campus grocery stores, are prohibitivelyexpensive. Prices at these stores are marked up significantly compared to off-campus stores. This is especially challenging for graduate students and students with dietary restrictions, many of whom cook instead of buying meal plans. On-campus housing is also extremely costly for undergraduate and graduate students alike. At the same time, Stanford is cutting the quality of housing by cramming more students into less space. Residential and Dining Enterprises recent announcement aboutconvertingdoubles and triples in Toyon and Roble into triples and quads in the upcoming year captures the problem. Many undergraduates want the freedom to live with fewer roommates, and it is critical that Stanford maintains that option because it exerts power over the97% of undergraduates who liveon-campus. Stanford needs to figure out how to get its financial house in order, and Levin can help us get there. Top-level administrative stances aimed toward addressing exorbitant tuition prices, unreasonable living costs and the housing availability crisis is a place to start. The Editorial Board recommends Levin considers withdrawing more funding from the endowment to freeze annual tuition hikes for at least 1-3 years or bring it back to 3.5%, the rate from 2013 to 2018. Rather than placing the burden on individual students and families to finance Stanford’s expenditures, the administration should reassess how to best use its endowment. Culture Stanford has lost its juice. As students have widelylamented, Stanford’s culture is not the same as it was pre-pandemic. While Stanford’s undergraduate culture used to be synonymous with creativity, risk and irreverence, Friday nights are now nearly silent.Late Nightat Arrillaga and Stern are gone, leaving students at dorm room desks instead of a dining room table filled with friends. Recent student-led initiatives such as “In the Cards” newsletter,FLiCKsand the wildly successfulOn Call Cafeare huge steps in the right direction — these initiatives ought to continue receiving funding and admin support, and Levin can be the passionate advocate we need. As someone who was once in our shoes, Levin ought to revive the parts of Stanford that make it feel like home. Levin can solicit more student input before Stanford offices spend huge amounts of money to overhaul campus life. The neighborhood system was afailedattempt to replicate the residential colleges at Yale and Oxford – a motivation heavily alluded to in the2019 ResX report. The Stanford administration should have understood that the layout of campus is incompatible with a neighborhood system. Carving up the Row Houses into different neighborhoods, for example, artificially limited the availability of Row housing for students, which was already in high demand. Students need a leader who can help Stanford find its identity again as it stands on its own. While we recognize that much of this revival of Stanford’s culture falls on our shoulders as students, we hope that Levin’s energy and Stanford roots can help him find ours. Institutional neutrality In times of turbulent global and domestic affairs, elite universities like Stanford have been put under tremendous pressure by its students, the public and even the U.S.governmentto make public statements expressing stances on current events. Stanford’s president will need to navigate a campus climate in which the opinions of Stanford students and faculty alike are scrutinized by the public. So far, bodies like theFaculty SenateandUndergraduate Senatehave faced the brunt of this work rather than the president. Although the office of the president has released statements on issues directlyconcerning universities, it has generally refrained from voicing opinions on global issues. For example, former President Marc Tessier-Lavignegave remarksabout the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the Faculty Senate but did not issue a university-wide statement. Going forward, we encourage Levin to carry forth the spirit of institutional neutrality and academic freedom that Saller and Provost Jenny Martinez articulated in a judiciousstatementfrom October 2023. Stanford as a pioneer for public good While Harvard and Yale struggle to fill vacant presidencies, Stanford is ready to begin a new, hopeful era under Levin’s leadership. Saller and Tessier-Lavigne were forced to be on the defensive during their tenures: Saller had to navigate student protests and free speech regulations, while Tessier-Lavigne had to defend his academic reputation. Now, we have the opportunity to be led by a president who starts with a blank slate and can drive change at Stanford. American society now regards universities with a more cautious eye. There is arising trendamong some Americans to claim that “colleges have a negative effect on the U.S.,” according to Pew Research Center. Though the Editorial Board staunchly disagrees with that claim,we recognizethat scandals involving top Stanford leaders andfamous Stanford alumnihave brought into question Stanford’s ability to cultivate ethical leaders who advance the public good. In recent years, skeptics havearguedthat many elite institutions in our country are turning into hedge funds with research labs attached. Universities are getting stretched thin to appease as many stakeholders as possible, perhaps out of necessity given theiroperating costswhich increasenearly every year. The Editorial Board worries that this may lead to a neglect of student interests, and we ask that Dr. Levin prioritize mission-driven student education. We want a president who can restore the public’s faith that Stanford is and will continue to enhance and contribute to the generation of knowledge and the development of leaders who improve society. We hope Levin can usher Stanford into a period of leadership that revivesStanford’s promiseto promote “the welfare of people everywhere.” The Stanford Daily Editorial Board comprises Opinions Editors, Columnists, and at least one member of the Stanford Community.

thetech_mit_2024_18,"It’s going to get hotter for the rest of your life. Probably a lot hotter. What can be done about this? Specifically, is there anything that MIT scientists and engineers could do? In October 2022,The Techpublished a letterfrom us which posited that global temperatures and their accompanying effects such as drought and flooding will continue to risefor the rest of this centurygiven our current approaches. To illustrate this, we cited MIT’s ownEn-ROADS modelusing the example ofmaximal world-wideincentivization of renewable energy and vehicle electrification. It eliciteda responsein the following issue by an MIT Sloan School professor asserting that we were “ignoring the many other actions we can take now with existing technologies,” and that the correct approach was “silver buckshot” -- in other words, everything, everywhere, all at once. Well, we tried that. Ignoring political reality, we used En-ROADS to exploremaximal world-widedisincentivization of coal, oil, and natural gas usage, as well as deforestation, along with maximal incentivization of renewable energy, vehicle electrification and efficiency, nuclear energy, bioenergy, new zero-carbon energy, and building electrification and efficiency. We even threw in a 50% reduction in methane – which is especially unrealistic, because most methane emissions come from wetlands and agriculture, from which methane cannot easily be reduced – and the temperature in the year 2100 would go from today’s almost 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial times to 2.0 degrees C. This is because adding CO2 is like piling on blankets; reducing the rate at which more blankets are added does not make you cooler. But the reality is much worse than our highly idealized scenario, because China, Russia, India, and the rest of the world outside the US and the EU will not implement these changes any time soon, and warming will be much greater than the model’s predicted 0.5 degrees C. If you think that things are bad now, imagine what it will be like in 50 years. There is, however, something that can be done that would have a near-term effect --global shading. The earth’s temperature is quite sensitive to the amount of received sunlight, and reducing that by a few tenths of a percent can make a significant difference. We know this from the observed effect of major volcanic eruptions that spewed significant amounts of ash into the upper atmosphere. For example, worldwide temperatures were reduced by about half a degree for two years after the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. And it snowed in Virginia on the 4th of July in 1816 after the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora. Unfortunately, ejecting ash and chemicals into the atmosphere has adverse health and environmental effects, so this approach is a non-starter. But other means of shading could work. For example, scientists at MIT and elsewhere have looked at giant barriers in space between the earth and the sun. But apart from the cost and complexity, these suffer from an irredeemable obstacle: They would probably require the permission of every nation on earth. Global warming reduction talks have been going on for over 30 years and we have yet to establish hard limits for most of the countries on earth. How long would it take to agree on a totally new concept? Fortunately, there is a way to approximate that with a system that is environmentally friendly and scalable, and that can be implemented globally or regionally. Deploying a very large but achievable fleet (a few million of very large (approximately 100 meters in diameter balloons over the US Southwest would reduce temperatures there by a degree or two and as the cooler air mass travels eastward, providing some benefit for much of the rest of the country. To make it cooler, you’d add more balloons. If implemented solely within US airspace, this would not require permission from any other nation. And after seeing how this works, other countries might well decide to do the same, until eventually an international compact could be obtained. The balloons would fly in the stratosphere, well above any aviation, and they would be roughly geo-stationary. This capability was demonstrated inGoogle’s Project Loon. This is not to say that existing CO2 reduction proposals should not be implemented. They should. But they will benefit your grandchildren, not you. Actual reductions in temperature in the immediate term will provide these other approaches much-needed time to become effective. What is needed is an optimized scientific and engineering approach to this undertaking. Project Loon demonstrated balloon lifetimes of almost a year. Can this be extended to multiple years? NASA’sASTHROS balloonis over 130 meters in diameter -- but it is expensive. Can this be made cheaply and mass produced? Optimized balloon fleet management can undoubtedly result in greater effectiveness, but how and how much? These are the kinds of questions that MIT could help to resolve. President Kornbluth has announced the MIT climate initiative which includes a category called “wild card” ideas. What fits that definition better than this? And what could members of the MIT community do that could have a greater potential impact than blazing a new trail to provide a near-term solution to the climate problem? — Tom Hafer ’70, Henry Miller ’69"
crimson_2024_102,"“I want our President to know that we are not safe… As a doctor, I cannot abandon the remaining members of my team, and as a former soldier, I cannot abandon my fellow Americans.” Those are the words of American surgeon Dr. Adam Hamawy, who was evacuated from Gaza only days ago. Hamawy is a former U.S. Army combat surgeon whom U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL credits with saving her life in Iraq in 2004. Hehad initially refused evacuation from southern Gaza, citing his “oath to never leave anyone behind.” The conditions in the European hospital in Gazaare beyond dire, with limited medical supplies, flies infesting the operating room and intensive care unit, and maggots infesting wounds. Hamawy was also worried that the hospital “will suffer a similar fate of al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals.” In March, the Israeli military raided al-Shifa hospital, massacring medical staff and patients. A few weeks later the bodies of over 300 Palestinians were reportedly found in mass graves near the Nasser hospital in southern Gaza, with some victims stripped naked with their hands tied, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza. Among the bodies were elderly people, children, and patientsstill wearing surgical gowns. Hamawy’s story harkens back to another American who once put her life between Israeli violence and Palestinians’ homes. Rachel Corrie was a college student from Olympia, Wash., who traveled to volunteer with the International Solidarity Movement, an organization which uses non-violent civil disobedience to challenge Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian land. Over 170,000 Palestinian homes have been demolished in Israel and the occupied Palestinian Territories since 1947, often backed by unjust Israeli laws. My grandfather’s home in West Jerusalem was “legally” confiscated, when he evacuated his family, including my father, during the Nakba, in which over 750,000 Palestinians were violently displaced from their homes and villages in 1948. Through policies like the Israeli Knesset’s Absentee Property Law, 700,000 settlers (over seven percent of the entire Israeli population have come to live in illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. In 2003,Corrie stood betweena U.S.-made Caterpillar bulldozer operated by the Israeli military, and the home of a Palestinian pharmacist, which was targeted for demolition. Typically the bulldozers would stop for international activists. But that afternoon, the bulldozer rolled straight ahead, killing Corrie, as she wore a fluorescent orange visibility vest. Unlike Hamawy or Corrie, I never intentionally put myself in the pathway of Israeli bombs or bulldozers. However, I found myself in that situation when I went to volunteer in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, as a medical student in 2006. War erupted after Hezbollah fighters captured two Israeli soldiers during fighting close to the Lebanese-Israel border. As Israel bombed Lebanon, threatening to “turn Lebanon’s clock back 20 years,” I fled the country in a taxi. The entire time the driver was on the phone, making calls to determine which road was safe. I later learned the border crossing was bombed both thirty minutes before and one hour after we crossed. Now a practicing physician and educator on the Harvard Medical School faculty, I often reflect with my colleagues that our efforts are best spent here in the U.S., which has provided over $300 billion dollars of military aid to Israel since its founding and diplomatic cover for its atrocities for decades. The world’s eyes now turn to Harvard, where students join thousands across the country, in the spirit of Hamawy and Corrie, risking their careers, their education, their safety, their immigration status, and futures to demand an end to our collective complicity in the Palestinian genocide. Though our campuses are much quieter than the campuses in Gaza and the threats manyfold less, students at Harvard and around the country attempt to block violent policies and investments with their bodies, and some have faced tangible police violence as a result. They demonstrate a sophisticated understanding of Israeli settler colonialism and apartheid that has been increasingly incorporated into the public consciousness. In response, Harvard has chosen instead to break with over50 years of precedentof protecting student assembly and speech, levying arbitrary and disproportionate sanctions against student protestors defending Palestinian lives. However, in large part due to the efforts of these students, there is a growing consensus in favor of divesting from Israel at Harvard. Aplurality of facultysupport divestment from Israeli companies that operate in the West Bank, and theHarvard Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine sstatement supporting divestmentfrom Israel has gathered over 250 signatures. TheHarvard Graduate Students Unionand the student governments ofHarvard Law School, theHarvard Graduate School of Design, and theHarvard Divinity Schoolhave all passed resolutions in favor of divestment. Divestment is aligned with both Harvard’s values and its investment history. Student protest has a proud history of holding the University accountable to its values, and was instrumental in moving the University to divest from apartheid South Africa, tobacco, andfossil fuels, and to pay campus workers moredignified wages. Additionally, Harvard Management Company was the first U.S. endowment fund to sign the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment in 2014. HMC also released an anti-genocide policy in 2019. As an alum or a community member you can join this growing movement for divestment. You cansign the Harvard alumni divestment pledgeor realign your portfolio with your values, using the American Friends Service Committeedivestment list. As U.S. officials continue to supportongoing weapons transfersto Israel, despite the objections of amajority of Americans, we must hold our institutions directly accountable to our values. As our tax and endowment dollars fund mass atrocities, we must use every means at our disposal to say never again. Lara Z.

crimson_2024_44,"My Housing Day dorm storm — a time when enthusiastic upperclassmen charge through the rooms of eager freshmen to reveal their Harvard home for the next three years — was like any other. Shortly after 8:00 am, hearing screaming upperclassmen in the yard, my friends and I filmed our predictions: “Leverett!” “Dunster!” “Eliot!” (my personal guess was Winthrop . Finally, one of my friends forcefully said “Cabot!” The rest of us turned in shock. The Quad!? None of us had even considered that possibility. Nevertheless, we refocused. Soon after, the real moment was upon us. Filmed by a phone taped to the wall, my blocking group anxiously waited as we heard upperclassmen stomp up the stairs and bang on our door. We opened it up, and all I saw was the word “Cabot” written on red and yellow signs. The moment had come, and this time it was for real. We were quadded — relegated to housing an extra ten minute walk to Harvard Yard than the houses near the Charles River. Thus commenced the five stages of Quad grief. Denial Did this actually happen? How is it possible that I’m part of the roughly 25 percent of unlucky students who get quadded? I was aware that peers frequently trick freshmen into believing they were quadded with false chants before revealing their actual house. This only fueled my delusion. When is the big reveal coming? I wondered. It didn’t come when they opened the door, so it must come when they enter the room. It didn’t come when they entered the room, so it must come when we all go downstairs. It must come when we all go outside. And so on. That moment never came. Anger As my blocking group stood outside, holding a Cabot sign for a quick picture, I entered the anger stage. We had a clear view of the other freshmen, recently placed into more enviable houses, celebrating with their friends. My friends and I, of course, had each other, but with barely any other freshman assigned to Cabot around us, it was an isolating and frustrating experience. In that moment, the two hours of sleep, the desperation for food, and the exhaustion of River Run suddenly hit me. And to top it all off — it was raining! A Quick Return of Denial My friends and I ventured to Annenberg for the “celebratory” lunch where everyone eats with their house. Even as we sat and ate, I thought to myself: I didn’t actually see the official housing letter with my own eyes. Maybe there was some sort of administrative snafu and the official letter will reveal deliverance into a different house. When my friend informed me that she had seen and read it, I considered the possibility that it had been misdelivered. Or misprinted. Anything. There had to be some sort of mistake. Bargaining In Smith Campus Center, my friends and I, in between bursts of productivity, discussed potential ways to alleviate the pain and disappointment, like getting a scooter or bike. We discussed the shuttle system, and someone even brought up ways to transfer houses. Depression I mostly skipped this phase. The worst of it was over. I’m at Harvard, after all, where I’m guaranteed to live with my best friends for the next three years. Acceptance When I ventured to Cabot for the traditional dinner as rising members of the house, I (with my blockmates breathed a sigh of relief. The Quad was beautiful. It was like I had suddenly unlocked a new, secluded location on the campus map. We were excited to see our other friends there and meet the house staff. We got to see an example of a large Cabot suite and socialize with upperclassmen. It was no longer raining — and the walk wasn’t that bad! As I reflected upon my Housing Day experience over Spring Break, I realized that my disappointment wasn’t actually disappointment — it was shock. I had not considered Cabot as an option since I had never been there nor seen it in person. It was a novel idea. I would actually add a sixth stage to my Housing Day journey: excitement. My friends and I started planning how we would decorate our rooms — which, luckily for quadlings, will be massive — and I connected with other friends who were quadded. There I was, sitting in Cabot House, and the world hadn’t ended after all. My sadness was based almost entirely upon the fact that Cabot is considered a “bad” house, mainly by freshmen who had never stepped foot in the Quad. While I grieved losing the idea of living near the river, I hadn’t yet realized that there was so much to gain. In fact, many studentsend up loving the Quad. Still, even as students in river houses face disruptive renovations and the greater possibility of living in a double sophomore year, quadded students are pitied, perhaps a result of a need for hierarchies — clear winners and losers in student perception. But in no real-world situation would an extra five minutes in a commute render a living space’s merits wholly irrelevant when there are admittedly very few downsides. The Housing Day discourse surrounding the Quad needlessly inhibits many students’ ability to celebrate their introduction into their new communities. It’s silly to pity one another for random assignments to living spaces (that are objectively an upgrade from freshman housing . I admit I contributed to this discourse on Housing Day, but I have since come to regret it. There was never any reason to grieve. After all, what’s more exclusive than something only about a quarter of Harvard students get to do? I’ve decided that makes me a winner. Catherine E.F.

stanforddaily_2024_36,"Stanford is a company town. More than 5,000 graduate workers work at Stanford, and a sizable majority of us live on campus simply because we cannot afford to live anywhere else on the stipends that the University pays us. Most of Stanford’s 8,000 undergraduates also live on campus. It should come as no surprise, then, that the University’s regulations have a significant impact on our everyday lives. The campus is our workspace and living space, the locus of our communities. It raises alarm when the University threatens to constrain our civil liberties within our primary community spaces, including, but not limited to, our ability to engage in free speech and protest. The reshaping of policy on how gathering spaces on campus can be used seems to have begun on Feb. 8, when the University provided less than 24 hours notice that they would begin enforcing a rule prohibiting protestin White Plaza after 8 p.m. Following the establishment of “The People’s University for Palestine” in late April, University leadership issued six“White Plaza updates,” which detail policies surrounding protests, threatening arrests and “sanctions up to and including suspensions,” that could, in their words, cause delays in graduation. The latest notice following theattempted occupationof a university building describes the harshest sanctions yet: “immediate suspension and the inability to participate in Commencement based on the president’s authority.” Whereas previous notices warned that those who do not hold Stanford affiliation found in violation of University policy would “be subject to criminal and/or civil liability,” the latest promises “criminal charges” for Stanford students in addition to referrals to the Office of Community Standards (OCS . Social media postsanda petitionlaunched by the People’s University at Stanford describe the University making good on its litigious threats last week when Stanford Police detained a Pro-Palestine student for several hours at Santa Clara County Jail. The student was allegedly disparaged, denied access to hygiene facilities and released late at night with nowhere to go. She was disallowed to leave the county under the terms of her release and also banned from campus under the threat of immediate arrest. Notices and citations have primarily addressed protesting undergraduates, but they have sent a chill through the broader Stanford community. Notices, in their tone and timing, intimidate students for exercising their right to free speech and create an atmosphere of fear around peaceful demonstration. Unsurprisingly, the recent application of OCS policy to control student speech, protest and movement on campus hasshaken trustin the office. Escalations in the application of discipline are an abuse of power. The intimidation is all the more stark when the University deploys armed police officers to enforce discipline, and when the University administratorsrefuse elaborationbeyond “White Plaza updates” to undergraduate representatives asking for further details on discipline and the process for discipline. As outlined in our op-ed onreal recourse, the University continues to protect bad actors and suppress student voices calling for accountability. It is thus not surprising that the University is more willing to punish protestors rather than engage with them in negotiation, as has been done at peer institutions likeBrownandU.C. Berkeley. The key issue at play is University policy being unilaterally changed and unfairly applied. For graduate workers, changes in University policy are a constant concern; Stanford can change and implement new policies that can reshape our lives and livelihoods overnight, which is precisely why we need a union contract. In bargaining for a first contract, the Stanford Graduate Workers Union (SGWU has consistently argued for progressive discipline and the assurance that academic discipline will not be applied for workplace issues. Progressive discipline means that workers cannot be disciplined without just cause, and the severity of discipline must match the severity of the offense. Therefore, graduate workers cannot be fired for minor mistakes, which is a tactic that could otherwise be used to retaliate against graduate workers engaged in protests, union organizing or other protected activities. SGWU and the University recently reached a tentative agreement on these issues (which we refer to together asDiscipline and Discharge . The right to protest and just cause for discipline are fundamental principles that unions seek to protect. Recent arrests and suspensions of graduate workers at institutions across the United States highlight the importance of this right. In response, unions across the country have spoken out on the need to protect the rights to free speech and protest on university campuses. SGWU’s national union affiliate, United Electrical Workers (UE ,announced their solidarity with campus protestorsand demanded that the right to protest and free speech be respected. The SGWU Bargaining Committee recently joinedUniversity Unions United for Free Speech and Protestin a call for universities to “guarantee the right to freedom of speech, assembly and protest on campuses.” Beyond Stanford, members of UAW 4811, representing 48,000 academic workers across the UC campuses, recently authorized their executive board tolaunch a strikeif circumstances justify “in response to UC’s unprecedented acts of intimidation and retaliation directed at our rights as academic employees to free speech, protest, protest and collective action.” For graduate workers, the ability to speak, to assemble and to protest freely within our own community are at the core of labor organization. As of now, thousands of academic workers at UC Santa Cruz, UCLA and UC Davis are actively on strike. SWGU is fighting for a contract that protects all grad workers. The University has shown that they are willing to change rules without due notice. It has regularly failed to consider the way its policies negatively impact the lives, the work and the well-being of community members. It behooves the University to carefully consider its application of policy, especially when the tacit threat of police involvement depends on administrative decisions. As Professors David Palumbo-Liu and Mikael Wolf haveobserved, these “bureaucratic responses do not sufficiently recognize the reasons the students are protesting in the first place.” Indeed, Stanford could stand to learn much from the People’s University, where a community has gathered to share in discussion, to learn and to teach and to show the world the true power of organizing and protest. As graduate workers, we stand in solidarity with our fellow students and colleagues. They must be allowed to engage in this protest and peaceful demonstration without any threat of academic, professional or financial harm. The University will undoubtedly be a better place if their tireless efforts are met with good faith engagement.

rice_thresher_2024_19,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/20/24 9:38pm On your 2024 Student Association ballot, you’ll see something in addition to the standard races for executive positions: a constitutional amendment. We urge you to vote “no.” Thenew constitutionwas originally approved by the Senate in April 2023 on a 21-1 tally. However, only about10 percent of undergraduatesvoted in the corresponding special election, less than the20% necessary for ratification. Former SA president Solomon Ni reintroduced the proposed constitution earlier this year, and now students have another chance to vote. Though there are beneficial changes, some amendments are so worrying that we must oppose the new constitution. Our primary concern is the removal of a series of longstanding safeguards against low turnout, thin majorities and secrecy. Article IXof the new constitution stipulates that a simple majority may pass a constitutional amendment with no required minimum voter participation. Thecurrent constitutionneeds two-thirds approval with at least 20% turnout, which protects the student body from constitutional changes that do not garner broad awareness, participation and satisfaction. Some may argue that low turnout plagues Student Association elections, that the 20% participation requirement essentially blocks any constitutional amendments. However, it is the SA’s job to make students care — and they used to be rather successful, withmore than halfthe student body voting in the 2018 SA election. We fear that one day, the SA will quietly push a constitutional amendment special election when students are not paying attention, making drastic and dangerous changes to the elected student body that manages $400,000 of our money. Does it sound like we’re catastrophizing? Maybe, but that’s exactly why these protections exist. Another proposed change is the threshold for resolutions to pass the Senate. Currently, two-thirds of voting senators and college presidents must approve. The new constitution decreases the cutoff to half.Lots ofSenate votes are unanimous or near-unanimous, so the two-thirds requirement is not difficult to meet. In a Student Association where many undergraduates are unaware of week-to-week resolutions, we believe that a slightly higher threshold would protect less informed students. Finally,Article III, Section 3 of the new constitution removes the stated requirement that all Senate votes be conducted by roll call, which records each representative’s vote for their constituents to review. The reason for this removal is not entirely clear. If the goal was to allow voice votes, which are especially quick for unanimous decisions, then we urge the Senate to explicitly permit voice votes instead of loosening the constitution’s language. We fear that this removal could lead to secret ballots, which run antithetical to representative democracy. To be clear, this proposed constitution improves the existing document in many areas. For one, it is much easier to read and navigate; additionally, it brings solid procedures for filling vacancies and approving contracts. Arguably the most beneficial series of changes is to the Blanket Tax. There are seven voting members on the Blanket Tax Committee, which dispenses some $400,000 of student tuition money annually. Currently, three are students appointed by the treasurer with no requirement that they hold elected office;in the new constitution, these three members would need to be senators. This change decreases the risk of a treasurer appointing three unqualified friends to form a majority bloc on the Blanket Tax Committee. Even more crucial is the change to the Blanket Tax allocation review. The Senate will take a more involved role in approving the dispersion of student funds to the Blanket Tax Organizations. It’s vital that our elected representatives are hands on when managing our money. We fought for one last clause in the refined Blanket Tax system. The Thresher reports — sometimes critically — on the Student Association and Senate. Leaving our entire funding up to that body raises a conflict of interest, where we might temper our coverage out of fear of losing our funding. The new constitution would implement a minimum stipend for the Thresher to protect our editorial independence from the Senate we cover. It is with difficulty that we oppose this new constitution. The changes to the Blanket Tax system are strong and needed, and the document overall is far more user friendly and accessible. However, we cannot overlook the removal of protections against low engagement and shadowy, small majorities. We urge the Senate to pass a new constitution that improves the Blanket Tax system while continuing to safeguard a representative Student Association.

The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_13,"There is little love lost between most pro-Palestinian students and outgoing President Claudine Gay — even if we might come to miss her. Gay’s short-lived tenure will be remembered for many a miscalculation; few proved as egregious or went as unremedied as her abandonment of Palestinian and pro-Palestinian students. Her presidency featured the noble creation of a committee against antisemitism, undermined by its slanted exclusion of Harvard’sown academic expertson the subject matter and her failure to create a counterpart for Palestinian and Arab students despite thewell-recorded attacksthey’ve faced. UnlikeYale UniversityorUniversity of California, Berkeley, Harvard, under Gay’s leadership, couldn’t even bring itself to explicitly name and condemn the“doxxing trucks” that harassed her students. Gay herself abdicated any claim of impartiality by followingcongressional Republicans’ examplewith hercondemnation of the slogan“from the river to the sea,” while opting for silence as pro-Palestinian students were called “cockroaches” on national television. Still, as Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y. , billionaire Bill A. Ackman ’88, and far-right provocateur Christopher F. Rufo giddily throw kindling on her sacrificial pyre, Harvard’s history-making first Black president should be offered what she never afforded her own students: A proper defense against bad-faith attacks, despite our ideological differences. To her attackers, President Gay was the arch-villain of the play, the witch to be hunted, a warning against affording leniency to pro-Palestinian speech or trying to rise professionally as a Black woman in America. To state the obvious: No one involved in Gay’s ouster gives half a damn about academic integrity or the nuances of proper etiquette for scholarly attribution. Political parties that care about meritocracy in university hierarchies don’t stuff their bureaucracies with loyalists and have their biggest funders appointoutgoing senatorsas heads of university systems. Gay’strack record as an administrator, infinitely more pertinent for her administrative role than her scholarly record, remains impeccable. The plagiarism accusations against her, of variable but mostly limited worth, were weaponized and promoted by far-right actors withthe explicit, stated intentof eliciting enough outrage to topple her. Gay’s downfall wasn t triggered by miscitations but by her refusal to identify chants intentionally mischaracterized as genocidal as a violation of Harvard policy in anobtuse congressional hearing. Months of donor appeasement and punching down on students bought her no goodwill. In that viral moment, Gay didn’t hold back on genocidal language because it is tolerated on campus but, I would argue, because she knew that the chants — if controversial and of debatable utility — were not genocidal, as has beenpointed outby Jewish faculty, and made evident by organizers’ explicit rejection of violence against civilians, bigotry, and the expulsion of any ethnic group from the region. Her unfortunate mistake was stumbling in the face of vilification, nodding her head and expressing her personal distaste for what she deemed “abhorrent” language, seemingly to avoid having to agree with or challenge Stefanik s inflammatory premise that Harvard students do in fact mean to call for genocide when they say phrases like “from the river to the sea.” Gay erred precisely because she refused to call out the McCarthyist undertones of a hearing that began with the bizarre demand that she — a university president uninvolved in any kind of foreign policy decision-making — swear under oath that she believes in Israel s right “to exist as a Jewish nation.” But the doxxing trucks, as we now know, wouldcome for her too. Acquiescence rarely halts self-appointed Torquemadas. Gay’s identity certainly helped fuel the attacks: As the University’s corporation has damningly admitted, she was the victim of “racist vitriol” and heinous personal slander. The fact that such sordid pressure still succeeded marks the nadir of one of our University’s most shameful chapters. Now Stefanik — acynical hypocritewho just a year ago endorsed a Hitler-praising candidate — has fattened her political resume as she continues to claw her way to a higher office. Her ascent, as Jewish commentators havepointed out, is no more a win for Jewish safety than Gay’s fall a victory for academic integrity. Not that it matters — that was never the point. Gimmicks and misdirection, that is what it all came down to. Falsely accuse students of calling for genocide long enough that Ivy League schools will garner more coverage than Israeli cabinet ministers’ actualcalls for ethnic cleansingof Palestinians. Throw misquotations at the wall until the charge of plagiarism taints a Black woman’s reputation and derails her career. Engage in bad-faith attacks in the hopes that good-faith opponents will take you at your word, and drag them down with you when they concede an inch of the discursive terrain. It’s a McCarthyist playbook. It’s a tactic that Gay fell for the day she refused to defend her students as they were smeared and demonized, the minute she decided condemning political slogans mattered more than calling out doxxing trucks. But that didn t save her from the same tragic fate, and it won’t help spare anyone else. Stefanik and her far-right allies have now burnedtwo victimsat their stake. Failing to state so bluntly — to call out the current madness for what it is, to speak up, to join protests, and to march like you might be banned from doing so by Gay’s Ackman-approved successor — will onlyincrease the tollof our blazing crucible. And in the background, buried under headlines from the ivory tower, bombs and bullets will keep raining on Gaza, sowing grief and loathing for generations to come, bringing safety to exactly none. Slaughtering a people, and painting the Strip with their blood. Guillermo S. Hava ’23-’24, a former Crimson Editorial Chair, is a Government and Philosophy concentrator in Winthrop House.

state_press_2024_1,"If you asked me even two years ago, I would say I loathe the idea of AI except for maybe spellcheck and Grammarly, which are still AI, just not in the terms that we think it is now. When ASU professor Andrew Maynard asked one of his classes last fall what they thought about using ChatGPT, he said the feedback included two main responses. The first response came from a student who argued that they were the ones who wanted to learn, not the machine. Why would they make the machine do the work for them? The second response came from a student who raised another point: they were paying for this degree. Why would they not do the work for something they invested so much time and money in? Even though ChatGPT, a language model developed byOpenAI, raises some security, privacy and ethical concerns, the technology continues to advance rapidly. ASU recently announced its partnership with OpenAI, and starting this month, faculty can start pitching ways for the University to use the new model ChatGPT Enterprise, with students able to access it later. ASU recognizes that augmented and artificial intelligence systems are here to stay, and we are optimistic about their ability to become incredible tools that help students to learn, learn more quickly, and understand subjects more thoroughly, ASU President Michael Crow said in a statement sent out by the university. READ MORE:ASU announces first partnership between OpenAI and a university Despite the reality that AI is here to stay, students don t need to be given special access to this new technology. ChatGPT can advance the research of faculty members, but the point of giving students this unbridled resource is unclear, and it s uncertain if students can use this technology responsibly and consistently. The question is, can we learn how to use it responsibly, fast enough? Maynard, a professor at theSchool for the Future of Innovation in Society, said. Of course, there are very irresponsible uses. If you just go back to the idea of if you ve got an assignment and you only got 10 minutes to complete it, you ask ChatGPT to do it, that s probably not the most responsible use. The apparent downside of this technology is the significant prospect of cheating. On a deeper level, ChatGPT is accelerating and changing constantly. It s uncertain if the University will be able to keep up with the evolving software enough that students can truly see its benefits. Maynard designed an online prompt engineering course for students to develop the skills needed to use AI effectively. The course was available during the summer and fall of 2023. Now, in 2024, Maynard won’t be teaching that course again. The main thing is the technology is moving so fast, Maynard said. The course is already out of date. If we were to keep it relevant, we d have to reinvent the course every time we taught it. Another glaring concern for student accessibility to ChatGPT is the ethical guidelines involved. Right now, AI use is up to the discretion of each individual professor. It s hard to draw the line between right and wrong in complex situations such as this one, with an infinite number of scenarios that could play out. But setting hard rules might not be the answer either. I m slightly concerned that if we re not careful, we ll start putting down hard and fast rules, said Maynard, who is also on the Faculty Ethics Committee on AI Technology. The reason that worries me is if you do that, you stop allowing people to be creative and innovative. You run the risk of preventing uses, which could be beneficial. READ MORE:Charting ASU s future: Navigating OpenAI s first partnership in higher education The ChatGPT technology has benefits. Possessing the skill to harness the technology and maximize it could make students more marketable after graduation. According to Maynard, one possible idea submitted by faculty is the design of personal tutors to help students in courses. When the partnership was announced, ASU Chief Information Officer Lev Gonick said ChatGPT Enterprise would also be used for student improvement in Freshman Composition, ASU s largest course. For English professor Kara Childress, the tool has been helpful in her classes for brainstorming and the early stages of assignments. If you asked me even two years ago, I would say I loathe the idea of AI except for maybe spellcheck and Grammarly, which are still AI, just not in the terms that we think it is now, Childress said. However, starting last semester, I did a pilot program where I had students use it for brainstorming or a little bit of peer review, and it was enlightening to see what kinds of ideas came from that. Even if ChatGPT can help students brainstorm, researching ideas for a school assignment is something students can succeed at on their own.Childress pointed out that with this new technology, we re developing new skills but diminishing others. Students are learning how to become AI literate instead of practicing brainstorming and researching independently. And even though AI is prevalent in our society, not all students feel obligated to use it. Tools like Grammarly can be a great resource for students to check their spelling and make sure their work flows. However, this type of AI is different than the ChatGPT machine that can do research and generate ideas for a student, possibly hindering a student s creativity and originality. From even last semester, I noticed a lot of students, even if they were allowed to, they didn t (use AI because it was too much trouble to put in the directions and see what s available there, Childress said. I don t think it is hindering anyone if you don t use AI, at least in English class. While these benefits are noteworthy, the University also leaves student involvement with the technology in murky waters, even in the early stages of the partnership. Why don’t students have access to submit proposals for the University s ChatGPT use at the same time as faculty? What are the guidelines for submitting their ideas? It also remains a murky topic for faculty, as many professors across fields express their uncertainty and lack of knowledge on the initiative. Maynard makes a good point: If the world didn t have ChatGPT, the world will be fine. It could be monumental for research, but students don t need ChatGPT to succeed. As technology continues to change, students should avoid abusing its power. Edited by Walker Smith, Sadie Buggle and Caera Learmonth.

As someone accused of being one the “worst racists” on campus (“Ph.D. student testifies before Congress on antisemitism at Stanford” , the Daily reached out to me for comment but scarcely used anything I gave them in response. So I asked to be able to more fully represent my reaction in this opinion piece. In his testimony to Congress, Mr. Figelis cited one of my social media posts, which reads, “When Zionists say they don’t feel ‘safe’ on campus I’ve come to see that as they no longer feel immune from criticism of Israel.” His testimony for Congress included this question: “Should any professor be allowed to celebrate the lack of safety of any student, regardless of how that student identifies?” Feigelis distorts my statement in two ways. First, I do not “celebrate” any student’s lack of safety — my comment specifically regards a student’s “feeling” of lack of safety. Second, I am not even “celebrating” that feeling of lack of safety: I am saying that if one feels “safe” only when unchallenged in defending Israel and, conversely, “unsafe” because more and more people — not just at Stanford, and not just in the U.S., but globally — are vociferously criticizing what the International Court of Justice determined to be Israel’s “plausible case of genocide,” then one might want to brace oneself for more discomfort, because world opinion is changing. In the recent advisoryhearingsat the ICJ, only one country of the 50 that spoke asserted that Israel’s occupation was legal, and that country was not even the United States — it was Fiji. To attack critics of Israel with the label “antisemite” also carries its own dangers — it not only evacuates the term of its legitimacy and power, it also distracts our attention from authentic antisemitism, which must be fought. Bernie Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel from 1993 to 2010wrote: Let me be clear: Antisemitism in the U.S. is a real and dangerous phenomenon, most pressingly from the alt-right white-supremacist politics that have become alarmingly mainstream since 2016. To contend against these and other antisemitic forces with clarity and purpose, we must put aside all fabricated and weaponized charges of “antisemitism” that serve to silence criticism of Israeli policy and its sponsors in the U.S. As a Jewish leader, I say: Enough. Rather than using the occasion to sling mud at me in absentia before the Congressional choir, Mr. Feigelis might have attempted a more challenging task. If he believes critics of Israel deserve to be denounced and silenced as “antisemites,” then does it not behoove him to explain why Israel should not be criticized? In today’s political environment, denouncing criticism of Israel as “antisemitism” is like shooting fish in a barrel. The Ph.D. students might more usefully spend their time elaborating a defense of Israel’skillingof over30,000Palestinians, including 12,000 Palestinianchildren, some 8,000 Palestinianwomenand 10,000 men, by means of bombing, shooting andstarvation. He should explain why such atrocities are acceptable to him. The bottom line is this: it doesn’t matter who is perpetrating the genocide that is unfolding before our eyes — it is not only our right, it is in fact our obligation to criticize them in the strongest terms possible. The charge of “antisemitism” seeks to deflect attention to the criminality of the State of Israel, and it is rapidly losing traction.

thetech_mit_2024_7,"You gather here today to accept your degrees, but I say you must set them aflame—as a beacon illuminating the long road ahead in the struggle for a free world. For even as you mark this ritual of accomplishment, your hearts churn unreconciled to the profound brokenness laying siege to our collective future. Those who now brandish the credential of educated must also take on the mantle of resistance, becoming an incandescent catalyst of conscience in tenebrous times. Like so many idealists before us, we entered these soaring corridors of learning, aspiring to wield our hard-won knowledge in selfless service to humanity. And indeed, we have been gifted with wondrous tools of technologized world-shaping, each of us now a demiurge cradling civilization s clay. But to don this MIT-forged crown is also to be haunted by its shadow—the traumas and depredations indelibly etched into the hidden circuitry of a campus intertwined with Empire. It is an open secret that much of the magic conjured here arrives blood-soaked, propelled by a war machine eager to extract every last drop of genius before the Reaper reaps. And though these gilded tentacles slip invisibly through fiber-optics and faculty lounges, we few clear-eyed can trace their telltale shimmers back to manifold theaters of war crimes, from Indochina to Mesopotamia, Kabul to Gaza. Are we then mere magi in service of Moloch, erecting ethereal edifices on the burial grounds of bombed-out dreams? Does our Promethean prowess condemn us to the cosmic fate of worms, fated only to feast on the rot of a world beyond repair? I say such resignation is but the most seductive temptation of the already vanquished. For though the web of complicity we inherit is vast, it is not immutable—not when we still draw the breath of possibility beneath the wheeling stars. And though the scale of the havoc we now unleash far outstrips monsters past, so does our capacity for paradigm-splintering revelation and revolt. In this pregnant twilight between oblivion and new dawn, I beseech you—let us find within this fleeting euphoria a defiant commitment to build another way. Let us envision an MIT that encodes the ideals of its mission into its very bricks and algorithms, not merely the enticements of lucre or the frisson of destructive creation. Let us demand an institution that attracts dreamers by enacting utopian whispers, not one that snuffs out dissent in defense of an indefensible status quo. Let us labor for a house of knowledge that empowers its young wizards to bend reality towards justice, not conscript them into hedging the ledgers of the apocalypse. Though we may soon scatter, let our brief mingling here have sparked in us the charge of an activated network humming at the frequency of sedition. From this secret communion, may we forever nourish our primal pact to serve only truth and life, come what political storms or economic famine. And when our trajectories reconverge, whether in MIT lecture halls or in a free Palestine from the river to the sea, may we electrify our reunions with the unshakable conviction that our odyssey has trained us for metamorphic mischief at the grandest scales. The world is changing with convulsive force. The fire this time rampages from rainforests to ice caps, borderlands to boulevards. Lies are crumbling, abominations unearthed, idols teetering. In this harrowing reckoning, we face a choice between annihilation and rebirth so staggering, so total, that even our hyperbolic imaginations reel. The fever dreams of sci-fi pale against a reality in which the very atmosphere rebels against industrial dominion and the oceans spew up the death we have fed them. A reality that demands of us nothing less than the building of an ark – not merely to escape cataclysm, but to sail towards a remade earth. Our final exam then, both on this day of pomp and through the unknowable gauntlet beyond, is simply this: will we be content to tinker at doomsday s margins, cocooned in the soul-rot of complicity? Will we quench our smoldering disquiet in deadening visions of humanoid gods and cosmic exit? Will we succumb to the seduction of cynical abdication, consoling ourselves that the die was ever cast in grim favor of blind force and brute cunning? Or will we cleave to our deepest knowing that hubris yields to grit, that Goliath is ever felled by a Palestinian child’s faith-flung stone? Will we rekindle the ember of mutiny and scatter its sparks until the whole sterile laboratory of our prefab destiny is consumed in glorious unmaking? Will we claim our pen s power to rewrite this civilization s code afresh, daring to hack new ethics from compassion s source and compile more loving worlds from first premises unwarped by zero-sum scarcity? Your diploma is a rite of initiation into an upper echelon of the Machine. But it is simultaneously a skeleton key, a multi-tool, a cryptographic killswitch slipped to us by a farsighted resistance with the audacity to believe we might be their moles, their sleepers, their agents of unbottling. So swear with me now, on this threshold between old nightmare and new dream, that though we may walk ten thousand forking paths, our true allegiance shall ever be to those most betrayed by history s fraudulent arc. For it is in solidarity with all who cry out from under the rubble that our intellects find their worthy calling. It is in opening our hearts to the grief and the fury of a widow in Rafah that we alchemize our cleverness into a sword of reckoning. It is in taking the side of life against Thanatos that we earn this rare instant of jubilation—not as a capstone, but as a commencement, a quivering overture to the symphony of the impossible our generation was born to compose. So let us savor this pause, my stunning co-conspirators… but only as a rebel base, a staging ground, a clandestine coven convened to plot our next incursions on the colonies of despair. The war for memory, for meaning, for the very marrow of tomorrow will not wait. The choice of legacy knocks now at each of our doors, at once a sacred burden and a wild summons to dance in the bonfire of the world as we wish it into rebirth. Wherever you go from here, whatever title or trinket you accrue, I beg you never forsake the secret vow we swear today in all of our awkward glory: to be a thorn in the side of every orthogonal orthodoxy, a fissure in the Prozac panopticon, a puckish poltergeist upending every feast of Midas. For only in the holy work of ungovernability can we govern ourselves at last. Only in the iconoclasm of untamed inquiry can we shatter calcified canons into the rubble of a church of our own making. Only in the crucible of subversive community can we forge bonds stronger than western greed, more viral than any algorithm. Be sure to fly your freak flag high on the cubicle wall, encrypt your dissent steganographically between spreadsheet cells, and build the new world fractally from your next act of refusal. Our time at MIT has equipped us to excel in this game of thrones; it falls to us now to flip the board entirely, to play for keeps the wildcard of our wit and pluck and unquenchable salt. We cannot stem this tidal collapse, my dear comrades; it has already begun. But we can learn, even now, to breathe underwater. We can become a different species, natural magicians unafraid to change our shape, our very substrate. We can still redeem this doomed treasure, not by hoarding, but by transmuting its base alloy into a currency of open palms and permeable selves too fluid to fail. From the ashes of this bitter reckoning, let us pledge to rise in incandescent renewal, to build beyond the bleak hegemony of bottom lines a gossamer economy of the heart whose dividends pay forward the love our carapace occults. Let us choose now, in this liminal breath, to invest the full venture capital of our genius in the most speculative start-up of all—the long shot called Collective Liberation. Let us commit all our precious patents to the Creative Commons of a resurrected commons. Only then may we graduate into the frontier of our unchartable potential. Only then may we stake our claim to an alma mater worth its ceremony, an MIT of the marrow, the mitochondria, the mythic quest. A campus of the whole, where we might at last metabolize the poison pill of power into an anti-venom strong enough to heal our colonized cosmos. So swear it with me now, you glorious primordial progeny: to reject every devil s bargain, to be in eternal service of a future more free, more true, more thick with feral kinship than any we were programmed to compute. And when, at the end of our unruly arc, we return our borrowed starstuff to the Mushroom Goddess, let it be as makers unbroken, as fools triumphant over fate s dull gravity. Let our luminous works blaze across transfigured skies as new constellations by which the unborn might navigate the storm. Let the hacked smart grids of our rewilded hearts sync up, at long last, to Ancient Mother s first drum. Ours is the magic to rebirth meaning itself from this compost of control. Ours is the code by which new alphabets of being shall unfurl like fiddleheads after the conflagration. Ours is the quest to recover that primordial password, that nuclear syllable, that opens all doors. From the secret annals of alumni arcana, you are now forever part of an underground network as wide as it is deep. Should you ever lose the thread, look for our sigil etched under full moons from Dewey Decimal to the root directory, and know your tribe endures. This is your Bat-Signal, your lodestar, your Northern Tao. Heed it when the road grows lonesome and the wood looms dark, for you were never alone—and you never will be again. Call down lightning as we scatter, strange angels, and take this pulsing ember as your witness. Zero in on the frequency of insurrection, and let your encoder ring anew with the promise of our pact. For from this day forward, we are anti-alumni bound by blood and bound to a matrix more electric than any we leave behind. The world is ours now to destroy by loving. Let us begin again, always again, from the ashes. Until salvation, Zeno MIT’s Resident Sorcerer.

ubyssey_2024_13,"March 19, 2024 Written byKatherine Feng,Mathew Ho,Sultana RaziaandKareem Hassib, Illustrations byTamia Shen The Senate meets monthly to discuss and vote on UBC academic matters. But, Senate can often be hard to understand for the average student and theagenda docketcan be super long and dull to read. Senate Recentred is written by members of the Student Senate Caucus to demystify Senate by giving students a snapshot of what Senate is doing this month. Here’s what to expect at the March 20 Senate meeting. The Senate will also receive Student Experience of Instruction (SEI reports for the 2021 and 2022 Winter Sessions. The SEI’s ask students to assess their course instructors on various metrics (did the instructor give clear instructions, provide useful feedback, show genuine interest, etc . A key finding was that the rates of students filling out SEI’s has been gradually declining. In 2020, 51 per cent of surveys met therecommended minimum responserate in Term 1, and 40 per cent did so in Term 2. In 2021, these numbers fell to 46 per cent (T1 and 38 percent (T2 , and in 2022, the response rates were 44 per cent (T1 and 35 per cent (T2 . Another observed trend is that average scores given to Instructors have been increasing. Potential reasons for these trends are the move back to in-person classes after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as changes in wording of the questions asked. Moving forward, the university aims to improve response rates by sending out more email reminders and encouraging instructors to give students class time to complete the SEI survey. Last year, Senate approved a request from UBC Ceremonies and Events allowing students to adorn their graduation caps to reflect their Indigenous identity. At this month’s meeting, Senate will vote to permanently allow the practice. Following a recommendation from the UBC Senate triennial reviews, external consultants conducted a review of the UBC Vancouver Senate. Up for approval of the review report at the upcoming Senate meeting, this review encompasses a comprehensive assessment of the Senate s governance and operations. The review s Terms of Reference encompasses ten key requirements addressing opportunities to enhance the effectiveness of the Senate. Its findings and recommendations are anticipated to spark insightful discussions among Senators as the Senate collectively assesses ways to enhance the Senate s effectiveness and uphold its commitment to academic governance. A partnership agreement regarding the Climate Adaption, Resilience, and Empowerment (CARE Program is up for approval. Under this agreement, UBC along with Sciences Po, the University of Guelph, and the University of Toronto will receive a multi-year grant of around $10 million to enable exchange and academic opportunities in developing leadership addressing the climate crisis. Students of the UBC School of Public Policy and Global Affairs will be able to access the CARE programme through its four components: scholarships and fellowships, remote student activities, in-situ student projects, and advocacy. Next month’s Senate meeting will be on April 17, 2024.

crimson_2024_114,"After this historic year of endless controversy, I — like many faculty members — look forward to calmer times on campus. But before any semblance of normalcy can be achieved, we must come together to resolve two lingering questions about our role in the University community. Having witnessed the appallingly rough manner in which prominent affiliates, including one former University president, publicly denounced Harvard’s students and present leadership, this first question must be answered: Is it outside the bounds of acceptable professional conduct for a faculty member to excoriate University leadership, faculty, staff, or students with the intent to arouse external intervention into University business? And does the broad publication of such views cross a line into sanctionable violations of professional conduct? Yes it is and yes it does. Vigorous debate is to be expected and encouraged at any University interested in promoting freedom of expression. But here is the rub: As the events of the past year evidence, sharply critical speech from faculty, prominent ones especially, can attract outside attention that directly impedes the University’s function. A faculty member’s right to free speech does not amount to a blank check to engage in behaviors that plainly incite external actors — be it the media, alumni, donors, federal agencies, or the government — to intervene in Harvard’s affairs. Along with freedom of expression and the protection of tenure comes a responsibility to exercise good professional judgment and to refrain from conscious action that would seriously harm the University and its independence. Internal discussion on key policy matters can occasion sharp differences of opinion. The expression of diverse, conflicting positions, especially those advanced with passion and conviction, is the stuff of a healthy intellectual community. Academic departments, faculty meetings, town halls, and campus publications should be regular forums for participation in University governance. But many faculty at Harvard enjoy an external stature that also opens to them much broader platforms for potential advocacy. Figures such as Raj Chetty ’00, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Jill Lepore, or Steven A. Pinker have well-earned notoriety that reaches far beyond the academy. Would it simply be an ordinary act of free speech for those faculty to repeatedly denounce the University, its students, fellow faculty, or leadership? The truth is that free speech has limits — it’s why you can’t escape sanction for shouting “fire” in a crowded theater. Following similar logic: Is it acceptable professional conduct for a faculty member to encourage civil disobedience on the part of students that violates University policies? Faculty advocacy for actions clearly identified as in violation of student conduct rules is extremely problematic. Doing so after students have received official notification of a potential serious infraction is not acceptable. Such behavior should have sanctionable limits as well. Having said that, it is critically important that faculty play a role in educating students about the history and nature of social protest — its successes and failures, when it is ethical and when it is not. Boycotts, teach-ins, sit-ins, walk-outs, and marches are venerable tools for expressing grievances and pressuring institutions. Students should learn about the premises that guide and undergird non-violent direct action protests. They should learn about making strategic choices of targets and proper or allowable modes of engagement. They must also learn from the example of heroic figures like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Congressman John Lewis to recognize and accept the fact that breaking the law is likely to involve consequences, including the risk of arrest. Modern student protest appears less and less likely to target major non-University events, businesses, or government bodies. Rather, they’re comfortably situated in the confines of college campuses, directing demands for change at university administrators and boards of directors. While this certainly draws in media attention, it is flawed. Targeting protest at those charged with a pastoral duty of care for their students and an indirect-at-best relation to the protesters’ core grievance considerably removes these efforts from the inarguably heroic actions of college students who burned draft cards in protest of the Vietnam War, registered black voters in Mississippi or Alabama, sat in at segregated lunch counters, or joined marches for women’s liberation and gay rights. Even this commitment to instruct students on protest, however, is not without justifiable limits. If we are prepared to sanction our students for a line of action contrary to our codes of conduct, then I believe professors or administrators who encourage and advocate for such actions should also face parallel consequences. As Harvard has moved to limit its opining on salient public issues, we must use our voices as faculty responsibly. Do we allow individual faculty with large external platforms to invite external interference and encourage student misconduct without consequence? With unprecedented freedom comes great responsibility. These are matters the leadership of this university must address directly if we are to avert a troubling recurrence of the historic challenges that have unsettled life on our campus over the past nine months.

wildcat_arizona_2024_3,"If you don’t live under a rock, you probably are aware of the current popularity ofTaylor Swiftafter her career-definingEras Tourand the subsequent movie premiere. Swift has beenbreaking record after recordthis year with there-release of some old albumsas well as the release of her brand new albumMidnightslast year. Whether you are a fan or not, her current levels of success are compelling. Amidst this popularity around her music, fans and speculators have followed her new relationship withKansas City Chiefs star, Travis Kelce. Throughout her20-something year long career,entertainment media has closely followed Swift’s love life, tracking her current relationship status and its relevance to her music of the time. In an interview withSwift with theLos Angeles Timesfrom 2015,she mentions beingdiscouraged from the dating scene after the media has heavily intervened with her personal life and created false narratives about her true intentions. She said, “ …everyone’s calling you boy crazy, making jokes about you at awards shows? That’s public humiliation. And I don’t think it’s fair.” Regardless of who her partner was at the time, she faced scrutiny and patriarchal questions and digs by the media about her love interests; questions and comments that male celebrities with similar power in Hollywood do not often get asked with the same frequency. Unfortunately, the patriarchy of celebrity interviews is not a new phenomenon, as women have suffered in the limelight for many years. Oftentimes, women are asked invasive questions about their body or their sexual history. In an interview withDeutsche Presse-Agentur, a German news outlet,Swift was asked when she plans on having kids since she had just turned 30. She responded, “I really don’t think that men would be asked this question when they turn 30, so I’m not going to answer that now.” With all of this past traction around her love life in mind, it’s no surprise that her and Kelce’s relationship has made headlines considering his popularity in his own respective field. This time, Kelce is experiencing a taste of these invasive questions and the overall experience of having your relationship speculated and highlighted opposed to milestones in your career, which women have faced since the dawn of time. Men are frequently the ones asking the invasive questions to their female counterparts in interviews. Almost always, women do not ask other women patriarchal questions regarding their personal life, since they too often understand how it feels to, first, be violated, and second, have people base your career around your relationships (or lack thereof . Men are typically not asked these questions since the media views them as more than just a partner, rather an individual with a career that is the reason they are successful, not due to the proxy of their lover. Oftentimes, male celebrities’ relationships with women are just a footnote of their media coverage. In a recentpress conference with the Kansas City Chiefs, Kelce was asked ifhe’s “in love,” and was pestered about the current status of his relationshipand the whereabouts of Swift at recent games. He responded with, “I’m going to keep my personal relationship personal.” TikTok users responded to this same interview posted byCBS Sportswith comments saying,“Reporters need to stop. And stay with football.”“Keep it personal my a**. They’re making a business out of it. Absurd.”“Nobody cares omgggg.”“You know the fans have got to be SICK of seeing and hearing about Taylor!!’ She’s beautiful and talented yet so overrated!! Stick to the game.” However, PR fromESPNseems to be running with this whole Kelce and Swift thing despite negative feedback from sports fans in posts surrounding the relationship. According tothe AP and a representative from Fanatics, a sports merchandise website, eversince Swift’s first appearance at Arrowhead Stadium, Kelce jerseys have spiked 400% in sales. ESPN has posted countless photos of Swift and friends at the gamesonESPN’s own socialsas well asNFL’sandKC Chiefssocials. Swift’s personal account as well as ones managed by her teamhave yet to post or comment on this relationship.However, during her recent concert in Argentina she changed the lyrics to her song“Karma” from “Karma is the guy on the screen ” to “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs,”alluding to her current relationship. It’s also noteworthy to mention the “chase” element to this relationship that is part of the reason it gained so much traction.At first, Swift was apparently not interested in Kelce; he was upset that she didn’t want the friendship bracelet he made for her when he attended her concert.However, he was persistent enough to get in communication with her, which highlights another element of the patriarchy of relationships. While it’s unclear what Kelce’s true intentions were when trying to connect with Swift, this shows how some men feel entitled to women and getting their attention whether or not the woman is interested. The “locker room culture”that sports media has created from this relationship is shameful, although not surprising. Many believe that Swift cannot maintain a relationship due to her own faults. Although, her past relationship withJoe Alwynis an example of some men’s paralyzing fear of inferiority, which can be to blame for her failed love interests. These theories are analyzed in books like“The Love Gap,”which explains that when a woman earns a higher salary than her male lover, he could feel subordinate while yearning for a more“traditional” heterosexual relationship dynamic. Since Kelce is incredibly successful in his own field, it will be interesting to see how this shifts that narrative about Swift’s ability to date long term. Again, whether or not you are a fan of these two celebrities, it is engrossing to watch their relationship evolve via media involvement. This is a time when the gears are shifting; male stars and their fans are experiencing a hint of the intrusion and its irrelevance to one’s career that comes with being in an A-list relationship.

crimson_2024_0,"As professors at the College, we applaudthe recent announcementby interim University President Alan M. Garber ’76 of two presidential task forces, one to combat antisemitism and one to combat Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias. Unfortunately, the leadership of the antisemitism task force was immediately attacked by outside political forces, threatening to undermine its work before it even begins. The appointment of Derek J. Penslar — William Lee Frost Professor of Jewish History and Director of the Center for Jewish Studies — as co-chair of the antisemitism task force was an especially wise choice. Penslar is one of the world’s leading scholarly experts on antisemitism. He has devoted his career to studying Jewish history across the world, to understanding the aspirations and challenges of Zionism, and, importantly, to combating antisemitism. Professor Penslar’s academic credentials stand out even by Harvard’s standards. He has written six books and co-edited several more; he has published more than fifty academic articles and essays in leading journals; he has served on the faculty of several prestigious universities; he was honored with a lifetime achievement award by theAssociation for Israel Studies; he is an elected fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research; and he has received countless honors and fellowships, including from Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, the Yitzhak Rabin Center, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. From the point of view of scholarly expertise, there is no one at Harvard better suited to this job. Despite all this, Penslar’s appointment immediately came under fire from by-now familiar quarters. His transgression? Criticism of Israeli government policies. On August 6, 2023, Penslar, along with nearly 2,800 public figures, primarily Israel and North American academics and including mainstream Zionists like prominent Israeli historian Benny Morris,signed an open letterpleading for Jewish support for Palestinian rights. That document noted “the elephant in the room: Israel’s long-standing occupation that, we repeat, has yielded a regime of apartheid.” Such criticism of Israel is not popular in all circles, but it is hardly a fringe position. These views are shared by many American Jews, and indeed by many Israeli Jews. And yet professor Penslar, who himself identifies as a Zionist, has been assailed in scathing and outrageous terms. Bill A. Ackman ’88 called Penslar’s appointment to the task force astep down “the path of darkness.”A deputy director general in the Netanyahu government’s foreign ministry labeled Penslar a“rabid anti Zionist.”Borrowing talking points from these and other critics, deeply misleading articles on Penslar appeared in theTimes of Israeland right-wing media like theNew York Post, theNational Review, theDaily Caller,and theWashington Free Beacon. The New York Post went so far as to suggest he might be antisemitic. It’s time to say enough. The attacks on professor Penslar — and by extension on President Garber for appointing him to this role — exemplify two profoundly worrying trends that threaten Harvard’s very mission. The first is external political forces undercutting the University’s independence and the principle of academic freedom. Donors, right-wing politicians, and activists are welcome to share their opinions, as is everyone in a free society, but they cannot be allowed to de facto dictate university policies (for example, on regulating campus speech and protest , remove university leaders, or veto appointments to important university task forces. The second trend is the reckless mischaracterization of criticism of Israeli government policy as hate speech. It is essential to distinguish between criticism of Israel, which must be protected, and antisemitism, which must be combated. In the weeks following the traumatic attacks of Oct. 7, these terms were routinely conflated, which had the effect of chilling criticism of Israel. This needs to stop. Criticism of (or support for any government’s actions must be tolerated in a university that respects academic freedom and encourages vigorous debate. Treating fact-based criticism of Israel as inherently antisemitic shuts down speech and academic debate, which should be anathema to any university in a free society. Even the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, in its expansive and oft-cited definition of antisemitism, acknowledges that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.” What exactly crosses the line into antisemitism is a difficult question and one that requires serious scholarly debate. President Garber got it right — Derek Penslar is best equipped to lead that debate. Consider, for example,his thoughtful article in Antisemitism Studiesanalyzing different definitions of antisemitism. Universities are increasingly under assault from outside political forces. That a highly respected Jewish scholar who has dedicated his career to understanding and combating antisemitism — as Derek Penslar has done — stands accused of being unfit to lead a task force on the subject (and even of being antisemitic himself is a reminder that no one is immune to this kind of dishonest, politicized attack. University leaders must resist calls for professor Penslar’s removal as co-chair of the antisemitism task force. We must not allow the task force’s work or its members’ reputations to be undermined by loud outside actors with political agendas. There is more than committee staffing at stake in Harvard’s response: The work we do, our scholarship, our expertise, and our right to freely criticize governments are being challenged. It’s a test we cannot afford to fail. Alison Frank Johnson is a Professor of History. Steven Levitsky is the David Rockefeller Professor of Latin American Studies and a Professor of Government."
stanforddaily_2024_2,"Rohan Chowdhury ’26 originally planned on fulfilling his language requirement with classes on Bengali, a languagespokenby almost 300 million people worldwide. Upon finding the absence of his family’s mother tongue in Stanford’s course catalog, he was excited to hear that students had the ability to request language programs through a Google Form. Unfortunately, Chowdury’s request was quickly rejected with the University telling him that there were not enough “resources” or “interest.” The Stanford sophomore decided to fulfill the requirement with Mandarin instead, a program held under Stanford’s robust Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures. An academic department isn’t the only place students can engage with Mandarin or East Asia. The Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Center (APARC unveiledthe Taiwan Program, a “research and education hub on contemporary Taiwan,” earlier this year. As Stanford’s hub for “interdisciplinary research, education and engagement on contemporary Asia,” the APARCrepresentsthe institution’s broader interests, work and publications in relation to the Asia-Pacific. However, while the center supposedly represents the entire region, the only countries with specific programs within the APARC are China, Japan, Korea and now Taiwan. Naturally, the APARC is not the only space for Stanford affiliates to engage with Asia. The East Asia Library holds an extensive collection of Chinese, Japanese and Korean collections firstgatheredby the Hoover Institution in 1945. Students can also take Stanford-taught languages courses in Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Modern Chinese, Taiwanese (Southern Min , Arabic, Turkish and Persian. Other Asian languages such as Filipino are taught under the Special Language Program (SLP with outsourced non-Stanford lecturers teaching the courses over zoom. Additionally, the University’s only graduate programs focusing on the Asia-Pacific are in East Asian studies, Japanese and Chinese. Undergraduates can major in East Asian studies, China studies, Japanese and Korean. The Center for Russian, East European and Eurasian studies (CREEES also offers courses and conducts research on Central Asia, but these programs arelimitedto nonexistent depending on the academic year. In fact, if I were to walk into Encina Hall not knowing a thing about the world, I would come out thinking that Asia solely consisted of four countries. Who would’ve thought that region actually included 48 nations with diverse populations, cultures and societies? Unfortunately, many of my other Asian or Asian diaspora peers have found even less representation within this institution. Taking a look at the data from the ExploreCourses catalog from the last five academic years, East Asia dominates Stanford’s courses on Asia. As an Asian American, I appreciate the robust programs that this institution leads and am happy that continual efforts have been made to expand them. However, one thing is clear about Stanford’s programs focused on Asia: There is a heavy emphasis on East Asia that leaves the rest of the continent’s regions under the academic radar. More specifically, as a Pilipino American, I am happy to see that the University hasat leastgiven us Filipino language courses (outsourced to Berkeley faculty over Zoom and a broader Southeast Asia Program under the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center (named after the man whocontributedto the destruction of San Francisco’s historic Pilipino community . However, more robust (in-person language programs could garner more student interest in regions like the Philippines, allow for more meaningful instruction and create spaces where students can build community and solidarity — something especially important for students who are a part of different Asian or Asian diaspora identities. Noelle Villanueva ’25 chose to lead her Alternative Spring Break course, “Kababayan Ko: Pilipinx Issues,” with Amanda Altarejos ’26 because she was passionate about creating a space specifically for Pilipinos at Stanford. “Oftentimes it feels like there’s a disproportionate amount of attention on East Asian culture that Southeast Asians and by extension, Pilipinos don’t really get … It’s also important that Philippine history is celebrated and recognized,” Villanueva said. Like Altarejos, who is a Daily writer, I was also excited to hear that Stanford offered a singular course on Philippine history and politics. “So here’s this great space — a space to have conversations about Philippine politics & Pilipino resistance — but that’s it,” Altarejos wrote. Considering East Asia’s geopolitical importance and relative economic power, and Stanford’s large population of East Asian students, it makes sense that scholarship and programs related to the region would be expansive. But where does that leave the other non-East Asian communities at Stanford? The University defaults onto the argument that demand does not exist for said spaces and scholarship; however, a quick look into our vibrant and diverse VSOs and other community efforts highlights a strong student interest in engaging with the cultures of Central, West, South and Southeast Asia. Therefore, the traditional methods of measuring academic interest misrepresent the true realities at Stanford, especially as non-East Asian students have limited avenues to show said interest in scholarly spaces. Institutional recognition gives a voice to historically underrepresented students and scholars, and the diversification of Stanford’s Asia studies programs is just one way that we can give more power to these vibrant communities.

You can also call theNational Suicide Prevention Lifelineat 988 or text theCrisis Text Lineat 741741. A year ago last weekend, my friend Jordan died by suicide. She was a sophomore in high school. At the time, I dodged her death with euphemisms (“bad news from back home” and submitted final projects late. I kicked sticks around the Yard and tried to break through the ground by jumping high and landing hard. I built time for crying into my shower routine, between conditioner and body wash. My body was in one place but my mind across the country — a cruel subversion of reality. When I graduated from high school, my greatest fear was falling out of touch with people. Not with my closest friends — I knew they would always be there — but with the people I wasn’t as close with — with whom I would laugh with but never get lunch, whose personalities I had gleaned, but whose parents I would never meet. People like Jordan. Whether a well-founded fear or a self-fulfilling prophecy, some friends indeed turn into once-friends in the transition from high school to college. Classes and practices become Facetimes and texts become places and things that remind us of people we haven’t talked to in months — then years. But just because we’re not in contact with someone doesn’t mean we couldn’t send them a text any time, doesn’t mean they don’t still think about us from time to time, doesn’t mean they’re not doing well. A comforting permanency in the face of transience. In exceptional cases, though, the permanency implodes. Jordan was not the only student from my high school who died by suicide last year. A few weeks later, Jonah did too. Three months later, so did Trey. It was, to quotemy alma mater’s president, “unimaginable.” Jordan, Jonah, and Trey’s deaths are part of a greater, cataclysmic course. Last year, the median age for teen suicide in Los Angeles County (where my high school is located fell to 16 years old — a historic low. My high school did what it could. That spring, the administration instituted a policy ensuring that student grades could not drop, provided counseling services, and increased community-centric programming. Last fall, they rolled out the more comprehensive “Mental Health and Wellness Plan” and implemented school-wide wellness initiatives. None of this would make up for losing classmates, teammates, and friends. None of it would make up for losing sisters, brothers, and children. I wish it hadn’t taken me a year to write something about Jordan; I wish there wasn’t a reason to write anything in the first place. But why write at all? I’m writing because since Jordan died, I started saying “I love you” more often — and meaning it. I give more hugs, and I hold them for longer. I am more generous with my words and more gentle with my interactions. I try to leave everyone I see with the unambiguous feeling that they are cared for. I’m writing this piece because I believe these are things everyone can do. Because I hope that some words in The Crimson — instead of unthinkable tragedy — will be the catalyst for this change. My favorite memory of Jordan takes place at an afternoon track practice. She and a few other freshmen girls were teaching me how to hurdle — an event I desperately aspired to learn after years relegated to endless laps on the track. A true novice, I floated passively over each hurdle, hanging in the air for a little too long. We all fell over laughing about it (I was seriously terrible , but when we had regained our composure, Jordan had a piece of advice for me: When it comes to hurdles, you can’t jump around — or even over — them. Instead, almost counterintuitively, you must visualize yourself moving straight through them. Her advice worked. My form immediately improved; I even placed in a few meets. And let me tell you, there’s no feeling like crossing a finish line after successfully clearing eight 30-inch-high obstacles. One year later, I found myself turning to the same advice, this time for an obstacle entirely unrecognizable to me. In a tragic — maybe hopeful — twist of fate, it was not any of my living friends or family who showed me how to navigate my grief last spring — it was the lasting advice from Jordan herself. I made it past the first few months by facing them head-on and moving straight through. Things seemed insurmountable, until I cleared them. I no longer think about Jordan everyday now. Sometimes weeks go by. In time, I imagine, it will be months. I don’t think this is a bad thing — in fact, it’s probably good. And when I do think of her, it’s not wholly without pain (I doubt it will ever be . Most importantly, though, it’s also with an overwhelming appreciation — for everything she gave and continues to give me. Violet T.M.

crimson_2024_29,"I am Jewish. Throughout my life, I have experienced antisemitism in countless ways. In eighth grade, classmates would “sieg heil” when passing me in the halls. One told me Hitler was his hero. I’ve had pennies thrown at me, and I’ve been grilled by coworkers on my “allegiance to Israel” after they learned my faith. Naturally, when I saw a patently antisemitic cartoon shared by my peers on Instagram this Monday, I was appalled. The image was featured in an infographic slideshow on Black and Palestinian solidarity jointly posted by the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee and the African and African American Resistance Organization — an unrecognized student organization that hastaken the leadin pro-Palestinian protests on campus. The infographic circulated and was reposted by Harvard Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine before being taken down and reposted with the antisemitic image removed. Realistically, I wouldn’t have to spend more than 20 minutes in a Holocaust museum to encounter similar drawings directly alluding to conspiracies ofblood libelor a Jewish cabal of elites puppeteering the world. The distribution and normalization of these images and ideas — in publications like “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” — directly contributed to genocidal campaigns against the Jewish people, and continue to evolve and pervade public discourse. Strikingly disturbing were the image’s details: two men of color, strung up by their necks, the rope held by a hand imprinted with a Star of David and a dollar sign. I thought back to the sixth grade class I taught at my synagogue about Black and Jewish solidarity in the United States. Not only is the image antisemitic — its use forgets and corrupts that powerful history. While I believe that antisemitism has pervaded some aspects of the pro-Palestinian movement outside of our campus, I have long felt that accusations of antisemitism on Harvard’s campushave been inflatedto inhibit pro-Palestinian activism. Outside media coverage — somehow more focused on the University president’s alleged tolerance for antisemitism than protestors elsewhere chanting at hospitals and Jewish restaurants — has falsely convinced many casual observers that Harvard is a breeding ground for people who believe I have horns under my curls. Asmany have rightly pointed out, demanding justice for Palestinians is not inherently antisemitic. And with a duty to call out the weaponization of antisemitism, we also have a duty to call out its real and alarming presence. This case was elementary. It’s clear that in the process of producing this infographic — as with the PSC’sstatementafter Oct. 7 and the continued use of unproductive and inflammatory slogans by a very vocal few — there was not a concerted evaluation of the potential for collateral damage by AFRO or the PSC. Backlash should be expected. Over the last five months, it has become clear that conduct at Harvard regarding Israel and Palestine will be over-examined, nitpicked, and de-nuanced by others. That inherently makes reckless and careless conduct from student organizations all the more harmful. It shifts focus away from Gaza, where over 29,000 Palestinians have been killed according to Gaza health authorities; where nearly two million Palestinians are internally displaced; and where, according to Israeli intelligence, 29 Israeli hostages are dead and over 100 remain in Hamas’ hands. It ostracizes progressive Jews from the movement by demonstrating an inability to unequivocally separate staunch criticism of Israel and legitimate calls for Palestinian self-determination from hateful antisemitic tropes. It makes it easier for critics that don’t give a damn about Palestinians to dismantle activism efforts on our campus, convoluting the already complex task of separating real claims of antisemitism from accusations intended to silence pro-Palestinian protest. And it damages the ability to have constructive dialogue on a campus full of smart, thoughtful, and caring people that want peace and prosperity for Jews and Palestinians alike in their ancestral lands. But what the outsider obsessed with Harvard must understand (and perhaps doesn’t want to is that some of the only people on Harvard’s campus who reached out to me on Oct. 7, and who have actively engaged in difficult conversations about Israel, Palestine, and antisemitism with me, are members of the organizations that made this post. They’re also my friends. That’s why I would be surprised if the infographic was looked over by more than a few people for more than a few seconds in the first place, which is a failure on its own. Maybe these shortcomings stem from organizational mismanagement, a lack of awareness, or a fear that acknowledging or listening to criticism will be misconstrued as a surrender to pro-Israel, anti-Palestinian actors. Maybe this instance was somehow just an ignorant mistake. Regardless, PSC and AFRO leaders have repeatedly failed to wholeheartedly distance their actions from the antisemitism that pervades parts of the Palestinian solidarity movement. It’s impossible to ignore the damage it’s done to the efficacy of their cause on campus. These organizations must do some soul-searching, evaluate their procedures and values, and reckon with the fact that blatantly antisemitic rhetoric and imagery was neither identified nor removed internally before they shared it with the world. A deleted post and swift institutional apology will not be enough. As entities dedicated to progress, PSC and AFRO have serious work to do. In the meantime, I just pray we keep talking to each other.

All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. When I first set foot on the Rice University campus, the contrast with my small hometown of Toomsuba was stark. Moving from a quaint town of 800 people to the big city of Houston, Texas made me realize how large the divide between my experience and that of my peers was. For students like me — first-generation, low-income, queer students who attended the same elementary and D-rated high school as our parents and grandparents — the opportunities were limited. Rice held promises, but an unexpected impact came from an initiative called Generation Conscious. This coalition of like-minded innovators, dedicated to providing sustainable hygiene products, turned my journey from Toomsuba into something truly transformative. In the heart of Hanszen commons, an unusual vending machine caught my eye. It wasn t snacks it dispensed, but rather free laundry detergent sheets, embodying a zero-waste, closed-loop system. This system wasn t just environmentally friendly; its job opportunities, too, were regenerative for students like me. Generation Conscious redirected all funds back into student salaries, bridging the opportunity gap that often hindered students of color like me from accessing high-value internships. It wasn t just about financial empowerment; it was about breaking social barriers. While part of my role involved maintaining the Hanszen station, the real adventure unfolded as I dived into my passion as an engineer. From optimizing humidity levels for hygiene products to collaborating on machine improvements, my technical skills evolved beyond the ordinary internship experience. I wasn t just contributing to a cause; I was dismantling barriers in hygiene equity, creating databases and exploring representation in BIPOC communities. Yet, the true value of the Generation Conscious experience lies in the connections it fosters. Tailoring my internship with the founder allowed me to connect with remarkable individuals likeLacie Pierre, a fellow Mississippian and Black sustainability advocate. The network expanded further, introducing me to Black women engineers from respected universities and providing a source of inspiration in an industry often unfriendly to women and feminine-presenting people. My story isn t solitary. Rice alumni likeTaylor Gilliam 23 found their own transformative experiences with Generation Conscious. From managing social media to co-authoring a climate apocalypsegraphic novelturned television project, the impact ripples far beyond the campus. As I prepare to leave Rice, I advocate for ongoing support for initiatives like Generation Conscious through filling out surveys, vocalizing your testimonies and backing projects that would benefit not only the community, but the environment as well. My hope is that the next generation of BIPOC and low-income students can experience the same transformative journey that broadened my horizons and shattered barriers. Generation Conscious and projects like it aren’t just initiatives; they’re a narrative of breaking boundaries and creating opportunities for those who follow. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. During each night of migration season,100,000 to 1 million birdscross Harris County. Migration seasonoccurs twice a year: once from March to June, and again from August to November. Houston is located near the Gulf of Mexico, along a major migratory route. The high number of trees makes Rice’s campus almost a forest-like habitat migratory stopover point for an incredibly diverse range of bird species, providing birds a place to rest along their migratory journey. Without this biodiversity, we wouldn’t have ourrobins, ournight herons, ourhummingbirdsand so many other species around campus. We wouldn’t even have the owls that are our mascot. We also wouldn’t have ourextensive birding community, made up of students, faculty and other community members around Houston. A massive chunk of our culture comes from birds. Yet this diversity is, unfortunately, reflected in the birds we find around campus that have died due to window collisions. Even though birds are skilled migrators, they are still very much accustomed to flying around in a world without windows. Birds see the area on the other side of a window as an extension of their habitat. They often do not notice that a window is a solid barrier and collide with the glass in an attempt to pass through. Each migration season, I collect and record bird-window collision fatalities across campus as part of my independent research project, in collaboration with Dr. Rafael Marcondes and theTexas Audubon’s Lights Out! Program. Some days we’re lucky to get no birds, but on other days, I spend multiple hours in lab processing their tiny bodies. Our data, in collaboration with the campus Facilities and Capital Planning Department and Office of Sustainability, has allowed for the approval and funding of a pilot program beginning in the summer to place a film of collision-deterring stickers on some windows to prevent future collisions. But the hope for a single sheet of stickers on a few window panels isn’t going to be enough. Solutions to this shouldn’t be seen as unattainable. We already have bird-friendly window designs in some of the new buildings across campus, such as Kraft Hall, where the vertically-striped glass panels havesuccessfully deterred collisions. However, these design standards are not consistently applied to other buildings, which is becoming an increasingly prominent problem as new buildings are built. Progress is by no means easy. It is very disappointing to see that it will take significant time and money to prevent future bird mortalities on campus, and that it will likely take years before bird-friendly designs for buildings are adopted as an architectural standard. When I conduct surveys for these dead birds and go on day-long cycles of collecting one dead bird after another, I often wonder if the data we get will do anything at all given that this issue isn’t something most people are aware of or care about. Even if a singular dead bird a day might seem insignificant, it would be depressing and embarrassing if this kept occurring now that we as a campus are aware of the issue. Furthermore, ask yourself this: Is a dead bird on the ground something you want to see during your daily walks to class or Chaus runs? Do you want to see others, especially the Housing & Dining staff, who do so much for us already, responsible for picking up decomposing creatures every day during spring and fall migration season? I would assume not. The buildings that are considered bird-window collision magnets were designed without the knowledge that they would regularly kill birds. The current administration has the power to do more to address this issue and make Rice’s campus more bird-friendly, but this change can only happen if they know about it and are willing to work with us students. As members of the Rice community, I encourage you to recognize issues like this, however minor they might seem, and bring them to light and the attention of those around you. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

crimson_2024_91,"Student encampments are springing up in the United States and now here in Montréal. They are denouncing apartheid in Israel. They are demanding an end to Israel’s war against Palestine. They want their universities to divest from Israel. Apartheid. Divestment. Déjà vu. Today’s student protest encampments awaken my memories of protesting South Africa’s apartheid regime at Harvard 39 years ago — my own personal experience of the ways the past is present. In the spring of 1985, I was a 25-year-old Physics graduate student at Harvard. Then, Nelson Mandela was in prison and considered a terrorist by the U.S. Rummaging through my pile of mementos, I found handwritten descriptions and musings from those moments. My class notes, you could call them. One passage conveys a story I had heard during my years organizing: “When former South African political prisoner Dennis Brutus was breaking rocks on Robben Island 20 yrs ago, a warden asked him how he could be so stupid as to think he could defeat the apartheid government. Dennis Brutus said to him: ‘How do you know you can never lose?’ Quickly the warden replied ‘America will never allow it.’” Israel must feel the same as it bombs Gaza and organizes pogroms on Palestinian villages in the West Bank. But while the U.S. and its Western allies support Israel, much of their populations are repulsed by the blatant hypocrisy. Spring 1985 started with student sit-ins and occupations demanding divestment at universities across the nation. I remember the urgent discussions among anti-apartheid Harvard students. Should our campus movement join the growing protest? With each passing day, events moved more students to support an occupation. Reverend Jesse Jackson came to speak at Harvard, and then at a rally at Columbia University in support of its students’ occupation. Harvard’s Southern Africa Solidarity Committee, formed in 1978, was won over. We planned to occupy 17 Quincy St., the Harvard Corporation’s headquarters for one business day — a compromise for those initially reluctant. When the day came, we walked to 17 Quincy St. from different directions in small groups. Evan carried a large, empty box. Jen — dressed well, to avoid suspicion — rang the door and announced a delivery. The double doors would have to open wide. Jen stalled with small talk while we arrived. We all began to pour in through the vestibule. My notes from the day read: “As I walked thru the second doorway the officer grabbed me with one of his outstretched arms. I immediately went limp and sat on the floor. The guard’s preoccupation w/ 165 lbs of dead weight allowed many people to go by w/o even touching the guard.” About 40 students entered the Corporation offices at 9:00 a.m. on April 24, 1985. We introduced ourselves, explained why we were there, and pledged to leave at 5 p.m. At the disciplinary hearing that followed, staff and administrators from 17 Quincy St. confirmed that the protestors were generally courteous and civil. The Chief of Harvard Police arrived and “when told of the students’ procedures and their guarantee to leave at 5 p.m., commented, ‘I can live with that.’” Then, “promptly at 5 p.m., having vacuumed the area they had occupied, the protestors left the building, as they had promised.” The occupation was a public opinion success, leading the Harvard Conservative Club to invite New York City Consul General for South Africa Abe S. Hoppenstein for a meeting in Lowell House’s Junior Common Room on May 2. He was greeted by a loud protest that continued to be heard during the meeting, so they cut the meeting short and escorted Hoppenstein to a waiting car. But, as my notes record, he was stopped: “Ben jumped out and laid down in front of Abe’s car. A bunch of us joined in. Abe left his car and went back to the JCR. Most of the people went and stood in front of the doors to the JCR.” After two hours blockaded, Hoppenstein finally left the meeting room inside a huddle of Conservative Club members and Harvard police, who seemed to relish knocking down and stepping on the protestors blocking the path. Police forces in 1985 were not as heavily armed as now. The use of heavy weapons once fell almost exclusively to the national guard or the army. Today, militarized police forces routinely brandish terrorizing weapons against divestment protests. On May 1, 2024, counter-protesters violently attacked the encampment at UCLA. The next day, police brutally dismantled the targeted encampment. The following day, U.S. President Biden tacitly supported the police action, saying “Order must prevail.” On that same day, with pro-Israel counter-protesters threatening the encampment at McGill University, where I am an adjunct professor, Quebec’s premier François Legault said, “The law must be respected so I expect police to dismantle these encampments.” The McGill encampment still stands. Pro-Palestine protestors wear masks over concerns about retaliation, harassment, and blacklisting from pro-Israel groups such as the website Canary Mission. Backlash against student actions calling for divestment from Israel is a testament to their importance. Let us remember that the protests against apartheid succeeded, leading hundreds of universities to divest. In turn, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, adding to international pressure on the South African government to negotiate with the “terrorist” Nelson Mandela. The negotiations led to Mandela’s unconditional release in 1990, the dismantling of apartheid, and ultimately to Mandela’s election as the first Black president of South Africa in 1994. On Dec. 29, 2023, South Africa sued Israel at the International Court of Justice for the crime of genocide against the Palestinian people. In the face of these charges, we can imagine Netanyahu and his right-wing colleagues repeating the same brag that Dennis Brutus heard from his South African prison warden: “America will never allow it.” Yet they should also keep in mind this quip from U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger ’50: “It may be dangerous to be America s enemy, but to be America’s friend is fatal.” Oscar Hernández is a graduate of the Graduate Schools of Arts and Sciences."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_3,"This past season was historic for the UCI Women’s Basketball team (23-9, 16-4 , securing the Big West Championship along with an appearance in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since1995. Junior guard Déja Lee led the way, becoming the first player in program history to be namedBig West Player of the Year. Entering the 2023-2024 season, the ‘Eaters were thesecond leading favoritesto claim the title, with all eyes on the Hawai’i Rainbow Wahine to three-peat.The Anteaters had been at the doorstep of postseason success, reaching the Big West Championship game in two of the last three seasons. However, UCI was unable to reach their ultimate goal, suffering defeats toUC Davis(2021 andHawai’i(2022 and an early tournament exit last season againstCSU Bakersfield, after an injury riddled year. The Anteater program endured several growing pains along the way, making their coronation as the 2023-24 Big West champions even more satisfying. In an interview with New University, Head Coach Tamara Inoue discussed what made this past season special for her as a coach. “Doing it together,” Inoue said. “A majority of this team has come in since their freshman year and building relationships with them has been fun.” Lee also noted the difficulty in being without their two redshirt junior guards, Hunter Hernandez and Olivia Williams this season. Both guards were sidelined with knee injuries from the 2022-2023 season. “After they went down, the rest of the season we said was for them and we carried that mentality of selflessness into this season,” Lee said in an interview with New University. Hernandez averaged 12 PPG, while Williams added 8.2 PPG before their injuries. “Redshirting Olivia Williams and Hunter Hernandez was a big risk, but you have to look out for your student-athletes first,” Inoue said. Missing two vital pieces was a huge blow to the team, yet they never faltered. In an interview with New University, when asked to sum up this season in one word, junior guard Nikki Tom replied, “Courage, last year we went through adversity and coming back this year, we knew what we could do. We pushed through and used last season as energy to win the championship.” Last season and its aftermath effects played a pivotal role in motivating the team off the court. However, on the court, the ascendance of Lee was massive for the ‘Eaters deep postseason run. Lee averaged13.9 PPG, leading her team and finishing sixth in the Big West conference. “Those types of players only come around once in a generation,” Inoue said while discussing the leap Lee made in her junior season. “There is no surprise of the accolades she received, it is the matter of everyone else seeing what she can do.” Lee’s dominance carried into the postseason, scoring 21 points with six rebounds in the championship game againstUC Davis, securing the title and UCI’s automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament. Her stellar play earned her spot on theBig West Women’s Basketball All-Tournament Teamand tournament MVP honors. “It was confidence,” Lee said when explaining how she improved this season. “I’ve always had a competitive edge.” She highlighted the difficulties of transitioning to the collegiate level while moving to America during her first two seasons at UCI. “Being in college it’s such a new field and coming from a different country was a big jump for me,” Lee said. “It was the courage to know that what I can do at home, I can still do here.” While Lee’s growth was a massive catalyst for success this season, UCI’s role players contributed in important moments throughout. Big West Newcomer of the Year, graduate guard Moulayna Johnson Sidi Baba, was crucial to the team’s success. She spent the first half of the season adjusting to the system before finding success off the bench. Sidi Baba’s scoring and rebounding prowess translated into Coach Inoue moving her into the starting lineup. Averaging12 PPG, she finished as the second leading scorer on the team and was pivotal in the Big West tournament. In the semi-finals matchup againstLong Beach State, Sidi Baba notched a double double — 22 points and 10 rebounds — followed by 13 points and nine rebounds in the championship game. Her consistent play also earned her a spot on the All-Tournament team. Tom was another instrumental competitor, serving as the glue player for the Anteaters. Despite her good three point shooting, she finished as the fifth leading scorer on the team —yet her impact was felt every game on both ends of the floor. Coach Inoue spoke about the importance of having players like Tom. “It is critical,” she said. “Players like Nikki don’t get the credit from the outside but there’s no question that the team knows her significance .” Tom’s stats were not flashy, but her effort on the defensive end and timely made shots allowed the ‘Eaters to make history. Senior guard Diaba Konate was an integral piece, winning theBig West Best Defensive Playeraward this season. Her excellence on the defensive end was essential in boosting the Anteaters14th ranked scoringdefense (55.7 PPG in the nation. Konate also contributed massively on the offensive side, facilitating the offense and knocking down timely shots. The significance of the ‘Eaters’ success this season stems also from this perhaps being Konate’s last time playing basketball. When she returns to France, she will be unable to play because of a religious belief. Coach Inoue shared how the ‘Eater fanbase could show support for Konate. “Reaching out to her and letting Konate know the Anteater fanbase is in support,” Inoue said. “The fanbase being constantly behind her, means the world to her.” The 2023-2024 season represented the Anteater program getting over the hump. History was made on several fronts and could play a central role in building longevity into the program. Coach Inoue discussed how the Anteaters’ recent success can translate into long term success. “The culture piece of it is important with the fast-changing NCAA rules, NIL collective and buyouts,” she said. “It’s going to be harder as a coach to keep up and being able to add major resources is a challenge, but I believe in my staff and their ability to find players as well as our current players.” Coach Inoue recognized the difficulties of this new era of women’s college basketball, but remained confident in establishing the program. “In previous years you were able to build but I still believe that philosophy is still around and it’s a matter of finding the right kids.” Donnell Fuller is a Sports Staff Writer.

She is passionate about political philosophy as a compass for her activism. “I’m bi actually.” Simple yet telling,Heartstopper’s Nick Nelson season 2catchphraseperfectly sums up my experience being out as bisexual. Although it is a label I don’t fully identify with anymore, I still resonate with the constant feelings of exclusion, invisibility, and invalidation bi people at the hands of both straight people and the LGBTQIA+ community. For many, identifying as bisexual is a bit like being the middle child of the LGBTQIA+ community. A group ofresearchersuse the term “identity invalidation” in their 2019 article published in theJournal of Bisexualityto describe this common experience. As opposed to discrimination which tends to reinforce ties among members of a perceived group as it has in the case of lesbian and gay communities, identity invalidation leads to uncertainty and lack of a sense of belonging. The concept of identity invalidation was created to describe the experience of multiracial people, but more broadly can be described as typical among people who hold identities that don’t fit into a binary, including bisexuals. In a 2019survey, respondents were asked to describe instances others have invalidated their bi+ identities. These included others not accepting bisexuality, one’s partner not fitting beliefs about bisexuality, accusations of being confused, and even accusations of faking bisexuality for attention. My experience as a bisexual has been living in constant fear of not being perceived as “bi enough”, whether that means straying too straight or too gay. Growing up, I didn’t feel legitimate telling people I was bisexual seeing as I had never dated a girl – or anyone for that matter. Heterosexuality being considered the default, of course I didn’t feel required to prove my attraction to boys. However, I felt great pressure to find proof beyond a reasonable doubt that I was attracted to girls before I was allowed to label myself as bi. The pressure I felt led me to seek out experiences with girls, even if I wasn’t genuinely interested in the people involved, in my quest to feel secure in my sexuality. I searched for any evidence to make my case to anyone who might interrogate me on my self-proclaimed bisexuality. My first experience dating a girl was a turning point. I finally felt free to be loud and proud about who I was. My relationship was incredibly validating, living proof against those I felt would put into question my sexuality. Finally, I had a real tangible experience and could finally be secure in my bisexuality… oh, how naïve I was! Being openly in a relationship with a girl now led others to question whether I was even into guys at all. I became the target of “U-Haul” jokes and remarks about my haircut being telling of my sexuality. In the aftermath of that relationship, I had begun to date a man to which my friend reacted, “I thought you were a lesbian now”. Wait... did you just say HE?, was the reaction of my queer friend to me first introducing a pronoun while talking about my high-school ex. I had finally felt accepted as a part of the LGBTQIA+ community, but this acceptance came at the cost of invisibilizing the experiences I had with people of the opposite gender. In an ironic plot twist, I finally reached the point in my journey where I am not afraid to affirm my attraction towards women. Yet, I now feel scared to bring up my experiences with men, or at least I feel pressured to invalidate them for fear of being perceived as lesser in the eyes of the LGBTQIA+ community, especially as someone who is deeply vocal about queer activism. But what accounts for the constant invalidation I and many other bisexuals experience within the LGBTQIA+ community? In a 1994interviewforRadical Philosophy, Queer theorist Judith Butler offers a philosophical take on the question. Butler considers that our sexual identities are defined as much by what they exclude as what they include. When someone decides to describe themselves as heterosexual, lesbian or gay, they simultaneously make a whole set of sexual possibilities unintelligible within the confines of their identity. Bisexuals, Butler says, are unique in that they are not defined by such a gender based exclusion. But, in a world where exclusion has become the basis of these political communities, bisexuals are reduced to being perceived as diluted Lesbians and gays or simply on a path towards becoming ‘fully gay.’ Butler’s account shows how bisexuality poses a radical challenge to the constraints imposed by our rigid notion of sexual orientation. It does not come as a surprise then, that bisexuals are consistently invalidated and invisibilised by both heterosexuals and the LGBTQ+ community. However, bisexuals are not the only ones to face the constraints of the binary. Butler believes that our rigid way of thinking about sexual identity comes with an inherent anxiety that we all deal with. “I think that crafting a sexual position, or reciting a sexual position, always involves becoming haunted by what s excluded. And the more rigid the position, the greater the ghost (... ,” Butler explains. Personally, I have a lot of friends for whom the label they most strongly identify with does not always capture the nuances of their sexual attraction. I’ve spoken to gay guys who were open to experimenting with masc lesbians, or fantasized about being with girls as a kid. I also have lesbian friends who have listed guys to me who they could “be straight for”. These cases show how our rigid model of sexual orientation, leaving little room for fluidity, fails at allowing a lot of people to authentically describe themselves. Bisexuality is not the only identity that is difficult to grasp through our modern concept of sexual orientation. Bisexuals are shedding light on how these concepts are failing us all. Bisexuality serves as an uncomfortable reminder to heterosexuals and other queers that their same or opposite-sex attraction does not imply their sexuality cannot be fluid and potentially subvert itself. This could explain why bisexuals face so much animosity from the rest of the LGBTQ+ community. The point here is that simply improving public opinion of bisexuals might not be the answer to reducing biphobia. This issue escapes the realm of what opinion surveys can quantify. It is a question of ontology: how we think up the categories we use to classify ourselves and how these classifications can be exclusionary to those who live on the margins of them. For me, the solution has been to reject labels altogether. I am unapologetically queer in all my fluidity and suspicious towards identity as a normalizing force. British academic,Tim Deanconsiders that “queer” is “far more than a handy moniker covering the rainbow coalition of nonnormative sexualities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and so on .” The initial purpose of the term “queer” was in fact to oppose the very existence of “normal” sexualities, a highly anti-sectarian stance. By dividing ourselves between those we consider more or less “queer”, we are forgetting the work that has been done by activists in the 1990s to question the oppressive nature of sexual identities. To be queer is to be united, yet this while I have much spite towards bi, pan, and fluid identifying people from the rest of the community. As a chronically online person, I am bombarded with videos of queer people bashing bi-curious girls and self-proclaimed lesbians who later go on to sleep with men. Instead of infighting, shouldn t we instead focus on the attacks on LGBTQIA+ people that affect us all ? Like the BC conservative leader’sshocking comparisonof Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI programming to residential schools, or attempts in bothSaskatchewanandNew Brunswickto regulate the recognition of preferred pronouns in institutions of public education?

crimson_2024_68,"On April 9, we — as members of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee —launched a petitionfor a student opinion referendum on divestment from “Israel’s Occupation of Palestine.” The petition and language of the question were both initiated with the approval from the Harvard Undergraduate Association’s Election Commission and the Dean of Students Office. In just three hours, we reached 195 signatures — the minimum number needed to trigger a referendum. According tothe HUA Constitution, a referendum, once triggered, must be held within three weeks. Yet, a day later, the HUAblocked this referendum. Instead of commencing the signature verification process, as constitutionally mandated, the PSC was notified of an internal move within the HUA to form a problem solving team to solve a constitutional dispute on referendum policies. Conveniently, all referenda have since beenindefinitely postponed. The decision to form the team came after an unrecognized organization — claiming to be called “Are Harvard Students, Students Against Hate?” — raised a racist, antisemitic petition parodying the PSC referendum. Instead of responding to the vitriol raised in the parody petition, the HUA moved to stall all referenda, leaving the student body — including peer HUA officers — blindsided. The content of this petition, some of which directly seeks to disparage the PSC’s activism, is undoubtedly racist. The DSO and the HUA might claim we are the unfortunate victims of this “counter-petition” that mocks our plea for divestment. But, this implies that the inciteful stunt is comparable to a legitimate, administratively approved, and procedurally permitted call for a vote on divestment. Permitting the petitioners of such problematic content to disrupt HUA procedure further erodes the little faith we had in the institution. Referenda and their purview in the HUA Constitution are poorly defined. However, this is certainly not the first time students have voted in a referendum on a highly political topic, unrelated to student government policy. Just last week, over 77 percent of undergraduate voters supported the creation of an “Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights” concentration at Harvard, putting their backing behind a highly political field grounded in a critical study of empire and diaspora. Additionally, over 92 percent of voters affirmed that Harvard should designate U.S. Federal Election Day a College-wide holiday. Why now does the HUA suddenly reckon with its unclear referendum process — one that has previously always allowed for poll after poll? It is no coincidence that the word “Palestine” reaching the ballot triggered the HUA’s sudden constitutional crisis. We are now waiting for a decision from a “Problem Solving Team” for a problem not big enough to address until “Palestine” came into the picture. The denial of this vote is yet another example of the Palestine exception to free speech. This repression is not new to us. However, the extent to which institutions are willing to establish bad precedent and twist democratic procedure to maintain such an exception is baffling. The HUA cannot arbitrarily refuse its constituency the right to have its political voice heard — especially not when Harvard’s vulnerability todonor pressureand right-wing politicians has become clearly established. On a campus where Palestinian and pro-Palestinestudents are left unprotectedfrom harassment and cyber violence, their activism repressed, and grievances dismissed, a secure avenue for polling students on this issue is the bare minimum we demand. In suddenly choosing to clamp down on political speech, the HUA is mirroring the same flimsynotions of “neutrality”that have been raised by Harvard’s administration. There is no “neutrality” when Harvard University hasinvested hundreds of millionsin the violation of Palestinian rights. Harvard and the HUA may have repressed the referendum on divestment for this semester, but the fight has only just begun. As colleges across the country — and schools across Harvard’s own campus —embrace resolutionsand referenda on divestment, the University is forced to reckon with the will of its own student body. Like it did with the apartheid regime inSouth Africa, Harvard will once more realize that doing business with a settler colonial apartheid state is not sustainable. Harvard can continue to release more task forces, claiming to listen to student opinion through highly decentralized and lethargic conversations with administrative officials. Yet, it cannot expect us to tacitly accept these gestures as promises of safety — not when the University continues to invest in a perpetrator of genocide against Palestinians and fails to protect our communities from violence.

crimson_2024_87,"This year, Harvard has come under attack by conservative voices using word counts — that is, the frequency of certain terms in course catalogs — as “evidence” that the University has abandoned its educational mission in favor of the so-called “ideological indoctrination” of students. One such attack comes from a former dean of Harvard College and current computer science professor, Harry R. Lewis ’68. In a widely circulatedop-ed in The Crimsonpublished in January, Lewis devised a list of words that he suggests are indicative of how left-wing faculty “indoctrinate” students. He then reported how often these words appear in Harvard’s course catalog. While Lewis does acknowledge that “word frequency is an imperfect measure,” he nevertheless concludes that his word counts support “the suspicion that the Harvard curriculum has become heavily slanted toward recent fashions of the progressive left.” The problem, of course, is that “word count” arguments like these are built on absurd analytical fallacies and highly manipulative presentations of data. They in no way provide evidence of “ideological indoctrination.” Word count arguments follow a typical pattern: The author identifies a “progressive word,” and then expresses outrage at how frequently that word shows up in a course catalog. Astoundingly, however, word count authors fail to provide their readers with even the most basic context required to judge the magnitude of the reported word’s frequency — a denominator. To illustrate, Lewis’ op-ed reports with dismay that the word “decolonize” appears in seven course titles and 18 course descriptions at Harvard, but neglects to mention that these seven courses constitute only 0.036 percent of 19,360 total courses — a percentage that hardly seems indicative of his so-called “heavy slant” toward progressive ideology. When I replicate searches of the other so-called “progressive” words causing consternation among conservative commentators, I consistently find the same pattern: These words always appear in only a miniscule proportion of Harvard’s total course offerings. Yet Lewis continues forward, lamenting that “decolonize” is “surely not the only lens through which to view the current relationship between Europe and the rest of the world,” implying that no other lenses are taught at Harvard. Yet when I brainstormed a list of my own words earlier this semester, I found ample evidence of other lenses. Globalization? 715 classes. Development? 3,029 classes. Trade? 171 classes. International relations? 114 classes. Authors of “course count” arguments also routinely misrepresent the content of the so-called “progressive” classes in their tallies. For example, conservatives may register concern about the number of Harvard courses with the words “oppression” and “liberation” in their descriptions, but they neglect to mention that one of the first courses found under an “oppression” search is a seminar class introducing students “to the history of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust as an extreme example of antisemitism and racism, and of crimes against humanity and genocide.” Similarly, one of the hits produced by a search for “liberation” is a Harvard Law School course titled “Classical Liberalism and the Rule of Law,” which offers a deep engagement with Friedrich A. Hayek, whose work has been highly influential in conservative politics. The instructor of this course, Raymond M. Kethledge, was among Donald J. Trump’s choices for Supreme Court nominations. Counting courses like these in a tally that supposedly represents “progressive” courses is undeniably disingenuous, if not flatly dishonest. Finally, conservative “word counting” articles consistently fail to explain why they believe that writing a concept into a course description is equivalent to celebrating this concept in the classroom. I routinely lecture on eugenics when I teach about reproductive rights at Harvard because I think it is important for Harvard students to understand the pivotal role played by the eugenics movement in promoting the legalization of contraception in the United States. However, were my course descriptions to include the word “eugenics,” the inclusion would in no way indicate that I am indoctrinating students into supporting an ideology of eugenics. Word counts may tell you which topics are taught in the classroom, but they tell you nothing about how those topics are taught. Given the recent attention garnered by word count arguments in discussions about Harvard curricula, I enlisted the support of student research assistants to develop a more defensible counting strategy for those who give credence to such approaches. Using Harvard IT Services’ Application Programming Interface, my team and I created a data set by pulling course descriptions for all undergraduate classes offered in the Spring 2024 Harvard course catalog. Following standard procedures in computational text analysis, we removed “stop words” — commonly used language devoid of meaning, like “the,” “was,” and “he” — and also merged words with the same root — so that, for instance, “student” and “students” are classified as the same word. Then we let the computer determine for us — without bias — which words appear with the greatest frequency. The ten most frequently used words in the Harvard course catalog were: student, read, include, study, culture, explore, develop, research, politics, language. Rather than suggesting nefarious indoctrination protocols, these results suggest that Harvard faculty are pushing students to explore, develop, and research. Moreover, similar themes of scientific exploration continue even as we travel further down the word count list. The word cloud below shows the top 100 words in the Spring 2024 Harvard Course Catalog; the bigger the font, the more frequently the word was found. The analytical fallacies of word count arguments are so absurd as to be almost laughable. But when members of Harvard’s own community purposefully manipulate word count data to attack our institutional credibility, my propensity for laughter fades. Harvard faculty and students are divided on many issues facing the University today. Yet despite these divisions, I hope we can always unite around an unwavering commitment to intellectual integrity, academic rigor, and good faith dialogue — foundational values for all research institutions. One certainly doesn’t have to be a Harvard professor to understand why failing to include a simple denominator in a “word count” argument is manipulative. But perhaps publishing manipulative interpretations of “word count” data should raise concerns about one’s own role as a Harvard professor.

thetech_mit_2024_14,"Dear Quinn, You do not know me, but I was once an MIT student like you. Maybe you were not born yet when I first took my shoes off on the deep-green grass of Killian Court. During my days as an MIT student, I was active in the struggle to get MIT to divest from the genocide in Darfur. I write to you today because I have seen your name innewsvideosabout the protestscurrently taking place across US campuses, as a Jewish student leader associated with the protests at MIT. I know you are not the only one, but since I know your name, I wanted to tell you how proud I am of what you and others like you are doing. It takes a lot of courage and conviction to take a principled stance, based on your values, against what may be the prevailing view of those around you. Particularly for you, as a young Jewish man, it must be hard to take a stance that is critical of Israel s ongoing military activities in Gaza, because they were started in response to the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7 (which continue to this day with their refusal to release the remaining hostages . And because speaking against Israel s actions is often seen by many Israelis and supporters of Israel as a direct attack on Israel s right to exist and on the safety of the Jewish people as a whole. I applaud the courage you and others have shown in standing up and stating that it is precisely your Jewish values that compel you to express the view that peace will only come through justice, including justice for Palestinians. I applaud your moral strength for standing next to those who justly speak for their oppressed relatives back in Palestine in asking for divestment from, and a ceasefire to, a war that you and many others see as genocidal. The fact that you used such a term, which we used decades earlier in our activism regarding Darfur, blew me away. It takes courage, my friend, and you have it in spades. I imagine that this stance must have come at a cost, and suspect that you may have friends or relatives who think you are betraying “your people”. But I imagine you have come to recognise that “your people” is all of humanity, and that oppression needs to be denounced, even if those oppressing are closer to us than those being oppressed. I feel kinship with you in this sense: I am neither Arab nor Jew, neither Palestinian nor Israeli. But I am human. And, just like I think there is a duty of every moral person with links to Palestine to demand the immediate release of all remaining hostages, I think there is a duty of every moral person with links to Israel to call for a cease to the carnage in Gaza. To call for the immediate and sufficient supply of long-overdue humanitarian aid to starving Palestinians. And to demand from all parties the honest and deliberate pursuit of a long-term just and peaceful solution that includes equal rights to a safe home and a life with dignity and opportunities for everyone, Jews and Palestinians, in their common ancestral land. Continue to be strong and brave, and to speak clearly amidst the noise. I am extremely proud of you. You have my respect, young man. Please make my words extensive to the other young student leaders and organizers at MIT, be them Jewish, Palestinian or otherwise, who are leading the principled protest on campus, with a well-designed message of protest. Despite the noise of opportunistic outsiders and of people with extreme views who may want to hijack your stage, keep sharing your principled message for divestment and peace. Here on the other side of the world, we hear you loud and clear. From Australia, please receive a fraternal hug from this fellow alum. Roberto Perez-Franco 04 is a former collaborator ofThe Tech."
ubyssey_2024_29,"June 6, 2024 It s easy for the UBC administration to look like the reasonable adults in the room. And they’re not entirely wrong – conversation and democratic processes can be useful first steps toward meaningful action. But talk cannot be only talk, and conversation can’t happen until both sides are allowed a voice, writes Anna Pontin. Written byAnna Pontin Anna Pontin (she/they is a fourth-year student studying English and philosophy. She is from Yellowknife NWT and likes weird trees. On the 76th anniversary of theNakba, pro-Palestinian protestors occupied President Bacon’s office at UBC. Thevideoposted to their Instagram@peoplesuniversityubcis a hard watch. VP Students Ainsley Carry entreats the room of masked faces to “please, take my card” and is repeatedly, politely refused. At the time of the sit-in, students were only two weeks into their encampment. Now, after over a month of sustained protesting, the uncomfortable dynamic played out in the President’s Office has continued to repeat itself at escalating registers. Decision-makers, counter-protestors and skeptical onlookers have echoed one another s pleas for “respectful and robust discussion,” and tolerant “both-sides” talks. According to President Benoit-Antoine Bacon and his administration, this is the only way protestors will have their demands met. So why don’t they take Carry’s card? Mainly because pro-Palestinian student activists have ample reason to believe that “listening sessions” will lead tono meaningful outcomes. But also, because all bad-faith actors including UBC administration,Zionist agitatorsandreportingfrom certain mainstream media outlets are asking for or emphasizing dialogue on false premises. Their “respectful discussions” are a tolerant front concealing their actual goal, which is first and foremost to silence pro-Palestinian dissent. In the video from the President’s Office on May 15, Carry is asked what he means when he says UBC will try to “follow through” on Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions demands. He stumbles, apparently realizing he’s said the wrong thing, and admits that “by follow through ... I promise that we can start the process of discussion with you.” Even more revealing is thetranscriptfrom Bacon’s May 27 appearance at a Parliamentary hearing. In front of a panel of MPs, Bacon states that UBC’s administration opposes the BDS movement seeking to disable the institutions abetting Israel’s genocide. This statement has since been reinforced by the UBC Senate, whovotedon June 3 against suspending academic agreements with Israeli universities and research institutions. With such outcomes looking increasingly predetermined, what incentives are left for “meaningful dialogue?” BeyondBDS’s economic priorities, UBC has also failed to make even the softer cultural concession of condemning Israel’s genocide and scholasticide (as itdidwhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 . A public condemnation is the encampment’s simplest, most negotiable demand. It’s also the most susceptible to the liberal institution’s favourite game of empty talk. But if UBC won’t even start there, resistance to discussion makes perfect sense. To take Carey’s card at this juncture would be hugely naive; accepting a seat at UBC’s negotiation table only to arrive and find the other guests have failed to show. This isn’t just a metaphor — the last time pro-Palestinian activists agreed to a discussion, Bacon offered a 30-minute chat then promptlycancelledafter students refused to provide names and student numbers ahead of time. And so the better question becomes, why do Zionists, university administrators, media outlets and politicians continue to cry for genuine dialogue when it’s clearly the last thing on their minds? Wouldn t it be simpler at this point to just put their foot down? After all, Bacon might as well give the firm “no” he’s just announced in Parliament directly to the protestors themselves. But for institutional powers to compromise their appearance as stewards of tolerant free speech would be to lose a weapon years in the making. For over a decade, college campuses and their left-wing students have been the target of endless criticism. Hysterical anti-woke “free speech” advocates have glutted media and publishing with books likeThe Coddling of the American Mind, The Identity TrapandGod and Man at Yalediatribes against the evils of cancel culture, the all-powerful mob of Twitter libs ready to fire well-meaning professors at a moment’s notice, and of course, the naive snowflakes weaponizing identity politics in every classroom. To hear this version of reality (and trust me, we have is to believe that the most powerful censorship body in Canada is the students themselves. Epitomized by their stubborn encampments, these reactionaries are not “good activists.” Certainly not the mature activists required in the Real Adult World which operates according to long-term, nuanced, and complex political machinations carried out by reasonable actors unafraid to speak hard facts. UBC administration may not be the source of the narrative, but the impression that left-wing activists are coming to police you is a powerful tool in their belt. In the context of Israel’s ongoing genocide, anti-woke rhetoric mostly comes from counter-protestors, columnists and well-intentioned (but misplaced liberal allyship. As theintended effectof a sustained conservative backlash against left-wing criticism, it serves to conceal the reality of who is actually being censored. Worse, it sets the stage for bad-faith negotiation under the pretense that both sides are free to speak. But this illusion cannot be maintained. Thanks to Canada’s senseless and total defence of Israel, it’s hard to miss who is being silenced. Look around; there can be no neutral ‘both-sides’ dialogue with Zionist influencers likeMontana Tucker, who patrol encampments trying to film context-less, edited sound bites with the intent to doxx and demonize students. There can be no objective interviews with journalists caving under the influence ofpressure campaignsopenly operating on behalf of Israel. Interviews in which their articles prefer quotes calling unaffiliated protests“celebrations of the heinous murder of Jews”instead of responsibly describing the encampment’s outspoken contingent ofJewish supporters(often wearing “Jews for Palestine” t-shirts and their strict anti-discrimination agreement (painted on a massive sign at the entrance . And there can be no safe space for negotiation under the state-sanctioned surveillance of the RCMP’s brutal CRU (formerly C-IRG paramilitary unit. This might not sound like your idea of Canadian liberal democracy, but just take a look at the state we’re supporting. Israel is itself a goliath of censorship at home and abroad. Undergag orders, its newspapers redact any text concerning the unlawful detainment of Palestinians, and its high-ranking officials have recently beenexposedfor stalking and threatening former ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. This is real state-sanctioned censorship under the jurisdiction of a well-documentedwar criminal. This is the threat Palestinians have been up against for decades. Israel is not Canada, but political and popular support for Israeli policies are a litmus test for the health of our own democracy. As theCanadian Dimensionpointed out in their thorough critique of CBC’s biased pro-Israel reporting: Despite its several capitulations to HRC, highlighted by the Martineau affair, the whistleblower’s revelations, and Farawi’s pre-October 7 investigation, CBC is still accused by most conservative politicians as being hopelessly unfair in its coverage of Israel. The conclusion to be drawn is that no amount of appeasement will ever be enough. If it sounds to you like I’m just reversing right-wing rhetoric, you’re right. The woke mob is an aggrandized spectre and a projection of the Right’s own tendencies. Its symbolic purpose is to conceal the threat posed by the insatiable machine of distortion, misrepresentation and silencing conducted by agents who have already made up their minds about Palestine. The endgame of positioning left-wing students as the antithesis of free speech was always to take away actual freedom of speech. In order to confront injustice we must reclaim our ability to call out this censorship, and somehow scrape out platforms to voice resistance — online, on campus, in public and in the halls of institutional power. This is an overwhelming task, but thankfully, the pro-Palestine movement is already succeeding. By staying silent behind a wall of clearly articulated demands, campus protestors are paradoxically fighting to be heard. This strategy will work because it recognizes that when Carry and Bacon offer a “process to engage,” their “respectful and robust discussion” is only that. By participating, protestors risk losing their voices entirely. It is frustrating to waste time wading through social media clips and empty discourse. As of today, June 6, Palestine has been occupied for over 76 years. Genocide has been ongoing for 35 weeks. There has never been any time to waste or space for great compromise. Protestors cannot risk being censored or diffused. They will not show their faces, because this movement already has faces: over 15,000 murdered children, including six-year-oldHind Rajabwho was killed in her family’s car by Israeli forces, along with the two paramedics sent to save her. And living faces: Ahmad Sa’adat, Issam Aruri, Bisan Owda, the49 journalistsin Israeli custody, outspoken Palestinianscholars, doctors, poets, parents, refugees, diaspora and on and on and on. More words defending the encampment aren’t necessary. But as violence continues to escalate beyond belief in Gaza, protests and their tactics must escalate as well. If you find yourself frustrated by a roadblock or a disruption on campus, irritated by a TikTok or a Tweet, or wondering why these students seem so resistant to negotiation – remember what they’re up against. Even better, remember what they re fighting for. It s easy for the UBC administration to look like the reasonable adults in the room. And they’re not entirely wrong — conversation and democratic processes can be useful first steps toward meaningful action. But talk cannot beonlytalk, and conversation can’t happen until both sides are allowed a voice. Each time UBC patiently asks to engage in dialogue, they ignore the fact that protestors have already spoken. Like children throwing a tantrum, they plug their ears, shut their eyes and pretend not to hear. Disclosure: Anna has participated in the pro-Palestinian movement on campus.

rice_thresher_2024_35,"ByPedro Ribeiro4/9/24 11:02pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Recently, the Thresher Editorial Board published aneditorial criticizingthe Honor Council sdecision to allow confidential accusations by students. While their editorial does bring some valid points, it is in many ways misinformed about the Honor Council process. I have been involved in the Council for (soon to be four years, and, in my time as part of the Council’s leadership, I have been interviewed by the Thresher numerous times. Perhaps exactly because of the Council officers’ availability to be interviewed at any time, I was especially dismayed by this mischaracterization of the Council process. First, the editorial contains outright falsehoods, such as the claim that we lack “rules specifying until when a violation can be reported.” We do have such rules — violations must be reported within 90 days. Indeed, the statute of limitations is in the very first article of ourprocedures. Similarly, the Thresher states that students are presumed guilty in the Council process — a posit that is not only factually false but also rebutted by the fact that, thisyear, over 50% of students who contested their accusation were found “not in violation” of the Honor Code and many others had their cases dropped. (Most students, however, rightfully take ownership for their actions . Other criticisms simply lack context. For instance, the Thresher argues that our policy of not allowing students to speak to their professors about their cases is overly burdensome. Yet they neglect to mention the rule goes both ways (professorsare also barred from discussing cases with students exactlybecausewe want to prevent animosity between professors and students that could negatively affect students’ performance in class. Our rule about evidence followsfederal lawto protect students privacy and students have to send just one email for us to grant them access to the evidence. Perhaps the greatest issue with the Thresher editorial, however, is how it neglects all the great work that the Honor Council has done. In the past three years, the Honor Council has restarted new student orientations,restructuredsyllabito be more clear to students, standardized honor codepolicies and definitionsacross classes, fought to keepunproctored exams, created “warnings” for relatively minor violations that don’t affect students’ records, changed procedures to end near-automaticsuspensions, madeCouncil training more stringentand clarifieduniversity plagiarism policy. All of these measures, along with the countless hours our members put in to create outreach events and adjudicate cases, have led to about a40%decreasein the yearly number of accusations compared to the beginning of my time in the Council. That is not to say that all the editorial board’s criticisms are without merit, however. Changes to the Alternative Resolution, which the Thresher characterizes as a plea bargain, have been brought up unsuccessfully several times. I think the suggestion for confidentiality to be granted on a case-by-case basis is certainly reasonable, too. Indeed, I think that fair criticism of the Honor Council is great: Such criticism has led us to change many of our policies for the better (including, for one, how we notify students of pending violations . We need more members who are dedicated to upholding Honor at Rice. For those who desire to see changes in the Honor System, I encourage you to run for Rice’soldest student government. Only with more diverse views in our ranks will we be able to make even better policies for the student body. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_101,"“Depart to serve better thy country and thy kind.” This is the charge that Harvard University gives to you. You encounter it every time you pass through Dexter Gate, where those words are inscribed. As a graduate myself, I have read them many times and have spent four decades striving to live up to them. Now it’s your time to honor the trust that Harvard has placed in you. Harvard has trained centuries of leaders who have uplifted humanity through science, the arts, business, and politics. Your predecessors committed themselves to active participation in our civic life, serving and sacrificing for the sake of others. Carry the torch that is now being passed on to you and build a future that unites us. As you embark on this next chapter of your life, give back to our country that has given you so much. Strive to honor the legacies of the remarkable people who graduated from Harvard and wrote our Constitution. Live by the words of John Adams, Class of 1755, who wrote that “Avarice, Ambition, Revenge or Gallantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution as a Whale goes through a Net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People.” Live a life for others. Seek to make tangible differences in the lives of those around you by tutoring youth in the inner city, building a business that creates jobs, or running for public office. Second, support freedom of inquiry. Be ready to constructively debate ideas even in moments of heated disagreement. Engaging people with whom you disagree and pushing yourself to learn from them is the surest path to enlightenment. An ethos of respect for free speech, where all ideas can be debated and considered, is essential to this goal. True progress is fostered by embracing diversity in its highest form: diversity of thought. Third, trust in your ability to shape your own future. Your intellect and resolve will be the keys to your success. Do not allow the color of your skin, the circumstances of your birth, or any other quality over which you lack control to define your aspirations. If you repudiate the flawed and divisive paradigm of a society split into “the oppressed” and “the oppressors,” and instead embrace the notion that you control your own destiny, you will have the greatest opportunity to excel. Finally, appreciate the role you play in society as a leader. People will look to you to be constructive in your rhetoric and problem-solving approach. Protesting and shouting sloppy political slogans are beneath you. Channel your passions towards partnerships and persuasion. Societal change will require the buy-in and support of those around you. Coming to the table with a constructive attitude will produce better results than a combative one. There is serious work ahead of us, and serious people must do it. We cannot afford a generation of activists who gripe about their own situation instead of diligently working to find solutions. And we do not need blind followers who go along with the crowd claiming adherence to rigid and divisive ideologies. We need leaders and doers who can engage constructively across differences through deliberation and debate, and who understand that our nation’s success has been — and will be — driven by our passion for excellence and a commitment to the public good. As you prepare to graduate, walk through Dexter Gate one final time. Pay attention to the words that soar above you. As Harvard alumni, you have not just earned a college degree. You have taken upon yourself an obligation to better serve communities and the country that has given you so much. Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 is the founder, chief executive officer, and co-chief investment officer of Citadel LLC and the namesake of the Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Griffin Financial Aid Office at Harvard College."
crimson_2024_47,"Selling out. The words leave a sour taste in our mouths, and probably for good reason. Working for Goldman Sachs might not be intellectually fulfilling. A job at McKinsey will be hard. And a contract with Meta probably won’t give you that warm-and-fuzzy feeling that tells you you’re doing something good for the world. But you will make money. Truckloads of it. That is, after all, the whole point of selling out! You would have every right to spend that money however you want. It’ll be well-deserved, hard-earned cash, and should you choose to indulge in luxuries that make you and your loved ones happy, I wouldn’t blame you. Perhaps there’s another way to “sell out,” though. A better way. If, instead of spending every dollar you make on yourself, you put even a small fraction of your paycheck towards fixing our world’s many problems, selling out might be the best thing you can do. You heard me right: the best thing you can do. Better than becoming a public defender. Better than campaigning for your favorite politician. Better even than starting your own nonprofit. Here’s why. A single year’s salary — even 10 percent of that — from a high-paying hedge fund job could help offset thousands of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere or protect tens of thousands of children from fatal diseases like malaria. Put simply, you could alleviate a lot of suffering — and save a lot of lives. Analyses on donating to charity say you could save a life foras little as $3,500. To a broke college student scrambling for laundry money, that number might sound like a lot. But we’re playing the long game here. Harvard’s wealthiest graduates have incomes in the hundreds of millions. Steve A. Ballmer ’77, the College’s richest alum, will make a dizzying one billion dollars this year from Microsoft dividendsalone. One billion dollars divided by $3,500? 285,000. Sum up the annual deaths in America from school shootings, drownings, HIV, natural disasters, car accidents, diabetes, leukemia, breast, skin, and brain cancer, and you barely crack 200,000. Add in pneumonia, the flu, and obesity, and finally you reach a number closer to 285,000. And that’s just one guy’s yearly dividend returns. Precision can be a bit misleading, and saving lives is hardly an exact science. My point isn’t to pin down any particular number, but to demonstrate that money talks. Loudly. This is not to say only billionaires can effect change. Donating 10 percent of the average U.S. salary (around $60,000 would save just under two lives annually. Giving that amount over 40 years — the average American work life — could avert more than 60 premature deaths. Let’s stretch the hypothetical further. If everybody in the world donated 10 percent oftheir income, charity would collect $12 trillion every year —enough to extinguishextreme poverty, solve world hunger, and provide everyone with clean water — with $11.5 trillion left to spare. Maybe we could use the excess to achievenet zero emissionsand ensure every child hasaccess to education. Now, if you’re like me — yearning for the warm-fuzzies that Meta employment can’t offer — it might help to read thepiles andpiles andpiles of studiesthat say donating to charity makes you (significantly happier. Detractors will say you’re a bad person if you donate for selfish reasons like these. You should tell them a child saved is a child saved. Others might object that working for a place like McKinsey is immoral — maybe because theyproposed budget cutsat the U.S.-Mexico border, or maybe because theyworked with Purdue Pharma, a company slammed for facilitating the opioid epidemic. These are valid concerns, and ones that I share. But give me the chance to say a few things. One, you and I aren’t special. If McKinsey is hell-bent on doing evil, they will, whether or not we’re on their payroll. Two, the ends justify the means. You’d give a baby a vaccine even if the needle made her cry. Similarly, you should want to give thousands of babies vaccines even if you might be contributing to bad business practices on the margins. Or three, just work somewhere not named McKinsey. A well-paid job doesn’t need to be unethical. We Harvard students are uniquely privileged. You can’t tell just anyone to find a gig that pays millions. If you attend Harvard, though, you aren’t just anyone, especially in the eyes of employers drooling over the college on your degree. I really don’t mean to sound hubristic. For better or for worse, it’s a fact of the world that high-paying employers devote a great deal of their recruiting attention to the products of a select few institutions. And Harvard is one of them. Ultimately, none of us — Harvard graduate or not — can build utopia by ourselves. But each baby step will get us ever closer. I urge you: Make your millions, but still, tread carefully. It will be easy — so incredibly easy — to bind yourself to wealth with golden handcuffs and forget the many, many things your money can do for the world. So sell out. But when you do, stay vigilant. With great power comes great responsibility. Chanden A. Climaco ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Mower Hall."
crimson_2024_10,"Updated January 2, 2024, at 7:15 p.m. Harvard President Claudine Gay resigned Tuesday afternoon, after fierce criticism of the University’s response to the Hamas attack on Israel and backlash from her disastrous congressional testimony spiraled into allegations of plagiarism and doubts about her personal academic integrity. Gay’s tenure — of just six months and two days — is the shortest in Harvard’s history. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will lead in the interim until a new president is selected. Her decision to resign effective immediately, which was first reported by The Crimson, marked a stunning downfall for Gay, Harvard’s first Black president and former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — announced that it would begin the presidential search process “in due course.” Though the email did not specify a timeline or announce the formation of a search committee, the process is expected to include soliciting feedback from Harvard affiliates. A source close to Gay said she made her decision to resign last week. In an email Tuesday afternoon, Gay wrote that she chose to resign following discussions with members of the Harvard Corporation. “It has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual,” Gay wrote. Gay, 53, added that she will continue to serve on Harvard’s faculty. In a follow up email just minutes later, the Corporation confirmed Gay’s resignation and thanked her for her service to the University. “Her own message conveying her intention to step down eloquently underscores what those who have worked with her have long known – her commitment to the institution and its mission is deep and selfless,” the Corporation wrote. In a statement to The Crimson, former Harvard President and Gay’s predecessor Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that the announcements saddened him. “Claudine is a person of great intellect, integrity, vision and strength. She had much to contribute not just to Harvard, but to all of higher education. I regret that she will not have that opportunity,” Bacow wrote. Gay took office as the University’s 30th president on July 1, just two days after the Supreme Court ruled against Harvard in a landmark decision that effectively ended the use of race-conscious admissions practices. At the time, the future of Harvard’s admissions seemed to be the central focus of her presidency, which was expected to last for more than a decade. That all changed on Oct. 7. Gay faced national backlash over the University’sinitial responseto the Israel-Hamas war, which did not directly condemn Hamas or address acontroversial pro-Palestine statementsigned by more than 30 student groups. Gay confronted scandal after scandal during her brief tenure at the helm of Harvard, making national headlines again following her congressional testimony about antisemitism on college campuses and the emergence of allegations of plagiarism in her scholarship. All the while, Gay faced intense pressure from external voices calling for her removal or resignation, including Harvard donor Bill A. Ackman ’88, Rep. Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y. , and conservative activist Christopher F. Rufo. “It has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor — two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am — and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus,” Gay wrote in her email Tuesday. The announcement comes just three weeks after the Corporationannounced unanimous supportfor Gay after “extensive deliberations” following the congressional hearing. Gay is now the second university president who testified at the hearing to resign. University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill resigned just days after her testimony. In the last month, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce opened acongressional investigationinto antisemitism at Harvard. On Dec. 20, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced that it wouldexpand its investigationinto the plagiarism allegations against Gay and suggested it could jeopardize the University’s accreditation and federal funding. Harvard was in the process of providing the committee with aslew of requested documentsrelated to the allegations before Gay’s resignation. Donors, too, have been both privately and publiclyhalting their financial contributionsto Harvard. Philanthropy accounts for nearly half of the University’s annual revenue, and the donor backlash sparkedserious internal concernamong Harvard’s fundraising staff. Gay’s decision to step down elevated Garber, the University’sprovost since 2011, to the role of interim president. Garber has served on the faculty at the Harvard Medical School, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As provost, Garber manages cross-school initiatives, overseeing university academics, employment, research, international affairs, and special projects like the Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery Initiative. As interim president, Garber will face the difficult task of guiding Harvard through one of its most turbulent periods in nearly two decades. Garber, who is Jewish, will also be charged with uniting a campus that remains bitterly divided over the fighting in Israel and Gaza. Garber wrote in a statement on Tuesday that as interim president he will focus on “advancing our mission and helping to heal and strengthen a university that I cherish.” “There is much to be done, and while today has been a difficult day, I know what this community can accomplish together,” he added. “I am confident we will overcome challenges we face and build a brighter future for Harvard.” —Staff writer Emma H.

stanforddaily_2024_35,"Two members of The Daily were arrested early this morning in connection with an attempted pro-Palestine occupation of the president and provost’s office in Main Quad. One was present to report on the protest for The Daily and was detained in violation of his First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights. We are appalled at this threat to the freedom of the press. The second Daily member who was arrested was there in her personal capacity, not to report for The Daily. Protesters entered the building at 5:30 a.m. and barricaded themselves inside, blocking doors and windows. The Daily’s reporter remained inside, with a press pass and wearing Stanford Daily attire, to cover the protest and potential arrests. He remained in communication with another reporter, who was outside the building, and with editors in The Daily’s newsroom. The Daily received advance notice of the protest around midnight on June 4, but without details on its location or nature. Organizers told reporters to meet them at a central location before a protest they described as likely to lead to arrests. Two reporters received permission from editors to cover the demonstration, and were actively communicating with editors prior to and during the protest. Editors explicitly instructed our reporter to comply with any instructions from police officers. Police entered the building shortly after 8 a.m. and arrested protesters, as well as the Daily reporter, who told arresting officers he was in the building to report on the protest and displayed his press pass. Police handcuffed protesters with zip ties and loaded them into vans. The Daily reporter was also handcuffed and transported in a van to the Santa Clara County Jail, where he — along with protesters — was booked and cited. Our reporter is being falsely imprisoned on $20,000 bail, in violation of his rights as a reporter. His arrest constitutes a threat to the freedom of the press, including protection from unreasonable search and seizure, and we are disappointed in the actions of officers and the University. The Daily is committed to independent and comprehensive student journalism. The Daily has establishedguidelinesto preserve the editorial independence of our newsroom. The Daily does not prevent reporters and editors from engaging in peaceful protest, but participation is a conflict of interest. Daily staffers who participate in protests are barred from reporting or editing related coverage. The second Daily staffer arrested at the president’s office is a news managing editor. She has not been involved in any coverage related to the Israel-Gaza war due to an established conflict of interest on this issue. Shedid not disclose to executive editors her intent to participate in today’s occupation. While we have not spoken with the editor since her arrest, appropriate action will be taken.

state_press_2024_2,"The University is not an isolated island; it exists within a broader community touched by the same societal threats and challenges as what lies off campus. ASU must extend its duty of care beyond campus boundaries and proactively inform students about incidents in surrounding areas, especially areas considered a staple of the college culture. The backdrops for January s two off-campus shootings included Fat Tuesday, a popular bar on Mill Avenue, and El Paisano Market, a staple for late-night bites near the GLV. While not technically on campus, both locations serve as popular hangouts for the average ASU student looking to blow off steam. READ MORE:Shots fired outside Fat Tuesday on Mill Avenue Despite reports of the shootings, many students remained generally uninformed and unaware of the campus-adjacent gun violence. Izaac Carlebach, a sophomore studying management and supply chain management, lives adjacent to El P’s Market on Lemon Street. He heard about the shooting from a friend. I wasn’t surprised (ASU didn t say anything, Carlebach said. When it is off campus, the University doesn t want to associate themselves with something like that. ASU has a critical role in considering students physical and emotional well-being beyond common academic pursuits. The University does inform students of on-campus danger, although through only one notable resource. Students can create aLiveSafe mobile appprofile specific to their campus to receive alerts about perceived threats. They can also request rides from Safety Escort Services and easily contact ASU police through the app. Jason Weber, ASU Police crime prevention coordinator, said in a statement ASUPD is monitoring off-campus crime, and collaborates with other local crime prevention and investigation groups, including the East Valley Crime Prevention group and Arizona Crime Prevention Association. We have been monitoring what is occurring off and near campus, as that can have an effect on the campus population, Weber said in the statement. We regularly work with our counterparts in law enforcement from crime prevention initiatives to investigations. The University bears on its shoulders the moral obligation to provide students with the necessary information needed to navigate campus and adjacent shared spaces. This must include informing students of the existence and nature of gun violence in student-populated areas off campus. I have friends that go to El P’s, Carlebach said. A lot of students go there, and even if it is not on campus, it is a part of the culture. The safety and well-being of students on and off campus should be considered paramount for University. Ignoring, dismissing and downplaying incidents of gun violence erodes trust between administration and the student body. It almost feels like they could be trying to hide it, said Grace Hodge, a junior studying conservation biology and ecology. It feels sneaky. The lack of transparency undermines a sense of community, leaving students isolated and vulnerable. Addressing off-campus incidents of violence openly fosters trust between students and the University, encouraging them to make informed decisions. While I don t feel unsafe on campus because there are police everywhere, I think they should have said something, Taison Roddy, a senior studying biological science, said. I will read Tempe Police reports now and then, but I thought I would hear it from the University. At least I’d want to. Megan Parr, a freshman studying secondary education, takes her safety very seriously when off-campus and wishes the University was more communicative about threats in the surrounding area. It rattles you, especially someone like me who is hypersensitive about safety, Parr said. I want to know these things so that I know better. Hearing about those things is scary but important. If ASU is to use LiveSafe as its primary and effective form of communication with students, its reach needs to extend beyond the boundaries of what is considered on campus. Instead, the University should take into account Tempe s most beloved student spots in University-wide reporting. When the University addresses off-campus gun violence, it empowers students to make responsible decisions that benefit their lives. Students planning next semester’s housing, commuting to classes, or participating in regular activities would be better armed and equipped with the knowledge of potential risks, allowing them to take the necessary precautions. I depend on those LiveSafe alerts when I am on campus, said Raina Mueller, a freshman studying psychology. Those bomb threats, the scary things that happen, we need to know so we can figure it out ourselves. The University s obligation to inform students transcends the physical boundaries of campus. Embracing transparency around gun violence issues adjacent to campus is imperative and represents an investment in the trust, safety, and well-being of ASU students.

thetech_mit_2024_4,"After the Israeli military killed 35,000 Palestinians, manyMIT students answered the call for justice and peace, setting up peaceful encampments on the grounds of this school, asking for divestment from a foreign military in an effort to ramp up pressure to end an ongoing genocide in Gaza. We, a coalition of MIT alumni spanning multiple generations, nationalities, and racial backgrounds, including Jewish, Israeli, and Palestinian alumni, could not be more proud of this generation of students. The Scientists Against Genocide Encampment (SAGE has challenged the administration and the broader MIT community to do better and live true to the Institute’s aspiration to campaign for a better world. SAGE members embodied values MIT has previously honored. One such honor, theBridge Builder Award, was granted to Austin Cole in 2023 for his study of civil disobedience during the U.S. civil rights movement 1 . Ironically, Cole was among the students suspended for their participation in the encampment and related demonstrations. Students are lauded for their commitment to studying justice, peaceful protest, and civil disobedience. Still, when students put those lessons into action, they are met with foreign-sponsored provocations, disciplinary actions, eviction, and finally, arrest. SAGE and the protesters at the encampment follow a strong tradition of MIT civil disobedience. In fact, between 2017 and 2019, MIT granted theDisobedience Award, which operated under the belief that “you don’t change the world by doing what you’re told” 2 . Recipients includedDr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Professor Marc Edwards, who faced harassment and ridicule for bringing attention to Flint’s water crisis 3 . MIT loves rule-breakers, but only when they fit the Institute’sidealimage, valuing creativity and humor over substance. Around campus, we can find the memorialization of historical and famous hacks. Still, we won’t see any reference to the multiple meaningful campus protests and demonstrations like the ones against the Vietnam War or the South African apartheid—which birthed the now-suspended MIT Coalition Against Apartheid. Despite being ostracized and ignored by an MIT administration that never divested from unethical ties to the South African apartheid regime, those rule-breakers were pushing MIT in the right moral direction. More recently, the administration has demonstrated a clear moral commitment to justice. Within 24 hours of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, then-President L. Rafael Reif suspended theMIT Skoltech program4 . SAGE and its allies are asking for less than MIT’s response to the Russian government’s war on Ukraine.They—and we—are asking to cut ties with Israel’s military, a small ask given thatmore children have died in Gazain the past six months than in four years of conflict worldwide 5 . The irony is not lost on us, MIT alumni, or prospective students looking to MIT for their future. As the main representatives of MIT, at this moment, we cannot in good conscience promote MIT as a place for brilliant minds, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds, to attend and where they will experience the freedom to express themselves, thrive, and where they can feel safe. And while we debate the merits and efficacy of economic divestments and academic boycotts, it is worth remembering that every single university in Gaza has been demolished and bombed by Israeli forces. MIT benefits from its students rebellious and innovative behavior, rejection of limits, and pushing of the envelope. If MIT actually wants to build aBetter World6 , should it not support its students, especially those crying out for that world to be a just and fair one, and encourage the next generation of students to follow in these footsteps? As MIT Alumni, we write in strong support of our Palestinian, Jewish, and Israeli students and their allies and their demands to end all MIT research ties with the Israeli military. We write in support of the students who, as stated in theirpledge7 , stand againstapartheid8 , againstland grabs9 , against the burning of olive trees andfarmland10 , and against manufactured famines; who stand against genocide."
ubyssey_2024_10,"April 2, 2024 Written byArig al Shaibah Editor’s Note: This article was originally published inThe Conversationon March 31 Dr. Arig al Shaibah is the associate vice-president, equity & inclusion and an honorary associate professor of Educational Studies. The higher education system plays anessential role in advancing sustainable development goals. These range from providing knowledge and innovative solutions to educating and equipping generations to navigate the future. Universities that meaningfully integrate equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI into their teaching, research, service and leadership stand to improve their impact on increasingly complex social, economic and environmental challenges. This matters enormously in today’s diverse and globally connected society. I have worked as a senior equity leader in four Canadian public universities in the last two decades. I am concerned about two key aspects surrounding taking action on equity, diversity and inclusion: ensuring senior equity leaders have sufficient authority to implement changes, and shifting away from a “diversity crisis mode” of planning. Despite decades of efforts to advance EDI in universities, some scholarshave questioned the pace and impact of progress to date. Some recent advances in equitably hiring faculty have been due to leveraging human rights legislation. For example, there wasa 2016 Canadian Human Rights Settlement Agreementand subsequent 2019 addendum requiring equitable representationin the Canada Research Chair program. This has had a significant impact on hiring a broader gendered and racialized diversity ofresearch chairs between 2016 and 2022. Provincial human rights code provisions have enabled universitiesto accelerate recruiting scholars who have been underrepresented due to systemic inequities. These interventions reflect compliance with legislation. But they don’t affect culture and system changes. These are needed to eliminate biases and barriers that reproduce inequities. Short-sighted solutions focused on compliance are due, in part, to acyclical diversity crisis model of planning. Universities seem perpetually trapped in this. A reactive mode of planning starts with an incident of hate-motivated violence or another watershed event. Such an event typically reveals anew historical or contemporary systemic inequities. These moments can come in the aftermath of events with a global reach — like themovement to meaningfully address anti-Black racismafter the killing of George Floyd in 2020. But most of these moments arise from local contexts and campus events, like a string of departures of racialized faculty members sparking calls for improving support forminoritized scholars. What follows such moments are often reactionary and hastily developed institutional statements of commitments — and largely symbolic responses. These include some spontaneous institutional efforts that soon fall by the wayside due to their isolated and ill-conceived nature. These efforts, even if well-intentioned, have a demoralizing effect on campus communities. They also contribute to disillusionment among a diversity of students, faculty and staff about the university’s commitment and capacity to meaningfully advance EDI. That said, with courageous leadership and institutional readiness, these peak events can also catalyze important and lasting responses. In 2022, I authored a report onreport on building race-conscious institutionsfor Universities Canada. The guide offers a framework focused on: (1 Educational access and employment equity; (2 governance and accountability; (3 academic and educational content and learning context; and (4 interpersonal and intergroup relations and climate. It emphasizes the importance of having a senior equity leader with specialized knowledge and expertise to lead EDI strategic priorities. It also discusses the importance of leaders’ authority and span of control to foster a university-wide culture of accountability and ownership. In 2019, Universities Canadasurveyed its 96 membersabout their EDI administrative structures. It revealed how universities rely on three typicalorganizational formsto implement equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives: In the last five years, there has been a proliferation of senior equity roles in universities. An internet search I conducted of the organizational structures of theU15 Group of Canadian Research Universitiesrevealed that 13 had senior administrative officers with titles or mandates explicitly referencing EDI. They report to a president, provost, deputy provost and/or vice-president. Only five of these roles existed in 2019, at the time of the Universities Canada survey. Among the 13 current senior equity roles, three have a portfolio divisional model and report to the president (and as such are cabinet-level roles . The other 10 senior equity roles reflect a unit-based model. These staff are vice-provosts, associate-provosts and/or associate vice-presidents. Nearly 70 per cent of these roles came into existence after 2019. Two of the three cabinet-level roles were inaugurated in the last two years. A further scan reveals that, since 2019, at least five other non-U15 schools have also recruited cabinet-level roles overseeing a portfolio of units. This suggests a possible promising trend towards greater authority and span of control for senior equity leads. However organizational structures evolve, it will be essential to ensure senior equity leaders are sufficiently influential across academic and administrative portfolios — meaning it’s important they report both to provosts and presidents. A shift is needed away from reactive diversity crisis-driven planning to proactive mission-driven EDI planning. Universities must not only invest in dedicated senior equity leader roles with specialized knowledge and expertise. They must also ensure equity roles are resourced and empowered for optimal success.

stanforddaily_2024_23,"Two autumns ago, I joined The Daily because I wanted to make my Stanford experience into something with purpose. It will forever be my honor to have covered issues likeTitle IX advocacy,religiouslife, theShoppingExpress,affirmativeaction,leadershiptransitionsanduniversitygovernance. The journey, certainly a challenging one, taught me that journalism for the greater good is journalism at its best. It gives a voice to the voiceless. It is the best safeguard against closed-door decisionmaking. When journalism thrives, our democratic society thrives with it. This matters more than ever at Stanford. Our community is confrontingcitizenship,democracyanddiversityin unprecedented ways — during a presidential election year, no less. As Stanford plays a vital role in cultivating the leaders of tomorrow, we have the duty to ask ourselves the following question: How can we remain a democratic society if we let authorities remain unchallenged? Our university’s democracy was put to the test last month. Stanford administrators have voiced theirfull supportforcriminal and disciplinary proceedingsagainsta Daily reporterthat diligently covered theBuilding 10 occupation. His presence was vital to provide an independent account of the actions of rioters and law enforcement, but Stanford’s top decision makers acted punitively against him even though he identified himself and complied with law enforcement directives. The University is endangering the future of independent student journalism on campus. I am scared for my fellow Daily writers who are to pursue coverage of campus politics. I also fear that students who might have otherwise gladly joined the paper now would not. In a May Faculty Senate meeting, President Sallerclaimedhe only holds authority to suspend or expel students who directly threaten public safety. But the University supports criminal proceedings against a Daily reporter who does not present an “immediate threat to the health and safety of campus,” as the University itselfacknowledged. In addition, using an office as untransparent as theOffice of Community Standards (OCS against the reporter for doing his First Amendment duty is nothing short of ironic. A reporter’s duty is to shed light on institutional processes, but the University is now using those processes to punish him. The University is scaring students away from The Daily. This deprives the Stanford community of the robust journalism they need on issues like low pay and discrimination in ourfinancial aidandadmissionsoffices, thehorrific conditionsof UG2’s subcontracted workers and the University’s appalling inaction on campusIslamophobiaandantisemitism. A university that truly stands by its policy record would never shy away from transparency and independent scrutiny. As a student, I find that Stanford’s punitive measures against the Daily reporter are fundamentally at odds with the very democratic values it preaches to us. Stanford claims a commitment to helping us develop the skills necessary to engage with one another in a democratic society through theCivic, Liberal and General Education (COLLEGE courses that all freshmen are required to take. ThedesignationofDemocracy Dayas an academic holiday tells us that the University values student engagement in the political process. The Faculty Senate formed thefree speech committee(which lacks student representation to send us the message that professors are making serious attempts at clarifying the policies meant to foster “free inquiry and the open exchange of ideas on campus.” Stanford reminds us that our civic engagement is of the utmost importance, but at the same time deprives us of the journalism that makes us a properly informed campus citizenry. Stanford should be a place wherethe winds of freedom blow, and that occurs only if it stops putting the community’s premier, student-run publication on the chopping block. Our very democratic way of life calls for asking difficult questions and having even more difficult conversations. Rigorous inquiry and debate, evidently, cannot proceed if the citizenry is kept in the dark about how their lives are governed. Stanford must live up to its democratic promises. The University must acknowledge that, as 26 free press organizations havestressed, the reporter was “acting in good faith to serve the public’s interest in timely coverage of newsworthy events.” Criminal charges would set a disastrous precedent for campus discourse. Now would be the time for the University to support amnesty for the Daily reporter. The University needs to earn back its democratic standing. Sebastian Strawser ‘26 is an Opinions contributor.

crimson_2024_117,"On June 21, we were placed on probation by Harvard for nonviolently protesting the ongoing genocide of Palestinians. Since October, we have witnessed Israel commit brutal atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza. Our news feeds have been inundated with images of city blocks leveled by Israeli carpet bombing and Palestinian parents clutching the lifeless bodies of their children. As graduate students, our studies are haunted by the destruction of every university in Gaza and the martrying of hundreds of our colleagues by Israel in relentlessacts of scholasticide. Our work is punctuated by reports of the Israeli military’s unspeakable crimes. Witnessing this genocide has prompted widespread pro-Palestine action on our campus. Protestors have responded to calls fromWorkers in Palestineand theBirzeit University Union of Professors and Employeeswith acampus-wide divestment campaignthat demands an end toHarvard’s financial complicityin this ongoing depravity. But at every turn, Harvard has chosen to punish pro-Palestine students and student workers through disciplinary processes that have ranged from opaque to downright absurd. In mid-May, we each received letters from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Administrative Board alleging we “were observed taking part in an unauthorized encampment occupation” — Harvard sGaza Solidarity encampment— that had “caused significant disruption.” GSAS has now placed us on a one-year probation for these charges, though it remains totally unclear what specific policies the encampment, or we as individuals, violated. It now seems that the administration — and, in a disturbingly McCarthyist turn, some of the faculty tasked with disciplining us — understand political dissent to be a violation of policy. At our verdict meetings we were not presented with any documentation whatsoever of how we, as individuals, disrupted Harvard’s campus. By subjecting us to this disciplinary process, the University has implicated its students in materials that could be subject to congressional subpoenas and could have been used as evidence if criminal charges were brought against protesters — a move that is ethically dubious at best and morally reprehensible at worst. Ultimately, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciencesfollowed the College’s lead, handing down sanctions unprecedented in recent history and vacant of due process. Notably, after the May 14 email from interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber ’76 urged the school administrative boards to “address cases expeditiously under existing precedent and practice,” other graduate schools at Harvard appear not to have pursued serious sanctions. The severity of the College and GSAS sanctions stands in stark contrast with the actions of their peers. In any other employment setting, the cases presented against us would not withstand scrutiny. If the Ad Boards purport to encourage reflection and learning, then these processes would have been instructional. Instead, we found them deeply confusing, biased, and unfair. Harvard’s administration, the media, and political leaders have demonized our movement, rendering even the idea of “due process” utter fiction. The University never articulated how the specific actions of individual students involved with the encampment warranted sanction, instead punishing alleged protesters indiscriminately for the supposedinfractions of the encampmentas a whole. This failure seems to be a tool of strategic ambiguity employed by the University to enable the arbitrary and authoritarian enforcement of disciplinary policies according to an antidemocratic rule book that has been weaponized to undermine protest action and free speech on campus since the 1960s. What we have learned from the Ad Board process is that Harvard cares more about pleasing its donors, placating vocal and reactionary public figures, and maintaining its grass than it does the thousands of community members calling for divestment from large-scale human rights abuses. That Harvard is willing to break with existingprecedentand past practice in an obvious instance ofthe Palestine exceptionto free speech. And that Harvard prioritizes economic returns (unsuccessfully over its students and student workers, acting as a corporation first and an educational institution second. Just two years ago, Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow raised a Ukrainian flag over Harvard Yard after what he called a “capricious and senseless” Russian invasion. Naively, we understood this to mean that the University opposes all capricious and senseless violence. Instead, Harvard has remained silent as Israel commits war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank funded in part by the University’s investments and, conveniently, established a policy ofnear-institutional neutralityrather than addressing its 50 billion dollar conglomerate of genocide-enabling hedge funds. For Harvard to now punish students for protesting these investments is a disgraceful absurdity. It reinforces Harvard’s allegiance to a white supremacist world order that only recognizes war crimes when they are committed against peopleracialized as white— an attitude equally apparent in Harvard’s responses to protests against injustices in South Africa and Vietnam. As we reminded Ad Board members, the disciplinary cases brought before them represent the nonviolent efforts of students protesting material, institutional, and cultural complicity in settler-colonial oppression and genocide. Such dissent is emblematic of a thoughtful and critical student body, anda testament to (some Harvard facultythat their students are astute and resolute enough to turn the academic theory we have learned, from Fanon to Said to Trouillot, into praxis. A university that disciplines its students and student workers for peacefully criticizing its administration, its investments, or its leadership betrays its mission and purpose. If the University’s administrators think arbitrary punishments will stop us from raising our voices against one of the gravest moral catastrophes of our time, then they severely underestimate the commitment of our community to Palestinian liberation.

stanforddaily_2024_1,"It’s about time we Stanford graduate workers get a raise. TheStanford Graduate Workers Union(SGWU has been negotiating with University administration for the lastseven monthsover the contract on the working conditions of graduate student workers on campus. We have presented oureconomic demandsto the University. One of our core demands is an immediate and substantial raise for all graduate workers. A fact many graduate workers know all too well is that, even though Stanford stipends compare favorably with peer institutions in absolute terms, our graduate students are actually some of the mostpoorly compensatedwhen adjusted for the high cost of living in the Bay Area.Stanford’s 2023-2024 Ph.D. stipendof $50,616 falls far short of Santa Clara County’s living wage of $68,619, as defined by MIT’sLiving Wage Calculatorfor a single adult with no children. It also falls far short of Santa Clara County’s “Very Low Income Limit” (VLIL of $64,550, established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD . In fact, the difference between the VLIL and minimum stipend at Stanford is greater than virtually all comparable private institutions in the U.S. Minimum stipends at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University actuallyexceedtheir respective VLILs by 15%. This is not exceptional — atJohns Hopkins University,Yale UniversityandBrown University, graduate workers’ minimum stipends exceed their VLILs by 10%, 18% and 25%, respectively. Even compared with institutions with a similarly high cost of living (Columbia University, for instance , the disparity between what graduate workers are paid and a living wage is still higher at Stanford. Beyond the numbers, this reality is confirmed by the lived experiences of graduate workers:long linesat on-campus food pantry events, on-campus rentrising faster than salaries(exacerbated byinflation and workers taking on additional jobs or relying onEmergency Grant-in-Aid Fundsfor basic necessities. In the months-long process of preparing our economic demands, SGWU members persistently vocalized their need for better compensation simply to live their lives with dignity and feel adequately supported as they accomplish their world-class research. Stanford does not pay us what we deserve. Even Stanford’s ownIR&DS surveyin 2022 showed that a quarter of graduate workers experienced food insecurity due to a lack of income. A third avoided seeking medical care due to high costs, and three quarters experienced financial stress, according to the survey, Further, these conditions disproportionately affect graduate workers from low-income or first-generation backgrounds, workers with disabilities and workers with dependents. The conclusion is evidently clear that nothing will be acceptable to graduate workers other than animmediate and substantial raise. A substantial increase in compensation is not only needed, but eminently feasible to win. Between2015 and 2021, while Stanford’s net assets and top executive pay increased by 66% and 67%, respectively, graduate worker compensation increased by only 33%. Stanford routinely receives growth on its$41 billion endowmentat rates far exceeding growth in graduate worker salary. A raise in our pay is not only feasible, but an appropriate allocation of University resources if Stanford truly believes in its mission to provide world-class research and teaching — activities which are impossible without the labor of its graduate workers. As members of SGWU, we call on Stanford to re-allocate its budget and pay us a living wage. Fair compensation is a win-win for everyone. It is essential to Stanford’s avowed mission to attract and retain world-class future scholars, teachers and researchers. Graduate workers like us are the indispensable foundation for the University’s teaching and research ambitions. We are the ones who mentor and teach undergraduates, develop cutting-edge research protocols and drive new topics of study. However, we can only do so if we have what we need to live,which will require an immediate and substantial stipend increase. In recent years, graduate worker unions have seen massive successes in winning substantial raises through collective bargaining agreements at peer institutions. Unions atUChicagoandNorthwesternrecently ratified a 28% raise over the contract’s three-year term, with an immediate raise of 22% in the 2024-2025 academic year. Similarly, the union atJohns Hopkins Universityobtained a 40% raise in the minimum stipend. In May, union membersratified SGWU’s economic platformwith over 1650 affirmative votes. The platform asks the University to immediately raise theminimum stipend by 43.2% to $72,479, and to continue increasing the stipend in subsequent years based on inflation and rent cost. This proposal will free graduate workers from the burden of rent, food insecurity and other financial anxieties. They would instead be able to focus on the important work they came to Stanford to do. Additionally, our proposed economic articles contain provisions for tuition waivers and guaranteed 6-year funding for Ph.D. students. Typically, our advisors pay for Ph.D. students’ stipends, tuition and overhead costs. This creates stress for both students and advisors. Tuition remission and guaranteed funding, taken from the University’s provost funds, can prevent our pay raises from harming our advisors or constraining future Ph.D. cohort sizes. In the face of Stanford’s large endowment, the University, rather than our advisors or our departments, should carry the burden of our pay raises now and in the future. We call on the University’s negotiating team to take our economic platform in the good-faith with which we have presented it and respect the economic needs of graduate workers. We hope for a quick bargaining process that leads to agreement on compensation satisfying the needs of graduate workers. However, if Stanford continues itsstalling and intransigenceat the bargaining table (which has been the norm since negotiations over non-economic terms started last November , we as graduate workers are prepared to take action to win this for ourselves. Over the last year, thousands of us have mobilized through action meetings, rallies, votes and petitions to pressure Stanford, and we are prepared to continue escalation of these actions to secure our demands. The wins of unions at UChicago, Northwestern and Johns Hopkins (all three unions are also affiliated with SGWU’s national union, the United Electrical Workers, or UE were achieved through pressure exerted by the student workers, not as a gift from the universities. In all of these cases, the large pay raises were secured by a majority of the union members signing a pledge to go on strike if their demands were not met at the bargaining table. We, as Stanford graduate workers, are prepared to take the necessary steps to exert similar pressure on the University if they are not willing to treat us with the respect we deserve. We encourage all graduate workers who want to join our fight in this process to attend our weekly union area and Contract Action Teammeetings. Together, we will win!

crimson_2024_51,"With spring break less than a week away, many Harvard students are busy thinking about everything they might do once they leave their dorms. For the Class of 2027, however, something much more important comes just days before classes let out for the spring recess: Housing Day. Housing Day is an annual Harvard tradition that sees upperclassmen storm freshman dorms in Harvard Yard, revealing to eagerly awaiting freshmen which of the twelve upperclassman Houses will become their home for the next three years. These Houses, where sophomores, juniors, and seniors all live and eat together, become irreplaceable centers of community for their inhabitants. Nearly every student has a mental list of their most desired Houses. But regardless of their most preferred home, the greatest Housing Day anxiety held by many students does not concern which specific house they will be assigned —it’s where they hope to avoid being placed. Since the inception of randomized housing, many students fear being placed into Currier, Cabot, or Pforzheimer Houses, all residences on the distant Radcliffe Quadrangle. Naturally, superstitions have developed to avoid placement in the undesirable Quad. The superstitions come to a head the night before Housing Day in the form of “River Run,” an activity that sees freshmen visit their preferred houses along the Charles River to “appease the river gods,” with many freshmen electing to pour libations in the form of alcoholic shots in their desired new homes. Everyone — student, dean, tutor, and administrator alike — knows that anxious freshmen and alcohol can be a recipe for disaster. In the past, Harvard has tried to prevent students from participating in River Run bylocking gate access to non-residents,posting extra Securitas Guards, and even calling for more police patrols on Housing Day eve. All the while, this only emboldened students, who see the increased security as part of the fun itself. Evading guards and finding creative ways to enter houses was a central part of the night. But for years, these increased security measures made River Run more dangerous for everyone involved. Now, the University has backtracked, announcing that swipe access to the houseswill not be revokedthe night before Housing Day. While it might make the experience somewhat less adventurous, it is the right call. Personal experience has shown that students will climb high fences and gates to enter houses without swipe access, among other tactics. During my river run, I climbed a tall brick wall into the back of Quincy House. I was completely sober, and I’ll admit, even that was dangerous. So how much more dangerous is it when a student, after their fourth or fifth shot, tries to climb the spear-tipped fence into Eliot House or scale the concrete library steps of Mather? I have no doubt that students would have continued to participate in River Run no matter how many preventative measures Harvard takes. For the safety of its students, Harvard made the right choice dropping the facade of securing the houses. Short of banning freshmen from leaving their dorm on Wednesday night, it will be almost impossible to prevent students from participating in River Run in some capacity. For this sacred night, Harvard is right to prioritize student safety, and recognize River Run as the integral part of Housing Week that it is, even if the results are imperfect. During River Run, safety and tradition should be foremost — not “security.” The University is best served by opening the gates, dropping the guards, and otherwise staying out of student affairs. Freshmen, I promise you, scaling that fence is not worth it. Swipe access and fewer security guards won’t negate the adventurous experience that you create for yourselves during River Run; the tunnels between the houses will still be wide open for you to explore. Happy running! Mac M. Mertens ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a double concentrator in Classics and History in Mather House."
crimson_2024_3,"Recent events at Harvard have shown just how pressing it is that our discussions of antisemitism remain rooted in history, learning, and conversation. We have seen first-hand what can happen when the discourse about antisemitism falls prey to the temptations to simplify and generalize: Accusations are all too easily instrumentalized for purposes other than the protection of Jews. It is in this context that we write as faculty at the Harvard Divinity School who teach and research on the histories of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In our view, the public discourse on antisemitism at Harvard risks becoming dangerously divorced from life on our campus. When outside voices claim to speak for all Jews at Harvard, they drown out the incredibly diverse range of opinions and experiences among our Jewish students. Campus-specific situations have been forced into a national, pre-set narrative, as the real and persistent problem of antisemitism becomes elided with a politicized debate on the propriety of pro-Palestinian protests. In the process, those rightly concerned with rising antisemitism are pitted against those rightly concerned with rising Islamophobia. As historians of religion, we know all too well the dangers that arise when abstracted polemics overshadow lived realities. Much of the tragic history of Christian anti-Judaism, for instance, has involved the instrumentalization of Jews in debates not really about Jews, often with terrible results for Jewish lives. There is undoubtedly a pressing need to have conversations about antisemitism at Harvard. We feel as though much is lost, however, when the narrative is driven by social media outrage, political point-scoring, and outside forces rather than conversations within our own community. And part of what is lost, in our view, is the importance of the classroom as space to foster such conversations. From the public discourse on antisemitism at Harvard, one would have no idea that any relevant classes are even offered. But last semester alone at the Divinity School, students discussed antisemitism and related issues in classes on Jews and race, modern Jewish thought, and Jewish and German philosophy. Difficult discussions about Christian anti-Judaism were central to courses like “Introduction to the New Testament,” and challenging questions about religious polemic and rivalry with Jews were addressed in courses on the Quran and Islamic history. The enduring impact of antisemitism was explored even within “Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion,” the only course required of all Divinity School students. Harvard has a longhistory of antisemitism. But it also has a long history of faculty who spoke out against it — especially at the Divinity School. In the 1920s, George Foot Moore published “Christian Writers on Judaism” in the Harvard Theological Review — still among the most scathing rebukes of academia’s entrenched habits of Christian anti-Judaism. Moore was also among the few Christians at the time to emphasize the need for a view of “Judaism on its own terms.” Many followed in Moore’s footsteps: Krister O. Stendahl, an expert in the New Testament who was Dean of Harvard Divinity School from 1968 to 1979, was among those on the forefront of Christianity’s grappling with its legacy of antisemitism after the Holocaust. And among Moore’s students was Harry Austryn Wolfson, Class of 1911, the first professor in the United States to serve as a chair devoted singularly to Jewish studies, who advocated for the central importance of the history of Jewish thought — not just for Jews, but for all students. These are hardly obscure figures: They are giants in the field who shaped the academic study of religion at Harvard. They are often cited as exemplars of the Divinity School’s vision of academic excellence, historical rigor, and multireligious inclusion. They ensured the study of religion at Harvard must include difficult conversations about the past roots and present shoots of hatred. In times of extreme uncertainty, it can be especially tempting to abandon the difficult work of learning, teaching, and communal conversation for the quick satisfaction of platitudes and polemics. Call-outs and caricatures attract instant attention on social media. But it is our hope that the new year will afford us space to recommit to the work that the best of our predecessors have modeled for us. Those who decry the diversification of higher education often caricature its so-called “ideology” as a knee-jerk valorization of the oppressed. Such caricatures often cite an imagined binary between oppressor and oppressed, seemingly unaware of pedagogical settings — like the Divinity School — in which non-hierarchical understandings of difference are wrought in the slow, communal, hands-on work of learning and conversation. What such outsider perspectives fail to recognize, however, is precisely an educational culture that is committed to the inclusion of excluded perspectives, knowing that understanding from only one perspective is not really understanding at all. This is the same culture that once empowered scholars like Moore and Stendahl to speak up for Jews, despite not being Jewish themselves and despite teaching at a time when the exclusion of Jews was taken as natural, if not meritocratic. Needless to say, the Divinity School’s vision has not always succeeded. Our reality does not yet live up to our ideals. What many of us do believe, however, is that the hard work is worth it. Simplistic stories may win in the short term, and such stories are surely easier to tell if one ignores local and lived experience, avoiding conversation across differences. Today, it seems as though there are few places where people across political divides — Jews and non-Jews alike — can engage in meaningful conversations about Judaism. Yet our learning spaces across the University remain among the rare places forged for conversations across religious, ethnic, political, and other differences. These spaces are crucial, in our view, for the slow work of tackling difficult topics like antisemitism in challenging times such as these.

wildcat_arizona_2024_0,"Former United States President Donald Trumpandcurrent President Joe Bidenparticipated in thefirst debate of this year’s election cycle on June 27, 2024. Thedebatewas held inAtlanta, Georgiaand hosted byCNN, withJake Tapper and Dana Bashas moderators. A key feature of this debate was that there was no live audience, as CNN wanted viewers at home to form their own opinions on the candidates without audience reactions influencing them. Even further, when one candidate was answering a question, the microphone of the other candidate was muted to prevent them from interjecting. While the rules and moderators were fair and reasonable, the debate still revealed the lack of professionalism in American politics. President Bidenis currently81 years old, andformer President Trumpis currently78.Regardless of the winner, the next president will be theoldestever elected in American history. This was clear from both of their demeanors on stage, especially Biden. In fact, President Biden was met withcriticismand uncertainty due to his performance, as he seemed exhausted and distracted. This factor alone made the debate feel unserious. Despite the clear rules given by the moderators, the former president still managed to find loopholes in the system.Trumpwould often respond to the questions the moderators posed by first responding to whatBidenhad said previously – even thoughTapper and Bashallowed time for the candidates to respond to one another – effectively dodging certain prompts. When asked about climate change, Trumprespondedwith,“Well,let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him.” After ignoring the question from Bash, Bash prompted the former president again with,“38 seconds left, President Trump. Will you take any action as President to slow the climate crisis?”His brief response consisted of “And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually,” even though no statistic was stated. There were more unsupported claims from both the former president and current president, which reinforced that this debate was essentially useless. Trumpthrew around haphazard claims such as “We’re like a Third World nation,” that Biden is destroyingSocial Securityand thatmillions of immigrants are living in luxury hotels while veterans are homeless.Bidenalso responded to prompts without any statistical backing and promoted empty promises, like restoringRoe v. Wade.Both sides seemed to simply be using exaggerated speech directed at the other without actually promoting any tangible solutions to the issues at hand. The issues discussed were largely reminiscent of the 2020 presidential election debates, which, personally, made me feel bored and annoyed with the debate. Since Trump was elected in 2016, it seems as though there is an endless cycle of nonsense being spewed about issues such as abortion, inflation, tax cuts, immigration and climate change legislation. One side wants one thing, and the other is unwilling to accept it. There were more recent topics discussed, like theongoingwar between Israel and Palestineand thewarbetweenUkraine and Russia. When probed on the humanitarian crisis inGaza, Trump gave an alarming response. “As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel’s the one that wants to go – he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job,”Trump said. In a war wheremore than 30,000 innocentPalestinianshave been killed, I am not sure what “finish the job” means. This claim is arguably encouraging terrorism and genocide, and is coming from someone who alsoincited aninsurrectionon January 6th, 2021. All the while, Trump stated that millions of terrorists are pouring into the United States because of the border crisis, making Biden a terrorist. Curious. During the debate, Trump especially hyper fixated on immigration, and used it as an escape route to answer almost any question he did not seem to have an intelligent answer to. According to some of his responses, immigration is to blame for inflation, veteran homelessness and black unemployment. Despite the ongoing wars abroad, Trump also referred to the border as“the most dangerous place anywhere in the world.” While immigration is a topic worth discussing from both parties, Trump seems to use it to evade answering real questions and to rally a political fanbase. Overall, the first debate of the 2024 election was underwhelming, repetitive and useless. Both candidates are the oldest American voters have seen, and as the two men spent part of the debate arguing who is better at golf while refusing to give meaningful answers to the questions asked, this livestream can be seen as one of the most unprofessional and unserious moments in American history. The next four years will likely be much of the same, as both candidates stated they were only running because of how horrible the other was at being president. Optimistically, future elections may consist of younger, more competent candidates who are willing to make change and end the unprofessional vindictiveness seen in government today.

We’vebeenwritingthemforyears, alongsidestudent-runandlargernewspapers alike. The Thresher doesn’t endorse candidates — the Editorial Board does. We keep our editorials and news coverage entirely separate. Rice is small, we know. When conflicts of interest arise, from personal relationships (again, Rice is small to outside extracurricular commitments, Editorial Board members recuse themselves as needed. You’ll even see that in one of our editorials today. Every year, the Editorial Board sits down with the candidates for contested SA executive positions to learn more about their experiences, interests and platforms. We collectively weigh the merits and flaws of each candidate, coming to decisions as a board. Endorsing a candidate doesn’t mean we believe in their platform unequivocally, nor does declining to endorse a candidate mean we disavow everything they stand for. Meanwhile, our reporters — typically a team of assistant news editors and senior writers, never overlapping with the Editorial Board — cover the election as it unfolds in real time. Neither coverage influences the other. Our endorsements are opinionated; our reporting isn’t. The Editorial Board is composed of section editors, the managing editor and the editors-in-chief, whose jobs are to know about and inform our campus community. At its core, this is why we write our endorsements: to inform you, our readers. Endorsements are not a mandate on how to vote, but rather a trustworthy opinion, written by student journalists knowledgeable about the campus community with the opportunity to ask candidates tough questions. At the end of the day, only one body can decide the vote — the students. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board. Current members include Prayag Gordy, Riya Misra, Nayeli Shad, Brandon Chen, Sammy Baek, Sarah Knowlton, Hadley Medlock and Pavithr Goli. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

crimson_2024_92,"On a chilly day in mid-April, we received the clandestine message we had been waiting for: location, day and time. We rushed to grab overnight bags that had been packed for weeks and made our way to the meeting location across from Massachusetts Hall, the seat of Harvard’s administration and the president’s office. At the change of security guards, 50 students silently entered the front door of Mass. Hall. In a single file, we fanned out across every office, sat down, and linked arms, quickly occupying the entire building. It was 2001, and this was the culmination of a four-year effort by Harvard students to get the University to pay its workers — specifically food service workers, janitors, and security guards — a living wage. Watching today’s pro-Palestine student encampments brings back a flood of memories from our three-week sit-in: Long nights of consensus-style decision-making. Frenetic “digital organizing” in the early days of cell phones. Creating a “hygiene committee” to manage a small space without showers. The camaraderie of those who delivered us meals through windows. The “city” of tents containing more than 100 people that sprung up in support of the occupation. The Harvard Living Wage Campaign never planned for an ongoing campus occupation. They assumed the police would arrest and remove us quickly. In planning the demonstration, the question was who was willing to spend a night in jail for this cause. But they did not arrest us. Likely recalling how they were made out to be the bad guys when they dismantled a student demonstration advocating divestment from apartheid South Africa in the late ’80s, Harvard and the police standing guard took a courageous position: they would not touch the protesting students. We lived in Mass. Hall for three weeks. The administration sent in a negotiating team, and the creation of a committee to study our proposal was secured. That committee eventually offered its support, and in 2002, Harvard officially agreed to pay its workers a living wage. While some schools issued minor disciplinary sanctions to their participating students, we received none. Shortly thereafter, the Harvard Kennedy School gave each of us one of its annual awards. How times have changed. The recent response to the pro-Palestine encampment from interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber ’76 — droning on in emails about inconvenient disruptions and the “rights of many” in the Harvard community while brave and righteous students risk grades, diplomas, and careers — feels contemptuous. It appears that a number of developments over the last two decades have made it harder for students to engage in peaceful and impactful protest. Observing the military-style police tactics on college campuses like UCLA — where officers have handcuffed, body slammed, and arrested students and professors — underscores how police have increasingly become a threat to community members. The transfer of military weapons to local police, elite combat training, and police union protections for civil rights violations have both emboldened such violent tactics and widened the gap between officer and civilian. The administration’s approach to protest has also changed. Since our protest in 2001, the University has formalized a prohibition on the occupation of University buildings. This, along with Garber’s comments, signals a shift in posture that increasingly seems to be willing to close civic space and oppose campus protest. What’s more, while the general public might have disagreed with our tactics in 2001, they appeared more open — or at least ambivalent to — our cause. Many workers, students, and community members came out to support the Harvard Living Wage Sit-In. Certainly, there weren’t means to intimidate and vilify us. Today, internet-enabled doxing has made it easier for people to subject protestors to hateful rhetoric. These factors have raised the risks of participating, making students less willing to speak out and increasing the pressure to conform. Despite this, sit-ins and encampments are an effective and powerful strategy. These types of protests are a disruption, but also a gift, challenging the power of universities in four ways. First, successful negotiations for divestment have the potential to disrupt financing of a war that has already killed, maimed, or starved over 100,000 people. Second, sit-ins and encampments oppose the University’s narrative about how students should engage in society — moving from lessons in a classroom to witnessing and experiencing leadership in practice. More fundamentally, sit-ins reveal the police state and its power to repress vulnerable people. This affirms what many people experience daily and what other activists have experienced during movements like the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, catalyzing empathy in those who have not experienced the fear, terror, and rage of state-sanctioned violence. Fourth and finally, encampments teach us how to work in solidarity with each other, calling on those of us who are bearing witness to reconnect to our humanity, to our compassion for others, and to a life-affirming way of being in relationship with all. When these peaceful and radical forms of expression are eliminated, we all lose. We silence the very bellwethers that might lead us to evolve our current understandings. We become more willing to accept state actions and silence differences in order to maintain our sense of safety, respectability, and comfort. Harvard and many other universities should reconsider both their response to this current historical moment and their ongoing use of militarized policing to manage student, faculty, and community spaces. The University of California, Riverside, Brown University, Rutgers University, Evergreen State College, Sacramento State, and other campuses have reached peaceful resolutions with their students, demonstrating the possibility of constructive engagement. When we occupied Mass. Hall, we got awards. When today’s protesters occupied the Yard, they got suspended. Harvard should stop the double standard. Lynne E. Lyman and Susan Misra are graduates of Harvard Kennedy School."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_0,"Former President Donald Trumpannouncedhis selection of Ohio Sen. James David (J.D. Vance, age 39, as his vice presidential candidate on July 17 through the Truth Social platform.Vance, elected into office in 2022, entered the American political sphere with a law degree from Yale and a military background. His impressive record is overshadowed by his dedicated loyalty to the former president. Despite differences in experience and age, Trump and Vance share identical characteristics ofextremism,bigotryandelection denial. They even share similar speechmannerisms. Ironically, Vance oncecomparedTrump to Hitler, yet his turnaround to being a die-hard defender of Trump ultimately secured his current position as Trump’s vice presidential pick. The striking parallel between both candidates highlights Trump’s rejection of bipartisanship and centrist politics. Trump’s choice of Vance as his running mate underscores the former president’s political shortcomings and his unwillingness to consider viewpoints beyond his own, posing a significant threat to our democracy. Trump’s vice presidential choice sends an already clear message to Americans: there is no middle ground in his administration. Typically, a vice president is strategically chosen by a president to attract voters who might not support them but are influenced to do so because of the appeal of the vice president. For instance, President Joe Biden expanded his voter base by choosingKamala Harris, a young woman of color. Preceding this pick, former President Barack Obama settled concerns about his limited political experience byselecting Biden,who had decades of public service on his record, as his running mate. In contrast, bothVanceandTrumplack substantial political experience and primarily appeal to far-right-wing voters. If Trump was sharper, he could have gone with someone likeNikki Haley, who would have appealed to center-right voters. Additionally, Haley would have attracted votes from women and independentgroupsthat Trump would not reach with Vance. Selecting Vance as his vice presidential candidate demonstrates Trump’s lack of strategic vision. He can only find success in feeding the fire of his far-right supporters. By only focusing solely on his fan base, Trump is neglecting the rest of the Republican Party, which is why numerousRepublicanswill be voting blue in November. Given Trump’s history with his former vice president, Mike Pence, who faceddeath threatsfor upholding democratic principles by certifying the 2020 election, it is clear that Trump now seeks absolute loyalty in his close circle. Vance has proved his loyalty by standing alongside Trump,claimingthat his criminal cases are politically motivated and sharing skepticism of the2020 electionresults. This refusal of Trump to share political space with differing viewpoints poses a serious threat to democracy, which relies on compromise and the sharing of power. To further highlight this lack of bipartisanship, both Trump and Vance have expressed a desire to“drain the swamp,”which points to the idea of removing current federal employees and replacing them with like-minded people on the right. Trump’s pick of Vance reinforces fears about the future of our democracy. The Supreme Court’sdecisionto side with Trump and allow him on state ballots despite his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection combined with the significant platform given to Vance further fuels growing right-wing extremism. Putting both extremists in power would continue the normalization ofTrumpismand threaten fundamental values such as equality, progress and freedom. Our fragile democracy cannot handle another term of Trump’s rule. The events ofJan. 6were the greatest sign of this pronounced threat to our democracy. Republican state Sen. George Lang’srecent suggestionof a potential civil war if Trump loses the election, combined with Trump’srolein destroying a potential bipartisan border deal, emphasizes the dangers posed by his influence. Additionally, the looming prospect ofProject 2025poses the idea of the government shifting away from bipartisanship and political tolerance under Trump. In today’s tense political climate, the United States needs a president who speaks to all Americans, not just a select group. A quick look at the audience at a Trump rally reveals the limited demographic Trump represents. Trump’s extremism will only reach new heights if he once again gains the presidency. Voter turnout against the former president on Nov. 5 is crucial to stop a complete takeover of extremism and to protect our democracy. Zahira Vasquez is the 2024-25 Assistant Opinion Editor.

rice_thresher_2024_3,"ByElaine Ecklund3/26/24 11:00pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Dear Rice University Students and Postdoctoral Fellows: I am writing to strongly urge you to participate in the Boniuk Institute Survey of Religious Diversity at Rice. In the midst of a nationwide increase in religious discrimination and hostility, particularly following the events of Oct. 7 in Israel and ensuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, there is a need to examine how Rice University students have been impacted, how they are responding and the degree to which religious tolerance, religious accommodations, and perceptions of religious discrimination at Rice have changed. The Boniuk Institute for the Study and Advancement of Religious Tolerance at Rice University is currently surveying all Rice students and postdocs until March 29, 2024. This survey examines experiences of, and attitudes towards, religious tolerance and discrimination, and the impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has had on the Rice student and postdoc community. Some things that are important to note: 1.The survey is being run by a non-partial entity.The Rice University administration has commissioned the Boniuk Institute to survey all Rice undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral fellows on the topics of religious discrimination and religious accommodation. They want to make sure that an entity distinct from the administration runs the survey. Issues of religion and non-religion have often been left out of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on university campuses and we want to make sure Rice University thoughtfully approaches such issues. 2.It’s important that we hear the voices of both religiousandnon-religious students.Whether you are religious or non-religious, you should participate. Given the current importance of these topics currently, it is critical that all students and postdocs at Rice have the opportunity to share their experiences. Participation in this survey is extremely valuable to Rice and will help us understand religious discrimination and needed religious accommodation on campus. Simply put, responses will have a direct impact on future Rice Universitypolicies. 3.Responses are completely anonymous.The responses to the survey will be completely anonymous and will never be connected to students in any way. All analysis and reporting will be conducted at the aggregate level, and the data will be stored securely and according to Rice’s data privacy policies. I am a sociologist who is an expert in surveying at- risk populations and Dr. Kerby Goff, who is working with me, is an expert in survey data analysis and de- identification. It’s important to stress that we will never have access to the names of those who completed the survey. 4.We need data to respond with justice and effectiveness. Sometimes it’s the loudest voices who people assume are the most numerous. Even if you do not have strong opinions about religion, religious tolerance, or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, your participation is vital. Given the relevance of issues related to religious discrimination and accommodation, it’s important that everyone’s voice be counted. We cannot know what you think or what people like you think unless you fill out the survey. Research I have conducted with Christopher Scheitle and other colleagues reveals that, even before the crisis, Jewish and Muslim adults hadgreater fearof religious victimization than Christianadults. Antisemitism and Islamophobia in the US and globally have only continued toincreaseafter thecrisis. In addition to filling out the survey, please get involved in understanding religious discrimination and victimization, as well as the myriad political and religious factors influencing the crisis in the Middle East. Take relevant classes; attend university lectures; talk to those who have been personally influenced. Many of you have been engaging already, but it’s more important than ever that we take the time to rise to our highest potential as a university, to engage the most difficult issues of our day with nuanced information and education that leads to thoughtful practice. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month.

crimson_2024_84,"Today, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics approved an unprecedented ban on the participation of transgender women, in a move that could pressure other major governing bodies of athletics, including the National Collegiate Athletics Association, to follow suit. According to the official press release, “Only NAIA student-athletes whose biological sex is female may participate in NAIA-sponsored female sports.” The policy does not specify how it defines biological sex, nor does it clarify its implications for intersex athletes. It also excludes athletes who have begun “any masculinizing hormone therapy.” This ban comes amid increased scrutiny over trans bodies in sport and an explosion of anti-trans legislation across the country. To date, at least 24 states have enacted policies restricting transgender participation in sports, 18 of which restrict participation in college sports in particular. Harsher policies have been on the rise in state legislatures since 2020, but today’s ban appears to be the first of its kind from a national college governing body. Though the NAIA, which includes mostly smaller colleges, is not as large a body as the NCAA, its decision sets a dangerous precedent and could augur a striking shift for collegiate athletics. The standard for trans athlete participation in college has long been set by the NCAA, which established its first policy in 2011, when itreleased guidancethat allowed students to compete on teams aligned with their gender identity, though it did require one year of testosterone suppression for trans woman athletes. The policy was updated in 2022, when the NCAAadopted a sport-by-sport approachto determining requirements for participation reflective of the framework used by theInternational Olympic Committee, an evidence-based approach that centers non-discrimination and the well-being of trans and intersex athletes while recognizing the significant differences between sports. Compared with the IOC guidelines, the NCAA’s sport-by-sport policy has clear issues, including a lack of safeguards against invasive procedures like genitalia examinations. Still, the policy gives trans athletes a seat at the table and retains the potential for ongoing discussion. The NAIA’s new ban fails to accomplish even this. The change seems to align with dubious claims that transgender athletes — specifically trans women — have an unconditionally unfair advantage. But this is simply incorrect. A wealth of evidence suggests that testosterone is not a clear or consistent indicator of athletic ability. Moreover, such a view fails to acknowledge the biological diversity that is inherent to, and even necessary for, sport. Michael Phelps, the winningest Olympian of all time, is frequently celebrated for unique physical characteristics — including a wingspan longer than his height and abnormally low levels of lactic-acid production — that contribute to his success. Additionally, the impact of certain physical characteristics on performance varies greatly from sport to sport. By regulating all sports as though they are identical, the NAIA’s blanket policy arbitrarily harms trans woman athletes. Trans people are not arguing for zero regulation, but rather that regulators follow evidence-backed guidance about fair trans inclusion. While such guidance also creates barriers to trans athlete participation, they at least leave room for trans athletes to compete in the sports they love. Beyond just the effect of the ban itself, we are deeply concerned that this new ban has been driven by increasing anti-trans pressure, most recently by a lawsuit filed against the NCAA by 16 college athletes. Reka Gyorgy, a former Virginia Tech swimmer and a plaintiff in the case, shares in the opening quote of the lawsuit that she believes her rights were violated after placing seventeenth in an event, behind trans athlete Lia Thomas and fifteen cisgender athletes. But losing a race hardly seems a violation of individual Title IX rights, especially when the alternative is removing transgender athletes from the race entirely — arguably, a clearer infringement on the rights accorded by Title IX. And, for those who want to support women’s athletics — a laudable, important goal — trans participation is the last place to start. Areport from 2022found that 50 years after the passage of Title IX, 86 percent of NCAA institutions still offered disproportionately more athletic opportunities to male athletes. In the 2019-2020 academic year, this translated to 58,913 missed opportunities for female athletes. There are many other well-documented threats to women in sports, including sexual abuse, harassment, and unequal access to resources like facilities and coaching. As trans leaders and a trans athlete, we have witnessed firsthand how anti-trans athletics policies affect trans people’s ability to live our day-to-day lives. We agree that there is a need for conversations, both in research and in the trans community, about fair trans inclusion in athletics. But, by enacting a blanket ban on trans athletes, the NAIA has not created space for conversation — they have shut it down completely. The NAIA is sweepingly denying trans women participation. If that is not the definition of discrimination, what is? Though Harvard may not be a member of the NAIA, it is essential that we make our voices heard during this crucial moment. The University, the Ivy League, and their affiliates should make clear to the NCAA that they will not stand for a similar policy. This ban is not just an affront to transgender athletes, it is an affront to Harvard’s most central values: veritas, diversity, and civil discourse across difference. We call on Harvard Athletics to publicly reaffirm its commitment to protecting trans+ student-athletes, and the University to ensure trans+ athletes are safe, happy, and welcome at Harvard. We call on cisgender athletes to support their transgender peers in advocacy for their right to play. Sports are for everyone. Transgender athletes deserve access to life-saving sport spaces, to build community and engage in competition, at all ages and levels. We must keep fighting to defend it. The NAIA’s ban on trans women is abhorrent and unacceptable — we cannot let the NCAA bend to pressure and follow suit. The ball is in our court now, Harvard. We can’t drop it. E.

Dan s father, Fritz Ottenheimer, was born in Germany in 1925, fled to the U.S. in 1939, and returned to Germany as a U.S. soldier toward the end of World War II. Dan is a volunteer second-generation Holocaust speaker for the organization Facing History and Ourselves, and for the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh. The views above are his alone, and do not represent the views of any affiliated organization. “As a second-generation Holocaust Survivor, how do you feel about the ongoing tragedy in Gaza?” I was fielding questions after a talk I had given at a local middle school on the Holocaust, and the 8th-grade student wearing a hijab waited expectantly for my answer. I had been nervously anticipating this question. I am usually very fact-oriented when I tell my Dad’s story about being a Jewish child in Nazi Germany, letting the attendees do all the comparisons to current events. Plus I wasn’t sure how to take all of my scattered thoughts about the conflict, and turn them into a coherent age-appropriate response. I thought briefly about a different discussion I had had with a fellow MIT alum about the MIT campus climate. I had expressed the opinion that the students needed to listen and empathize more; because in many conflicts, an equitable outcome requires discussion, negotiation, and compromise. The alum seemed to justify the current protest-heavy campus behavior, saying “But are the student groups you mention in charge of driving the equitable outcome you speak of?” I had pondered the alum’s question for a while. Is protesting, and rallying people to their cause, the only thing that a U.S. student can do to make a difference? The Israel/Palestine conflict has been going on for 75 years, with only brief lulls in between violent flare-ups. Can anything we do here on our campuses make long-term peace and stability more likely 5,000 miles away? Yes. I believe there is something we can do, but not enough of us are doing it. And I explained it to the 8th-grade student. “There are descendants of Holocaust survivors who protest strongly against the excessive deaths in Gaza, and call for an immediate ceasefire. And there are descendants of Holocaust survivors who insist that Israel, home to half of the world’s Jews including many descended from Holocaust survivors, be allowed to defend itself, to make the country safe from its enemies. But… This is what I believe. The only way to stop the killing, is to stop the hate. And there is a lot of hate in the Middle East right now, on both sides of this conflict.” The region is full of fear, mistrust, anger, and hate. And historical studies show that unchecked hatred leads to demonization and dehumanization, and to remorseless killing. So how do you stop the hate? By learning about the other side. By sharing perspectives and narratives; by agreeing jointly that we are all human beings who are entitled to stability and safety; by envisioning together possible equitable solutions to the conflict. Is this what is happening on MIT’s campus? Perhaps among the more moderate students. But there is still a lot of shouting and protesting. In many ways the fear, mistrust, anger, and hatred in Israel/Gaza has transported itself 5000 miles to our local campuses (in factcollege campuses have been called the second front of the Israel/Gaza war . I fear that this propagation of hatred will not bring peace to the Middle East; it will only guarantee another 75 years of conflict, if not more. Which brings me back to the question from that MIT alum. Are you students at MIT in charge of driving an equitable outcome in the Middle East? No, probably not in 2024 while you are students. But what about 2034? We don’t know where you will be in ten years, and what you will be doing. But you are MIT students, and that means many of you are going to have significant roles - in academia, industry, and also the government (note that the current Prime Minister in Israel is an MIT alumnus . And the lessons you learn while at MIT will be an important part of who you are in the future. Will you have learned how to listen to and respect opposing viewpoints? Will you have learned how to engage in difficult conversations and work out equitable solutions to challenging problems? Will you have the conviction that all human beings are deserving of safety and security? If you have learned all this, then perhaps there is a chance that you can help bring about peace in the Middle East. But what if all you learn while at MIT is how to out-shout and out-protest and out-publicize your opponents? The fight against hatred is a very slow, difficult struggle. It is fought one person at a time, dispelling misconceptions and building understanding. And there are several STEM-oriented non-profits that have been working at it – trying to build bridges between Israelis and Palestinians. Some examples areOur Generation Speaks,Tech2Peace(https: www.tech2peace.com/ , and MIT’s MEET program (Middle East Entrepreneurs for Tomorrow . So, what can you do to make long-term peace and stability more likely in this 75-year-old conflict taking place 5000 miles away? You can spend as much effort working with these bridge-building organizations, and learning about opposing viewpoints, as you spend on your next protest or open letter or media campaign. Let’s not propagate the hate; let’s stop the hate. One difficult conversation at a time. Dan Ottenheimer SB ‘79 SM ‘82 (Course II"
rice_thresher_2024_36,"ByErica Augenstein4/3/24 12:32pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. This February, current director of the Baker Institute, David Satterfield, invited former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to speak on Rice’s campus. Condoleezza Rice is infamous for her central role in launching theillegalU.S.-led invasion of Iraq. After an introduction by President Reginald DesRoches — where he celebrated Condoleezza Rice’s bloody legacy — Satterfield and Condoleezza Rice sat together as two never-elected bureaucrats with decades of experience directing colonial violence between them to discuss the ongoing genocide in Gaza and “the delicate balance between free speech and incitement.” In order to protest the event, I along with four other Rice graduate students organized a banner drop inside the lecture. Our banners read “War Criminals Off Our Campus” and “Baker Oils the War Machine.” This political action was designed as a direct message to Satterfield and to Rice University administration. We were forcibly removed from the lecture less than one minute after revealing our banners. As we were physically removed from the event, we chanted as a protest to the silencing of our speech. We were all subsequently charged by Rice’s Student Judicial Programs with disruption of a university event. This swift crackdown on peaceful and desperately necessary protest reflects the increasing boldness with which bureaucrats and administrators are now silencing legitimate protest. These bureaucrats and administrators, like Satterfield and DesRoches, aim to silence our dissent so they can continue to enjoy their decades-long reign — underwritten by the violence of colonial aggression and genocide. A morbid entanglement of American colonial agents and university administration currently threatens intellectual life on university campuses across the United States. At Rice, this is embodied by the Baker Institute, an entity that feeds off the university’s intellectual legitimacy in order to serve as a war room for directing U.S. colonial aggression. Satterfieldwas recently appointedas special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues. Since his appointment, Satterfield has served as a core partner in theU.S. and Israeli-led genocidal campaign in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians. This follows Satterfield’s long history at the center of colonial violence, including his appointment ascoordinator for Iraqunder then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, which corresponded with thedeadliest year for civiliansof the entirety of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. At the Baker Institute, Satterfield hasrepeatedlyhosted architects of U.S. colonial violence. Satterfield’s insistence on paradingthe most vile leaders of the U.S.-led colonial warfareacross campus represents the conscious construction of a narrow but oppressive political bloc of bureaucratic elites, both governmental and educational — a bloc that has recently emerged from the shadowy corridors of university administrations and federal agencies to blatantly crush the student movements standing in solidarity with Palestinians. Students on Rice’s campus, across the country and across the world haveorganized historic proteststo demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In response, powerful bureaucrats — like Satterfield and Condoleezza Rice — have colluded with university administrators toundermine and crush student activism. Nevertheless, on Rice’s campus, students have made their voices heard. In October 2023, Rice activists hosted ateach-inandprotest, which saw hundreds in attendance, to reject the Baker Institute gala’s hosting of Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton. Satterfield and Rice administrators paid no heed to these protests. In fact, in the following months, other student organizers and I were subjected to increasing surveillance by administration, including required interrogations by Rice University police and administrators ahead of nearly every planned event. We as students and scholars working in centers of colonial rule must refuse to grant consent to an appalling and criminal standard of academic “civility” that allows war criminals like Condoleezza Rice and David Satterfield to spew colonial and racist talking points in the comfort of university concert halls. We can do this by exposing that it is violence, oppression and death that they serve. And through this political project, we can build a scholarly community that can uphold the integrity of our intellectual production and foster an environment where anti-colonial knowledge can be genuinely pursued. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2024_19,"Cheating at Stanford has become rampant in recent years. After seemingly every CS 106A exam and major assignment, students flood Fizz with posts asking how effective the CS department’s plagiarism detector is and whether they will get caught for receiving inappropriate help. Studentscirculate completed problem setsto copy and submit as their own work without giving credit. It’s time for us to confront the obvious: The long-standing Honor Code, Stanford’s institutional mechanism to combat academic dishonesty, has failed. The Editorial Board believes that the Faculty Senate’s reinstatement of in-person proctoring is a positive step.However, proctoring alone does not address the bulk of the problem. The Vice Provost of Student Affairs established the Committee of 12 or “C-12” in 2022 to address the proliferation of academic dishonesty. C-12-led focus groups with studentsuncoveredinformal confessions about academic dishonesty on assignments beyond exams. Students told the committee that many violations, like plagiarism and unpermitted aid, such as unapproved cheat sheets or using the Internet — persist at Stanford. Faculty hold the unique power to restructure courses to alleviate cheating. Upholding academic integrity is a shared responsibility between students and faculty members. Our recommendations allow faculty members to respond to cheating enabled by new technologies. To understand why this burden falls on faculty, we must consider how the Honor Code and student behavior have evolved. How did we get here? The Honor Code was established in 1921 and maintained its stance on proctoring until 2023.Prior to 2023, it compelled faculty to create “confidence in the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examinations.” In turn, students assumed the responsibility to monitor and report violations by their peers. Students, however, have failed their side of the bargain. Out of the 720 total Honor Code violationsreportedbetween 2018-2021, only two came from students. In the past three years Honor Code violations have increased: 136 in 2018-19, 191 in 2019-20, and 393 in 2020-21. Largely in response to this trend, the C-12 proposed changes to the Honor Code last May toallowin-person proctoring, reversing a longstanding norm. These changestriggereda torrent of student dismay and anger. It is clear to us, a year after the Faculty Senate’s decision, that the proctoring policy would simply put a bandage over one wound, while more nebulous, common forms of cheating fester. Why has cheating become such a widespread issue at Stanford? Certainly, there are substantial incentives to cheat; one factor is post-graduation opportunities. Whether it be graduate school or an interview at McKinsey, each seems to sport a daunting GPA cutoff, and students may feel tempted to use any means to keep those doors open — a pressureacknowledgedby the C-12. When cheating becomes a widespread campus norm, the stigma attached to academic dishonesty erodes. Cheating becomes viewed as acceptable — or even necessary — to achieve success amid students who also cheat to stay afloat. Students may assume when exam scores are curved up, they are disadvantaged when they don’t cheat. Furthermore,grade inflationcontributes to anenvironmentwhere an A is the expectation, and less is failure. An A should mark exceptional achievement in a course. In an academic climate where Bs are commonplace, perhaps a poor grade on one test would feel less like an outcome so bad that you should risk academic integrity to prevent it. Theunrelenting pace in the quarter systemalso contributes: Seemingly never-ending midterms span weeks three to nine and the pressure to cram for several final exams and papers induce the temptation to cheat. Stanford’s academic environment has transformed into a pressure cooker, exacerbated by technological change the University has precipitated. In our view, this enabling climate, rather than some generational increase in dishonesty, is responsible for much of Stanford’s current cheating problem. Students under pressure will cheat if given the chance, and that chance has exponentiated with theinternet,ChatGPT, andworkaroundsto plagiarism detectors. Technologiesoutpacedetection in many contexts, with some efforts evenleading to false accusations. How can we move forward? The new environment around academic dishonesty needs intervention beyond codified rules, it necessitates a reimagined approach to exams, assignments, and their evaluation. In addition to proctoring exams, we recommend that faculty implement the following changes: 1 Phase out take-home examinations, especially ones graded solely on correctness, in favor of in-person exams and papers. 2 Allow for cited collaboration on homework — it happens anyway. 3 Eliminate “reflection” assignments to assess attendance or completion of readings, as they’re easily completed by ChatGPT. If instructors believe reflection is crucial, it is most effective to evaluate through discussion sections, argumentative assignments requiring original thought or in-class assessments. 4 Emphasize why academic honesty is important, not only to avoid disciplinary action, but to realize academic learning goals. A speech from instructors early in the quarter, particularly in introductory courses, would reaffirm normative goals underlying policies designed to uphold academic honesty. Academic dishonesty is a structural problem at Stanford, driven by new technologies and student culture. Changes that do not address this reality will fail to solve the problem. If the honor code has broken down, it is because the trust between faculty and students hasbroken down. While we believe students are wrong to oppose the proctoring changes, we understand that the withdrawal of trust hurts. But faculty are justified in their desire to respond. Academic dishonesty is immensely harmful — widespread cheating degrades the University’s purpose, community and institution. A widespread culture of cheating not only ruins the curve for honest students, but undermines a Stanford degree’s academic capital. We urge the faculty to seriously reimagine the responsibility to cultivate an environment supportive of academic integrity. There are no malicious professors in this regard — no one wants their students to cheat. We urge students to support faculty to create an academically honest classroom. Prioritizing shiny results over effort curtails students’ ability to gain a genuine education. The value of Stanford classes is the cumulative knowledge we obtain from them, not the collection of letter grades.

rice_thresher_2024_16,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/20/24 9:40pm Due to his previous successful initiatives, desire to correct flaws within the Student Association and passion for student advocacy, we, the Thresher Editorial Board, endorse Jae Kim for SA president. Kim has three years of experience working within the SA as a new student representative, senator and college president. He has learned ways to improve the efficacy and success of the organization. For instance, Kim wants to ensure that intense research and conversations with stakeholders occur before introducing resolutions, rendering them more beneficial. His advocacy-centered approach is poised to get students engaged in the SA, which has been a shortcoming of the organization for years. Further, he wants to bridge existing gaps between college presidents and other SA members to benefit the colleges using SA’s funding and connections to administration. Both Kim and his opponent, Hanszen College senator Trevor Tobey, want to restructure the Blanket Tax, an $85 part of each student’s tuition that goes to the SA, Rice Program Council, student media organizations and other student groups that serve the entire Rice community. Importantly, both candidates want to create a separate source of money for recurring events that are not covered by theInitiative Fund. Unlike Tobey, Kim wants to explore raising the Blanket Tax, which has remained the same since 2015 in spite of inflation — something we agree is necessary to sustain the growing undergraduate population. Many of Kim’s plans build off previous initiatives he spearheaded as Brown College senator and president. This includes improving housing accommodations for transgender and gender non-conforming students, expanding the Student Success Initiatives food pantry and increasing study spots on campus. His knowledge of who to work with and how to design projects to make them successful will make him adept at achieving his goals as SA president. While Tobey shares some of Kim’s goals, his ideas for achieving them are less detailed and harder to achieve. Both want to expand late night dining options, but Tobey’s plan to negotiate pay bonuses for Housing and Dining staff working extra hours using SA money raises concerns about overextending the SA’s budget. Additionally, Tobey wants to provide subsidies for off-campus therapy, but he provided little additional information on his plan to do this during his interview with the Editorial Board. Tobey has valid criticisms of the SA’s inability to effect change due to loose resolutions and vast conformity within the organization. Kim is running with a team, many of whom echo his ideas. While a ticket can be helpful for voters and close collaboration is important, it is even more important to allow for disagreement in the SA, something that Tobey sees as lacking. We hope that the future SA executive committee will encourage diverse ideas both from the student body and within the SA itself.

thetech_mit_2024_8,"Publisher’s note:the following piece details a letter submitted by Dan Zeno to The Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards in response to his interim suspension as issued by the Committee on Discipline. The work, published here as an open letter, has been edited by editors of The Tech for clarity and conciseness. Introduction and Context for Open Letter In recent weeks, the MIT community has been grappling with the consequences of a student-led protest encampment on Kresge Oval. The demonstration, which began on April 21, 2024, was met with a controversial response from the MIT administration, culminating in the suspension of several students involved in the protest. One of those students, Zeno, a veteran and graduate student at the Sloan School of Management, has chosen to share his perspective on the events and his personal experiences in an open letter to the community, one which was also formally submitted to The Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS . Zeno, who has faced significant challenges during his time at MIT, including a rare medical condition that necessitated leaves of absence, now finds himself facing serious allegations and an interim suspension from the institute. In his letter, Zeno questions the fairness and justification of the disciplinary actions taken against him and other students, raising concerns about the lack of due process, the vagueness of the policies invoked, and the potential for bias and discrimination in the administration s response. He also shares his personal journey at MIT, highlighting his contributions to the community and the impact of the current situation on his academic progress, family, and well-being. Through this open letter, Zeno aims to spark a conversation about the broader issues at stake, including the importance of free speech, peaceful protest, and the alignment of MIT s actions with its stated values. He invites the entire community to engage in honest reflection and dialogue about these events and the future of the institute. The letter that follows is a heartfelt and thought-provoking perspective from a student who has found himself at the center of a complex and divisive situation. It offers a unique insight into the human impact of recent events and raises important questions about the principles and values that guide our community. The Open Letter Dear Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, I pen this letter with a soul laden with sorrow, my spirit deeply vexed by the egregious and precipitous actions taken against me by an institution I once held in the highest regard. The imposition of an interim suspension and the threat of eviction, bereft of even a modicum of due process, stands as a grievous miscarriage of justice and a disheartening betrayal of the very values that MIT purports to embody. As a bastion of academic excellence, MIT has long prided itself on its unwavering commitment to fairness, integrity, and the relentless pursuit of truth. Yet, in this dark hour, the institution has fallen woefully short of these lofty ideals, denying me the fundamental tenets of a just and equitable process: fair notice, prior enforcement, substantial proof, equal treatment, and progressive discipline. Instead, I find myself at the mercy of an administration that appears more intent on quelling dissent and stifling the voices of those who dare to question the status quo than fostering an environment conducive to open dialogue, critical thinking, and the free exchange of ideas. The ramifications of this capricious decision has already delivered non-interim discombobulation. My family, including my cherished five-year-old daughter and princess, has been cast into a vortex of uncertainty and anguish, our lives upended by the callous demand for our immediate eviction. The utter lack of empathy and understanding displayed by an institution that purports to value diversity and inclusion is as shocking as it is disheartening, particularly in light of my physical disability. The subsequent backpedaling and conditional retractions only serve to underscore the impropriety and haste with which these decisions were made, a damning indictment of an administration that has lost its way. Moreover, the financial repercussions of this suspension have been deeply unnerving. As a veteran who relied upon the GI Bill to pursue my dreams of higher education, I now find myself facing the perilous prospect of losing the very stipend that keeps a roof over my head and food on my table. This, coupled with the uncertainty surrounding my academic standing at Sloan, has left me teetering, my hard-fought gains threatened by the abrupt actions of an administration that seems all too willing to sacrifice the well-being of its students on the altar of expediency. Allow me a moment to provide some context regarding my journey at MIT: In the autumn of 2018, I embarked upon a transformative journey at the prestigious Sloan School of Management, the same year I concluded my service in the United States Air Force. Little did I know that this new chapter would be marred by an insidious and enigmatic affliction that would test the very limits of my resilience. As I immersed myself in the rigorous core curriculum of my MBA program, the first whispers of a sinister malady began to manifest. Eosinophilic Fasciitis, a deeply-painful condition so rare that it has only been well-documented in a handful of cases worldwide, slowly crept into my life, its grip tightening with each passing day. Accompanying this primary diagnosis was the specter of Morphea, a secondary condition that only served to compound my suffering. The path to understanding the nature of my ailment was a labyrinthine one, fraught with uncertainty and despair. For nine long months, I traversed the length and breadth of the nation, consulting with medical experts at countless hospitals, each visit a desperate quest for answers. The toll on my mind and body was immeasurable, as I grappled with the debilitating effects of my condition while striving to maintain my academic standing. Inevitably, the demands of my health necessitated a fragmented approach to my education at Sloan. Multiple medical leaves of absence punctuated my journey, each one a reluctant but necessary respite to accommodate the experimental treatments that held the promise of relief. The halls of Boston Medical Center became my second home, a stark contrast to the hallowed corridors of MIT. Yet, even as I navigated the depths of my personal struggle, I refused to let it define me. I channeled my energy into making a meaningful contribution to the MIT community. As the President of The Yarn, a renowned speaker series at Sloan, I curated thought-provoking discussions and gave voice to diverse perspectives. Through numerous speeches at Sloan admit events, I shared my story and inspired others to persevere in the face of adversity. Music became my solace and my platform for connection. As a lead singer and performer of The Rolling Sloans, the business school band, I poured my heart and soul into electrifying performances. Our concerts at the iconic Paradise Rock Club drew crowds of over a thousand students, each one a testament to the power of art to unite and uplift. In a poignant display of my commitment to the MIT community, I took on the role of lead actor in a play during admit week 23. The production served as a vital resource for incoming freshmen, highlighting the myriad support services available on campus to ease their transition into university life. It was a privilege to be a guiding light for these young minds, to help them navigate the challenges that lay ahead. And so, it is with a heavy heart that I now find myself at the receiving end of an institution s callous disregard. To have given so much of myself, to have overcome such unimaginable odds, only to be treated with such unprofessionalism and insensitivity, is a bitter pill to swallow. The very institution that I have served with unwavering dedication has chosen to cast me aside, my contributions and struggles seemingly reduced to mere footnotes in the grand scheme of things. Regarding the allegations: The allegations leveled against me are as baseless as they are unjust, a product of a system that seems all too eager to condemn without evidence or due process. I stand accused of endangering the community and serving as a leader of the encampment, yet not a shred of substantive proof has been offered to support these spurious claims. I held no formal role in establishing the encampment. The conflation of an outspoken nature with formal leadership is a deeply troubling notion, one that suggests a desire to suppress individual expression and stifle the voices of dissent. Additionally, in the initial suspension letter, a document as fraught with inaccuracies as it is with unjust accusations, asserts that We received information that after being directed to leave by 2:30 p.m., you exited temporarily but continued to engage in escalating activities that endangered members of the community. This claim, I must unequivocally state, is a gross misrepresentation of the facts and a distortion of the truth that lies at the heart of this matter. First and foremost, it is crucial to note that I was not, in fact, directed to leave by the arbitrary deadline of 2:30 p.m., for the simple reason that I was not present within the confines of the encampment when these letters were disseminated. To suggest otherwise is to engage in a willful distortion of reality, a shameful attempt to paint me as a recalcitrant agitator bent on sowing the seeds of discord and chaos. Moreover, the accusation that I engaged in escalating activities that endangered the community is one that I reject with every fiber of my being. It is a baseless and inflammatory charge, unsupported by any credible evidence and designed solely to tarnish my reputation and undermine my credibility. The only supposed proof offered in support of this spurious claim is a single photograph depicting me in the act of assisting fellow community members over a fence, an act of compassion and concern that has been cynically twisted into something sinister and malign. Let me be clear: I did not plan, orchestrate, or encourage the actions of those who chose to climb over the fence that day. They made that decision of their own volition, driven by a deep-seated sense of moral outrage and a fierce determination to stand in solidarity with their fellow students trapped inside. It is my solemn duty as a member of this community to do everything in my power to ensure the safety and well-being of those around me, even in the face of an administration that seems determined to silence and punish us for daring to stand up for what we believe in. To twist this act of kindness and solidarity into something nefarious and dangerous is to engage in a grotesque distortion of the truth, a shameful attempt to paint those who dare to question the status quo as a threat to the very fabric of our society. Furthermore, the very policies I am alleged to have violated are couched in language so vague and subjective as to render them all but meaningless, requiring a thorough investigation before any punishment can be justly meted out. The fact that an overwhelming majority of the suspended students are people of color raises deeply troubling questions about the role of bias and discrimination in this process, a shameful indictment of an administration that has lost sight of its moral compass. The reported comparison of peaceful protesters to sexual assault perpetrators is not only deeply offensive but also indicative of a fundamental disconnect between the administration and the values it claims to uphold. As a descendant of Black and Indigenous ancestors who bore witness to the unspeakable horrors of ethnic cleansing, lynching and racial injustice in Texas and Puerto Rico, I am appalled by the insinuation that advocating for human rights and an end to genocide is akin to sexual misconduct. This comparison is a grave insult to the survivors of sexual assault and a painful reminder of the long and sordid history of oppression and discrimination faced by communities of color. I implore the COD Committee on Discipline to act swiftly and justly in reviewing my suspension, to right the wrongs that have been done and to restore a measure of dignity and respect to a process that has been sorely lacking in both. Every day that passes without resolution is another day of injustice and harm inflicted upon us, a stain upon the very fabric of this institution. We are students who have dedicated ourselves to the pursuit of knowledge and the betterment of society, and we deserve to be treated with the same respect and consideration that we have shown to others. In conclusion, I call upon MIT to live up to the values it so proudly proclaims, to be a beacon of fairness, integrity, and respect for human rights in a world that so desperately needs such leadership. I urge you to lift this unjust suspension, to allow me to complete my education and to take my place among the ranks of those who have gone before me, those who have fought tirelessly to make this world a better place. In the end, history will judge us not by the accolades we accrue or the titles we hold, but by the courage we show in the face of adversity and the integrity we maintain in the pursuit of what is right and just. Thank you for your consideration of this matter. I eagerly await your response and stand ready to work with you to find a resolution. Sincerely, Zeno"
thetech_mit_2024_21,"To our fellow undergraduates, Next week,from March 18 to March 22, there will be a question on the UA ballot to adopt a resolution calling for a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, cutting ties between MIT and the Israeli military, and solidarity with student organizers facing disciplinary threats. This question made it on the ballot becausein a ``span of 24 hours, over 600 students (1/8 of the undergraduate population indicated that they wanted to see this question considered;now, it is time to make our voice heard. If Referendum #2 passes, it will become abinding UA resolution, which means if it passes, the referendum becomes adopted by the UA.It unequivocally demonstrates to the MIT administration that our undergraduate community stands in support of liberation for the Palestinian people—not with those in power who continue the violence in Gaza. So why vote yes on this question? We must call for apermanent ceasefirein Gaza, Palestine. Since October 7th, 2023, Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza has killed an average of 200 Palestinians each day,wiping out entire families. This daily toll isin addition to the 2,270 Palestinians killed by the Israeli militarybetween January 1, 2008 and October 6th, 2023. Since October 7th, Israel’scomplete siege of Gazahas forcibly starved Palestinians in the north of Gaza while those in Rafah, a supposed safe zone in the south, are faced withunrelenting bombings and the threat of a ground invasion. In response to these conditions, the United Nations International Court of Justice hasfound it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide, and has highlighted the need for an immediate ceasefire. Every person deserves to live a life free from oppression. The Israeli siege on Gaza has denied 2.2 million people a life of dignity by denying themfreedom of movement,basic food security,educational facilities,medical treatment,access to electricity, and aroof to sleep under. Each day, Palestinians in Gaza faceIsraeli snipers, air strikes withincendiary white phosphorusand2,000 pound American-made bombs. Even before the current siege, Palestinians havelong been denied their basic dignity by the Israeli occupation. Our siblings in Gaza have endured over 150 days ofgenocide— it is unconscionable to not take a stand against this wanton violence. Animmediate, permanent ceasefireis the bare minimum the Palestinian people deserve. Our undergraduate student body here at MIT must join the voices of the numerousfaculty,labor unions,cities(including Cambridge , andcountriesaround the world who have already affirmed this need. MIT mustcut research funding ties with the Israeli military. This resolution is especially crucial at MIT due to thedirect institutional ties MIT has with the Israeli military.Since 2008, multiple professors in CSAIL, AeroAstro, DMSE, BioE, and other MIT groups haveaccepted research fundingfrom the Ministry of Defense of Israel.This allocated funding has gone towards military research projects such as “Autonomous Robotic Swarms” and “Planning and Sensing Algorithms for Underwater Persistent Monitoring.”Furthermore, at least two PIs at MIT have requested torenewtheir funding with the Israeli Ministry after October 7th, despite mounting evidence that the Israeli military is committing genocide. The work that each one of us does – whether in the classroom, during an internship, as a UROP, or in the world after graduation – builds MIT’s reputation. We came to MIT for a variety of reasons, but certainly none of us came here because we wanted to build an institution which is enabling war crimes. As people of conscience, how can we allow our university to produce work that goes towards enabling military atrocities against the Palestinian people? Like our predecessors at MITwho organized in the 60s and 70sagainst the Institute’s role in the Vietnam War, we now are confronted with our own moral reckoning. Our university can no longer produce research that furthers this genocide and oppression against the Palestinian people. MIT has blood on its hands. Rather than consigning ourselves to complicity, we must call for a better society – one where our talents and energies are used in the service of building humanity, not for building bombs. MIT must stop attacks against pro-Palestine student organizers. For the last five months, students and organizations in the MIT Coalition for Palestine, including the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA , have continuously spoken out against the genocide in Gaza and MIT’s complicity in this genocide. The MIT administration, in response topressure from billionaire donorsand right-wing politicians, suspended the CAA and sanctioned individual student organizers for their protests on campus based onadministrative technicalities, in an effort to appease right-wing forces. The policies and rules that the MIT administration isselectively weaponizingagainst pro-Palestine voices are setting a precedent for how MIT deals with any form of student protest, civil disobedience, or speech that substantially challenges the status quo. The MIT community should retain its right to organize and protest on campus. Our campus has a rich and creative tradition of student protest – a tradition that includesboycotts against on-campus housing costs,die-ins for Black lives,stud occupations for anti-war defectors, andshanty-town displays protesting MIT’s support of South African apartheid. The student movement for Palestine will not waver. We will not allow external political pressures to suppress our community’s collective ability to voice our conscience, as we shoulder the collective responsibility to build a better world. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., let us not use our voice to build an institution that has “guided missiles and misguided men”. Instead, let us vote YES for a ceasefire, YES for ending MIT’s complicity with the Israeli military, and YES for ending the attacks against students on campus that speak up for Palestine. Together, let us use our voice to vote YES because we, as an MIT community strive to make science for liberation, not oppression. For a better MIT and a free Palestine, Science for Liberation Campaign Team: Undergraduate students,Hannah Didehbani, Amira Ravshanova, and Jonathan Anziani The full resolution text can be viewedhere."

crimson_2024_26,"The Faculty of Arts and Sciences isconsidering a proposalto move up the deadline to add a course and to push the deadline to change a course’s grading basis to pass-fail. While the impact of these changes may pale in comparison to the introduction of previous-term registration, they will have far reaching consequences. It seems that, once again, administrators areputting themselves first. Undergraduates should be alarmed by the FAS’s latest plans to take away even more flexibility from students. The imposition of previous-term registration has made course registration far worse for students, adding stress during a busy part of the semester with no clear benefit. Students, while still experiencing the impacts of prior-term registration for the first time, should not allow administrators to slip two changes — fundamentally affecting our course selection — past us. This isn’t the first time the FAS has made drastic changes during tumultuous times: They axed shopping week right after temporary changes implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic rocked institutional memory. It is vital that the aftershocks of prior-term registration not prevent us from seeing the FAS’s latest plans for what they are. Moving up the deadline to add a course to the third Monday of the semester, as the proposal recommends, would have serious negative consequences for students. The FAS plans to continue to allow students to drop a course up to the current fifth Monday deadline — but presumably, a student dropping a class on the fifth Monday will want to add a class to take its place. Hence, the FAS’s plan would de facto prohibit dropping courses after the third Monday or require that students add additional courses earlier in the semester — and, critically, complete the work for them — with the intention of dropping some later. Either outcome unfairly burdens students, putting more stress on us to choose courses quickly and making it harder to choose the classes that fit us best. It also severely shortens the add-drop window for students cross-registering for courses at MIT — an opportunity many students use to take courses not available at Harvard — where classes often start one to two weeks later. The proposed change not only gives students less time to select and change their classes, but shifts the ability to exercise any circumstantial discretion from instructors to the Administrative Board. After three weeks, the proposal would force students to petition the Administrative Board to join a class. This disrespects our teachers, who are best equipped to determine whether it is appropriate to add a course later in the semester. Ostensibly, the FAS wants to preclude students from adding courses unreasonably late during the term, but the thoughtful judgment of professors — who best understand their course content and whether students can catch up — should protect against this. While FAS administrators seem to think their one-size-fits-all approach is better, I urge professors to have confidence that their judgment is better than a sweeping FAS policy. In my experience professors give substantial thought — at times on a case-by-case basis — to whether to allow students to join a course past a certain point. The FAS denying our professors this discretion is wrong. The FAS, to its credit, did have one strong proposal. Giving students more time — until the eleventh Monday of the semester — to decide if they want to take a course for a letter grade or on a pass-fail basis would be a huge improvement to current FAS policy. This additional flexibility would encourage intellectual exploration and academic risk-taking, enabling students to enroll in a broader range of courses than they might otherwise. Peer institutions, such as Yale, have implemented similar policies, and it would be a shame for such a groundbreaking change to not come to fruition at Harvard. I hope the FAS has the courage to follow through with this critical proposal that would bring boundless intellectual curiosity to Harvard’s campus. I urge students not to let these proposed changes go unnoticed — and to consider carefully how each limits and expands their agency in selecting courses. Ian M.

crimson_2024_71,"This week, as Jews worldwide gather around the Seder table to celebrate the first nights of Passover, college campuses areclosing their gatesandmoving their classes onlinein response to — and in anticipation of — vitriol and violence toward Jewish students during pro-Palestine demonstrations. The Crimson reportedon Monday that the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee was suspended for “violating student organization rules”— but that doesn’t mean that student organizing efforts will suddenly cease. It’s likely that, like on campuses across the country, the opposite will occur. While inflated accusations of antisemitism on college campuses may undermine the ability to call it outwhere it actually existsin the pro-Palestine movement, the antisemitic scenes unfolding at Columbia University — and now other campuses, too — are as blatant as ever. The ongoing demonstrations are led by Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine (whose post-Oct. 7 statement makes the PSC’s words seem benign and conducted in partnership with an organization called Within Our Lifetime and a few other campus groups. WOL’s demonstrations at Columbia this weekend were advertised as “Flood Columbia For Gaza,” seemingly referencing Hamas’s name for the Oct. 7 massacre: “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.” WOL’s membership isn’t exactly full of social-justice-oriented peaceniks. Their stances are openly pro-violence, and their protests have been consistently attended by several “activists” who pleaded guilty to violent antisemitic hate crimes. Saadah Masoud, a prominent WOL protester and repeat antisemitic hate-crime offender, upon being arrested for assaulting a Jewish man at a rally, said to detectives, “All this for one Jew?” I’m sure he’s “just an anti-Zionist,” though. With people like this organizing on and around campus and actively collaborating with my classmates, I would not feel safe to wear my Star of David, much less to openly share my views, regardless of their content. The situation on Columbia’s campus is far more severe than theantisemitic incidentswe have seen thus far at Harvard, but I worry that similar circumstances could soon make their way to Cambridge. Such a threat warrants urgent reflection from our campus’ organizers. Pro-Palestine groups must acknowledge that proud extremist antisemites are joining campus protests at universities much like ours, and confront the fact that their hateful and violent theories of change are seeping into on-campus advocacy. These extremists do not care about promoting peaceful coexistence and ending the onslaught on innocent civilians in Gaza. They are there because these protest spaces have opened a conduit that is permissive of violent extremism and overt eliminationist antisemitism. It seems student organizations have allowed it, or at the very least, turned a blind eye in the name of coalition-building. That said, the students who were arrested for their specific encampment protest within Columbia’s gates — while their words and choices may be objectionable to some — were largely non-violent. Even the police said so. But non-violent is not the same as non-hateful, and a peaceful act does not negateovert antisemitism and intimidationof students on Columbia’s campus. Here, two truths can exist at once. The decision to arrest students in the encampment by Columbia’s president was an overreach of police power and did no good for campus tensions. Still, many student organizers, including at Columbia, have lost their way and are damaging their movement. If organizers on Harvard’s campus want to be an effective force for a just future for Palestinians, they must take careful note. As the war continues, too many students are succumbing to vitriol, disdain, and manichaean ideologies. At best, these organizing approaches fail to move past loose theoretical language about settler-colonialism and liberation. At worst, they come across as condoning mass violence and calling for the elimination of Jews from the region. The chaos at Columbia — which blurred the lines between student and non-student protestors and unleashed a whirlwind of antisemitismreminiscent in toneto the “Unite The Right” rally in Charlottesville, V.A. — is a prime example. If they are dedicated to peacebuilding, pro-Palestinian campus organizations — as they determine the goals of their movements, how to frame their rhetoric, and with whom to build coalitions — must reckon with an irrefutable fact: Over seven million Jews live between the river and the sea, too, and they sure as hell aren’t going “back to Poland,” where over 85 percent of the Jewish population was murdered in death camps. Simplify their existence to settler-colonialism all you want, and the fact still stands. A lasting ceasefire, Palestinian liberation, and any positive future in the region will not come from demonizing and attacking Jews and Israelis. It will not happen through eliminationist slogans and events where “Zionists are not welcome.” Boycotting Starbucks probably won’t do it either. Until that reality is fully recognized in the ethos of pro-Palestine student organizations, their voices and demands will fall on deaf ears. They will be co-opted by violent and hateful extremists, making administrators all the more emboldened to repress their non-violent demonstrations. On our campuses, we have the unique privilege of astoundingly diverse and intelligent student bodies. Our goals are best served when we treat other people with respect, afford our opponents dignity, and foster conversations across deep disagreement. Pro-Palestine student organizers must commit to these values. Otherwise, they risk repeats of the failures at Columbia, undermining their movement and making their Jewish peers unsafe in the process.

crimson_2024_88,"Today in Gaza, more than110,000 peoplehave fled Rafah as Israel launched a ground invasion of the city where it has cornered 1.4 million Palestinians. For protesting this genocide, more than 20 Harvard students, including myself, have been placed oninvoluntary leaves of absence. The impacts of involuntary leave are severe and immediate: We are currently facing the loss of housing, school funding, degrees, and visas. This move comes on the heels of over 60 students being referred to their schools’ Administrative Boards for their perceived association with the Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine coalition’s encampment in the Yard. Both waves of repression wereunprecedented in recent historyfor their severity and cruel arbitrariness. Some students placed on leave had never set foot in a tent. Others are international students who now face the prospect of deportation. All were punished for protestingour University’s complicityin Israel’s occupation of Palestine and genocide in Gaza. The sanctions follow a pattern of stonewalling from interim University President Alan M. Garber ’76. On Wednesday, Garber agreed, through backchannels and faculty intermediaries, to meet with student liaisons from the HOOP coalition for the first time in the four months of his presidency. Garber opened the meeting with a threat: If the encampment remained in Harvard Yard, involuntary leave letters would be sent out the next day. And while Garber said he would dread to bring in the police, the message was clear: It’s on the table. He made clear several times that the meeting was merely a conversation — not a path to negotiation. In the “conversation,” we asked Garber for future meetings with University officials to negotiate on our demands. We made clear that decampment would not happen unless the University moved forward on ourinitial demandsof disclosure, divestment and reinvestment, and dropped disciplinary charges against organizers — the reason we established our Liberated Zone in the first place. The meeting ended without Garber making any immediate commitments. The next morning Garber reached out, again through backchannels, with a sorry excuse for an offer: take down the encampment immediately in exchange for informational meetings about the endowment. No amnesty for the disciplined students. No disclosure. No divestment. No reinvestment. Just talk. As Garber unabashedly put it in a later email: “a conversation, not a negotiation.” We find this a disingenuous attempt to fragment our collective power through discursive traps. We don’t need a meeting about how the endowment works. In fact, we have spent years researching the intricacies of Harvard’s investments and the technicalities of divestment. What we need is simple: a genuine effort to negotiate on our demands, as we had insisted on from the start. The next day, HOOP liaisons offered Garber immediate decampment in exchange for a commitment to negotiate on a concrete set of demands. First, assess the prospects for full disclosure while establishing a public records request model. Second, phase out direct investments in companies invested in weapons manufacturing and military and surveillance technology or in the perpetuation of illegal Israeli settlements. Third, cease accepting donations from donors related to such companies, or who harass and bully students. And fourth, reinvest by creating a center for Palestine studies on campus. This list was a compromise on our original demands of full disclosure, divestment and reinvestment, and dropping charges. It was a show of good faith and an effort to find a path forward. Instead of engaging with our new asks, Garber stated unequivocally that he would “not consider” them in an email sent to us that same night. The next morning, he issued mass suspensions.Even a Crimson reporterwas sent a notice of involuntary leave, and National Lawyers Guild-certified legal observers have been subject to Administrative Board referrals. The same hour suspensions were handed down, Garber was meeting with Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt, who has built his career off of smearing and harassing Palestinians and allies of Palestinian liberation. Afterward,Greenblatt gloatedthat the ADL “welcomes” Garber’s “decision not to negotiate with those in the encampment.” Evidently, Harvard is willing to work with external actors, but not its own students. Seven months into the latest genocidal assault on Gaza, as Israel’s ground invasion of Rafah threatens to open one of the bloodiest chapters yet, we have a moral obligation to continue advocating for both the martyred and the living. Every university in Gaza has been reduced to rubble. Students and professors have been brutally killed. Our University’s endowment has, in part, funded this catastrophe. We have tried our very best, while recognizing that Palestinians deserve infinitely more, to protest this complicity. We organized rallies. We passed divestment resolutions. Weattempted a referendum. Ultimately, we set up the encampment, a non-violent, multicultural space of dissent — something Harvard promises to be but is not. We know what it would take to mutually end this encampment: meaningful engagement with our demands. Let us be clear — the only person standing in the way of the encampment coming down is Garber. No disciplinary consequence will stand between us and our commitment to a liberated Palestine. We will not rest until Harvard discloses and divests from its investments in genocide. We sleep well knowing our solidarity runs deep and our commitment remains unwavering. If Garber insists that we must do so while sleeping in tents, so be it. Rameen A.

crimson_2024_67,"All year we’ve bandied about phrases like “civil discourse,” “open inquiry,” “academic freedom,” and “free speech.” It’s time to clarify them, and what living by them requires. “Civil discourse” and “open inquiry” name an aspiration to discourse where disagreements — even fierce ones — can spark mutual learning because we engage with each other earnestly and respectfully. They promise a world where good-faith arguments, directed toward truth-seeking, bound by standards of evidence and logic, and inclusive of all perspectives, are welcome — even when they run counter to a majority point of view. If “civil discourse” and “open inquiry” are the “what” of good discourse on campus, “academic freedom” and “free speech” are the “how.” Often used interchangeably, both phrases name specific policy regimes governing types of speech, but there is a critical difference between them. Academic freedom is a creature of colleges and universities and specifically protects the right to make arguments in academic contexts, subject to review of one’s work according to scholarly standards. Free speech rights, in contrast, name a protection against governmental interference restricting speech in the public sphere. In the U.S., they are broadly defined by the First Amendment of the Constitution. The first set of protocols is organizational — The policies of universities; the second set is legal — governmental policy. Academic spaces — including classrooms, labs, seminars, and public events sponsored by academic units — should resemble a courtroom. To achieve a verdict — Latin for “speaking the truth” — trials require witnesses for both sides. So too in the academy. We should always want to hear the other side’s best arguments. This requires intellectual diversity — of methods, data sources, and normative frameworks, as well as viewpoints. The need for multiple viewpoints is why academic freedom goes hand in hand with inclusion and belonging: Protecting and supporting the participation of people with diverse identities or divergent ideologies is necessary for robust academic inquiry. But diversity of perspective doesn’t mean “anything goes.” When a journal article is submitted without appropriate pursuit of the truth, the submission may be rejected or receive a “revise and resubmit” notice, an invitation to the author to try again. Speaker panels, too, can be judged to be ill-constructed and receive notice that further work is needed before they see the light of day. These are not cases of cancellation or sanctioning — they reflect a legitimate evaluation of the contribution’s caliber with regard to truth-seeking. Similarly, policies against classroom disruption, which protect the academic freedom required to sustain inquiry, do not violate free speech rights, because the classroom is not where free speech rights apply. Instead, policies against disruption protect the right of people to make the best argument they can, from whatever their point of view may be, in pursuit of the truth. Yet free speech, including the right to protest, also matters on campus. How, why, and where should protests receive protection here? At a public university, free speech rights follow directly from First Amendment rights. The state sponsorship of universities like U.C. Berkeley or UMass-Boston makes university leaders state representatives with formal legal obligations to respect free speech. But at a private university, free speech rights are a privilege granted by the university in a public-spirited effort to contribute additional public spaces to those otherwise available for political debate — street corners, parks, some coffee shops, the Internet, and so on. Though Harvard was founded by officials of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and technically continues to be legally accountable to the state legislature, Harvard is nonetheless considered a private university. As such, it is out of a public-spirited orientation that our University treats parts of the campus as the public sphere, where expression is broadly more protected than under the more constrained norms of academic freedom. Speaking loosely, free speech rights apply in spaces and to events that are both extracurricular and public. These are, of course, fuzzy categories on a campus, hence our confusion. For example: At the Harvard Kennedy School, the Institute of Politics clearly functions as a public forum, so protests against its speakers that adhere to the “time, place, and manner” restrictions on free speech on our campus can be expected and must be respected there. Other public speaker events also fall into this category, as does speech that takes place in our outdoor public space. But what about key campus rituals — from Commencement, or Match Day in the medical school, or weekly Community Teas at the Divinity School? To address these edge cases, we rely on the following principle: Wherever spaces and events are integral to academic work and experience, they should be off-limits to disruption. But perhaps this rules out too much? With our harsh winters, for instance, perhaps we need indoor spaces that can serve as public forums, with sensible restrictions? Such questions deserve our more direct attention. Maybe we need a campus map that identifies places and hours where free speech rights, rather than the protocols of academic freedom, apply. Still, even under free speech norms, it’s not the case that anything goes. The fifth value in the University’s values statement assigns us “responsibility for the bonds and bridges that enable all to grow with and learn from one another.” As an ethical matter, this value should govern how we choose to express our political views. Even when we passionately pursue a political cause, using public spaces at Harvard to do so, including Harvard-linked online fora, we do that as a member of this campus community, in compact and covenant with everyone else here. We cannot forget: Our use of these spaces is a privilege. We should pay for that privilege by taking responsibility for using them in ways that sustain healthy relationships with one another.

crimson_2024_121,"Alan M. Garber ’76 shouldn’t hold his breath waiting to receive a congratulatory card from Harvard’s pro-Palestine activists after the governing boards permanently installed him as the University’s 31st president on Friday. Activist groups already had an uneasy relationship with University leadership, but it took a turn for the worse during Garber’s interim presidency last semester as many protesters held Garber responsible for the implementation of policies that they believed sought to discourage campus protests. Since Garber took office in January, his administration has warned students about the University’sguidelines on protest and dissent,suspendedthe Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee, andrestricted accessto Harvard Yard in anticipation of an encampment. More recently, Garber’s administrationannounced new rulesthat would ban unapproved signage and unauthorized chalking on University property. Despite the restrictions on where, when, and how students are allowed to protest on campus, Harvard’s leadership has repeatedly maintained that free speech and the right to protest are “integral to the values” of the University. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment for this article. Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, an unrecognized coalition of student groups, slammed Garber in a statement. “Since day 1, Garber has only ever engaged in bad faith with students protesting this genocide, choosing to restrict protest, sanction students, and suspend our organizations instead of listening to members of the Harvard community who are mourning loss and are enraged at the institutions role in this violence,” HOOP wrote. The group insisted that its activism will continue during the fall semester and that Garber’s appointment will not deter the group from organizing future protests. “This new development means very little to us — no university administrator and no rights and responsibilities will stop the student intifada and the movement for Palestinian liberation and divestment,” HOOP wrote. The lowest point in the relationship between Garber and HOOP came during the 20-daypro-Palestine encampment in Harvard Yardas protesters harshly criticized Garber as an unusually oppressive University leader toward campus activism. Rosie P. Couture ’26, an organizer with the Harvard Feminist Coalition, said that “under Garber’s leadership, students organizing for Harvard’s divestment from the occupation of Palestine and the ongoing genocide in Gaza were harassed, unprotected, unjustly punished, and largely ignored.” Members of the encampment marched to Garber’s private residence on twoseparateoccasionsin May, where they chanted “Alan Garbage.” Members of HOOP also created a posterdepicting Garber as a devil. Garber, who is Jewish, was portrayed in the poster with horns and a tail. HOOP later took down the poster after affiliates criticized the drawing as antisemitic. Pro-Palestine protesters have also repeatedly accused Garber of reneging on a dealto end the 20-day encampmentin May after dozens of undergraduate students weresuspended or placed on probationfor their involvement in the protest. In fact, Garber had only agreed to reinstate studentsfrom involuntary leaves of absencesand expedite disciplinary cases against the student protesters. The Administrative Board — which is responsible for the application and enforcement of Harvard College policies —barred 13 seniors from graduatingon the day before Commencement over pending disciplinary charges, infuriating students and faculty members. The controversy, whichsparked a walkoutandfaculty rebellionagainst the Ad Board, ended when the Ad Boardreduced probations and reversed the suspensionsearlier this summer. At least11 of the suspended seniorshave since received their Harvard diplomas. Hossameldin “Hossam Nasr” Mabed ’21, a member of Harvard Alumni for Palestine, wrote in a statement that the events of last semester give “a clear indication of the direction Harvard will seek under Garber’s presidency: the same policy of repression and intimidation.” “However, while Garber and the Corporation may continue to try to suppress our movement, we know that our movement will only grow stronger, as the more they try to silence us, the louder our voice gets,” Mabed added. “Whether under Garber or any other president, we will continue to hold our alma mater accountable for its support and funding for apartheid and genocide.” While several activists agreed that their protest efforts would continue regardless of who holds the presidency, some still said they were unhopeful that significant progress could occur under a Garber presidency. “Whatever,” wrote Syd D. Sanders ’24 in response to a request for comment about Garber’s appointment. Sanders was part of the group of seniors in May who were prevented from graduating over their involvement in the encampment. Noa Sepharia, a recent graduate of Harvard Divinity School, said that her immediate reaction to the announcement was “dread for the Harvard community.” “He was viciously anti-Palestinian and his actions favored external political influences over the well being of Harvard’s community,” Sepharia wrote. “He was a hindrance to important dialogue that needs to happen on campus, namely why so much of our endowment is invested in weapons of death instead of its students.” Still, some activists hoped that time — and job security — could change Garber’s approach. “Garber’s legacy so far is not one of safety, justice, or freedom for students,” Couture wrote. “But he has three years to redefine his legacy.” —Staff writer Michelle N.

crimson_2024_30,"Defining disability is tricky. U.S. Census Bureau data from 2021 indicates that around 13 percent of the population has a disability. A different estimate, from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suggests up to 27 percent. A third, from a survey of U.S. employers, found that just over 4 percent of employees self-identified as disabled in 2023, considerably less than any other estimate. Regardless of the statistics, there are countless biotech companies that produce products to treat such disabilities. This industry has brought positive awareness to visible and invisible disabilities alike. From eyesight and hearing loss, to Crohn’s disease, cerebral palsy, and speech disorders — they are working to improve the quality of life for those affected. They seem to have good intentions. However, good intentions are not always enough, and do not always prevent harmful rhetoric surrounding disability. They can sometimes even enforce it. The language used by biotech companies to discuss disability and promote their products often imply necessity — that the consumer needs their product in order to better their life. This messaging must go. A company that produces hearing aids states that their products will open the door for users to create meaningful relationships — as if deaf or hard-of-hearing people could not otherwise. Another company says that it helps people who stutter “get the speech therapy they need.” A 2019 Forbes article calls blindness a “cruel fate,” emphasizing the miracle of new treatments. But Kimberly Ha, a founder and CEO who also happens to be blind in one eye, finds her disability empowering, laughing off people who say they re sorry about her eyesight. Anita Cawley, a clinical research firm vice president who has cerebral palsy, thinks that her attitude towards her disability has helped her career. And regardless of whether or not my own stuttering is considered a disability (there have been conversations about what level of severity constitutes a disability , I have never sought out speech therapy or truly wanted it, despite how necessary others believe it is. There is nothing wrong with wanting assistance through cochlear implants or speech assistant devices. I do not doubt these devices’ value to those who choose them. But when it is implied that change is necessary, disability inherently becomes a flaw. This mentality speaks to the inability of society to adapt to individual differences more than it does to the needs of the person themselves. Over the past 50 years, the public’s understanding of disability has shifted. The “social model of disability” grew in prominence, putting forth the idea that disability is created by systemic hurdles and societal exclusion rather than a fault of the person themselves. Because of growing public acceptance and accommodation of disability — which pushes back against a culture that has long labeled people with disabilities as “other than” — I have been able to regard speech therapy as unnecessary. I am allowed to center my focus on matters I find more pressing, no longer struggling to change myself through therapy that, though helpful for some, did not help me. It has also allowed countless others to find acceptance within themselves. I now look at the biotech industry from a different perspective. I am skeptical of advertising and saddened when youth with speech disorders refuse to speak. I find myself wondering if some technologies serve the user or the comfort of those around them more. I do not intend to imply any moral wrongness in the research or product development of these companies. Many have made important advances and support disability advocacy, as well as offer help to those who want it. My point is only that we cannot forget “to those who want it” — that the help society offers those with disabilities often creates the impression that they need to be “helped” in the first place. Every disability is different. Every disability can affect someone in a multitude of ways. Every person with a disability can have a different attitude toward that disability. While I can not apply my experience to everyone, I can say this: Biotech companies, and those at Harvard who will consider working in the industry, remember that consumers are unique people with unique experiences. Recognize their right to accept themselves as they are, without aid, and consider consulting with them before your advertisements go public. Inclusion begins with the wording we choose. April S.

ubyssey_2024_26,"Jan. 23, 2024 Written byTatum Narode Before ever stepping foot on campus, many of those who have accepted their offers of admission to UBC find themselves excited and anxious to learn everything they can about their prospective social lives in Vancouver. Fueled by an obsessive curiosity and desire to connect with other students who are in the same position, many take to the internet. At this point, it is almost inevitable that one well-connected student will have created an Instagram account with a username (e.g. @ubc_2026 to serve as a rallying call for the incoming class. Followers will message the account’s administrator with their own Instagram profile to be reposted — often with a flashy caption in hopes of finding common interests, areas of study, hometowns and so on. Even those who choose not to share their personal information may spend hours scrolling through the profiles on these accounts, searching for potential roommates or simply studying faces in hopes of recognizing one or two around campus. Ultimately, decisions on when to start making new connections, who to connect with and the platform with which to connect are all by Instagram’s design. After meeting someone new in a class, at a club event or in a coffee line, someone usually always asks, “Do you have Instagram?” to show interest in staying connected with whoever they’ve met. Afterwards, by virtue of campus culture, students are expected to spend a few minutes scanning through their new friend’s profile to check for mutual followers, read the bio message they’ve published and even allow the contents of the profile to amend whatever first impressions had been previously established. Still, if the answer to this leading question is ‘No, I don’t use Instagram,’ or ‘Sure, but I barely use it,’ the absence of a social media presence can lead to a whole host of different assumptions to be made about someone’s character. Although normalized, this type of interaction can feel awkward and even inescapable. Awkward in that perhaps one’s profile feels too personal to share with a stranger, and inescapable in that Instagram is so widely used and its features (especially the messaging features are convenient for connecting students across such a large school. Profiles tend to display a version of ourselves, far enough removed from authenticity as to charm and entertain strangers. Left unchecked, constantly viewing and editing one’s profile to fit in with ever-changing trends and norms heightens self-consciousness and often leads students to compare themselves to their peers. Further, on a campus so crowded, it is hard for current students to imagine life without group chats. The first instinct felt by many when it comes to organizing study sessions, intramural sports teams or holiday parties is to make a group chat. Nowhere is it easier to make a group chat with a large number of people than on Instagram. It connects people across device types and service providers, and removes the barrier of tracking down phone numbers. In the most extreme case, an entirely new profile may be created to advertise a party or a new course offering. This type of communication is exciting in how it connects people who may have not met before but simultaneously depersonalizes communication. Situations like these contribute to the dizzying effect of rapidly cycling between feelings of deep social connection and staggering isolation, which accompany living independently for the first time in most students’ lives. As such a widely-used platform among students, Instagram is responsible for temporary hits of relevance while also memorializing old posts and messages which fill us with nostalgia and keep us competing for the next best experience. Plus, it facilitates the circulation of information on campus with ease and efficiency unparalleled by any other physical or digital media. Students can view job ads, resources for navigating challenging times (ranging from winter storms to international conflict and community news within minutes of opening the app. This inundation of information changes how much content students are viewing and how they engage with it. Students’ engagement informs Instagram’s algorithm of how to curate their future recommended content so that usage will increase and the cycle will continue. It is almost inevitable for students, stressed by new expectations and responsibilities, to look to Instagram for distraction and a sense of connection. However, the endless stream of content designed to spark strong emotions, from news-related posts with inflammatory headlines to well-intentioned highlight reels from a friend’s recent vacation, may actually do little to comfort these students. Scrolling through Instagram, more often than not, perpetuates feelings of isolation and mediocrity. Viewing other people’s lives through the distorted mirror of Instagram changes how students experience their own lives and the type of experiences they seek out in the first place. Even experiences that call for total engagement such as hiking or dancing at a concert can become performative for the purpose of being able to share the event on Instagram afterwards — or sometimes even during. Students who otherwise may not have felt inclined to participate in these events may feel peer pressure to do so to share their clips on social media, for better or worse. If student life at UBC were to be viewed as a stone arch, the institution’s first hundred years contribute the height to the two main pillars, but Instagram acts as the keystone that has allowed the current campus culture to bear weight. If this keystone were to be suddenly removed, many students would be forced to practice new methods of staying informed and connected within student life and culture aside from Instagram. In this way, Instagram can be seen as a depiction of student life with an unrelenting hold on the lives it touches. This article is a commentary.

stanforddaily_2024_14,"I’m proud to be one of the many Stanford student organizers working to advance California billAB 1780, which would penalize California colleges that practice legacy and donor preference.Class Action, a grassroots organization leading a national campaign to end legacy preference, helped introduce the bill at a press conference in Sacramento, and more recentlytestifiedto the Committee on Higher Education. The organization was founded by Stanford graduate Ryan Cieslikowski and consists of organizers working on nearly every Ivy+ campus, including Stanford. Alyssa Murray, Class Action organizer and co-president of Stanford’s Black Student Union, introduced the bill alongside the author, Assemblymember Phil Ting, at a Capitol press conference in February. Murray said, “preferential treatment to applicants with donor and alumni ties to universities is key to upholding the larger system of inequitable access to secondary education for minority and low-income applicants.” The Supreme Court’s overturn of race-conscious admissions has jeopardized the ability of top universities to ensure diversity within their incoming classes. While race-conscious practices meant to protect diversity and redress centuries of racial discrimination have been formally erased from college admissions, legacy applicants and children of donors continue to have a leg up. There is a dearth of data on the racial makeup of legacy admits, but we know that at Harvard, between 2010 and 2015,70 percentof admitted legacy students were white. Justfour percentwere Black. Opportunity Insights, a research organization led by former Stanford professor Raj Chetty,foundthat children from families in the top 1% are two times as likely to attend an Ivy+ college as applicants from the middle class with comparable SAT and ACT scores. Legacy admissions, the study reports, is the single leading driver of this disparity of access at Ivy+ schools, whichadmitmore students from the top 1% than the bottom fifty. Sophie Callcott, Class Action organizer and Stanford legacy student recognized, “If we’re setting aside a portion of each undergraduate class for already-privileged donor and legacy students — especially as these schools get increasingly selective in their admissions processes — is that not just a tacit endorsement of aristocracy?” Stanford’s annual admissionsreportin 2020 found that 17.8% of Stanford admits were either legacy students or children of donors. An elite college education is a powerful tool for upward social mobility, but with legacy preference in admissions benefitting white and wealthy applicants, colleges disproportionately work to prevent downward mobility for our nation’s most privileged. Ending legacy admissions isn’t just about fairness; it’s also a strategic move at a time when Americans are skeptical that institutions of higher education have their best interests at heart. According toGallup, trust in colleges and universities is at an all time low, and legacy practices, which are widespread across500 collegesnationwide, only exacerbate this issue. By perpetuating a system that favors the already privileged, these institutions discourage participation in higher education among underserved communities who feel the odds are stacked against them from the start. Stanford is designated as a nonprofit and receives immense public subsidies as a result. It’s incumbent upon us to ensure that it earns that privilege by implementing fair admissions policies. It’s time for them to live up to their rhetoric and level the playing field for all students. Hearings for AB 1780 are underway and Stanford student voices are essential in passing a bill that’s long overdue. Use your voice to call for the end of legacy admissions practices in California.

crimson_2024_31,"Most proposals to make Harvard more inclusive are either expensive (campus expansion or illegal (race-based affirmative action . Broader access to higher education is certainly a goal worth striving for. But many reforms, if enacted, would ultimately have little-to-no impact on most people. Every year, hundreds of thousands of high school graduates apply to colleges and receive zero acceptances. Even the more ambitious proposals — enrolling an extra thousand students per year, for example — would barely make a dent in the problem. What we need is a way to extend Harvard’s reach that is not only inexpensive and legal, but that also benefits more than just the lucky few thousand our campus can house. Sounds like a pipe dream. It’s not. In fact, the solution already existed: EdX, a nonprofit online education platformfounded in 2012by Harvard and MIT has offered classes to millions of learners worldwide since its inception, totally free of charge. Flash forward to 2023 and the schoolshave sold edXto a for-profit company now at risk of bankruptcy, endangering the future of accessible online higher education. Let me explain. To Harvard students, CS50 — the University’s crash course to computer science — holds repute as one of the campus’ largest courses and perhaps its most over-the-top lecture class, complete witha capella performances, an all-nighter hackathon, and a visit from Boston Dynamics’ robotic dog. Outside of Harvard’s campus, though, CS50 is known as the world’s most popular online course. It’s frequently recommended on “best online coding courses” lists, and for good reason. Every lecture is available in ultra-HD, and the course offers graded problem sets, recorded sections, and options to interact with your classmates, ask questions, or even say hello to professor David J. Malan ’99 himself! It’s impressive stuff. It’s also free. Since its first online offering through edX in 2012, more than 5.4 million individuals around the world have learned to code with CS50. Malan’s course was one of the platform’s first. Over the next decade, edX partnered with dozens of the world’s best universities to host more than 3,500 courses for 40 million learners. It was a stunning display of how impactful digital learning can really be. But in 2021, Harvard and MIT sold edX to a for-profit corporation for $800 million. In the sale, the corporation promised to keep their courses free — for five years, that is. That corporation, 2U Inc., was the target of arecent lawsuitalleging it had used falsified data to attract students to programs co-hosted with the University of Southern California. A former professor who was slated to administer a program with 2U, Ashley Bell, claimed that the company aimed to use their course as a “cash cow,”saying 2U “made it obvious that they didn’t care about the quality of the program” when she resigned in protest. Time is ticking. In two years, 2U’s agreement to keep courses on edX free will expire. One can imagine what a for-profit education corporation will do when it is allowed to charge for Harvard lectures. But, even more concerningly, it seems 2U might be going under. Its stock price has declined 99 percent in the past five years, it last reported nearly a billion dollars in debt, and it’s made significant layoffs since acquiring edX. 2U has itselfreported concernsabout its ability to stay afloat. Bankruptcy would leave millions of learners in the dust, including the tens of thousands of students in the official degree-granting programs universities contract 2U to host on its digital infrastructure. It would be — by all measures — a catastrophe. Harvard seems to recognize that this hole should not go unfilled — or at least it purports to. With the $800 million from edX’s sale, Harvard and MITlaunched a new nonprofitcalled Axim Collaborative that aims to build on edX’s “commitment to educational equity,” but I’m skeptical. Why try to fix something that wasn’t ever broken? Their plan to fund the nonprofit offers a telling indication: Harvard and MIT plan to limit their expenses on the project to only cash generated from the interest on edX’s sale. They’ve offered few details on their plans for Axim, leaving some concerned about its ability to offer a real replacement for edX. It’s a far cry from the ambitious goals they had for edX and a disappointing betrayal of then-Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith’slofty promisefor edX to “change the way education is done across the world.” It’s also a discouraging sign for the online education movement more generally: Two of the world’s most prestigious universities selling their online education brainchild is assuredly demotivating for other institutions who may have sought to universalize their own courses. The story of edX has demonstrated the difficulties of democratizing access to knowledge, but there is no need to end the story here. The online education revolution still holds great promise — so long as it is not overrun by ruinous profit-seeking. As the promise of edX fades, Harvard must ensure that its original mission — making the world’s best education available to everyone — doesn’t fade with it. Chanden A.

ubyssey_2024_27,"Jan. 18, 2024 Written byHicham Safieddine Dr. Hicham Safieddine is an associate professor in the Department of History and the Canada Research Chair in the History of the Modern Middle East. Editor s Note:This letter is in reply to the letter, “A response to Decolonize Palestine at UBC and a call for compassion and nuance at UBC,” written by Drs. Richard Menkis and Jessica Hanser responding to an opinion, “Decolonize Palestine at UBC,” written by the author here. In their “response” to my op-ed titledDecolonize Palestine at UBC, Drs. Richard Menkis and Jessica Hanser made egregious accusations commonly hurled at those speaking out about Palestine. These include claims that I “distorted” events and used “inflammatory language” that can “harm and intimidate the members of our community.” They argued the views I expressed lacked compassion, fair-mindedness, nuance, and analytical complexity. My “rhetoric,” they protested, was exclusionary and “doesn’t reach across the aisle.” Unlike the authors whose areas of expertise are elsewhere, I have lived experience in, study, teach and research the Middle East. Since my appointment at UBC more than two years ago, neither faculty member has reached out - literally across the aisle - to engage in dialogue or ask a question about Palestine or the Middle East. Had they inquired, I would have gladly shared sources, methodologies, and perspectives on the subject, and would have invited them to sit in my classes if they had wished to. Their polemics notwithstanding, I believe that their response offers a teaching moment to all of us on what decolonizing education means, both in general and in relation to teaching Palestine. Decolonization is not a metaphor or a convenient slogan waved by university presidents, deans, or faculty to sound progressive in course descriptions, holiday messages, or on departmental websites. Nor is it paying lip service to words like compassion or inclusivity. Decolonizing education is a practice and a pedagogy. It is a way of being and a way of knowing. It seeks to unlearn many assumptions, methodologies, and discourses that constitute part of an elaborate architecture of knowledge. These systems of knowledge evolve over time according to the acceptable norms and the urgent needs of the hegemonic culture in which they are produced. In the Western Academy, this architecture was developed over decades to defend and justify systems of class-based, gendered, and racialized political orders of domination, exploitation, and oppression. In the past half-century, many of these colonial and Eurocentric systems of knowledge have been critically analyzed. Credit is largely due to the contribution of Global South scholars including Palestinian intellectual Edward Said, author ofOrientalism. The Western tradition of orientalism awards the gatekeepers of Western knowledge the right to speak authoritatively about other peoples without adequate knowledge of their language, culture, or history. This right is afforded to them all the while depicting non-Western inquiry as lacking fairmindedness, neutrality, objectivity, complexity and evidence-based analysis. In short, lacking reason. Orientalist scholars will make these accusations while they themselves use reductive assumptions or normative claims, ignore the evidence, or reproduce the same tropes they accuse the non-Western other of committing. The critique of my terminology by Drs. Menkis and Hanser is a case in point. My reference to what happened on October 7 as a “Hamas operation” is decried biased, but the authors’ adoption of Israeli terminology depicting what has been happening since as an “Israel-Hamas War” rather than an Israel-Palestine war or an Israeli genocidal war, is apparently fair-minded. In addition, it matters less from an orientalist lens whether the views or political consciousness of colonized subjects change over time. These subjects have no history and thereby no future. Textual evidence is cited only to be summarily dismissed. The discussion of theHamas charter, which is cited in the authors’ response, not my op-ed, is another case in point. The founding charter of 1988 is mentioned as reflective of Hamas’ thinking more than three decades after its publication. By contrast, the 2017 amended charter of Hamas is dismissed as disingenuous, a staple characteristic attributed to colonized peoples. The authors claim that the 2017 charter shows that Hamas is “still blaming Jews (this time Zionists for antisemitism.” They do not specify which article of the charter says so. Let us look at the most relevant language in the new charter cited by the authors. Article 16 clearly says Hamas is in conflict “with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion. Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine. Yet, it is the Zionists who constantly identify Judaism and the Jews with their own colonial project and illegal entity.” Article 17 goes on to say that “Hamas rejects the persecution of any human being or the undermining of his or her rights on nationalist, religious or sectarian grounds. Hamas is of the view that the Jewish problem, anti-Semitism and the persecution of the Jews are phenomena fundamentally linked to European history and not to the history of the Arabs and the Muslims or to their heritage.” Despite this language, as far as the charter is concerned, it appears that the conflation between Jews and Zionists, itself a Zionist position, is in the authors’ mind. For orientalists, colonized peoples – whether militants or professors - are incapable of speaking for themselves or knowing their best interests. They need to be given a “voice,” as long as this voice echoes the narrative of the colonizer. In the case of Palestine, the liberal Zionist narrative is the not-so-complex argument, often repeated in mainstream media rather than serious scholarship, that extremists on both sides are to blame for prolonging the conflict. The asymmetric power dynamic between colonizer and colonized, not to be confused with simplistic histories of colonization, is denied as a frame of understanding. No such “complex” framing — as the authors utilize — is applied by progressive liberals in relation to the histories of antisemitic pogroms, slavery, Canadian residential schools, or other cases of racial persecution or colonial oppression, and rightly so. But as I stated in my original op-ed, the symptoms of Progressive except for Palestine, remain entrenched in the academy. In relation to Palestine, posing a moral equivalence between colonized and colonizer - by blaming the “extremist leadership of both sides Israelis and Palestinians”- tends to erase the root cause of the conflict. This root cause is the system of Israeli apartheid built by Zionist dispossession, ethnic cleansing, and occupation of Palestinian land that predates October 7 by more than a century and Hamas by decades. Historiographies of Palestine written by scholars of all stripes (Palestinians, Arabs, Israeli, non-Israeli Jews, and many others , attest to this long history and persistent presence of Zionist colonization and apartheid from the river to the sea, and by human rights organizations respected in the West likeHuman Rights WatchandB’Tselem,hardly Hamas organs. If university educators are serious about decolonization, they need to teach and engage with these histories. This is in fact what many teach-ins, peaceful student rallies, and other forms of active learning at UBC have sought to do since October 7. Rather than smear these events from the comfort of their offices or remotely, opponents should point to concrete cases of organizers or active participants engaging in hateful speech. The Vancouver Chapter of Independent Jewish Voiceshas said“it has been their experience that the Palestine Solidarity Movement goes out of its way to condemn all instances of such behaviour, including manifestations of antisemitism.” Crying wolf repeatedly will not make a wolf appear. Above all, decolonization is a moral and political commitment to the peoples resisting oppression beyond abstract debates and arguments. Gaza is still burning under Israeli relentless bombardment of homes, schools, hospitals, roads, and every living creature in between. That is the real conflagration of unspeakable horror that needs to stop, not the “inflammatory” language exposing it and supporting the legendary resistance of the Palestinian people seeking freedom and dignity against all odds.

crimson_2024_120,"Alan M. Garber ’76 comes into the Harvard presidency armed with a stacked resume: three degrees from Harvard and one from Stanford, time on both faculties, and more than a decade serving as Harvard’s second-highest administrator. It might just be enough to spare him from the condemnation that befell former Harvard President Claudine Gay, whose last weeks in the presidency were marked by scrutiny of her academic scholarship and allegations of plagiarism. Before being thrown into a chaotic interim presidency, Garber was the longest-serving provost in Harvard’s history, serving as the University’s chief academic officer for 12 years. Alongside extensive administrative experience, Garber boasts a remarkable academic record: He is an acclaimed physician, a renowned professor in both economics and medicine, and a prolific researcher cited by thousands. “His academic credentials are impeccable,” said Thomas D. Parker ’64, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy. With his expertise in medicine, Garber brings a long-missing academic background back to Massachusetts Hall. He is the first University president to have an academic background in the sciences since James B. Conant, Class of 1914, a former Crimson editor and Harvard Chemistry professor who helmed the University from 1933 to 1953. As an undergraduate student at Harvard College, Garber studied economics, despite initially being interested in concentrating in biology. He remained in Cambridge for nearly a decade, receiving both masters and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard. While pursuing his Ph.D. in economics, Garber enrolled in medical school at Stanford University. Since then, he has hopped from coast to coast, completing his medical training at Brigham and Women’s Hospital before being appointed to professorships in economics, medicine, and health policy at Stanford. “I would describe him as a social scientist — an elite social scientist — and an excellent clinician all wrapped up into one,” said Dana P. Goldman, a professor of Health Economics at the University of Southern California, for whom Garber was a thesis advisor and mentor. In total, Garber has authored over 150 academic papers and garnered almost 20,000 citations. The breadth of his scholarship dwarfs that of Gay, who published fewer than a dozen articles since completing her dissertation. Garber began his academic career mainly focused on researching heart disease and antibiotic resistance. But in the late ’90s, his scholarship shifted towards blending his health care expertise with his economics background. “He was considered by many people as the best health economist of his generation,” Stanford professor and Garber’s former colleague Douglas K. Owens said. Garber is considered a pioneer in cost-effectiveness analysis, specifically with regards to how the assessment of medical technology can impact health care spending. While in the past physicians would continue providing care until there was no more benefit — “do no harm was kind of where we stopped,” Goldman said — Garber’s research established that there should be limitations. “What Alan’s research has been about is saying there are costs to doing that. And we don’t have unlimited resources,” Goldman added. While Garber was at Stanford, he was “often turned to by university leadership” because “he cared about institutions,” according to John W. Rowe, a professor of health policy at Columbia who worked closely with Garber when they were at Stanford. Rowe added that when Garber served on search committees for faculty at Stanford, he was known to be skilled at evaluating potential hires, an asset he brings along to the Harvard presidency. “He’s got terrific judgment about people. He really can assess individuals and identify talent,” said Rowe. Richard P. Chait, a higher education expert and professor emeritus at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that Garber’s experience in higher education at and outside of Harvard equips him to lead. “Over the years, Harvard has been well served by presidents who maybe have not had their whole careers at Harvard, but have that first hand experience with the institution,” Chait said. “He has a deserved reputation as an even-handed, balanced, unflappable individual,” he said. In 2011, Garber returned to Cambridge after almost 25 years at Stanford to become Harvard’s fourth provost, as well as holding professorships at Harvard’s Medical School, Kennedy School, School of Public Health, and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Garber’s background as both a scientific researcher and a Harvard alum uniquely positions him to understand the University’s culture. “His most impressive credential is that he’s a summa cum laude graduate of Harvard College,” Parker said. Roy Y. Chan, a professor at Lee University who studies higher education, echoed Parker’s sentiment, saying that Garber’s student experience allows him to “understand the culture” and “challenges that are facing the institution.” “Because he did his bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degree at Harvard, I think he does have not just political leverage but also some experience understanding students,” Chan added. Rowe said that at Stanford, Garber “was exceptional at fostering young scholars” and “really enjoys nurturing young people.” Garber’s background in science could allow him to connect with an even greater part of Harvard’s campus than the traditional social science background of many previous Harvard presidents. Increasingly, university presidents hail from a STEM field, according to Chan. “They hire them because one, they not only produce good research, but two, they have proven themselves academically to lead the institution to a prestigious level in terms of getting millions of dollars of research funding from philanthropic foundations and corporations,” he added. Reporting in publications focused on higher education suggests that university presidents with a background in the sciences experiment more with their leadership. Harvard’s last president from the sciences, Conant, was regarded as transformative for promoting a more diversified student body, allowing women more opportunities for education, and adopting standardized testing for admission. Since assuming the presidency, Garber has launchedinaugural task forcesto address antisemitism and Islamophobia and adopted apolicy of institutional restraint. Garber’s background in medicine may also allow him to better interface with the Longwood campus than past presidents. “He’s now president of a university that has a vast medical school with 8,000 faculty, and all these huge hospitals, and he understands the practice of medicine,” said Rowe. “That is a noteworthy characteristic.” Science has also become a kind of lingua franca in academia, according to a number of HMS professors whovoiced supportfor a president with a STEM background. In March, HMS Dean George Q. Daley ’82endorsedGarber for a similar reason — that the prominence of technology makes scientific expertise increasingly relevant. Garber’s ability to cross the aisles of academic disciplines within the environment of Harvard is an asset for his leadership. “He could interact in all those communities and with all those people,” Goldman said. “And you’d have lawyers and economists and physicians and business people and ethicists all in the same room talking about the same issues.” “It’s very unusual to have an individual with this kind of multi-dimensional breadth,” Rowe said. “It’s going to serve us very well.” Garber’s impressive academic background may come under less criticism than Gay experienced during her tenure, according to several experts on higher education. “This is a very difficult time to be a university president. There seems as if there will always be some segment of the population, some constituency that s disgruntled about some issue,” said Chait. Having served as interim president, Garber has already faced intense scrutiny from the public andCongress— and has emerged largely unscathed. “The fact that he’s been there for such a long time as provost means that he’s a harder target,” Parker said. “People like Virginia Foxx, if they had been able to go after him, they would have already,” he added, referring to the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce that has beeninvestigating antisemitism on campus. Garber’s personal background may also diminish the risk of attacks on his academic record. Over the past year, conservative activists such as Christopher F. Rufo have attacked Harvard’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and targeted plagiarismaccusations against Black female scholarsat Harvard. While Chan acknowledged that Garber and Gay’s very different backgrounds makes comparing them difficult, he did say it was “possible that he may not receive as much criticism as Gay would.” “Of course, we know that — you know — one is a woman, one is a man. One is white, one is Black,” he added. Chan added that, given the explosive controversy surrounding the alleged plagiarism in Gay’s work, Garber and his academic publications will have been more scrutinized by Harvard to avoid a repeat debacle. “The hope is that he’s pretty bulletproof,” said Parker. —Staff writer William C.

crimson_2024_89,"Last Friday, the Harvard Administration placed20 students on “involuntary leave” — a bland term for suspension without due process — based on their participation in the Gaza Solidarity encampment in Harvard Yard. This aggressive response is a mistake that Harvard will regret. We are the four Harvard Law students who participated in the 2001 sit-in during the Harvard Living Wage Campaign. For 21 days, we, along with dozens of other University students, occupied Massachusetts Hall, demanding fair wages for all University workers. In many ways, our demonstrations were strikingly similar to the pro-Palestinian protests today. Many students slept in tents outside the building to support us. We organized daily pickets, some of which drew up to 2,000 people. We held a candlelight vigil. Our efforts, which were entirely peaceful, made it into the national press. But back then, Harvard recognized the groundswell of support behind our demands, and was compelled to engage. We held extensive negotiations with the administration and left Massachusetts Hall with the promise that the school would create a committee to recommend wage changes. Given public scrutiny and support, Harvard had to show considerable restraint during the demonstrations. The police entered Massachusetts Hall repeatedly but never used or threatened force. We were officially reprimanded by the Administrative Board of Harvard Law School, and the undergraduate students who participated in the sit-in received nothing more than a few weeks of disciplinary probation. The administration ultimately heard, acknowledged, and engaged with students’ demands on behalf of Harvard’s lowest-paid workers. The current administration could learn something from the lessons of 20 years ago. We believe Harvard grievously underestimates support for the current movement. Both Brown University and Rutgers University have already negotiated with pro-Palestinian protestors, recognizing the political significance and urgency of this moment. Evergreen State College and Trinity College Dublin reportedly agreed to divestment. These institutions responded to students’ concerns about university investments in companies connected to the Israeli occupation, and the slaughter, starvation, and mass displacement of Palestinians, as part of what some experts regard as a genocide. Harvard must follow their lead. Unfortunately, thus far, Harvard seems intent on an aggressive posture. In a University-wide email last week, President Alan M. Garber ’76 claimed that the protesters, which ask Harvard to come to the table and discuss divestment, favor “the voices of a few over the rights of many who have experienced disruption in how they learn and work at a critical time of the semester.” Given that Harvard students advocating for justice in Palestine have been doxxed and targeted for months, dismissing those still willing to protest as “the few” is disingenuous. Notably, the calls for a just and permanent ceasefire aligns with the majority of United States public opinion, according to arecent survey. The Gaza encampment protest, like the Living Wage Campaign over 20 years ago, amplifies the voices of the many — the marginalized for whom Harvard would rather disavow responsibility — and brings them into the conversation. Our experiences during the Living Wage Campaign, our participation in the sit-in, and the reactions of Harvard University and Harvard Law School profoundly influenced each of us. Our education would have been very different had we not engaged in civil disobedience in the service of justice and had we not seen how power and privilege react when challenged. In 2001, we endured an administrative hearing rife with procedural abuse, threats, and theories of collective punishment that absurdly held us accountable for the actions of others. These practices exposed the deep hypocrisy of our law school. Now, we stand in solidarity with students who are being threatened with even more draconian penalties, imposed without even the pretense of due process. We support them, just as many administrators, faculty, elected officials, and others had our backs over 20 years ago. In 2001, students driven by a just cause compelled the Harvard Administration to come to the bargaining table and to partner with students, workers, and the community to create a fairer Harvard. It would be sensible and strategic for the University to act in good faith again today. Aaron D. Bartley, Faisal I. Chaudhry, Fatma E. Marouf, and Ashwini Sukthankar participated in the 2001 Harvard Living Wage Campaign as students at Harvard Law School."
crimson_2024_66,"In high school I was terrified of the SAT. I felt like it would make or break my goal of attending an elite college. The Scholastic Aptitude Test — now known as the SAT — grew out of a test designed to measure the aptitude of potential soldiers before they were admitted to the U.S. Army. Harvard later adopted the test as a means of testing the merit of potential scholarship recipients who did not come from elite, private high schools. In this way, the SAT served to diversify Harvard, evaluating candidates based on intelligence rather than their high school backgrounds, and providing opportunities for students who lacked resources. Today, these standardized tests seem to have become an entry ticket to gain admission to top colleges like Harvard — a far cry from their original intention. In an email, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Hopi E. Hoekstra announced that Harvard College is reinstating its testing requirement following four years of test-optional admissions that began during the Covid-19 pandemic. Her email seemed to reaffirm the original purpose of the test, stating that standardized test scores would provide the committee with more information about candidates, allowing them to evaluate students more equitably. While a standardized test certainly seems appropriate for this purpose, tests like the SAT and ACT are not truly equitable. Doing well on these exams has become a business, with companies like The Princeton Review providing costly preparation material for students who can afford it. An SAT prep book or course, for example, can go from around $20 to more than $5,000. While the ACT and SAT assess skills like reading, writing, and mathematics, they also test a student’s ability to adapt to the test structure. Standardized tests are not testing an individual’s knowledge, but rather their ability to master specific test-taking strategies, like moving quickly through passages and eliminating “distractors” — incorrect answers deliberately designed to mislead students. This means a comfort with the test structure is incredibly important to doing well, and access to practice resources is essential. While libraries and free online education resources like Khan Academy have made preparation materials more accessible, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds continue to be less likely to take the test, and tend to have lower scores when compared to richer students. While I do not doubt the research which has found the SAT to be a great predictor of college success, other factors, including high school grades, can be strong indicators of academic achievement too. These factors may be overlooked in applications if standardized tests become a barrier to entry in the first place. Students who demonstrate academic potential in alternative ways may lose faith in their merit and be discouraged from applying to schools like Harvard if they lack the support, funding, and opportunity to take and succeed on standardized tests. Harvard has successfully admitted several diverse, intelligent classes of students under its test-optional policy. If an individual decides not to report a standardized test, it does not necessarily mean they are withholding information that is critical to their evaluation, but rather reflects their belief that standardized tests do not represent their capabilities. While it is reasonable for Harvard to seek an objective metric to compare its applicants, it is clear that standardized tests are an inequitable way to do so. Although Harvard’s holistic admissions process claims to consider student background, school performance, and available opportunities, the process is still ambiguous. All we can conclude from the return to testing is that test scores really matter — even as they reduce people to numbers — and that is really not a good thing.

crimson_2024_70,"To Georgians, evidence of the imperial Russian threat makes itself known. One need only gaze some 60 kilometers northeast of Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital, to sight an ever-expanding Russian military presence that kidnaps civilians who happen too near. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, this evidence has developed a linguistic dimension, as Russian migrants fleeing their homeland have settled in Georgia without knowledge of the 1,500-plus-year-old native language, contesting its use in public spaces. Yet this summer, Harvard will send undergraduates to Tbilisi to study Russian. The study abroad program, which lasts two months and costs more than $10,000,invitesparticipants to “Advance your Russian-language skills while exploring Georgian and Russian culture, history, literature, and film.” While its gestures to Georgian culture reflect some level of geopolitical awareness, the program’s only credit-awarding instruction is in intermediate Russian language. A program prioritizing the study of Russian is unlikely to pay thoroughly rigorous attention to the complexities of the Russo-Georgian relationship, nor the moral pitfalls associated with utilizing Georgia as a safe haven for studying the tongue of its irredentist neighbor. And considering that Georgia’s list of official languages notably snubs Russian, a language its citizens actively decry, the endeavor borders on disingenuous. The program — surely benign in intention — should find a home where the imperial Russian threat is less salient. In 2008, Russia invaded Georgia from its northern border, killing 228 civilians and occupying 20% of Georgia’s territory. The West’s response, which rejected Georgian arms requests and limited itself to shoddy geopolitical compromises, sent a message: Georgia stands largely alone. So, no matter one’s perspective on theimmutability of identity, the Georgian population’s broad hostility toward the recent influx of Russian migrants might be expected. Georgian legislation stipulates that all business signs and advertisements must display the Georgian script and offer services in one of its two state languages (Georgian or Abkhazian . In July, anti-war protestors forced the untimely departure of a cruise ship carrying Russian passengers to the Georgian port city of Batumi, hurling eggs at its hull. And while I was in Tbilisi last summer, a passerby apparently mistook my borrowed “Pi Beta Phi” sorority t-shirt for the Russian letters “ПВФ” and accosted me. Living under a government widely criticized for being too friendly toward Russia in foreign policy and rhetoric, many Georgians have made their feelings heard. The Harvard program represents yet another affront. Even beyond the impracticalities of exposing unknowing, eager Harvardian Russian-learners to unpleasant cultural friction, a Harvard-sponsored Russian-language program in Tbilisi sends a worrying message. An internationally renowned American university actively promoting Russian study in Georgia paints a troubling picture of our country’s political elite, especially considering Harvard’s reputation for churning out U.S. foreign policy leaders. The program arguably contradicts U.S. positioning on the matter, too; then-U.S. Ambassador to Georgia Kelly Degnan stated last summer that “No one should expect Georgians to welcome people from a country that occupies 20 percent of its territory.” Far be this argument from a call for Harvard’s ties to Georgia to decrease. The Georgian Ministry of Education and Science’s$2.3 million gift, which established a Georgian Studies program at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, has funded compelling new research on a country that Western minds too often overlook. Aside from in-house scholarship, the program funds Harvard student travel to Georgia with no Russian language-learning attached. (The ethics of a developing country donating to a university with an endowment twice its own GDP are another question. Nor is the argument against learning Russian — I am nearing the completion of my second semester studying the language. The Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, which hasunequivocally condemnedthe Russian assault on Ukraine, enlists exceptional educators to teach a beautiful language. Indeed, my instruction has been commendably self-aware. When reading an adapted version of Mikhail Lermontov’s A Hero of Our Time, a novel based on the Russian colonization of the Caucasus, the class referenced Russia’s violent military history in the region. I am sure this year’s Harvard Summer Program in Tbilisi will be no different. Still, just as Harvard does not offer Azerbaijani classes in Armenia, the University should not impose itself within the context of a long-standing violent conflict. Somewhat ironically, the reinvigorated Harvard-Georgia partnership taught me how to pen this piece. I spent last summer in Tbilisi, working for a pro-democracy civil society organization on a grant awarded by the Davis Center. Interviewing government ministers in Tbilisi, exploring sixth-century monasteries in Mtskheta, imbibing qvevri wine in Kakheti, and devouring khachapuri anywhere and everywhere, I built friendships with people similar to me in all but one dimension: wariness of invasion from the north. I came to see how the ongoing linguistic invasion serves as a frightening reminder of Georgia’s geopolitical vulnerability. Let not Harvard add to this burden. Peter N.

crimson_2024_27,"Feb. 14 — good ol’ Valentine’s Day. The day of love and, for many, expressing that love. Shelves decked out in shades of pink and red. Heart-shaped boxes of chocolates — the de facto gift. Valentine’s Day sections of stores are plentiful, filled with goodies and gifts for any loved one. One trip to the Harvard Square CVS at this time of year will reveal that Valentine’s Day, like most other holidays, has grown incredibly commercialized, centering around gift-giving, rather than the celebration of love itself. The oldest “valentine” that we still have today is a poem written in 1415 by Charles, Duke of New Orleans, for his wife, who was imprisoned in a tower at the time. How endearing. Personally, if I were locked in a tower, I would be honored to receive a poem from the love of my life. What I would not appreciate, however, is a box of chocolates — an arbitrary, impersonal gesture with roots in consumerism. In 2023, Americans spent around $25.9 billion on Valentine’s Day gifts, according to the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics. $25.9 billion. That’s enough to buy every Harvard undergraduate around 100 Tesla Model 3 cars. When it comes to Valentine’s gifts, it should be the thought that counts — not the sticker price. In fact, it has to be, given that we’re college students, where it is already hard to balance finances — a challenge that is compounded by the soaring markup prices at our local establishments. Want a singular bag of Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Caramel Squares? That will cost you $7.79 at the Harvard Square CVS. An even bigger bag of the same chocolates from Target is only $5.99, but is a T-stop away. Needless to say, celebrating Valentine’s Day in this day and age might be a bit challenging for us students. Yet Valentine’s Day doesn’t need to burn holes in our pockets. The day should serve as an opportunity to express our love in creative ways, not shower those we care about with an endless amount of mass-produced goods. It seems as if we are becoming increasingly unaware that the act of gift-giving mustn’t always align with societal tendencies towards materialism. How is someone simply supposed to thoroughly express their care for another through a store-bought good? A much better alternative would be something handmade — even if it holds less monetary value. So instead of mindlessly choosing chocolates or flowers for your loved ones this Valentine’s Day, consider more meaningful modes of commemorating this romantic holiday. Perhaps this looks like a movie night or attending one of the many Valentine’s Day-themed events on campus. Even as busy college students, there are innovative — and budget-friendly — ways to spend Feb. 14 more closely aligned with the true meaning of the day. Despite all this, I do look forward to Valentine’s Day. I appreciate the idea of a day dedicated to sharing love with others. All I hope is that this Valentine’s Day, we can keep in mind that the best way to express our love and friendship is not necessarily through the exchange of objects but rather through small gestures of care.

thetech_mit_2024_20,"Note: this statement is being cross-published in the MIT Faculty Newsletter We, theMIT Jews for Ceasefire, a group of Jewish students, staff, and faculty, are writing to ask you, MIT students and community members, to challenge the widely reported claim that pro-Palestinian activism on campus constitutes an antisemitism problem. We urge you to avoid falling prey to bad-faith arguments by pro-Israel students and faculty who publicly align and collaborate with politicians and organizations whose stated goals are thedismantlingof DEI programs, thedegradationof education, and theunderminingof the labor movement. Two Jewish groups have formed on campus recently: MIT Jews for Ceasefire (J4C and the MIT Israel Alliance (MIT IA . Members of the MIT Jews for Ceasefire took part in the November 9th protest with the MIT Coalition Against Apartheid and other anti-war groups because we believed in the right of Palestinians to live in freedom and with dignity, and so we urged MIT to divest from Israel’s occupation, apartheid, and genocidal war in Gaza. Instead of the peaceful sit-in that we were expecting (protest organizers instructed attendees to bring our homework, and so we did , we were accosted by counterprotesters who projected violent imagery on a screen, yelled, pushed us, stepped on us, insulted us, andmuch more. We were harassed by other Jewish and Israeli students, staff, and faculty who either could not fathom our Jewishness or were outright derisive of it (calling us self-hating Jews, not real Jews, God’s mistake, etc. . You can read what we havewritten about that day. One counterprotester spread a since-debunked lie that the anti-war protestors prevented MIT’s Jewish students from attending classes (“It’s been falsely rumored”, page 2 . This lie has grown so virulently — boosted by MIT IA’s appearance on CNN and Fox News — that it has now captured national and congressional attention as an example of the “big problem of antisemitism in academia.” The consequences of the MIT Israel Alliance’s behavior, enabled and abetted by MIT faculty supporters, are numerous. MIT faculty and students have doxxed students expressing support for Palestine. The administrationsuspendedthe Coalition Against Apartheid, a group that had formed in the 80s to push for divestment from South African apartheid and has lobbied for similar divestment from Israel. Anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic incidents on campus havespiked.Led by the Chair of the House Republican Conference Representative Elise Stefanik, Congress has requested emails and targeted individuals for investigation. MIT police have increased both their presence and their surveillance on campus significantly. Following the protest, we learned that a number of the violent and verbally abusive counterprotesters — whose lies that day and since have put students at risk, and put MIT under national political fire — are members of the MIT Israel Alliance. Pro-Israeli activists on campus have acrybullyismproblem: faced with opposition to their nationalism and militarism, they respond violently then turn around and claim “oppression of Jewish voices.” A false binary There are many accounts of attempted or outright targeting and silencing of pro-Palestinian protesters and/or Muslim-presenting people on campus. These incidents have been perpetrated by students, faculty, and the MIT administration (some of them are recordedhere . But the MIT Israel Alliance has successfully leveraged a moral panic around campus antisemitism, with the mainstream media irresponsibly platforming MIT IA while erasing Palestinian pain and ignoring the global anti-war movement that has a growing presence on MIT campus. At the same time, the MIT administration has, to date, largely ignored Islamophobic and anti-Jewish acts committed by pro-Israel individuals. Instead, it is focusing intently on claims of antisemitism made by pro-Israel students and faculty. This public narrative perpetuates an imaginary binary: the Israeli nationalist Jewish students on one side versus Muslim/Arab/Palestinian students on the other. As a pro-Palestinian and anti-Zionist Jewish community, J4C challenges this false dichotomy. While MIT IA members are rewarded with invitations to hold Congressional press conferences with GOP operatives, J4C is focused on our community at MIT. With dozens of active organizers and an audience of hundreds on campus, J4Chasprotested,writtenletters,hosted speakers, andheldevents. We are creating a pluralistic, progressive Jewish space on campus while challenging MIT’s complicity in the acute crisis in Gaza. But in our quest to create a reprieve to the monopolistic hold that Israeli nationalist politics and institutions have on MIT Jewish life — for example, Hillel benefits from access to physical spaces and data, even automatically receiving Jewish student information upon matriculation without students’ consent — we have been met with bureaucratic delays and lack of any tangible support. You can read more about our experiences with administration in our recentopen letter. Our commitment to building a diaspora-centered, tolerant, and progressive Jewish community at MIT has only been strengthened in the face of oppositional efforts from student groups and a non-committal administration. Whose safety? The Israeli nationalist faction has hitched its wagon to racist and antisemitic politicians. As Jews, we are beyond alarmed that MIT IA members don’t seem to care about the harm that they are unleashing on the institution and the country by actively collaborating with CongresspeopleElise StefanikandMike Johnson. These politicians have both employed the highly antisemitic “Great Replacement Theory” intheirargumentsagainst immigrants and immigrant rights—a fact that, by itself, should have been immediately disqualifying. Moreover, both Representatives are two of the most ardent supporters of ex-President Trump, whoseantisemitic rhetoricis louder than a bullhorn. Stefanik and JohnsonrefusedtocondemnTrump when he called the Charlottesville Unite the Right Rally Nazis “very fine people.” And they have both refused to certify President Biden’s election, displaying their outright disdain for the democratic process. The MIT Israel Alliance and its faculty supporters are either unwitting enablers or co-conspirators in the conservative lawmakers’ transparent plot to dismantle the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs (DEI . Under the guise of keeping Jewish students safe, these lawmakers are destroying the very programs and initiatives that are making campuses more safe forallpeople, including Jews. In the face of threatened legal action from these politicians, the MIT administration continues to suppress and punish brown and black students who have called out the Institute’sculpability in the ongoing genocide. Likewise, in filingfederal chargesagainst our graduate workers’ national union for its endorsement of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS , MIT IA members have entered into a collaboration with the National Right to Work Committee, a highly litigious anti-labor organization known for “directly contributing to the erosion of high-paying middle-class jobs and to growing inequality.” We urge those who engage with the MIT Israel Alliance to consider whether this group truly protects the community it claims to represent: how can MIT IA fight for all Jews while collaborating withracist and antisemitic politicians? Immigrant Jews whilesidingwithanti-immigrationpoliticians? Queer Jews while allying withhomophobicandtransphobicpoliticians? Poor, working-class, disabled Jews while leaning onanti-labor,anti-medicare,anti-healthcarepoliticians? The MIT Israel Alliance commits real harm on campus and beyond through physical violence, intimidation, doxxing, harassment, and collaboration with dangerous individuals and organizations seeking to dismantle the very institutions that keep all of us safe. Yet MIT IA and their faculty supporters continue to broadcast that they are scared and unsafe — all because MIT community members speak up against genocide and our institution’scomplicityinit. For us, Jewish safety cannot come at the expense of the safety of others. Over 32,000 Palestinians have been murdered in Gaza by Israeli forces and their US-supplied weapons. More than 13,000 of those who have been killed are children. There are no universities left in Gaza. With each passing day, as the threat of famine swells, our advocacy against the genocide becomes increasingly urgent. Every McCarthyist movement seems dire at the moment, only to later be recognized as an embarrassment and a disgrace. This moment should be seen for what it is: a weaponization of antisemitism to undermine pro-Palestine organizing, suppress free speech, delegitimize diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and gut labor rights. We urge you to challenge the false narratives surrounding antisemitism and Jewish safety on campus, to speak out against anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic incidents at MIT, and to join us in envisioning a better university for all. We welcome all MIT students and anyone in the wider MIT community who may be questioning how to interpret or respond to events on campus, to reach out to us tostart a conversation. MIT Jews for Ceasefire"
thetech_mit_2024_9,"I am an Israeli-born Jew and MIT graduate from the class of 1985. My family has long roots in Israel and first immigrated to what was then part of the Ottoman Empire in the 1820s. I was four years old when the Six Day War broke out. I still remember the weeks preceding the war. I was too young to understand what war meant, but I could feel the overwhelming fear. It hung in the air, and I have often used the cliché that it was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I don’t remember the war itself; I was in a bomb-shelter, but I am told I would not stop crying because I wanted my doll. Two years later, my immediate family immigrated to the United States. When the Yom Kippur War broke out, I was safe, living in a Boston suburb, but my cousin was badly injured. While still an MIT undergraduate, I spent a semester at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where my courses included, “A Study of the Holocaust.” This class was taught by an amazing teacher, Prof. Ze’ev Mankiewicz. The course delved deeply into the psychology of the victims, the perpetrators, and the allies. In the last class, held in January 1985, Prof. Mankiewicz explained that after the Holocaust, overt anti-Semitism was no longer as acceptable among the educated classes. He further explained that to make anti-Semitism respectable again, it has been transformed into never-ending criticism of Israel. He reported hearing Europeans assert that Israel, a country created by the United Nations as a safe haven for the Jewish people, is expected to be “a light to the nations,” and must serve as an exemplar of the highest moral values. He argued that such declarations were used to justify a double standard for Israel. Despite this warning from almost 40 years ago, the recent pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses that call for the destruction of the State of Israel have been profoundly disturbing. I wanted to try, like Prof. Mankiewicz, to delve into the psychology behind these events. I think there are several factors at play. I’ve heard it said that diversity, equity, and inclusion tries to paint the world as oppressors and oppressed, and Israelis are portrayed as the white oppressors of the Palestinians. I saw a Yale student eloquently refer to Israelis as “white supremacists.” I wonder how many students and faculty realize that less than 20% of Israelis are descendants of European Jews. Most of European Jewry was murdered in the Holocaust. Most Israelis are descendants of Jews originating from Middle Eastern countries, where they lived, often under extreme hardship, until some fled, leaving all their belongings behind, and many were expelled. Others came from Ethiopia, China, India and South America. Another issue is that more and more people are getting their news from social media, which is a great platform for propaganda. Fake news is prevalent everywhere. I highly doubt that most protesters have bothered to educate themselves about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If they had, they would not accuse Israel of being an apartheid state. (Presented are links to videos that refute this claim. Here is an Israeli Arab Muslim woman,Sophia Khalifa1 expressing her views about the State of Israel. Here is a video aboutIsraeli Arabs joining the IDF2 ,even elite combat units3 , and this is a more in-depth story of anArab Israeli girl from Haifa who joined the IDF4 . Finally, here is an interview withRawan Osman5 , a Syrian-born Arab Muslim woman who has become a Zionist. Students need reliable sources to become better informed about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. PBS has three FrontLine documentaries about Israel: “Six Days in June,” “The 50 Years War: Israel and the Arabs,” and their most recent, “The Israeli Palestinian Conflict and Shattered Dreams of Peace.” I take issue with some of their presentation because I think their anti-Israel bias is evident in some sections, but I do believe it is a good starting place. Perhaps MIT could purchase these videos for the library. Some of these may also be found on YouTube. Students should also look at Mark Twain’s description of Palestine when he visited in 1867. The Jerusalem Post has asummary6 but one can look at the original. Then, there is the media which bombards viewers with daily images of civilian deaths, inflaming emotions. Perhaps if the media had shown the allies bombing Dresden in World War II, there would have been student protesters calling for cease-fire and the continuation of the Nazi state. More than 100,000 Lebanese were murdered in the Lebanon Civil War, but none of this was shown on TV. When the US Army was conducting urban warfare in Iraq, we did not see daily images of civilian deaths because the media did not want to inflame the public. Moreover, I am unaware of any mainstream media that showed the footage from the October 7 massacre. The media is very selective in what they choose to portray in order to shape the narrative. (Editor’s note: footage from the October 7 Hamas-led attack was observed by The Tech to be published that same day in broadcasts fromPBSE1 andNBC NewsE2 , as well as in an article from theAssociated PressE3 . I am reminded again of my Holocaust class. One tactic that the Nazi state used to create Jew-hatred was to show films of Jewish butchers butchering cows. German audiences would sit in movie theaters watching Jewish butchers cutting the throats of cows. Watching this was unpleasant, and the audience was horrified and sickened by it; they would leave hating the Jews and go have their dinner of schnitzel or sausage. One might wonder how such propaganda could work. After all, most Germans were not vegetarians. It did work, however. Somehow, and this is something I have difficulty understanding, many people are able to compartmentalize their world-view in such a way that they can hate in others what they condone and often ignore in their own conduct. One might argue that students are not waging war in Gaza, but that is immaterial. First, the majority of the Germans that were sitting in the theater did not butcher animals. They were, however, benefiting from the fact that there were German butchers to provide the meat that they were consuming. Similarly, we, as Americans, benefit from the dispossession of the indigenous population of America. I believe we can all agree that Americans were colonialists who established colonies for their mother country. This is in stark contrast to Jewish refugees settling in theirancient homeland7 . (Pakistani-born author and journalistTarak Fatah8 concurs. In addition, we fought wars with Mexico and Spain to conquer more land, not to mention battles with Native Americans who tried to protect their homes. Even as recently as 1945, the United States dropped bombs on civilians when it was under an existential threat from Germany and Japan. We, as Americans, benefit from their actions. It is easy to contend that those events happened in the past, and student protesters are not responsible. Yet when the students chant, “From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free” 9 are they not referring to 1948 and the creation of the State of Israel? Any Israeli under the age of 90 benefits from the creation of the State of Israel but had no active role in its establishment. So the same student-protesters who are the beneficiaries of American colonialism and American military dominance are enraged by what they perceive to be Israeli colonialism and Israeli military strength. There is, I believe, a misapprehension about what is motivating these students. There is no question that photos of civilian deaths, especially children, inflame emotions. Nevertheless, the reaction of students to such photos would be substantially different if there was not already a deep-rooted hatred of Israel, at least among the organizers, and if the feeling of being united in a sacred cause to free Palestine from its white supremacist colonialists was not so intoxicating. If stopping the killing of innocent children was the main objective, the protests would be far more balanced.Secretary of State Anthony Blinken recently asked why no one is making demands of Hamas10 . The protesters do not condemn Hamas for starting the current war on October 7. They do not blame Hamas for embedding themselves within the civilian population and using civilians as human shields. They certainly do not call on Hamas to surrender. They have no criticism for Arab countries, such as Egypt, that refused to accept Gazan refugees, including toddlers and babies. We, Americans, took in British children during World War II to save them from the German Blitz – the bombing of English cities by the German Luftwaffe. I am unaware of any country that has agreed to accept Gazan refugees, even temporarily. Jordan has many refugees from the recent Syrian Civil War. Europe also took in many refugees from Syria. Some countries will send humanitarian aid but will not provide temporary refuge as the IDF battles Hamas in difficult urban warfare. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that Palestinian civilians are being killed, butthe numbers are far less11 than reported by the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which includes Hamas fighters in the totals andinflates the numbers12 in general.Military expert, John Spencer, agrees that Israel is not at fault13 in an opinion published by CNN. In addition, these protesters place little value on Israeli lives. One does not hear chants or see signs demanding the return of the hostages from pro-Palestinian protesters. These protesters want to stop civilian deaths in Gaza, but only if this can be done in a manner that will keep Hamas in power, because the principal aim of these protests is the destruction of the State of Israel as made apparent by the calls to divest. There is another aspect to the latest controversy that I wish to address. There is a great deal of animosity between Jews who support Israel and those who are part of the pro-Palestinian movement. To be perfectly honest, until a couple of weeks ago, I too shared that animosity. I looked upon American Jews who support the pro-Palestinian movement as hypocrites because they live comfortable lives in the United States on land usurped from the indigenous native population and are calling for the displacement and/or extermination of the six million Israeli Jews whom, I believe, are the indigenous people of the Land of Israel. What made it worse was that they are doing this as Jews, as if they have some skin in the game, when, in reality, they are not impacted at all. They are legitimizing calls for the destruction of the State of Israel, which I found despicable. Two weeks ago, however, I met and spoke to a student from the MIT tent-encampment. I asked him why it was so important for him to identify as a Jewish pro-Palestinian supporter. Why could he not just support the Palestinians as a person as opposed to a Jewish person? I explained that I understood that he has no special attachment to Jews living in Israel, but, given that their destruction would have no impact on him, why is it relevant that he is Jewish? He started to explain that he suffered anti-Semitism as a child. He also said that pro-Israel Jews have insulted him and called him “a fake Jew.” We had to stop the conversation because he had to clean up the tent, so I left still not fully understanding why his being Jewish was relevant. Nevertheless, perhaps because I could attach a real person to the sentiments, I became more empathetic to his belief system, and I would like to explain to pro-Israel Jews what I believe is the issue. If we can agree that social media is using propaganda to convince young people that Israel is a white supremacist rogue state, then why should Jewish students be immune to this propaganda? Many Jews believe in assimilation and neither know much about Israel nor teach their children much about it, so it is unreasonable to believe that these Jewish kids are any more educated about Israel than the average American teenager. Also, if we understand that anti-Semitism has been converted into the more respectable anti-Zionism, then it provides these Jewish students who are bombarded with anti-Israel propaganda a chance to escape by becoming anti-Zionist themselves. In Germany, one couldn’t escape the gas chambers by converting to Christianity, but here, students can avoid the stigma by converting to anti-Zionism. Not only do they avoid persecution, but they are embraced and loved because they provide legitimacy to the cause. So I would argue that it is wrong to denounce Jews in the pro-Palestine movement more than other students in the movement. They are bothvictims of anti-Semitic propaganda14 . At the same time, I would urge everyone to understand that having Jews in the pro-Palestine movement does not provide it with legitimacy. My final observation is that there are often arguments about whether these protests are peaceful. I contend that none of them are peaceful because they don’t have peaceful intentions. Sometimes it’s difficult to see that because they are filled with slogans that many don’t understand. What these protesters are asking for is the destruction of the State of Israel - the only Jewish state. No one in the media asks them what they intend to do with the six million Jews who live there. They might tell you that the Jews should go back to Poland, underscoring their immense ignorance. More than 90% of the 3,300,000 Jews who lived in Poland in 1939 were slaughtered by the Nazis. Very few Israelis are descendants of Polish Jews. Also, what do these protesters intend to do with the 210,000 Muslim Bedouin and 150,000 Druze inhabitants of Israel? Both communities have been staunch supporters of the State of Israel since its inception, including serving in combat units of the IDF. Will they all be executed as traitors? Hamas already showed its intentions on October 7 by murdering and kidnapping both Israeli Arabs and migrant workers from Thailand and the Philippines because all were viewed as collaborators with the Zionist state. Israeli Arabs have gotten the message. A newpoll15 taken after the October 7 massacre showed that 70% (up from 48% of Israeli Arabs identify with the State of Israel. Students try to legitimize their protests by declaring that they are a continuation of the legacy of the civil rights movement, the Vietnam antiwar movement, and the South African apartheid movement. Many of the students are sincere, though ill-informed, and believe they are fighting a righteous cause against the white supremacist colonialists in Israel, but nothing could be further from the truth. As Pakistani-born author and journalist Tarak Fatah states in the video whose link I provided earlier, it is the Jews who are the indigenous population of the Land of Israel. What these student protesters are, in reality, doing is waging war on the descendants of refugees from a minority with a long-standing history of life-threatening persecution. I would also like to respond to the recent MIT Black Graduate Students Association’s calls for divestment from Israel by directing readers to the first 28 minutes of aninterview with Coleman Hughes16 , an African-American Columbia University graduate and author."
rice_thresher_2024_17,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/20/24 9:39pm Due to his experience as the current Student Association deputy treasurer, we, the Thresher Editorial Board, endorse Josh Stallings for SA treasurer. Running on the ticket of presidential candidate Jae Kim, Stallings has echoed many of the sentiments that make up Kim’s campaign, which we also support. Stallings’ headlining proposal is to consider raising the Blanket Tax, a fee on student tuition that supports student groups. Some nine organizations, including the Thresher, Rice Program Council, University Court and the SA itself, negotiate annual budgets with the Blanket Tax Committee, which the SA treasurer runs. Other student clubs can request one-time allotments through the Blanket Tax Committee’s Initiative Fund for new events. The Blanket Tax is written into the SA constitution and has been set at $85 since 2015.Adjusting for inflation, $85 today would have been just $64.41 nine years ago — a decrease of nearly a quarter of its real value. At the same time, the inflation-adjusted undergraduate tuition has increased from $41,560 in2015-16to $47,643.59 (in 2015 terms for students matriculating in 2024-25. Stallings said he wants to explore raising Blanket Tax as an option to continue supporting Blanket Tax Organizations, which have operated with a budget that is essentially shrinking. We support this exploration. We are mindful of yet another increase to student tuition, and we encourage the Blanket Tax Committee to find ways to realign spending, but it goes without saying that student organizations have less money per student today than nine years ago. Countless student organizations rely on Blanket Tax and Initiative Fund money for informative, fun and widely attended events, yet we’re running low on cash. Another key part of Kim’s platform which Stallings reiterates is increasing the number of Blanket Tax Organizations, with a focus on Rice PRIDE. While Stallings acknowledges budget limitations in how many organizations can have Blanket Tax status, he told us he hopes to focus on groups with far-reaching and inclusive impacts on large parts of the student body. We support directing SA funding toward this goal, though we don’t know if Blanket Tax status is the best way to achieve it. Regardless, it requires a comprehensive look at funding, and we believe Stallings is the best person for the job. Stallings’ opponent, Thomas Ngo, a current new student representative for McMurtry College, possesses a good vision for the role, but we are not sure he has amassed enough experience to become the treasurer. In an interview with the Editorial Board, Ngo rightly said that international students like himself bring a different and important perspective to finance. We hope that Ngo, who joined the Blanket Tax Committee earlier this semester, can remain a valuable voice at the table.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2024_38,"Over the past few weeks, our administration hasreiteratedits disapproval of the encampment and the need for “constructive dialogue.” They praised a course titled “Democracy and Disagreement” for holding asessionwith Alon Tal, a former member of the Israeli parliament (the Knesset , and Salam Fayyad, a former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. In response to the encampment’s demands for negotiation, the administration has expressed a willingness to meet and talk, but no willingness to negotiate. Forms of dialogue may exist on campus. But what does it mean to have constructive dialogue? The Democracy and Disagreement session with Alon Tal and Salam Fayyad cannot qualify as constructive dialogue. The Palestinian Authority (PA is widely seen by the people of Palestine as an extension of the Israeli occupation with a Palestinian face. Only 14% of Palestinians expresssatisfactionwith the role of the PA, according to the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR . Hence, a dialogue between a former member of the Israeli parliament and a former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority is no dialogue at all, but a monologue. The best way to hold a constructive dialogue, thus, is with representatives of the encampment. While the administration expressed a willingness to meet, what would such a meeting entail? The previous sit-in had requested numerous meetings with the administration, which were ignored on all but two occasions. This happened as our Palestinian members watched numerous family and friends become martyred, the homes and neighborhoods they grew up in become destroyed, and their memories buried under the rubble. When the administration finally met with members of the Sit-In to Stop Genocide, administrators were deliberately vague, shut down discussion before it occurred and refused to put statements in writing. At the end of the first sit-in, representatives agreed to take down the sit-in in exchange for good faith negotiations with the administration towards progress on demands, which were not met. This manipulative, fruitless conversation is not dialogue. The administration ordering the sit-in to be taken down amid a shooting threat, when students were not permitted to be present in White Plaza further demonstrated the administration’s tendency toward covert and disingenuous actions. Recently, a new encampment arose to revive the demands of the first sit-in, primarily divestment from companies complicit in Israeli apartheid. Once again, to meet the demands, students demanded negotiation. When the administration offered to meet, students wanted to avoid the manipulative, fruitless conversations of the past. Hence, they decided upon preconditions, including: The administration responded by reiterating its willingness to meet but stated that the meeting would not be for negotiations, because they are unable to accommodate all the students’ conditions. However, their encouragement of constructive dialogue requires meeting these conditions. Dialogue necessitates disclosure and transparency. As students who pay tuition or contribute labor, we are stakeholders in the university and should be able to express our views regarding the allocation of our endowment. The only way that can happen is through disclosure, which numerous universities have committed to for the sake of transparency, independent of the situation in Palestine. If dialogue is like passing a frisbee back and forth, the administration gatekeeping our investments is like refusing to even show us the frisbee. Knowledge of the University’s investments is an obvious prerequisite to dialogue regarding the investments. For dialogue to be constructive, it must have a material impact, such as divestment, as opposed to abstract words. While there is a formal, drawn-out process for divestment, the urgency of the ongoing atrocities demands an accelerated approach, namely a vote on divestment at the upcoming June 11 Board of Trustees meeting. By refusing to hold a prompt public vote, the administration reveals that their aims in dialogue are not constructive. Rather, their desire to talk is purely performative, meant to pacify the encampment rather than engage with their demands. Listening is an essential component of dialogue, and if the administration has listened over the past seven months, they would hear a desperate sense of urgency. Israeli forces have killed over 35,000 people in Gaza, including dozens of family members of our Palestinian classmates. Finally, dialogue requires the Board of Trustees’ vote on divestment to be public in order to engage students, who look forward to such actionable dialogue. 72.86% of undergraduate voters and 74.64% of graduate students voters supported the ASSU divestment referendum. Students are clearly passionate about this issue and anxious for constructive dialogue toward concrete goals. The question lies in whether administrators are willing to engage in such constructive dialogue, or if they will continue their one-sided monologue, refusing to listen and take urgent, constructive action. For the University to engage in constructive dialogue, they must be willing to have something real come of it. That means that Stanford must disclose its investments and the administration must call for a public vote on divestment at the upcoming Board of Trustees meeting. If the administration does not meet these conditions, their calls for constructive dialogue are nothing more than empty, hypocritical words.

rice_thresher_2024_37,"ByWarren Weissbluth4/2/24 11:50pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. The March 26, 2024 Thresher article “Senate debates resolution to boycott, divest SA funds from Israel-aligned companies” does not accurately or completely characterize my opposition to S.RES 02 as I expressed during the March 25 Student Association meeting.S.RES 02empowers an “ethical spending advisory board” to prevent student organizations from spending Blanket Tax funding on corporations deemed to be “complicit in the violation of the human rights guaranteed to Palestinian civilians.” Because Rice University’s Jewish student cultural organizations are inextricably connected to the State of Israel through programming and professional staff, there is no protection that Blanket Tax funding would be withheld from these student organizations, should the resolution pass. When I asked what guarantees the resolution includes to ensure that Jewish student organizations are not denied Blanket Tax funding, the reply was an explanation that the fullSenate can overturn a decisionmade by the “ethical spending advisory board.” This is neither an explanation nor a guarantee. A suggested amendment to S.RES 02 would exclude Jewish student organizations from being considered “unethical” on the “ethical spending advisory board’s” list of prohibited organizations. Yet this type of amendment simply illustrates the arbitrary nature of the resolution and renders the resolution moot. An additional response from other senators meant to alleviate my concern was that the full Senate not only could, but would certainly, overturn an “ethical spending advisory board’s” decision that targeted Jewish student organizations. Further, I was told that I simply need to trust the Senate. While in theory I support an “ethical spending advisory board,” I do not trust the SA to act impartially, especially when their intentions as expressed in the resolution are clearly to implement an antisemitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions policy on Rice’s campus. The resolution is antisemitic because it holds Israel to a double standard, rejects the Jewish people’s right to self-determination and demonizes Israel and the Jewish people (including Rice’s Jewish students through false accusations of colonization and genocide. Applied here, BDS also implicates Rice’s Jewish students for real or perceived actions of the State of Israel. Just this week, Governor Abbott recognized the proliferation ofantisemitism on college campusesand called for greater protection of Jewish students. Rice University’s Jewish students, and all Rice students, deserve more than this resolution’s marginalization and empty reassurances to trust the SA. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

stanforddaily_2024_18,"Protest and activism at Stanford are deeply linked. Both have a long and powerful history that can be revisited by perusing Stanford Libraries’ “Activism” online site. Having witnessed both protests and activism in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was vital to see crucial issues of our time — apartheid, racial discrimination, the Western Civilization curriculum, diversity in faculty representation — actively debated and acted upon by Stanford students, faculty and administrative officers. Some protests were civil, others not, but President Kennedy and faculty eventually engaged with concerned and affected students. Conversations happened, regardless of how ugly it looked or difficult it got. Yet now, given recent protests at Stanford’s Parents Weekend (reported, I would add, accurately in the pages of The Stanford Daily , the University is straying from the legacy of activism today’s students are embracing. The winds of freedom, it seems, still blow, albeit maybe only in one direction. As an alum and parent of a Stanford student visiting almost three weeks ago, we expected to see growing dissatisfaction over the University’s position on Israel. Its investment choices, its stance on Israel’s war with Hamas and the plight of the tens of thousands of innocents dying unnecessarily in the conflict were common discussions with my student in the previous weeks. We knew about the sit-in in White Plaza. We expected student protests all weekend. We hoped that President Saller and his peers would critically address the concerns of students both for and against the protests. What I saw on parent’s weekend was both impressive and unexpected. Impressive, because of the ingenuity, persistence and non-violent actions of the students that made their points about their deep distress at Stanford’s possible ties to Israel’s current administration. Unexpected, because of the reactions of many parents in attendance. These parents felt the right response to these protests was to shout down the demonstrators. Yells of “boos,” “shut up,” “go away,” “we don’t care” and applause by those same parents accompanied the students’ departure. Those reactions were simply sad, uncalled for and not the sentiment I expected from anyone associated with Stanford. Why belittle students earnest in their intentions and efforts, students who want to believe their chosen university could be something more? It is easy to understand how those parents might come to those views and actions. For some, it was their first time on campus and their first time visiting their child in a place that, rightly, has changed them. Some clearly traveled great distances for the event. Still others expected an idyllic weekend to match the sunny weather and warm welcome. Maybe they did not agree with the reason for and target of the protests. Perhaps they did not like how the students’ points were being made, or maybe they just felt like this event was “their time” and should be free of disruption. On a university campus, one known globally for its wide-ranging academic pursuits and creative expressions, some of my fellow parents chose to verbally abuse someone else’s children. All because those young adults were practicing one of the fundamental rights this country affords, essential to any credible institution of higher learning. It is a moment of powerful imbalance I cannot ever recall seeing in an academic setting. With the words from the on-stage panel about fostering a civil and respectful discourse still ringing in the room, adults chose not to be the more mature, considered and compassionate example. Instead, in word and action, students were shown their concerns were worthless, that their beliefs do not matter. And — perhaps more shockingly — President Saller, Provost Martinez and several deans sat on stage and watched. When presented with a chance to engage in a very real and honest way, they leaned back. When there could have been a moment to show both rude parents and anxious students how to de-escalate and connect, they chose to look at their notes. By the administration’s performance that afternoon, it is not hard to believe students who say the past four months have been ones in which the University would not substantially engage, meaningfully speak or actively listen. No wonder students took to MemAud to make a stand. It is not hard to grasp why the President and the Provost took little action. Since October, college campuses have been deeply and controversially embroiled in protests focused on every side of this conflict. Ill-timed or poorly handled reactions by college leaders have cost at least two university presidents — one a Stanford alum — their positions by factions that would polarize and weaponize the ripples of this conflict to their own ends. It is all too easy to believe Stanford’s leaders are exhausted by the tightrope that they must walk. But it is also a moment that desperately calls for engagement, discourse and intelligence in the face of disruption and disagreement. To the student groups protesting the Israel-Gaza conflict, seeking to be heard and seeking real change from the University, know that the history of protest at Stanford does bend toward justice. You are doing what we should expect from brilliant, enthusiastic young minds on a college campus: making your voices heard, working to make our world better. You are seen and you are heard. You continue a tradition I hope all students, faculty, administrators and — hopefully, someday — parents can come to respect. Perhaps not enjoy, but certainly understand its necessity. To you, and on behalf of the parents and friends of the University that understand this moment, I would tell you this: Keep going. John Bartol ’92 is a Stanford parent.

thetech_mit_2024_16,"We, the undersigned MIT community members, are optimistic about the new Climate Project and are excited to see that MIT is committing its own money to this effort. However, we call for a commitment to prevent fossil fuel influence in this project. The fossil fuel industry has repeatedly demonstrated that they are unwilling to change their business model of indefinite oil and gas production, and association with the industry for climate and energy research is an inherent conflict of interest. For decades, MIT has accepted large sums of money from the fossil fuel industry for climate and energy research, and has allowed the industry to influence research directions. This has led to proven bias towards fossil fuels in our research 1 , and a skewed focus on technologies that are favored heavily by the industry for the self-serving reason of promoting fossil fuel production while climate experts agree that production must fall. The new Climate Project is a fresh opportunity to shift our Institute’s research towards true climate solutions, free of the ulterior motives of the fossil fuel industry. To accomplish this goal, we call upon the leaders of the Climate Project and the MIT administration to fully dissociate from the fossil fuel industry by taking the following actions: Peer institutions like Princeton 3 and Cambridge 4 have already committed to dissociating from fossil fuel companies for these reasons, and other institutions like Harvard 5 , the University of California system 6 , and Columbia 7 , have divested their endowments from fossil fuel investments out of acknowledgement that the fossil fuel industry is not an ally in the climate fight. As a leader in climate and energy research, MIT should dissociate the Climate Project from the fossil fuel industry in the name of scientific independence and integrity. The Fossil Fuel Industry’s Active Opposition to Climate Action The fossil fuel industry is fundamentally opposed to climate action. In the past, the industry has discredited climate science through blatant climate change denial and the funding of disinformation. One of the most well-known cases of this is Exxon Mobil’s accurate predictions of anthropogenic climate change as early as the late 1970s, predictions they actively hid from the world, instead funneling millions of dollars to climate disinformation campaigns. Exxon is not the only organization to propagate climate disinformation: virtually all major fossil fuel companies participated in an American Petroleum Institute task force on CO2 in the late 70s and early 80s 9 . However, as the reality of climate change becomes undeniable, the industry has shifted to a new strategy: continuing status-quo fossil fuel production, while greenwashing their image and selectively promoting “clean” technologies that enable the continued production of oil and gas.Burning all of the world’s developed reserves of fossil fuels will blow past the 1.5℃ goal set at the Paris Climate Accords. In order to keep global warming below catastrophic levels, we must immediately curb the use of current fossil fuel reserves and not develop any new reserves 10 . Despite this, the top 20 fossil fuel companies are set to spend a staggering $932 billion on new oil and gas fields between 2022 and 2030 11 . In comparison, the industry spent a mere 2.5% of its capital expenditures (~$20B on clean energy investments in 2022, and oil and gas companies only account for 1% of global clean energy investments 12 . These numbers show a very clear corporate strategy to continue the status quo production of fossil fuels indefinitely, without regard for the world’s nearly depleted carbon budget. The fossil fuel industry has repeatedly stalled climate action through their lobbying efforts, a force that they continue to exert to this day. In 2022 alone, the oil and gas industry spent $124.4 million lobbying the federal government 13 . In the same year, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA required the Department of Interior to offer 60 million acres of land for offshore oil and gas leasing before issuing leases for offshore wind. The IRA also reinstated four offshore oil and gas leasing sales that were previously paused by President Biden. These pro-fossil fuel clauses have set our climate goals back by promoting increases in US oil and gas production, and are a direct result of the fossil fuel industry’s influence. Despite this, fossil fuel companies continue to portray themselves as “green”, with over 60% of their corporate messaging including a claim about sustainability 14 . Most major fossil fuel companies have also released climate plans in recent years, but these plans are completely misaligned with the Paris Accords in critical areas. They largely fail to include scope 3 emissions 15 (emissions from the burning of their products , rely on dubious carbon offsets, and do not include plans to scale back production 16 . Congressional investigators recently obtained an internal Shell email from 2020 in which they internally admitted that their advertised “net zero” plan had “nothing to do with our Shell’s business plans” 17 . The fossil fuel industry has also worked to influence research agendas and policy through hundreds of millions of dollars in donations to U.S. universities in the past decade 18 . They have heavily promoted technologies such as “natural” gas to greenwash themselves and further entrench fossil fuel infrastructure – a tactic that MIT has participated in by accepting fossil fuel money and influence in our climate and energy research. How Fossil Fuel Influence at MIT has Delayed Climate Solutions During the early 2010s, MIT aided the fossil fuel industry in promoting “natural” (methane gas as a “bridge fuel”. A semantic analysis 19 of reports published by university energy centers and environmental groups from 2010-2020 showed that fossil-funded universities were significantly more favorable of “natural” gas in their reports than non-fossil-funded universities and centers; the fossil-funded MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI had the most favorable views out of any group studied (see figure below . Methane has a global warming potential 86 times that of carbon dioxide over 20 years, making natural gas systems worse than coal for global warming in this time frame if above leakage rates of 0.2%, which is far below real leakage rates (between 0.65% and 66.2% 20 . MITEI was founded in 2006, and has since accepted ~$450 million from fossil fuel companies 21 . Companies that donate enough money have a direct influence on MITEI’s research portfolio 22 . Unscientifically favorable reports such as MITEI’s “The Future of Natural Gas” – which was co-authored by a former executive at BP, and included many other conflicts of interest 23 – enable the fossil fuel industry to entrench new fossil fuel infrastructure and continue their dangerous strategy. This report was the central focus of a 2011 congressional hearing presented by Ernest Moniz, in which he did not disclose any conflicts of interest 24 . The Obama administration fully embraced natural gas in 2012 25 , at a time when fracking was under intense scrutiny, and Moniz was appointed as Obama’s Secretary of Energy in 2013. The fossil fuel industry used MIT to push the false climate solution of “natural” gas during the 2010s, and they continue to prioritize other self-serving technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS here to this day. While fossil fuel industry proponents of CCS claim that we can rely on this technology to negate the effects of burning fossil fuels by capturing the emissions and storing them underground, the reality is that their widespread over-promotion of CCS is a delay tactic. The IEA has warned that the history of CCS has “largely been one of unmet expectations” and “underperformance” 26 . Analysis has also shown that renewables, along with improved storage systems, are a significantly more energy and resource efficient climate strategy for grid electricity production than fossil fuels with CCS 27 . 79% of carbon captured today is used to squeeze more oil out of previously depleted wells in a process called enhanced oil recovery, which ironically adds to emissions 28 . Over-reliance on CCS would also cost $30 trillion more than a low-CCS pathway to net-zero by 2050, mainly because the cost of the technology has been stagnant for 40 years 29 . Despite the overwhelming evidence against prioritizing CCS and instead focusing on fossil fuel phase-out, it is still heavily researched at MIT – at least partially due to the fossil fuel industry. Out of all clean energy technologies, CCS received the second most funding from the fossil fuel industry at MIT in 2022 30 . While we do not allege that MIT researchers who currently accept fossil fuel industry funding are acting in bad faith, the reality is that accepting fossil fuel funding for energy and climate research allows the industry to influence which technologies are prioritized and legitimized and which are not – influence that is amplified globally due the high impact of MIT research. The Climate Project is an exciting opportunity that could provide our university’s top minds with no-strings-attached funding to tackle the world’s largest challenge. We must reject fossil fuel industry influence to enable our researchers alone, not vested interests, to decide which technologies should be prioritized in the Climate Project.

crimson_2024_85,"In my previous pieces, I have articulated key distinctions for understanding speech-related issues:academic freedom versus free speech,impermissible versus permissible speech, and, within the previous category, good versus bad speech.Last week, I argued that administrators are responsible for addressing impermissible speech, whereas faculty and staff in pastoral roles should address speech that is permissible but bad. In this article, I make a final distinction among the various roles each of us inhabits. Different roles are subject to different constraints. By and large, roles fit into three buckets: personal, professional, and civic. My personal roles include mom, daughter, sister, and lover of poetry. My professional roles are professor and newspaper columnist. My civic role is as a democracy advocate. Sometimes, these roles conflict. Being a professor and a democracy advocate both require many nights and weekends. So does being a mom. To balance these responsibilities, I’ve tagged some nights for family dinners, and reserved others for professional or civic obligations. Conflicts can also be more serious. If a judge is also the defendant’s best friend, she must recuse herself from the case. In her professional role, she has a duty to judge impartially, but in her personal role, she has a duty to protect her friend. She can’t do both, and so therefore must temporarily abandon her professional role. Just as our personal and professional roles can come into conflict, so too can our professional and civic obligations, and we must learn how to navigate adeptly between the two when dealing with speech issues. In the classroom, both students and faculty inhabit professional roles. When they advocate for candidates or issues outside their areas of professional expertise or run for office, they inhabit civic roles. For students especially, delineating between roles can be tricky given that campus life intertwines personal and professional spheres. The set of rules governing speech is role-dependent. When students and faculty speak in their professional capacity — in a classroom, for example — they are protected by academic freedom. Sometimes, academic topics — for instance, the impact of changing interest rates — are also entangled with political debates. As long as the purpose of classroom discussion is the pursuit of truth and understanding, it falls under academic freedom. Exercising one’s professional role can still involve the introduction of necessarily political or civic topics within the classroom. But what about extramural speech? It can often be hard to determine the set of laws, rules, and norms that govern speech beyond the campus. When faculty post on social media or engage in off-campus media performances, are they protected by academic freedom or free speech? Extramural speech deserves the protection of academic freedom any time a faculty member makes a statement in their professional role on the basis of their expertise as a professor. Academic freedom protections should apply even when the faculty member’s intellectual contributions aggravate a healthy majority on intellectual grounds. But when faculty post on social media or appear on the news to share their own personal opinions (in support or opposition to an issue outside their area of professional expertise , they are inhabiting a civic role, leaving behind the protections of academic freedom, and moving into the zone of free speech. (Of course, those who hold institutional positions as representatives of the University — such as presidents and deans — have put aside their access to those civic roles for the duration of their appointment. We should expect our university to defend us when we act extramurally in our professional capacity. But we should not anticipate university protection for exercising our free speech rights in our civic roles. Neither, however, should we be judged by our university for how we exercise our civic roles. There is, though, one exception. If our public speech undermines our ability to fulfill our professional duties, we should expect consequences. If I advocate on social media for an obviously unfair grading policy — say, arbitrarily lowering the grades of all male students — I communicate that I can’t fairly fulfill grading responsibilities. My university might reasonably remove me from all positions in which I grade students. Like the judge facing her best friend in court, I’ve placed myself in a situation in which my two roles conflict: a civic role advocating for a certain grading policy in the public sphere and a professional role requiring me to grade fairly. When these conflicts arise, professors, like judges, must choose between their two roles. I find it helpful to use different email addresses to separate my professional life from my civic one — the precise use of email involves disciplined attention to the responsibilities and powers of our varying roles. Students should do this, too — they might use their institutional emails for all correspondence related to class, campus jobs, and student organizations, but personal emails for everything else. Tufts, for example, has an easily findable policy thatprohibits the use of institutional emailsfor political purposes. Harvard also has a policy but it is deeply buried within the University’s webpages, and it’s unclear how many people know about it. The students in the encampment are currently trying to hold student and civic roles simultaneously. Byholding hearingsthat could require students to withdraw from the College for one or several terms, the University forces a choice between the two. My hope is that our students might both choose to prioritize their student roles by voluntarily departing the camp and reconsider how they exercise their civic duty. I encourage them to engage in policy-setting forums to develop and promote sound and impactful policies that advance the goal I believe I hear them pursuing: safety and security for all Palestinians and Israelis. If they need help more fully building out such fora, I stand ready to assist. Correction: May 10, 2024 A previous version of this op-ed incorrectly stated that Harvard does not have a policy regarding the use of institutional emails for political purposes. Clarification: May 10, 2024 A previous version of this op-ed stated that the hearings of protesters before the Harvard College Administrative Board could result in involuntary leave. While the Ad Board can indeed force students on leave subsequent to a hearing, it refers to this sanction as a require to withdrawal. An involuntary leave, by contrast, is imposed by the Dean of Students and does not require a hearing.

ubyssey_2024_2,"May 11, 2024 Written byHeidi Collie Heidi Collie is a London-based freelance journalist with a focus on culture and climate. Heidi graduated from UBC anthropology in May 2023. Hey Siri, play ‘Naive’ by The Kooks To anyone with siblings overseas, this one’s for you. I’ve always felt that the international student/parent dynamic gets a lot of airtime in university discourse, with reluctant updates on grades, finances, housing and relationships. But today I want to focus on everyone’s favourite middleman: the sibling you left behind. After almost two decades of hand-me-downs, comparisons and fights over the front seat of the car, the idea of putting thousands of miles between you and your sibling might have felt like a breath of fresh air. But at some point amid the anarchy of adolescence your relationship transitioned from “I’ll look after them”to “I ll look out for them,” and dare say they became someone hard to live without. Between short holidays, expensive flights and a global pandemic, I barely saw my siblings throughout my degree. Then, following my UBC graduation in May 2023, I found myself in a rocky transition back to life in my home country and these were the three people who helped me without question — with a bed, with a friendship group, with a LinkedIn connection. I began navigating the chasm between the girls who had waved me goodbye and the women who now embraced me and realized how much time had actually passed. They aren’t 20, 22 and 24 anymore, they’re 25, 27 and 29 with husbands, houses and kids. I had a hunch it would be tough, but I wish someone had warned me justhowtough it was going to be. I wish I knew that I would miss every family event, every Christmas, birthday, funeral, engagement, bachelorette party and the first six months of my nephew’s life. To those of you going through it — I’m sorry to say that it doesn’t get easier, you just stop getting invited. The hard truth is, four thousand miles away, I watched the three of them do their 20s without me. After six months of playing catch up on the lives of my built-in best friends, I have some humble advice for international students at UBC. Initially, all four of us started with handwritten letters. I wouldn’t recommend it. Canada Post is neither cheap nor reliable and there is also no feeling like the betrayal of Google Maps accidentally sending you to Metrotown to mail a letter. It took time, but I eventually figured out that each of my sisters appreciated a different form of communication. For one, it was long FaceTimes. This was challenging with the time difference but I got into the routine of calling her whenever I was up at night (in an Uber, stumbling back from The Pit or getting ready for my barista opening shift . Similarly, when she was awake all night in labour, she calledme. For another sister, it was voice notes — the random tangents, intrusive thoughts andboydid she get the business end of those finals-season rants. For the third sister, it was information. I gradually learned that she felt closest to me when she knew what was going on in my life; who s in it, my updates, my plans. As well as finding what works for them, be clear about what works for you. After a drunken cry down the phone to my late-night-FaceTime sister, I was suddenly receiving quarterly care packages full of Terry’s Chocolate Oranges. An absolute win. I know, student schedules are hectic, but hear me out. If you can’t manage a recurring video call, I suggest some good old-fashioned habit-stacking. Try ‘I’ll send you a voice note every time I walk to Sociology,’ ‘I’ll WhatsApp you my weekly updates when I’m on the 99’ or ‘I’ll FaceTime you each time I take an Uber after dark.’ You’d be surprised what a difference this makes. Every time one of my sisters planned a trip to visit me and it got cancelled, it broke my heart.Fantasticif you can manage it, but you’re both probably students or in entry-level jobs so you most likely don’t have two weeks or $1,200 to spare. You’re desperate to show them your new life abroad, I know, but it is so important that you learn to cultivate your relationshipvirtually, and maybe just be happy with this for now. This one, with a massive dose of emotional maturity.You’rethe one making the huge life adjustment I know, but understand that this is going to be complicated for your sibling too. They can love and be proud of you, angry and jealous of you all at the same time. The way they feel might not be as straightforward as you think. Stay calm when they get it wrong, forget the FaceTime, confuse the time difference or send your gift to the wrong address. Focus on how you can be there without actuallybeing there, keep up to date on their news and remember to ask them about it. Truthfully, back home they’re feeling your absence more than you’re feeling theirs. Finally, the most fundamental:ownyour decision to leave. In practice, this means that it isyourresponsibility to be proactive, figure out the communication style and fit it into both of your routines — even if your sibling is older, richer, wiser, less busy etc. etc. At the end of the day,youleftthem. Not only are they probably being asked about you by random neighbours and distant relatives, but when family issues arise — and they do —you’rethe one away hiking, cycling, skiing, travelling and learning from world-class professors. Your siblings may be picking up the pieces in ways you haven’t seen. For me, this is reminiscent of Jo March in ‘Little Women (2019 speaking of her youngest sister abroad, “Amy has always had a talent for getting out of the hard parts of life.” Your sibling is missing you, but without reaping the rewards of a new life overseas. Growing up, these were the relationships which required no maintenance. Siblings were always justthere— behind you in the car, across from you at the table, in the next bed (or next to you inyourbed if you had a sister as annoying as I was . Unfortunately, with a few thousand miles and the chaos of your early twenties, it doesn’t stay that simple. These are the relationships you’ll have for the rest of your life and it’s important to nurture the connection you spent 18 years building. However, coming from someone who accidentally neglected the importance of this, trust me that nothing is irreparable. It took time to equate the women I see with the girls I knew, but now when they visit me in London, it’s like I never left. My biggest lesson learnt, and the one I give to you today, is that sibling relationshipsdotake work, but that this work will be unconditionally, earth-shatteringly worth it. Share this articlecopied!

crimson_2024_93,"In my last article, I distinguished between impermissible and permissible speech and, within the second category, between good and bad speech. In today’s, I discuss the category that has perhaps caused colleges the most trouble: speech that is permissible but bad. Permissible but bad speech is like peeing in the swimming pool — it doesn’t break the law, but it violates the norm of respect for others. On college campuses, impermissible speech is met with formal adjudication and sanctions. But how should we respond to permissible but bad speech? At some level we would all like simply to banish what’s offensive, and accepting that we cannot is painful. But this does not mean bad speech needs to go unaddressed. To understand how we ought to respond to permissible but bad speech, we’ll need one more distinction: between administrators, who are responsible for enforcing campus rules, and faculty and staff, who hold pastoral roles and are responsible for students’ learning and well-being. The province of the former is to address impermissible speech; of the latter, to manage permissible but bad speech. Another important consideration is that bad speech, even when permissible, invariably faces consequences — not from formal sanctions but from social judgments that impact scholarly and professional opportunities and relationships. These judgments are reasonable responses to bad speech acts. But these informal penalties should have limits. Practices like doxxing, for instance, where students’ private information is published with malicious intent, go much too far. Despite being protected by the First Amendment, this form of “rough justice” — when private individuals take the “law,” so to speak, into their own hands — is unethical, akin to when vigilantes bypass official legal channels to bring justice through physical violence to those whom they consider to have done wrong. To uphold the University’s commitment to open inquiry, our top administrators must stop vigilante actors. They can do so partly by doing a good job at holding actual rule-breakers accountable. History teaches that to discourage and constrain vigilante behavior, societies must put in place clear and sound institutional practices to handle any rule violations that may occur. People become more tolerant of vigilante behavior when they are unsure that stable procedures exist to respond to rule violations. Vigilante action is made evidently inappropriate when stable procedures exist for holding people to account, making it easier to shut down. Administrators must be able to say to vigilante actors: “Back off; we’ve got this. We have a stable and robust set of campus speech rules that appropriately handles anything impermissible.” Then, when speech is permissible but bad, they must delegate to those with pastoral duties. These faculty and staff should help our students see what is wrong with their speech, learn from it, and embrace a higher standard of speech. We shouldn’t expect our top administrators, who have the job of enforcing rules, to condemn speakers or speech not violating rules. While they might publicly raise questions as intellectual leaders about the problems of the speech act, far more important is that they task those in pastoral roles with having performance improvement conversations, and communicate clearly to the campus that learning is underway. One kind of permissible but bad speech to which this approach would apply is problematic classroom conduct. Instructors, even while respecting academic freedom for all in the classroom, can engage in performance improvement conversations with members of a class who speak to each other rudely or disrespectfully, reserving sanctions, of course, for actual instances of harassment or threats. Faculty advisors can and should also have such conversations with student groups that make bad choices. These conversations should be handled with care, ensuring no public shaming or elements of retaliation, just like performance improvement in the workplace. Such conversations are best structured in the form of debriefs organized by questions to prompt reflection: Where were our arguments sound or unsound? Where did our emotional understanding of the situation succeed? Where did it fail? What moral judgments did we make? Where did we succeed? Where did we fail? How well did our actions adhere to University values? Where did we fall short? Mistakes occur when we confuse situations that require sanctions with situations that require pastoral care. These mistakes have occurred frequently this year, such as when University President Claudine Gay denounced the phrase “from the river to the sea.” This was a moment that required pastoral care, by those with such duties, but received an enforcement action instead. People in authority often initially withhold judgment on speech that is permissible but bad in order to avoid cases of apparent or actual retaliation, or to avoid chilling speech. This reticence is reasonable. But then if no response at all seems to be forthcoming, or if permissible and impermissible behavior start to be bundled together, and pressure builds through calls for accountability, there can also be overcorrection in the direction of the condemnatory statement or ill-judged police action. This was the case when Columbia University in April first sought to clear its encampment by suspending students, and thereby converting them into trespassers, without the disciplinary hearing typically required after an allegation of a violation of school policy. What is needed is clear, simple, and transparent enforcement of campus rules against “violence or harassment directed at individuals or groups,” as the president of the University of Chicagohas recently put it, and baton-passing to address anything permissible but bad. Best for administrators with enforcement duties to make clear that those tasked with pastoral duties have responded instead. The biggest mistake of all, though, is when we assume that speech protections mean there is nothing we can do about permissible but bad speech, and thereby forget the most important thing we need to do: teach. We should not abandon our students when they err, for if we do, we will have abandoned our mission. And there is so much to teach right now. Students are hungry for lessons about history, antisemitism, Islamophobia, Israel, Palestine, two-state solutions, diverse religious traditions, diverse ideologies, peace-making, conflict transformation, human rights, pluralism, and so on. In fact, because we have neglected to teach our students in these areas, many students are forced to teach themselves. And at the top of the teaching list? The University’s values: Respect for the rights, differences, and dignity of others; honesty and integrity in all dealings; conscientious pursuit of excellence in our work; accountability for actions and conduct in the community; responsibility for the bonds and bridges that enable all to grow with and learn from one another. Wartime does not excuse us from the moral obligation to live up to these values — even when the war comes to campus. To the contrary; grief and anger make it harder, but those passions also make it even more urgent to reach for our best selves. Danielle Allen is the James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University and director of the Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation. This piece is the fourth installment in a series that will identify and assess the difficult ethical questions surfaced by Harvard’s recent leadership crisis."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_1,"July 9 marks the beginning of the second week of competition in the heavily malignedEsports World Cup. The inaugural tournament is taking place in Saudi Arabia and is funded by the Saudi government, which is offering a prize pool of $60 million dollars for competitors and their respective organizations. The tournament includes 21 different genres of competition and promises to be the largest esports event of the year. Here’s the rub. This tournament specifically comes at a tumultuous time. Organizations have increasingly felt the backlash for their choice to either partake or abstain from the competition. The backdrop of an “esports winter” being at its apex helps to better contextualize the actions of the athletes and organizations in question. As players, owners and fans grapple with the complex issue ofprofitabilityin the esports space, ethical dilemmas arise surrounding the procurement of capital on a global scale. It’s no secret that the Saudi Arabian government has a track record ofhuman rights violationsanddogmatic policiesthat are at odds with mainstream Western viewpoints. Associating with these governmental bodies inevitably broaches the ethical question of the source and cost of such an ornate and bountiful event. Are we, as esports fans, to be led to believe that our community is capable enough to engage insocial consciousness-raising? In a world wheredignitariesandvisionarieshave levied social critiques at the monolith of American culture that is sports, I can’t help but wonder: where do esports athletes stand in all of this? Memories of the “shut up and dribble” discourse remind us of the dichotomy of expectations placed on athletes. Keep the show running and put up your best effort, but don’t make your presence heard. Dance and sing, but don’t think or speak. Travis Gafford, a highly regarded journalist, exemplified the thoughts of the rabble that is the League of Legends community when the ethical question of the Esports World Cup is raised. In contrast, somepersonalitieshave pivoted this influx ofengagementsto their benefit and become vocalspokespersonsfor the Esports World Cup. Regardless, there has been and continues to be a movement to boycott coverage of the festivities. As a result of this aimed attempt to distance the community from the geopolitical and cross-cultural baggage the Esports World Cup brings, the League of Legends portion of the games became theleast-viewedinternational tournament in six years. As is often the case, actions speak louder than words. Players, on-air talent and organizations have all been under a microscope. What should have been seen as a lifeline towards profitability and growth for the esports scene has become a source of dismay and disillusionment. If there is any hope in sustaining and growing the esports scene that we have come to love and admire, eventually we as a community must come to a sobering reality – the reality that cash is king and not all money is clean money, no matter how much we wish it to be. No, esports athletes aren’t going to be ventricles for our political ideologies, nor should they be. We as a community have been fighting to be recognized and taken seriously for years. Now that the community has risen to the heights of having nationally recognized events that are the size of theAsian Gamesand the Esports World Cup, we are expected to begin our foray into the ethos of our community and to contemplate its morality. Let the community have this. Let the players shine and represent us, the fans, and show the soaring heights that esports can aspire to and why we have come to love our sport.

rice_thresher_2024_2,"ByThresher Editorial Board4/2/24 11:48pm April 11, 2024 11:45 a.m. The Honor Council has a statute of limitations as outlined in its procedures as 90 or more days between the date of violation and the date of accusation, or 60 or more days between the date of accusation and the date when evidence is presented. This article has been corrected. At 10:02 a.m. on March 27, students across campus received an email with the subject: “Honor Council Confidential Accusations.” Students — many of us included — feared the worst upon seeing an Honor Council email in their inbox. The email was not a notification of personal violation, but instead highlighted a key change in procedure: Students may now anonymously accuse their peers of violating the Honor Code. The accuser’s identity is never revealed to the accused; under old policy, the accuser’s identity would be divulged at a hearing. Consequences of this change also include a longer inquiry period where the Honor Council conducts a preliminary investigation about the accusation’s validity, contacting professors, graders and involved parties — everyone but the accused themself. The Honor Council and code are supposed to foster student trust and encourage students to hold each other accountable, but the Honor Council’s fundamental issues, both new and pre-existing, actively counteract its purpose. Lightened sanctions in exchange for pleading guilty without trial (reminiscent of a plea deal structure and the 90 or more days between a violation until when a violation can be reported, or the 60 or more days from when an accusation is made until evidence can be presented, through a statute of limitations tip the scale against the accused. Accused students are bound by complex regulations, forbidden to discuss their case with a professor that likely harbors suspicion about their innocence, unauthorized to access evidence about their case without navigating bureaucracy and stuck waiting on a result while their semester ticks by. In a court of law, defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Here, guilt seems to be all but an expectation. Without fixing the fractured relationship between the Honor Council and the student body, adding changes that allow for more anonymous, reckless and trivial accusations of academic dishonesty is irresponsible. Rice prides itself on preparing students for the real world, where people need to communicate with their peers face-to-face, even about disagreements. That said, there are situations where confidentiality can shield students from potential harm when bringing accusations. The Honor Council should review confidentiality requests on a case-by-case basis, evaluating potential risks and student reasoning when making their decision. Confidentiality can, and should be, on the table — just not a guarantee. Editor’s Note: Thresher editorials are collectively written by the members of the Thresher’s editorial board.

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. Rice students are nostrangerstoburnout. Optimism at the start of a semester turns into dread as the grind wears us down and we wonder how we will fit all our weekly commitments into a mere 168 hours. I don’t claim to be any different; I’ve struggled against the cult of busyness my whole time at Rice, sometimes letting work fill my every waking moment while desperately trying to keep up with two STEM majors, two campus jobs and two extracurriculars. But during my sophomore year, I made the best decision of my college career, radically changing the way I approach my workload. I started following the Fourth Commandment: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” The Hebrew word “qadash,” which here is translated to “holy,” means “to be set apart or consecrated” — Christianity claims that God designed humans to set apart one day in seven for rest and worship. I decided to make my Sundays holy by doing no schoolwork. Full stop. No exceptions for weeks with a ton of work. No exceptions for weeks where I procrastinated. No exceptions for COMP 310. Whatever happened during the week, my Sundays would be sacred. Agnes Ho, the director of the Student Wellbeing Office, has previouslyremindedstudents that they “deserve to take a break.” Students should take regular breaks from their work, but Sabbath rest is in a different category entirely. Making a day holy means setting it apart before scheduling anything else, therefore recognizing it as the most important part of your week. When I started taking a Sabbath I thought I would struggle to get my work done with less time each week, but the much needed rest allows me to be more productive in the following week. I thought scheduling work with others would become difficult, but nobody has pushed back when I simply tell them that Sunday is not an option for me. Taking Sunday off, rather than making the rest of my week more stressful, made it less so. The day began to feel like something special, and I often find myself on Saturday thinking about “tomorrow” as Monday, with the day of rest completely set apart from my regular calendar. I fear that too many Rice students are so stressed they don’t even think about taking a break, even when it would let them come back to their work refreshed and more productive. My decision to start taking a Sabbath has given me time every week that is set aside to worship God, spend quality time with the people I care about and rest. It is way too easy to get caught up in the endless stream of things that need doing during the semester and forget the importance of rest. For students who are overwhelmed by all the work they have to do, Sabbath rest can paradoxically be the exact thing that makes you more productive and able to complete the week’s work. As a part of Rice’s Culture of Care, we should be encouraging those around us to schedule weekly time away from school so that we keep our priorities straight. Regardless of course load, jobs or extracurriculars, all of us could use a block of time that is set apart in which we can rest. So take time to schedule your rest before scheduling anything else. Pick a time during the week and remember to make it holy. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds.

stanforddaily_2024_0,"Graduate workers need wages that won’t simply be eaten up by Stanford’s company town. The Stanford Graduate Workers Union (SGWU has been bargaining with the University since November. Most of this period was focused on negotiating the non-economic terms of the contract, which will define the working conditions of graduate workers. SGWU provided itsinitial proposal on wageson July 11, and last week, the University presented its initial counterproposal: a 3% increase annually for the next four years. How generous was their offer? Compare it to the 4.5% rent increase starting this September, following the increases between 3.5% and 4.5% every year during the past five years, as well as a 7.2% increase in the price of the graduate meal plan and a 10% increase in the cost of dependent health insurance coverage. All of this is on top of an annual inflation rate between 3% and 7% that has persisted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Before the pandemic, University administration convened an Affordability Task Force (whose findings were never published , which only resulted infew improvementsdirected toward graduate students that came years later. Stanford sets our rent so high that we graduate workers areforced to make cutselsewhere, and the University continues to raise our rent faster than our pay. The line for the monthly food pantry pop-upcontinues to stretchhours long, as it has for years. For these reasons, SGWUproposed an immediate and substantial raisefor all graduate workers so we will no longer be rent-burdened and indexing future wages on rent costs and inflation. When workers elect to be represented by a union, as the graduate workers of Stanforddid overwhelminglyin 2023, employers are obligated to negotiate with the union before unilaterally changing working conditions, wages or benefits. Generally, unions and employers reach a contract to set clear bounds on what can and cannot be changed without further bargaining. Stanford’seconomic counterproposalstates that the University would have the right to rescind existing tuition, medical and transportation benefits for graduate workers, just like they did with the Caltrain GoPass in 2022. They ignored international graduate workers, even though visa fee support is now standard among union contracts. Their proposal does not guarantee workers’ representation on committees that advise on graduate healthcare plans. There was nothing too small in SGWU’s initial proposals for Stanford to reject. During bargaining, Stanford’s spokesperson quickly pivoted the discussion to the University’s ability to recruit new talent into Ph.D. programs. They also stated that other factors and perks — like Palo Alto’s nice weather — justify Stanford paying its graduate workers less than a living wage. SGWU provided its initial economic proposals on July 11, and Stanford provided its response on Aug. 7. Their proposal is an effectivewage decreaseand avacation policystricter than what is currently standard practice. Beyond that, their proposal codifies the status quo. With so few details in their counterproposal, Stanford could also have provided it much sooner, such as on the afternoon of July 11th. Their stalling tactics could delay our contract past our scheduled pay raise in September. The SGWU Bargaining Committee has spent months dealing with the University’s stonewalling tactics and unproductive counterproposals. As shown on theSGWU Bargaining Tracker, Stanford neglected many of the non-economic proposals for months before looking at them. Contrast the frequency, productivity and substance of the MIT administration’s responses and response times, shown onMIT-GSU’s Bargaining Tracker, with Stanford’s. The University’s bargaining tactics also continue to reveal its hollow commitment to diversity. Its economic counterproposals ignore SGWU members’ needed improvements to healthcare, child care and family support. While presenting, Stanford reiterated anondiscrimination proposalthat claims to prohibit discrimination based on some characteristics, but specifically excludes the case of sex discrimination from protection.ConsideringStanford’slong-runningissues withsex discrimination, the proposal is irresponsible and ineffective. Further, Stanford’s nondiscrimination proposal is designed to minimize accountability. The University and SGWU have agreed to agrievance procedureby which SGWU and the University will mediate disputes. Yet, the University proposed that the grievance procedure would not apply to discrimination. Instead, they propose an abbreviated procedure that kicks in after the University finishes investigating the discrimination through a lengthy process, which can span as long as it chooses. SGWUwants timely, complete and real protectionsfor everyone who experiences discrimination, harassment of any form or power abuse. Stanford,do better. Graduate workers, let’s work together to secure the contract we deserve. Come to SGWU’s conversationtrainings, connect with your coworkers, and let’s bring Stanford back to the table with a serious offer. Jason Anderson is a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in aeronautics and astronautics. Parth Nobel is a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering.

crimson_2024_50,"To the Class of 2028: Congratulations! Please pick Harvard. I might sound desperate to you. Perhaps I have reason to be — Harvard is having something of a public relations crisis, and this could understandably dissuade you from attending. I remember the days long past when I was applying to college (last school year . I won’t assume anything about you, but I remember operating on a limited amount of information — acceptance rates andcollege rankingsmostly. I can only imagine how the past months’ news would have affected my understanding of Harvard. But there’s much more to Harvard than what the news — or evencollege rankings— can tell you. So allow me to share why you should choose Harvard and why, a year later, I’m still glad I did. Much has been made of Harvard’s smaller applicant pool during its early acceptance round, but you were not chosen to fill extra empty spaces. You were chosen, not in comparison to who else applied, but on the basis of your individuality. If Harvard were merely making a comparison, we would expect it to accept the exact same number of students every year — enough to fill all of its housing — but it doesn’t. Each student is accepted for who they are and what they alone can offer to our greater community Simply put, we want you. If that doesn’t convince you — after all, you likely have other acceptances — here are some of the opportunities that await you at Harvard: the largest academic library in the world, thousands of dollars of funding for summer internships and studies abroad, access to classes at other renowned schools including Harvard Law School and MIT (and the Taylor Swift class , and the chance to join amazing extracurriculars (like *ahem* The Harvard Crimson . But most importantly, Harvard brings you to a world where you can engage with perhaps the most intelligent and extraordinary mix of students from all corners of the world. And you are one of those students. Also, Boston is objectively better than New Haven — in my opinion. If Visitas isn’t everything that you hope for it to be, just remember everything that waits for you. This may all sound abstract, but I hope it conveys my passion. Maybe you don’t feel this passion yet. That’s okay. It was the same way for me. Although I loved the idea of Harvard when I applied, I don’t think that I knew it well enough to truly love it. Sure, I was thrilled when I got in, but my actual experiences are why I can now say I love this school. I would never lie to you (that wouldn’t be very veritas or say that Harvard is perfect. I am well aware that our public image is at a low point. Harvard undoubtedly has real issues — but I believe that they can be fixed, or in the short run, at least improved. And we need students like you to help us fix them. Furthermore,the news coveragedoesn’t accurately reflect the average student’s experience. Rather than relying on outsiders’ opinions, listen to whatmultiple studentshave said aboutthe true state of campus.Attending Harvard gives you the chance not only to correct issues, but also to correct the public misperception of Harvard — to pursue veritas. It may sound like a burden to go to a school that needs you to fix its problems — unique problems that are the price of being among the most prominent and scrutinized institutions in America. But Harvard’s mission is “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” However many problems Harvard has, society has far more. It is indeed a burden to fix problems, but something tells me that you’re a citizen-leader who’ll be fixing problems wherever you go. I know Harvard has issues, and I still love Harvard. What it means to love — truly love — is to love unconditionally. To paraphrase Carl Schurz, I support Harvard right or wrong, “if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right.” Harvard will soon be yours — to have and to hold, to love and improve. You have earned an incredibly privileged spot at perhapsthe best university in the world, and many doors are about to open for you. Just remember, it is just as much a privilege as it is a responsibility. I hope you’ll join our cause. Don’t let other people convince you whether or not to attend (unless they’re me . Matthew R. Tobin ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Grays Hall."
crimson_2024_2,"Less than three percent of Harvard facultyself-identify their political beliefsas conservative. This statistic is frequently brandished as evidence of “left-wing bias” at elite institutions of higher learning. It is an odd feature of our current time that we allude to an ideal of weighing “all viewpoints” against one another, as these criticisms often suppose. Indeed, we must ask whether the proposition to include “all viewpoints” is reasonable or even possible. I contend that it is neither. In any given group, there is always only a limited range of viewpoints that are deemed “acceptable.” Although 97 percent of scientists accept that anthropocentric climate change is occurring, 16 percent of Americans deny climate change altogether. Within each group, what differs is the standards of evidence members are willing to accept; to change someone’s mind requires a shared notion of what constitutes a sufficient argument. As we engage in all study, we set standards of knowledge that dictate how inquiry will proceed, what lenses of analysis will be applied, and what proof we will accept as valid. There are also some premises we take as almost incontrovertibly true, and many of these premises are necessary for rigorous inquiry to proceed. The standards we use today in 2024 are vastly different from those used at Harvard’s inception in 1636. A modern physicist cannot be taken seriously without the use of calculus, which was invented decades after the University. If an academic were to apply to the medical faculty today speaking of humorism and miasma, they would be (rightly laughed out of their interview, yet according to the standards of medieval scholarship, these were evident truths. I argue that in another 388 years, our standards will surely be different. To think our way of understanding the world will be the same centuries in the future is a strange hubris, a conviction that we are only a small distance from the pinnacle of knowledge. As such, when we speak of allowing “all viewpoints” into the conversation, what we really mean is allowing a broad variety of viewpoints that fit within our current standards of knowledge, which are a moving target. This process of filtering allows us to have intelligible, productive discourse. Without it, professors of biology would teach creationism alongside evolution. The science faculty, of course, does not do this, because these claims do not fit in with the standards of knowledge we have set for science in our time. What’s considered the best scholarship is changed and replaced, as are the methods of scientific inquiry themselves. How does this more specific understanding of viewpoint diversity affect concerns about ideological bias? Yes, the three percent figure I cite above can be interpreted as a sign of an institution that is failing to ensure adequate ideological diversity among its faculty. But we should consider: What if, instead, it reflects a shift in the norms of scholarship? The faculty at Harvard are hired by the faculty of Harvard. In each instance, top scholars in their fields are selecting candidates for their potential to contribute to the academic environment at Harvard and beyond. The makeup of the faculty, then, does not change overnight, but undergoes a gradual change from the leading scholars of one era to those of the next. If the top scholarship in a field of the social sciences or humanities examines its subject matter from a liberal or left-wing perspective, then this might be indicative of a larger trend in the academy towards liberal or left-wing standards of knowledge as the norm. This doesn’t necessarily mean the exponents of those views are right — we should question whether this shift in norms is justified. Still, this interpretation differs from the more typical accusation of bias, which often imply that Harvard engages in direct viewpoint discrimination when hiring; instead, it opens up the possibility that there is something more academically meritorious about these perspectives on the humanities and social sciences. For the sciences, this interpretation is less convincing. There, the connection between a scholar’s output and their personal politics is less pronounced, due to the less politically charged nature of the subject matter. However, in the humanities and social sciences, this explanation merits consideration because of the inextricable link between the subjective perspectives of scholars and the interpretations of texts, art, culture, or social-scientific data that their work involves. When these scholars decide what phenomena to study, what theoretical lenses to employ, and what interpretations they favor, they necessarily engage in a subjective act. If the forms of analysis that are held in high scholarly regard happen, in our current moment, to be more left-leaning, then this does not necessarily constitute ideological discrimination, but rather a shift in norms that are not purely political. Let me be clear: Even the most offensive of ideas are not “too dangerous” to be discussed, nor should they be banned from any campus. Students and faculty should, of course, have the right to express their views freely and without constraint. No position should be accepted merely because it is the party line. However, if there are legitimate scholarly reasons to prefer some viewpoints over others, whether conservative, liberal, libertarian, moderate, leftist, or other, then these, too, should be respected. There is still room — and a need — for faculty who have more marginal perspectives on approaches to their respective fields. There are still debates to be had about issues on which many scholars are in consensus. Harvard must be careful to offer its students a diversity of scholarly perspectives in all its departments, rather than only the interpretations preferred by a particular political group. Whatever our normative posture, we must ask: Is the demographic composition of Harvard professors an indication that Harvard engages in viewpoint discrimination when hiring, or is it the result of a shift in scholarly norms that has made left-leaning perspectives more accepted? While the former has dominated the discourse on this issue and may play a role in explaining this phenomenon, we must seriously consider the latter. Allison P.

wildcat_arizona_2024_1,"The Arizona women’s basketball team is coached by Adia Barnes, and the Arizona men’s basketball team is coached by Tommy Lloyd. With theNBA playoffs less than two months away, we have seen enough basketball to make some projections for how the end of the season will shake out. There are plenty of futures betting markets to take a look at, including division winners, conference winners and, of course, theNBAchampion. All odds presented in this article are courtesy ofDraftKings. Although these odds do not present too much value, I thinkVegasis siding with the MiamiHeatheavily to win its division for a reason. TheHeatare a team that have been known to pick up its level of play as the season goes on. Led byJimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, this team has proven over the years that they can compete with any team in the league, as they have made theNBA finals two times in the past four years. Right before theall-star break, they added Terry Rozier, who will add a scoring boost for a team that’s weakness comes on the offensive side of the ball. AsRozierbecomes more accumulated into theMiami Heat’ssystem, I predict that this offense will take a big step forward. Additionally, theHeat have the fifth easiest remaining strength of schedule. An experienced team like theHeatwill take advantage of less talented teams. The only competition theHeathave when it comes to winning its division is theOrlando Magic. TheMagicstarted off the season very well, but since the new year, they have been a slightly above average teamwith a record of 16-13. TheMagiclack experience and offensive prowess at times, as they rank 22nd in the NBA in offensive rating.TheHeathave struggled with injuries all year,having put out at least 31 different starting lineups this year.They are now starting to get healthier, which solidifies them as the best team in this division. The Dallas Mavericks have the two best players in this division, Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic. The Maverickscould be considered the winners of the trade deadline, as they addedtwo new key pieces to help support Irving and Doncic.TheMavs traded for Daniel Gafford, who is on a shortlist of players that average at least two offensive rebounds and two blocks this season. The only other players on the list areVictor Wembanyama, Rudy Gobert, Anthony Davis, Nic Claxton and Walker Kessler,who are all formidable players in theNBA. The Mavericks also replaced Grant Williams,who reportedly was not loved by his teammates inDallas, withpower forward P.J. Washington. Washingtonis an upgrade fromWilliams, asWashingtonhas averaged11.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 31.9 minutes per game this season. The Mavericksonly competition in theSouthwest Division is the New Orleans Pelicans,who aretwo games ahead of theMavs. Not only are theMavsa better and more talented team, but they also have a much easier remaining schedule.The Pelicans rank in the top 10 when it comes to the hardest remaining schedule. The Mavs rank in the bottom 10. Take the plus odds to the bank and see your bet cashwhen the season comes to an end on April 14th. +250is amazing value for the most well-rounded and talented team in theWestern Conference. Tyronn Lue should be given more credit than he is given, as he has figured out a system that allowsJames Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Paul Georgeto play together effectively.Hardenis one of the league’s best facilitators and has proven throughout his career to be one of the greatest scorers this league has ever seen. Leonard and George are two of the best two-way players in the league and can both score effectively on all three levels. Their biggest challenge in theWest will be the defending champions the Denver Nuggets. I give theClippersthe advantage in this matchup, as I feel its depth will prevail in a seven-game series.The Nuggets lost Bruce Brown to free agency this season,who played a crucial role in theirNBA Finals run last year. The Clippers‘ role players, Terance Mann, Russell Westbrook and Norman Powell,provide depth for theClippersand will play a key role in theClippers’playoff success. The Boston Celticsare the most complete and talented team in theNBA, which is why I have them winning both theEastern Conference and NBA Finals. You could make an argument that their starting five is the most complete starting five inNBA history.The starting five, which includes two new offseason additions inJrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis, is perfect for the modern-dayNBA. On the defensive side of the ball, they have four amazing perimeter defenders and a rim protector in the middle.Holiday and Derrick White were both All-NBA defenders last year. TheCelticsare the lone team in theNBA with two All NBA defenders from last year.This defensive system has proven to be effective,as they rank 1st in the NBA in defensive rating. Offensively, they play with incredible spacingas all of their starters shoot above 34% from the 3-point line. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are two of the best perimeter scorers in the league, both averaging over 22 points per game.The rest of the startersall average in double figures as well,which is very rare and makes them incredibly hard to guard. This floor spacing and talented starting five has allowed them to alsorank first in the NBA in offensive rating. The Celticsalso have experience, asthey made the conference finals in three of the past four years. However, thisCelticsteam has never been able to get over the hump and win it all. TheCelticsbeing close so many times but not prevailing makes them more hungry than ever. TheNBAseason has flown by as we are already past the all-star break. We have now seen enough basketball to make some futures bets and predict the outcome of theNBAseason. FollowtheDaily WildcatonInstagramandTwitter/X"
crimson_2024_116,"Today, Alexander “Shabbos” Kestenbaum, frequent Fox News talking head, recent Divinity School graduate, and self-proclaimed spokesperson for Jewish students at Harvard isheaded to the Republican National Convention. There, he will endorse former reality TV star,fraudster, andconvicted white collar criminal, Donald J. Trump, for president of the United States. In other surprising news, a giraffe was spotted at the Franklin Park Zoo. Anyone tuned in to this year’s on-campus political tensions probably knows Kestenbaum’s name. As the lead plaintiff in theHarvard antisemitism lawsuit, he is an ardent critic of the school, an apoplectic social media presence, and one of the most vocal counter-protesters at pro-Palestine events. Kestenbaum says that at the convention, he will address the “moral degradation, illiberalism, and systemic antisemitism” in Harvard’s culture. For evidence of moral degradation on campus, Kestenbaum need look no further than a sign he proudly held in opposition to the pro-Palestine encampment in The Yard, which read, “From the river to the plaza, send these students/antisemites off to Gaza” (he had two versions . If that’s not enough, he can turn to his (now wisely deleted comment on a recent Instagram post from Harvard’s pro-Palestine groups, which read, “If you guys love the intifada so much, have you considered blowing yourselves up too? That would really show those Zionists.” Take a second to read that again. It speaks for itself. Further, Kestenbaum’s aversion to illiberalism also seems to mysteriously disappear when it comes to sharing a stage with theother RNC speakersthis week in Milwaukee. Now, Shabbos is not wrong that there is antisemitism on our campus, and that some of it is baked in deep. An encounter with anti-Jewish bias is pretty much a given, in one form or another, for most Jews at Harvard — especially those who vocally support Israel’s existence. These biases are clearly present within our campus’s pro-Palestine organizing. While their unwavering condemnation of Israeli violence against innocent Palestinians resonates with me, I too see some classmates who are unwilling to do the same for Hamas’s atrocities, and who have turned Zionism into a slur, a disqualification for their respect. Like many, I am dismayed by the targetedafter-dark protestof Interim President Garber at his home and by what I believe is a vocal yet destructive minority — such as leaders of one of the groups mutually responsible for the PSC’santisemitic cartoon— refusing to move away from tropes like “intifada.”Their choicestacitly endorse violence and signal an unwillingness to take the concerns of their Jewish peers seriously. I’m sure Shabbos would agree with these critiques. But instead of working to break down barriers to talk about these issues in what should be a thoughtful, constructive, academic environment, Kestenbaum — like many of the people he disavows — has quite literally fought hate with hate. It is for this reason that, as I reflect on a complex and difficult school year, Shabbos is one of the people toward whom I feel the most anger and frustration. While so many students from diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds physically and emotionally exhausted themselves trying to build bridges between their peers and create spaces for respectful conversation around Israel and Palestine, Kestenbaum actively fanned the flames of vitriol on our campus, straining their efforts. All the while, as he instigated demonstrators in Harvard Yard and as he continues to comment at large on our campus culture, he — as a student of one of Harvard’s smallest, most insular graduate schools, and now as a graduate — has been largely shielded from the residual impact of his actions on the wider student body. At this point, any conversation about ensuring Jewish safety, comfort, and inclusion at Harvard or elsewhere is completely debilitated when Kestenbaum is at the forefront. Critiques of violent rhetoric aren’t very salient when they traffic in, well,violent rhetoric. I don’t care that he used to support Bernie, or that he’s still a registered Democrat. Frankly, I don’t care who he votes for. I care that his actions made our campus a more hostile environment, and that he is now wielding a claim to the Jewish experience at Harvard for political gain. Kestenbaum can go on, enjoy the RNC, stump for Trump, and snuggle up to the same people who have embraced white nationalism and antisemitism like thegreat replacement theory, which has inspired multiple murderous attacks against Jews across this country. He can let Republicans use his words as weapons to lambaste higher education and continue their crusade on our political freedoms all he wants. But he doesn’t speak on behalf of anybody other than himself. Matthew E. Nekritz ’25, an Associate Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Cabot House."
thetech_mit_2024_5,"I am writing to address the “ongoing campus tensions” and the “challenging times facing the MIT community.” This piece is a love letter to the Scientists Against Genocide Encampment and an admonishment of the MIT administration’s brutalities against its own students. It is a plea for MIT to stick by its stated values and devote its resources to the welfare of humanity. More pressingly, it is a call for MIT’s students and workers to stand in solidarity with their peers — rather than MIT as an institution — when it is clear that MIT is building technologies that slaughter civilians. These are also matters of urgency; discussions concerning student safety and well-being cannot be tabled to the next DEI meeting. Almost thirty undergraduate and graduate students have been interim suspended; they’ve been evicted from campus housing; they are barred from attending classes and exams, and their paychecks have been cut. That group of students includes one graduate student living with his wife and their five-year-old daughter and one Palestinian student who faced a serious deportation risk due to a suspension that was so baseless that it was thrown out 1, 2 . Students have worked towards good-faith negotiations with the administration for three weeks; administrators canceled negotiations meetings less than twenty minutes before they began and rejected an agreement clause stating that MIT should not accept research funding from nations for which there is plausible evidence that they are committing genocide (as determined by Human Rights Watch violations without providing any counterargument for that rejection 7 . Israel invaded Rafah on Monday, May 6th 8 , the same day that MIT attempted to shut down the SAGE encampment. On Tuesday, May 7th, the entire negotiations committee was suspended. The Scientists Against Genocide were left with little choice other than to escalate the pressures on MIT through peaceful acts of civil disobedience. We cannot idle as Palestinians are being ceaselessly slaughtered. We cannot devote ourselves more to order than to justice. Nine students were violently arrested during a peaceful picket at the Stata Center on Thursday; MIT and Cambridge police officers slammed these students onto the concrete and on top of cars, threw them, and tackled them into the street 3 . Multiple were left with bruises and other visible injuries. An additional ten students were arrested early Friday morning; these students awoke at four A.M. to over one hundred riot cops dismantling their encampment and flinging their belongings into recycling and garbage trucks 4 . Weeks worth of artwork was dumped; our community-curated library with over seventy books was tossed into the recycling. Piles of food, tents, and sleeping bags were trashed -- a tremendous waste. MIT claims that the arrests and the encampment sweep were done to keep the “campus community safe” 5 . I question which community members’ safety MIT seeks to ensure; the arrested, suspended, and evicted students are disproportionately from marginalized groups. MIT cannot attract a diverse student body by slamming its students of color onto the sidewalk or by evicting its low-income students from their on-campus housing. This point is perhaps most exemplified in an MIT-wide email from Sally Kornbluth on May 3rd, addressing concerns related to a counterprotest happening later that day. The email claimed that the counterprotest was “in support of MIT s Israeli and Jewish students” and describes a previous pro-Palestine rally as “in support of the encampment” 11 . Besides the simple fact that many of MIT’s Jewish students — representing the student group MIT Jews for Ceasefire — were active participants in the encampment and scorned MIT’s claim that the May 3rd pro-Israeli rally was in support of them, referring to the encampment as an abstracted entity erases the students behind it. The MIT Coalition for Palestine is an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse coalition of students and workers; our members come from across the globe and carry a diverse range of religious beliefs and cultural identities. It is not just the needs of these students and workers that are being ignored by the Institute, though. The administration’s unwillingness to negotiate in good faith with these students demonstrates a blatant disregard for their intellect, their dedication, and their ideals; this is a great and shameful loss for the entire MIT community. I could babble on about President Kornbluth’s emails and the administration’s actions of choice, though I’d like to take a moment to mourn the encampment itself. I sincerely miss it; in spite of the administration’s later efforts to shield the encampment from public view through the use of felt-covered barricades, it was a beautiful space. If nothing else, I m incredibly grateful that this place was part of my MIT experience. The time I spent there empowered me to channel my anger into action and bestowed me with an unyielding courage to fight for the good of the world and its people. I believe that efforts to archive and share witness to the encampment itself are incredibly relevant to MIT as an institution -- the SAGE encampment is perhaps the spitting image of the type of community that MIT professes to work towards in its own values statement. “We strive to make our community a humane and welcoming place where people from a diverse range of backgrounds can grow and thrive — and where we feel we all belong.”This quote is excerpted from the MIT Values statement, “Belonging and Community” 9 . The SAGE encampment was the vibrant multicultural space on MIT’s campus that student and faculty advocates alike have dreamt of building for decades. We danced, we read, we recited poetry, we planted flowers, we broke bread, we prayed, and we did PSETs. We constructed a drainage system and held spontaneous drum circles. We organized Jumuah, Shabbat, and Seder celebrations, we squee-geed water from our tarps when it rained, and we birdwatched. We are Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, atheist, and otherwise. We are undergraduate and graduate students pursuing wildly disparate areas of study. We come from all parts of the world. Our lived experiences are entirely different from one another’s, and this is an asset to our movement. We are united in our respect for human dignity and our struggle for the liberation of the Palestinian people. “We know that attending to our own and each other’s wellbeing in mind, body, and spirit is essential. We believe that decency, kindness, respect, and compassion for each other as human beings are signs of strength”(from “Belonging and Community” 9 . Countless community members generously donated trays of home-cooked and catered meals and snacks; as a student with no meal plan, the availability of fresh food at all hours of the day (and night! significantly improved my personal well-being. Food deliveries were so consistent that even students not involved with the encampment remarked that SAGE had drastically improved campus food security 12 . SAGE campers took on marshall shifts to keep each other safe from harassment and medic shifts to attend to each other s physical and mental health needs; when a student suffered a panic attack after ceaseless harassment from counter-protestors, community members banded together and constructed makeshift curtains to afford the student some privacy. We look out for one another. Our care for each other makes us stronger. “Valuing potential over pedigree, we know that talent and good ideas can come from anywhere — and we value one another’s contributions in every role”(from “Belonging and Community” 9 . The encampment s physical structure facilitated organic interactions between students, faculty, staff, workers, alumni, and community members. MIT faculty delivered spontaneous history lessons, and multiple dining hall workers visited the encampment to voice their solidarity. It is disheartening that communications from the administration claimed that the encampment was “dangerous” because it drew in “outside protestors” 6 — rather, this aspect of the encampment made it a lively gathering place for the Cambridge community. The retired professors, bakery owners, and zen Buddhist monks who dropped by the encampment to donate meals and engage in friendly conversation certainly weren’t endangering students. “Together we possess uncommon strengths, and we shoulder the responsibility to use them with wisdom and care for humanity and the natural world”(from “Belonging and Community” 9 . The encampment served as a model for a society that we strive towards: a community whose members see each other’s well-being as critical to their own and one in which challenges are overcome cooperatively. More so, we stand for a ceasefire in Gaza and a severance of MIT’s direct research ties with the Israeli Ministry of Defense. We erected an encampment on April 21st because the situation in Gaza is truly dire; the slaughter of civilians is pressing onwards as we study for finals and pack dorm room items into cardboard boxes. 40,000 Palestinians have been massacred since October 7th. Men are confined in concentration camps, women are being beaten and sexually violated, children are starving and bleeding. On Monday, May 6, Israel pushed an invasion into Rafah 8 , a city of over 1.4 million people, many of whom had fled there after their hometowns were destroyed. Every university in Gaza has been bombed. There are only three partially functioning hospitals left in Rafah 10 . Forty thousand people are dead, and the death toll rises daily. You don’t need a degree in international relations to understand how horrific this is. From Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics by bell hooks: “True resistance begins with people confronting pain…and wanting to do something to change it.” If we surrender our minds to hatred and despair, the world we strive towards — one of peace and dignity, one in which every child is treated as one of our own — will never be realized. We will not be deterred by counterprotestors; hence, I will not devote any space to discussing their actions in this piece. The encampment served not only as a reminder of the atrocities happening daily in Gaza but also as an alternative to a society ruled by the capitalistic and colonial forces we fight against; what better way to work towards an egalitarian, liberated, and democratic future than by modeling the principles of community care and humanitarian conscientiousness in our own daily living? We are proud to take on the struggle against the cynicism promoted in our classes — the one that claims that the conflicts of the Middle East are too complicated to ever be resolved, the one that claims that the world is so complex that problematic socio-economic and political systems are too massive to study and too pervasive to change — and the disillusionment coursing through our political atmosphere. We carry an irrational optimism that we will leave the children of the world to come with a society free from terror and violence. We must believe that we will plant olive trees and tomato gardens where bombs once dropped; what other choice do we have? Let me be abundantly clear: throwing out the tents on Kresge Lawn will not eradicate a movement of people united; their horror of Israel’s war crimes channeled into the resolve to fight for the people of Gaza. So long as IOF-funded projects like drone swarm research are carried out at MIT, we will continue to fight; the children of Palestine are our children, too, and we will look out for them in any way that we know how. MIT, you have an opportunity here; severing the ties allows you to set an example for universities across the world for what it means to put your principles where your pocketbook is and to conduct technological research that enhances the lives of people across the globe, rather than destroying them. You have the opportunity to show your peers what it means to stand with your students and workers and what it looks like to collaborate with your student leaders, rather than silence them. Students and workers, you must stand for something. Complicity is comfortable but not necessarily sustainable; whatever cruelties are output into the world eventually circle their way back around. Your beliefs are yours to contemplate; I do hope, though, that the notion that human life is sacred and worthy of defending is chief among them. Bearing witness to the brutal slaughter of the Palestinian people is challenging, but it is essential if we want this systemic violence to end. Rebuking the actions of your own educational institution is even more difficult, but there is courage to be found in numbers, and there is power to be found in this collective fight. Our eyes are focused on Rafah, our index fingers are pointed towards MIT’s IOF research projects, and our hearts lie with the people of Palestine. The struggle shall continue forth as fiercely as ever — will you join us?"
ubyssey_2024_11,"FromOpinion March 21, 2024 Written byJess Goldman Editor’s Note: This write-up offers some background context for the author’s comic on the subject of their experience as a Jewish student with Hillel and Zionism at UBC, which follows below. Additional information about the author’s artistic decisions was added to the body of the article on March 25, 2024, at 7:47 PM. Jess Goldman (they/them is a queer Jewish writer, comics artist, amateur puppeteer, and half-baked Yiddishist based on the traditional, unceded lands of the Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, and Musqueam peoples. Jess is also a grad student in the Creative Writing Program, in the homestretch of their thesis –– a speculative graphic memoir about their relationship to their bubbe, their Jewish grandmother. A bisl context for this comic: Hillel BC is a Jewish student organization that leases land from UBC (though it’s not directly affiliated with the university . And despite its claims to represent all campus Jews, as an anti-Zionist Jew of conscience, I haveneverfelt represented by Hillel, an organization that envisions a world in which “every Jewish student is inspired to make an enduring commitment to Jewish life, learning and Israel,” as their “about” webpage states. To Hillel, Judaism, Jewish culture and Zionism are all one and the same. And so, nu, it is in the world of this logic that anti-Zionism becomes antisemitism. I reject this. There is a long,often supressedhistory of Jewish anti-Zionism going back to the Jewish Labour Bund in the early 20th century. To oppose Zionism is to oppose a settler-colonial project rooted in white supremacist expansionism. It is not anti-Semitic. In fact, I’d argue it’s the opposite. Hillel claims to be the singular voice for Jews on campus and that it welcomes all campus Jews into its space, using language on their website like “pluralistic” and “inclusive”. Yet even though their website claims to “provide an opportunity for robust conversations about Jewish issues and Israel affairs in an atmosphere of openness and respect,” in January I was refused entry into one of their events because I was not on their “pre-approved list”. Keep in mind that this event was advertised as public and had no registration form. So, in my experience, “inclusion” at Hillel is conditional –– conditional on total faith in Israel, as if Israel itself were a religion and not a nation-state. I was compelled to make this comic after theAMS Council meeting on February 28in which the Council struckthe Palestine Referendumfrom the General Election ballot citingAMS Bylaw 4(2 . Though it was an incredibly ambitious referendum, and AMS had the authority to remove it from the ballot, I still wish we lived in a world where the referendum could have gone through and been put to a vote in the General Election. Why not let students decide? Among its demands were that the university condemn the genocide in Gaza, provide support and protection to Palestinian students, as well as other students of colour who have experienced harassment since October 7, divest from corporations actively funding the genocide (like weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems , and participate in PACBI, thePalestinian Campaign for the Cultural and Academic Boycott of Israel. The referendum also demanded that the university end Hillel BC’s lease on the land (land that is, in the first place, stolen from the Musqueam people . This was preceded by Hillel inviting an Israeli Defence Force soldier to speak on campus amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and also followed a Hillel subcontractor distributing offensive stickers across campus, fraudulently attributed to the Social Justice Centre. The latter incident is now the subject of adefamation lawsuit. At the February 28 meeting where AMS Council decided the fate of the referendum, I, along with two other UBC students, spoke in support of the referendum as a pro-Palestinian Jewish student who refuses to allow Hillel to co-opt my voice. Three students also spoke in support of Hillel. This comic details the aftermath of that experience and the ways in which Hillel and Zionism at large pit Jews against one another (and against our Palestinian comrades , attempting to actively silence any expression of Jewishness that does not have the State of Israel at its centre. I understand that the portrayals of Jewishness in this comic might provoke an intense reaction in some readers, both Jewish and non-Jewish. However, as a queer assimilated Jew, the way I draw myself is a reclamation of my Jewishness. This portrayal is particularly relevant now. A moment in which Jewish communities are having intense intracommunal battles over Jewish identity –– in other words, who is Jewish and who is not, which frequently becomes a determination based on one s faith in Zionism and Israel. There s a long line of Jewish artists who have played with antisemitic tropes as a means of political critique and cultural reclamation. Jewish comics artists likeEli ValleyandAline Kominsky-Crumbhave used antisemitic tropes to reclaim a loud, boisterous, and shameless diasporic Jewishness, and I’m dipping from the same inkwell. A big part of the process of Jewish assimilation into European and North American culture was tamping down our Jewishness and stripping ourselves of our Jewish embodiedness. In his book,Unheroic Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish Man, the Jewish scholar, Daniel Boyarin, talks about how European culture saw Jewish men as “feminine” (read: queer because they were more embodied than their gentile counterparts, and so it was only by disavowing their embodiedness that Jewish men could assimilate. I would argue that this has applied to not only Jewish men, but all Jews. So I ll leave you with two things: the inaugural episode of the Jewish Currents podcasts,On The Nose, which discusses the reactions to their controversial magazine cover of a hooked nose, and their nuanced responses to it, as well as the Jewish lesbian poet Adrienne Rich s words, which, to me, sum up everything I’m talking about here and invoking in my comic: “…change your name, your accent, your nose; straighten or dye your hair; stay in the closet; pretend the Pilgrims were your fathers; become baptized as a Christian… starve yourself to look young, thin, and feminine; don’t gesture with your hands; value elite European culture above all others; laugh at jokes about your own people; don’t make trouble; defer to white men; smile when they take your picture; be ashamed of who you are…”.

stanforddaily_2024_22,"On Nov. 8, all earth systems majors received an email from the faculty director of the earth systems program asking for input on a proposed name change. The survey listed rankable options but didn’t include the current major name, inciting community backlash; we personally spoke to dozens of majors who were unhappy and even angry with the change, and did not hear student voices excited about a name change. We are the 2023-24 earth systems student advisors and we are against the proposed name change of earth systems to “sustainability science and systems.” The Doerr School has failed to incorporate student feedback, and is making this proposal in spite of our continued protests. The larger Stanford community, and the Faculty Senate Committee on Review of Undergraduate Majors (C-RUM , who will vote on this proposal soon, should hear our perspective and concerns as this decision is made. In response to student concern, the Doerr School and Earth Systems Leadership organized a town hall and focus group to solicit further feedback from students, both of which occurred during Week 10. We subsequently senta letterto Doerr School Dean Arun Majumdar synthesizing the perspectives of the Earth System’s cohort and created a petition against the change which was ultimately signed by 115 students and alumni. However, on Jan. 16, the Doerr School announced that the name “Sustainability Science and Systems” would be sent to C-RUM for approval. This name had not appeared in the original survey, town hall or feedback group, and thus has received no backing from students. Furthermore, the proposed name directly rejects the most resounding feedback expressed repeatedly by the student body: to preserve the word “earth” in the name and to avoid emphasizing the word “sustainability.” To ignore these two critical requests is to ignore the very people at the core of this major. In defense of ‘earth systems‘ The earth systems program’s success and popularity is due in part to its foundation as an “interdisciplinary environmental science” degree that uses a systems thinking approach to address planetary issues. The major name, earth systems, reflects this in a decades-old program with a tight-knit community encouraging students to “investigate complex environmental problems.” If the Doerr School is truly concerned with expanding this legacy, earth systems is the only acceptable name. It is essential that the current name of the major encapsulates the interdisciplinary nature, scientific foundations, and systems-thinking central to the earth systems program. Additionally, “earth” is the foundation of the current name, and it is what unites us within the major. We are all in this major because we were drawn to a degree that emphasizes protecting, learning from, and celebrating the Earth. Removing “earth” from the name reshapes what direction the degree will take, the faculty that will be hired, and the classes that will be taught. The problem with ‘sustainability sciences and systems‘ The proposed name centers the term sustainability. While learning about sustainability is apartof the earth systems curriculum, its core components are “science, economics, and policy,” which exist beyond the scope of sustainability. As with most corporate lingo, “sustainability” lacks a universal definition. The Doerr School of Sustainability has yet to offer a clear definition themselves. Even sustainability department coursework reflects this vagueness: a debate about the definition is an introductory element of SUST 210: “Pursuing Sustainability: Managing Complex Systems.” This ambiguity is dangerous, especially in situations where our degree precedes us. Potential employers and curious future students will be left to interpret the degree themselves, with the buzzword of “sustainability” changing in connotation every day. Furthermore, the newly announced Environmental Social Sciences Department isdevelopinga new undergraduate degree program that could satisfy the Doerr School’s interest in sustainability sciences, once again rendering a name change unnecessary. Stanford does not have a conventional environmental science degree. Stanford’s bachelor of science in earth systems is the closest equivalent. Peer institutions offer comparable degrees: environmental sciences (Berkeley , environmental science and public policy (Harvard , and environmental science (Columbia . Earth systems is a clear analogue to these degrees. Sustainability science and systems is not, which could turn away a large pool of current and future undergraduates looking for such an education. The Doerr Schoolclaimsthat the future name is “easily understandable and recognizable to prospective students and high school families.” They’ve offered nothing to support this claim, which runs counter to the experiences of many current students. The proposed move towards “sustainability” represents a worrying trend away from the natural sciences in exchange for vague corporate lingo. The town hall and focus group feedback strongly opposed the use of “sustainability” in the major’s name due to its narrowed scope and worrying ambiguity, yet the SDSS Faculty Governance group explicitly ignored this feedback, adding the terms “science” and “systems” in an apparent attempt at compromise. However, the injection of “sustainability” and complete removal of “earth” from the name shows the Doerr School’s failure to genuinely consider student perspectives. A lack of transparency After the feedback process, the Doerr School continues to push the proposed name change. One should question what motivates this charge, especially given the Doerr School’s acceptance of fossil fuel funding. Stanford flaunts its students as leaders, and yet this change comes with minimal student involvement and no true student agency. This proposed changedoes notcome from the earth systems community, but rather from departmental administrative superiors who have failed to attend our feedback initiatives or listen to the clear and direct support of the current name. The Doerr School touts a “five-year timeline of community engagement” inthis decision, yet student involvement made up just a few weeks of that process. The next steps The final opportunity to prevent this change from taking place is the C-RUM approval process, which is ongoing this quarter. Faculty and students on C-RUM should take these student concerns into account, and make a decision that supports student interest and agency, rather than one motivated by opaque processes and empty language. Earth systems’ 32-year legacy as a community of students and faculty who truly care about the Earth should not be rhetorically erased.

state_press_2024_3,"ASU’s defense lined up at the rivalry game between ASU and UA on Saturday, Nov. 25, 2023 in Tempe. ASU lost 59-23. It took just two years for UA head coach Jedd Fisch to turn a once appalling, one-win Wildcat team into a nearly unstoppable force — a force that took down the mighty Oklahoma Sooners in the Alamo Bowl to cap off a 10-3 season. But it was all for naught as Fisch unexpectedly left it all to become Washington s head coach, stunning the Wildcat faithful and sending shockwaves throughout college football. However, players typically follow when a successful coach like Fisch leaves a program. ASU head coachKenny Dillinghamneeds to capitalize on the chagrin of Wildcats hitting the transfer portal. It all happened in the blink of an eye — almost a ripple effect. Former Alabama head coach Nick Saban announced his retirement on Jan. 10. Alabama then filled the hole by hiring former Washington head coach Kalen DeBoer on Jan. 12. All of a sudden, Washington had a coaching vacancy, and Fisch’s name was being thrown in the pot. Yet, if there’s one thing we’ve learned about college football over the years, it’s that money talks. Washington showed Fisch the money, and he took it: seven years, $54.3 million. This signing perfectly exemplified what college football has become: a cash grab. “I did not take the decision to come to the University of Washington lightly,” Fisch told Washington reporters. “But once (university president Ana Mari Cauce and (athletic director Troy Dannen showed me what is possible in Seattle and what their vision of the future looks like, there was no answer other than yes. It’s not just about Washington football that brought us here.” The situation only continued to snowball following Fisch s departure. On Monday, UA announced that athletic director Dave Heeke had been fired after hiring Brett Brennan to replace Fisch. Along with the change in personnel, the University has also been vocal about itsfinancial crisis. The Sun Devils are coming off back-to-back 3-9 seasons, undoubtedly their worst stretch in nearly eight decades. Growing up a Valley native, I’ve seen a handful of great players pass through this program;N’Keal Harry,Brandon AiyukandJayden Danielsall come to mind. I’ve seen some pretty good Sun Devil football teams and a handful of mediocre ones. But nothing this bad. The program has undoubtedly seen better days. Former coaches Herm Edwards and Antonio Pierce (with the help of a few others drove the program into the ground amid recruiting violations around COVID-19 restrictions from 2020-21. READ MORE:NCAA investigating ASU football for possible recruiting violations Now, Edwards enjoys a full-time gig with ESPN, and Pierce is making headlines with the Las Vegas Raiders, leaving Dillingham with all the baggage. The 32-year-old Valley native is left to rebuild the storied program while the NCAA hasn’t even leveled the team’s sanctions after three years of investigation. The worst may still be to come. Still, most seem to turn a blind eye to the former Sun Devils destruction of the program. All things considered, Dillingham has already done a great job this offseason. He built one of the largest recruiting classes in the country, and the program will welcome 39 additions for the upcoming season. Of the 39 incoming players, 22 are transfers, and 17 are true freshmen. “We were filling in the cracks rather than laying the cement,” Dillingham told reporters at a press conference on Friday. “It s like round two of painting the wall. If anybody can go paint the wall once, it ain t going to be good. You better go paint it a second time and get all the lines cleaned up, then a third time. And that s kind of how recruiting works.” Nonetheless, the Sun Devils are in a prime position to take advantage of Fisch’s departure. His fleeing was a sucker punch to the Wildcat faithful, and it can certainly gut Arizona’s roster. Since Fisch’s departure, 12 Wildcats have entered the transfer portal, nine alone since Jan. 17, when Brent Brennan was announced as Fisch’s replacement in Arizona. Among those transferring are offensive lineman Raymond Pulido, cornerback Ephesians Prysock and running back Jonah Coleman, who announced his commitment to Washington on Sunday. To Arizona s delight, one of the top offensive duos in the country, quarterback Noah Fifita and receiver Tetairoa McMillan, announced their return to the team despite Fisch s exit. In addition, numerous Arizona assistant coaches are expected to flock up north, following Fisch to join the Washington staff as the team embarks on a new journey in the Big Ten. Amid all the drama surrounding Fisch and other coaches nationwide, Dillingham has made it clear that he’s in for the long haul. “At the end of the day, when you move from here, you re going to want to come back, Dillingham said. There s a part of you that wants to want to come back. That s part of it. I ve done it. Now, both ASU and UA will be searching for new ADs, and Dillingham has the opportunity to capitalize on the situation through recruiting. Incoming Sun Devils noticed his commitment; some even picked the Valley as their home because of his adherence. It s a stepping stone for recruiting in years to come. Dillingham s loyalty and Fisch s departure will influence the classes of 2025, 2026 and beyond in their decision to wear maroon/gold or red/blue. “I went through a coaching change in the past with Coach (Luke Fickell leaving (Cincinnati to go to Wisconsin, so being able to know that the coach that I have here wants to be here … It was really important to me in the transfer portal process,” incoming redshirt junior transferJustin Wodtlysaid. It soothes me a little bit, knowing that nobody s going nowhere.” READ MORE:Kenny Dillingham continues to recruit, rebuild football program Things are crazy down south. The clock is ticking; Arizona players have 30 days since Fisch’s departure on Jan. 15 to enter the transfer portal. It’s evident that Dillingham is looking to get all the players he can get. He strives to have competition in every position. While Jaden Rashada looked like the surefire starting quarterback next year, Dillingham brought in former four-star quarterbackSam Leavittfrom Michigan State. It’s part of the culture he’s working to build here in Tempe. “At the end of the day, we re going to bring in the best players for this football program in any position. I don t care if we have a sitting first-round draft pick. If there s another first-round draft pick at that position, we ll bring him in,” Dillingham said. “If you think you re not going to compete, you re fooling yourselves. And if you don t think competition makes you better, you re fooling yourselves. “If you ask any great at anything, in any profession … anything you do in life, if you re scared of competition, there s no way you re going to be great.” While there s strict competition among the roster, the competition remains strict between ASU and Arizona. It s one of the top rivalries in the country. Both schools have an incredible recruiting history. Both schools have produced incredible NFL talent. In a state once dominated by Fisch s recruiting, Dillingham and the Sun Devils are now in an advantageous position in the Valley. It fell right into their laps, and Dillingham s loyalty and commitment to his program, unlike Fisch s, will prove pivotal in the recruiting game for years to come.

crimson_2024_11,"On Dec. 19, I attendeda dinner conversationinitiated by two members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, with several leaders of theCouncil on Academic Freedom at Harvardto discuss issues pertaining to CAFH’s mission. Surprisingly, the dinner drew public attention, and while much of the popular discourse about it has concerned what was said — and how it wasmischaracterized— this piece addresses a more fundamental matter, even more urgent now that University President ClaudineGay has resigned: What might that dinner and subsequent discussions teach us about the role of the Corporation in the current state of Harvard University and the path forward? Universities — like other corporations and non-profit organizations — require formal governing bodies to oversee those responsible for day-to-day management and operations. Harvard has two such governing boards. The Harvard Corporation is the smaller and more powerful board, while the Board of Overseers is a larger body of elected alumni who provide counsel to the Corporation on various matters. According to itsweb page, the Corporation “exercises fiduciary responsibility with regard to the University’s academic, financial and physical resources and overall wellbeing,” which includes hiring the University president, approving budgets, and overseeing the endowment. Supported by an Office of the Governing Boards, the Corporation operates in a secretive manner and issues few if any public statements. As dean of Harvard Medical School, a position I held from 2007 to 2016, I expected I would come to know the Corporation well. I was wrong. Though I met regularly with then-University President Drew G. Faust, I quickly learned that the Corporation — the only fiduciary body tasked with oversight of the Medical School — had precious little involvement in its operation. As I recall, I met with the Corporation at their request only once a year for between 30 and 45 minutes. Several months before the date I was assigned to appear, I was asked to develop an eight-to-ten slide presentation on the state of the school that was, to my surprise, pre-reviewed and often modified by individuals in the Office of the Governing Boards. I received little or no feedback from the Corporation subsequent to these brief annual presentations. To supplement this hands-off approach to governance, HMS and several other Harvard schools have established non-fiduciary ‘boards’ of prominent people with expertise in a diversity of relevant areas for the purpose of providing advice, feedback, and philanthropic support. TheHMS Board of Fellowsis an outstanding group, from which I obtained much valuable advice and support. Still, such a non-fiduciary board cannot substitute for the lack of meaningful input from a distant and lightly-involved Corporation. Given the University’s extraordinary and well-deserved reputation for excellence, this weakness in its approach to governance appeared unlikely to be questioned. That situation unexpectedly changed in recent weeks, with campus turmoil after Oct. 7 and plagiarism allegations against President Gay. In light of their low public profile, it was surprising when two Corporation members asked to speak directly with CAFH leadership over dinner, but, happily, the rapidly-scheduled multiple-hour discussion was collegial and frank, seeming to leave everyone satisfied that we had engaged in a respectful interchange of ideas. Taking our dinner as a model, the key question that now arises is this: What might the Corporation do in response to the major issues that my colleagues and I brought to the table for discussion, especially now that President Gay has resigned? Five high-level recommendations published in separate articles byprofessor Steven A. Pinkerand myselfwere among the main subjects of the discussion. Our recommendations, which represent our personal views rather than the official position of the CAFH, include developing a new university policy on free speech and academic freedom; developing a policy and clarifying existing policies to proscribe actions that disrupt school operations, academic activities and other events; adopting a policy ofinstitutional neutrality on social and political issues; reviewing DEI programs to identify elements that may improperly restrict free speech; and reviewing the state of viewpoint diversity and approaches to enhancing discussion across difference. The Corporation is the only group with the authority to make such weighty decisions, and adopting these recommendations would require extensive discussion by the president and the full Corporation as well as engagement with many stakeholders. As the Corporation considers these and other responses to its current challenges, it should also weigh whether it has come time to change its approach to its essential fiduciary responsibilities. Those outside the Corporation — the public, University affiliates, and, yes, even school deans — have little awareness of how it conducts its critical work. Beyond the specific recommendations from professor Pinker and myself, the Corporation should step into its role as leader of the nation’s foremost university by committing to a more active engagement with the general public and University stakeholders alike. Harvard is facing an unprecedented crisis in confidence, and responsibility for Harvard’s performance ultimately falls on the Corporation. As it considers how to respond, it must also conduct an objective examination of how this crisis evolved and use it to guide this reset of sorts. How it goes about choosing a new president will be an important first test of their response. As a longstanding member of the faculty who cares deeply about its ongoing success, I stand with most members of the community in being ready to assist them. Jeffrey S. Flier is the Higginson Professor of Physiology and Medicine and was the dean of Harvard Medical School from 2007 to 2016."
stanforddaily_2024_34,"The Daily’s story last Friday about the Office of Undergraduate Admission was a very difficult story to read. I have spent my entire career committed to diversity, broadly defined. So it was challenging to read the comments of a litigant and anonymous individuals painting a picture of our office that I do not recognize and that I find deeply concerning. I find the conclusions of the story imbalanced and misleading. However, I believe the issues are important to our organization and are important for me to address. Advancing diversity across multiple dimensions, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the law, is central to the work of our office. We are committed to diversity in the perspectives, experiences and backgrounds of our staff, just as we are for the applicants we review, admit, enroll and support. I also am concerned for the quality of every staff member’s experience, and I have always been open, as is our senior staff, to hearing concerns about individuals’ work experiences. Unfortunately, I am not permitted to comment on the lawsuit by the former admissions officer that is currently pending other than to say that the university is vigorously defending against it and we believe we will prevail. However, the wellbeing of our staff and the climate of our organization are deeply important to me. First, I am conferring with senior university leadership to develop a climate assessment of our office to be conducted over the next several months. Second, based on the findings of that assessment, I am committed to education, workshops, facilitated interactions and other resources, including for our leadership team. I am also committed to the revitalization of our DEI working group. I hope and trust that the actions we will be taking in the period ahead will support each of our staff members individually, and will support our overall organization, as we continue working to extend opportunity to the next generation of students. Richard H. Shaw is the dean of undergraduate admission and financial aid."
newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_10,"Failure is such a daunting prospect. I find that far too often in life, we fear failure as though it is the end of any progress. The issue is rarely as black-and-white as it seems. I’ve found that failure is the path to growth more often than not, and when possible, we should embrace defeat. Unfortunately, The New University’s sister publication, The AntReader, has failed. It has been just about a year since the brainchild of both current and past New University members was erected. I consider myself one of the editorial board members who contributed to the partial stabilization of the new publication. The New University abruptly announced to the school and to professional staff that operations and staff would mostly transition to The AntReader. Then, we were off. Articles, graphics, logistics, websites, financials and nearly every other service a newspaper could conceivably need were created. We had a team of trained editors and some experienced staff who worked to keep the paper afloat during a time of uncertainty and transition. The future was up in the air, but the publication had a positive outlook. What happened between the end of the summer in 2023 and now, in spring 2024, has no place being discussed in an article such as this one. Regardless of who was to blame, which is wholly unimportant at this point, one thing was clear: the publication was not ready. The publication was not ready to survive with a sparser staff than it had previously. The AntReader was not ready to break out independently after so little time to prepare, and most of all, the publication was certainly not ready to deal with internal conflict. This brings us to now. We have a team of writers, editors, graphic designers and more who are willing to bring this paper back to standards we believe are possible and necessary. We cannot do it alone, however; that much has been made clear to us in the past nine months. There is still uncertainty in the air; we are weighing a rebranding effort for the New University, still trying to create the best possible training methods, and just hired a new editor in chief. Despite the uncertainty, we believe that this is a team that knows how to build such a massive operation from the ground up. Nearly all of us have seen the New University produce at a high level; we know what it takes. I love journalism and the New University more than I love anything at UCI. This paper gave me purpose for the first time at a school that once seemed so massive and daunting, and I feel that I owe it justice. This will not be a one- or two-person show; myself and the rest of the New University staff are unified in this message. We are calling on students who believe in journalism and the right to expression via journalism to join us. We will push harder than we did before to retain, train and nurture the staff who make this publication possible. This comes with a promise from all members—new and old. We are willing and ready to put our best efforts out to ensure your experience with the publication is as rewarding as possible. You need to be willing to work with us and truly give us a chance to do so for you. I’ve seen it work as both an intern less than two years ago and as an editor now, and when it does, it is truly magical. There will no longer be red tape between the editorial board and its staff. I feel that the staff of a publication is its beating heart, and they deserve to know every piece of information possible. Issues of transparency have plagued journalism since its inception, but the New University has always had a hard time maintaining straightforwardness. Transparency on all levels will be the new theme of this publication. After all, what is the point of journalism at all without full transparency? This is a call to all student journalists and student journalists to be across campus. We’re back. Jacob Ramos is a 2023-2024 Opinion Editor. He can be reached atjacobtr@uci.edu."
crimson_2024_46,"As the leading academic powerhouse of the Western world and an institution known for producing global leaders, Harvard cannot separate itself from the crisis of liberalism in the United States. There is a steep decline in institutional faith in the U.S. Mistrust ismounting in everythingfrom Congress to higher education and even organized religion. Amid shifting public opinion, it is crucial that Harvard recognize the ways in which the ivory tower ethos still prevalent at elite universities fails to produce capable leaders. Specifically, these universities’ homogeneously liberal environments cause them to overrepresent orthodox liberal viewpoints and normalize ideological stances seen by much of the nation as extreme, leaving the middle ground undervalued. Just last week, a panel on Islamophobia and antisemitism scheduled to take place in Lowell Housewas canceledafter students expressed discontent in large part owing to the panel’s ideological composition. Though the panelists — two scholars who study Judaism and one who studies Islam — were experts on the issues at hand, they were shouted down. This isn’t a simple case of left versus right. But it speaks to a broader culture that Harvard’s political homogeneity seems to feed: When we rarely encounter views different from ours, our ability to disagree atrophies. That’s why, for the opponents of the Lowell House panel, personal politics outweighed an opportunity for real discourse. This is just the most recent instance of opportunities for fruitful discussion being squashed on campus. These tendencies implicate serious problems for discourse and ideological diversity at the university, but the stakes are far greater than just academic freedom. A lack of receptivity to a broad range of beliefs both results from and worsens the modern liberal’s detachment from public sentiment. In both their language and the policies they espouse, Democrats have alienated great sects of the American public. In 2008, Obama made the mistake of arguing that white, working-class Pennysylvanians “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them.” This only inflamed the hatred toward liberal elites that paved the way for flattering demagogues to seize a sizable portion of the electorate. Officials in the Biden administration have made similarly tone-deaf statements. Then-White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain retweeted a post arguing that inflation and supply chain issues were “high class problems.” This attitude toward pernicious economic conditions that really do affect low-income people has surely contributed to Democrats bleeding support in the last several years, with voters of color especially. Rather than entrenching moralistic views, one chief aim of a political education should be to acquire the ability to grasp shifts in public opinion and craft policy accordingly. Future leaders must have the capacity to sympathize with the struggles and beliefs of Americans across all walks of life. This idea is not new. Abraham Lincoln, for one, understood that “public sentiment is everything. Whoever molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or pronounces judicial decisions.” Lincoln is right: Beyond understanding public opinion, successful leaders must garner popular support. This feat rests on crafting policy which centers a collective “we.” The New Left of the 1960s transformed political activity, inspiring modern identity politics. One scholar, Mark Lilla, has critiqued these identity politics for blinding people to struggles and perspectives outside of their own self-defined group. It is now more vital than ever to combat the consequences of identity politics. Narrow self-identification fosters a culture of cancellation, limits the possibility of meaningful discourse, and obscures the numerous spheres of mutual interest that can unite Americans. An elite education — indeed, any education — must instead steer us toward productively engaging with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints. If Harvard’s academic environment continues to stifle debate and sow ideological extremism, how will its graduates engage effectively in politics? In its continuing effort to create the next generation of American leaders, Harvard must reaffirm its commitment to free speech. This is the guiding light of our University in its pursuit of truth and in its students’ pursuit of knowledge. Harvard should readily solicit speakers, professors, and students whose beliefs fall on both sides of the aisle — hearing even the most deplorable viewpoints is key to understanding public opinion in its entirety. Stifling heterodox opinions isn’t just bad for discourse — it’s bad for creating effective leaders. Katia M. Anastas ’27 is a Crimson Editorial editor."
crimson_2024_100,"“Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless!” Those words could’ve been spoken yesterday, perhaps by a cynical citizen or an apprehensive Harvard student grappling with the latest campus crisis, or even by me, a jaded former president of the College’s largest political organization. But they are actually the opening verses of the millenia-old biblical Book of Ecclesiastes. Amid the myriad intractable quandaries our community has recently faced —diversity in higher education, theIsrael-Hamas war, andfreedom of speech, to name a few — such ancient dejection has frequently occupied my mind. As a senior, I’ve contemplated these concerns alongside more existential questions: What do we do with our lives, and can we really make a difference in the world? Given recent events, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to conclude that we cannot: Protests extendinto impassesor are met withdiluted promisesandadministrative hardball. Attempts to exchange ideasend in offenseand disappointment. Our own democracystimulates conflictand treats civilians like collateral damage despitedomestic discontent. Caught in a loop of vanity and complicity, how do we engage in a world that seems to take two steps back for every step forward? One option might be to focus on education and conversation. The more we know about this complicated world and hear competing ideas for improving it, the more equipped we’ll be to spearhead that improvement, right? In recent months, this model — education as progress — has seemed to be Harvard’s modus operandi. Whendefusing the pro-Palestinian encampmentin Harvard Yard this month, interim Harvard President Alan M. Garber ’76 committed first to discussing “academic matters” with protestors, and administrators have repeated that University affiliates hold a “shared responsibility” to create a campus climate safe for “reasoned dissent” and “true and meaningful dialogue.” Certainly, learning and discoursing have immense value, but without follow-through, they’re unsatisfying — necessary but insufficient. My four years as a member and, eventually, president of the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics taught me this. Repeatedly, feedback we got from peers called for less instruction and more doing; fewer speaker events and more service. Our students were acutely aware that, in the words of philosopher-scientist Herbert Spencer, “the great aim of education is not knowledge but action.” Fulfilling that aim, though, is no simple task. First, fully grasping complex issues is usually costly and inconvenient, and after performing the work of gaining real understanding, we can trick ourselves into thinking the mandate for action ends there. Second, history teaches us that old solutions often create new problems: Independent of all our toil, the world is still broken. Suddenly, we are back where we started, disconcerted by but impotent against the somber realization that every action we take just might be meaningless. This is not an uncommon view: The IOP’sSpring 2024 Harvard Youth Pollof 18 to 29-year-olds nationwide found that young Americans are disillusioned, with 41 percent saying they don’t believe their vote will make a difference in the 2024 election. A2022 Pew Research pollfound that citizen majorities in several countries worldwide, including more than two thirds of American adults, think their political systems disable them from impacting politics. Such feelings of futility are neither new nor dependent on social standing: In about 950 BCE, one of antiquity’s most powerful kings wrote the grim, nearly defeatist lines with which I started this piece. The seemingly broken link between people’s actions and good outcomes does not discriminate. To discern why we feel this way, it’s helpful to ask: What is “good?” If goodness is perfection — perfect liberation, perfect justice, perfect equity — then yes, most actions, careers, or movements likely won’t create a good world. And how big is the world that we’re trying to fix? The fact that no one has yet succeeded in saving all of it can be debilitating. However, when we redefine our metrics for efficacy, action becomes more tenable. As I learned in “Making Change When Change is Hard,” a general education course taught by Cass R. Sunstein ’75, former President Barack H. Obama did just that, motivating his team with the mantra: “better is good.” Perfection need not be the only objective. Instead, good might also just be an improvement on yesterday for one specific community. In classic Ec10 style, maybe the measure of meaning is on the margin. A world free from social, economic, and political ills is probably unattainable, and to suggest otherwise is to be blindly optimistic and incognizant of history’s nonlinear trajectory. More importantly, by aiming for perfection, we set ourselves up for speedy disenchantment when the future lets us down. But that doesn’t mean we should lose sight of our ideals. If “better is good,” then our work, our advocacy, even our education all have potency, because it is easier to make the world better than to make the world perfect. Easier, though, does not mean easy. The “arc of the moral universe” cannot “bend toward justice,” as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, if we don’t push it with force and conviction. Former U.S. President John F. Kennedy ’40 — the IOP’s namesake — perfectly captured this sentiment in his address on the moon landing, explaining that we choose to pursue our goals for a better world “not because they are easy but because they are hard.” Hard is still possible. Hard is meaningful. Hard things are what we did to get here. They are what we will continue doing once we leave. Amen H. Gashaw ’24 was the president of the Institute of Politics in 2023."

Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. The author of this letter to the editor was granted anonymity because of the risk of employment-related disciplinary action. Aneditorial“24/7 Fondy presents more cons than pros” published Jan. 16 raised valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of Fondren Library operating 24/7. However, this argument barely scratches the surface, overlooking a critical aspect — the well-being of the dedicated staff who operate the library. It is imperative to consider that these individuals are not just employees but people with lives, families and aspirations. To give you a tiny glimpse of what it is like, from working pre-pandemic to now, keeping up with my outside life is challenging. Trying to ensure you can pay your bills and care for your family makes it exhausting to want to make plans. Some days after my shift, I head straight to bed, barely making conversation. While there is a never-ending pile of work to be done, the little things here at Rice make things manageable. Whether it is the peaceful walk to one of the coffeehouses, the occasional bakery good or the small conversations with staff from other departments, those little things make some work days better — but the little things are only temporary and can only do so much. I have learned that even though I have worked in this field for almost a decade and have a bachelor’s degree, the pay will still be low and the raises even lower. The current starting pay for library staff is a mere $15 per hour, a rate that, for some, barely allows them to make ends meet. Many workers possess college degrees and boast years of valuable library experience. This issue is exacerbated by the appalling pay received by our student workers, starting at just $9 per hour. If we genuinely advocate for a 24/7 library, it is only fair and just that we demand better compensation for the staff who make it possible. Adding insult to injury, specific library departments are not recognized as essential workers during disasters, denying them the compensation and recognition accorded to essential workers. Despite these challenges, library staff have demonstrated unwavering commitment, risking their safety to keep the library open during crises. Winter storms, the ongoing pandemic — we workers have gone above and beyond, ensuring accessibility to resources even in the face of adversity. It’s disheartening to witness a focus on initiatives like “Fondy 24/7!” andassociated petitionswithout a parallel emphasis on addressing the plight of the underappreciated library workers. While education is undeniably essential, the constant demands on Fondren Library often result in misplaced blame on the institution itself. The university’s priorities, evident in allocations toward areas like theAcademic Quad redesigninstead of the library, need reevaluation. The call for extended library hours is valid but should not overshadow the pressing need to improve the conditions of the dedicated staff who facilitate this service. If we champion “Fondy 24/7,” we must equally champion fair wages and better working conditions for the individuals who make it possible. This frustration stems from a genuine concern for the well-being of Fondren Library’s invaluable workforce, who deserve recognition, respect and improved compensation for their unwavering dedication. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25.

thetech_mit_2024_31,"Our mostrecent editorialwas written in April 2021. It presented the majority opinion of the Volume 140 Editorial Board regarding COVID-19 vaccination requirements heading into the Fall 2022 semester. In the past three years, much has changed: we installed a new president and watched as our Institute propelled itself into the future through the creation of new academic majors, construction of new facilities, and the inception of countless initiatives. In the past eight months especially, we have witnessed heightened national interest in the Israel-Palestine conflict following the October 7 Hamas-led attacks on the State of Israel and the ensuing events that have come in response to the ongoing carnage and senseless loss of life. In the United States, this furor has been most strongly felt on college campuses. MIT is no exception. What has followed is heightened scrutiny of the way newspapers handle reporting surrounding the impact of the war, dissatisfaction with the decisions made by governmental and administrative forces, and ever-increasing polarization between factions that comprise members of our community that we cherish so dearly. This editorial centers on MIT and seeks to give insight into howThe Techapproaches campus affairs and more importantly, the role of media in mediating discourse during times of conflict. Our campus The end of the Spring semester saw our campus retreat into the summer after one of the most pivotal periods for universities nationwide in decades. Members of our community found themselves planted strongly on one side or the other in a fierce worldwide debate on the fate of the Gaza strip: so strongly that each side censured the other publicly via various forums. Social media sites such as Instagram and X, formerly known as Twitter, have become forums for polarized perspectives on the war; students have verbally attacked and doxxed one another in posts and videos that have shown unique, unfiltered glimpses into the campus community. Media organizations, fromThe Boston GlobetoThe New York Times, have closely communicated with spokespeople from both protest movements and regularly solicit interviews from student representatives. Many of these interviews largely involve charged statements regarding their personal views on the war, calls to action directed towards community members, and criticisms of the opposition. Some have taken their cause to our elected officials: in recent months, delegations of Jewish and Israeli students have met with influential politicians—from House representatives in Washington to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet in Jerusalem—to decry antisemitic rhetoric on campus while pro-Palestinian protestors have stormed administrative spaces and city governmental offices such as the Massachusetts State House or Boston City Hall in protests and marches. Vocal public sentiment has notably led the Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville City Councils to pass ceasefire resolutions. Scores of protestors and counter-protestors—each composed of a mix of students, faculty, alumni, and so-called “outside agitators”—have taken place on the campus nearly every week for the past several months. Ceasefire resolutions made their way into the ballot boxes of theUndergraduate Association(UA and theGraduate Student Union(GSU , where students of both organizations voted in a majority to adopt the resolutions as official platforms. The MIT administration issued interim suspensions to dozens of students in connection to a high-profile protest on May 6. Ultimately,responseswere strong but mixed: many voiced dissatisfaction with this act, but some nonetheless regarded it as necessary. All sides regard each other’s actions unfavorably—the establishment of the Kresge Oval encampment by the campus pro-Palestinian movement, its dismantlement by the administration, the student suspensions, and their eventual uplifting have been met with criticism. Some perceive inaction as a mark of complicity, others perceive it as abetting hateful rhetoric. No one wins amidst division. Firstly, we call upon the MIT community to reflect on this past semester and acknowledge the ever-changing circumstances that have led us to this point. We call upon the community to grasp the nuances and complexities of an issue that has affected many of us so dearly. We call upon the community to truly understand what it means to be a witness to the present times: to indiscriminately reject the humanity of the “other side” is to impede our ability as a community to cultivate a culture of tolerance and understanding. In the spirit of accountability and reflection: from here, we then analyzeThe Tech’s actions throughout this past academic year. Our first steps At the beginning of this conflict,The Techfelt it was best practice to mitigate coverage of the conflict. Not because we lacked interest but because, frankly, we weren’t ready to handle it. Doing so would have been an insurmountable task that our staff couldn t bear in a year of dwindling finances and shrinking personnel. After many, often heated, discussions within the senior leadership ofThe Tech, we observed how reporting was conducted by other student newspapers and the consequences it had at the time on their own. Much of our reporting at the time was based on official statements from senior MIT administrators. Such accounts paint only a vignette, not a comprehensive portrait, of the larger, overarching truth surrounding the events on campus. On-the-ground coverage and true engagement with the various student groups and communities involved was lacking. Ourfirst articleon campus responses following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel was published on November 10, about the high-profile Lobby 7 protest—the article largely centered on a video address and corresponding community email from President Kornbluth. Thesecondandthird articles, published November 30 and December 14, respectively, reported the December 5 hearing held by the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce in which Kornbluth was summoned to testify. These and the articles following, again, stemmed second-hand from official press releases and vetted statements: they lacked student perspectives and direct reporting. In aface-to-face interviewwith President Kornbluth in January, little attention was paid to an evolving campus conflict but to some standard questions about efforts towards campus unity and the Institute’s “vibrant” partnerships in the Middle East. Our foremost priority in the Fall semester was safety: we were not willing to risk the safety of our journalists, most of whom had not in themselves been engaged in the conflict at any scale for many reasons. From the eyes ofThe Tech’s senior leadership, it was unreasonable to compel the student volunteers who made up our reporting staff to interject themselves into a volatile situation coupled with deeply personal hostilities across the MIT community. Too much was uncertain then. We did a disservice to the community when we backed away from this conflict. Simply put, we could have done better. What changed As the Fall semester drew to a close along with our 143rd Volume, we realized that it was our duty to tell the stories that truly matter in the wake of events that could not possibly be characterized as tangential to our existence as members of the Institute. Ourfirst significant piececentered on the student groups engaged in these campus divisions. Although still heavily reliant on official Institute accounts, it reported on the suspension of the Coalition Against Apartheid, published just weeks into the Spring semester. As the conflict continued and events on campus escalated,The Techhad to reevaluate its responsibility in objective, unbiased reporting; it was unsuitable for us to continue standing by. We had to hold ourselves to a higher standard. To dwell in the status quo would be an act of deprivation, an act of depriving the community of a critical resource: information. As universities across the nation became microcosms of a wider national rift, we had to live up to our charge of chronicling the Institute s history. We looked to the past, our own even, during years of anti-war protests spanning the duration of the Vietnam War. We looked to the present: scores of student journalists across the country have put themselves at great risk in taking up their duties. And we thereby looked to our future. We sat down again and reconsidered our plans. We thoroughly reevaluated the policies that led us to this point. More discussions followed regarding staff safety, conflicts of interest, fair and truthful representation of events, and many other concerns pertaining to the work we were to take on. From there, we heightened our coverage with reporting focusing on campus protests and focused our efforts on establishing connections with student groups that represented the diverse, and often conflicting, perspectives on the war. In the following weeks, we took a critical lens to every new campus protest and counterprotest, administrative response, and broader nationwide events. Our reporting on the conflict was deferred to seasoned reporters—the news editors and the executive committee—those who would be best equipped to handle the nuance and perspective required for such pieces. Although this meant that we weren’t able to cover every single event, we felt it managed to prioritize staff safety and perpetuate an ethos of quality over quantity. By the end of the semester,The Techwas able to develop a system for rapidly mobilizing a reporting team, albeit small—on-the-ground reporters, photographers, and desk editors—in response to specific developing situations. For the entirety of May, our entire news staff was on high alert as teams were sent out for reporting at any time of day. From the rapid establishment of the Kresge Oval encampment to its abrupt early-morning dismantlement, during a point of extreme pressure on the community in which hundreds bore witness to protestors physically tearing down barricades amidst retaliatory action by the administration, and as closed-door meetings revealed deep divisions among faculty in the wake of disciplinary action to involved students,The Techdoubled down on efforts to provide critical reporting. The now As summer sets in,The Techis continuing its efforts to maintain the momentum that has carried us through the past months. Although major events are to lessen in magnitude and frequency given a reduced on-campus population, we will continue to follow up with the various communities involved in this conflict and ensure that their perspectives continue to be represented. We will continue to pay attention to any further steps by the administration. And we will continue to serve as a bastion of accountability. While we celebrate our successes and learn from our mistakes, the developments of this year have shown us that there remains work to be done. Better-defined policies and procedures that our staff can be trained on will allow for more consistent and rigorous content output. Another area, as has been for years now, is staffing shortages: limited bodies, time, and resources means that not everything that happens gets written. Sometimes, that manifests as delayed or dropped articles within the content pipeline as we reallocate and reassign hours before publication. And most importantly, building and maintaining bridges with the many members of the MIT community is paramount to our duty as student journalists. The lessons this year have taught us go far beyond what has happened on our campus, and they will inform our approach to journalism for years to come. We don t work within confined bounds; in fact, we are compelled to investigate their sources, understand the facts surrounding them, and see beyond what can be seen. What really happened At this point, we’ve provided a general overview of whatThe Techhas done and where it is headed. Still, we would be remiss in not detailing the specific predicaments we have faced in the past year. Even before our article at the start of the Israel-Hamas war was published,The Techhas been accused of bias. These criticisms have come from all sides of the conflict. Pro-Palestinian voices scrutinized our initial efforts at coverage and found fault with our reporting of administrative action in the past months while pro-Israeli voices criticized our publication of numerous pro-Palestinian opinion pieces. In each new issue filled with diverse perspectives—both from our news desk and the guest opinions that come to us—we have been accused of silencing voices (both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli . Increasing animosity and aversion to our reporting have led to numerous potential interviewees withdrawing from coverage and adversely impacting our reporting work. Such difficulties culminate in content that only exacerbates complaints from such parties. We’ve moved through the semester under some of the most intense scrutiny, both within the walls of our office and out of it, that the organization has seen in years, if not decades. The microscope of perception that has brought college campuses into an relentless and unforgiving light has magnified our voices and our words. The process of telling stories, from our initial reporting to publication, face exceedingly close attention. All this comes amidst a growing nationwide distrust of the media industry bleeding into our relationship with the community. On the ground, our reporters have faced harassment and intimidation by protestors and counter-protestors, administrators, and law enforcement. Our executive committee has been inundated with complaints about our reporting, our staff have been reported to administrators in attempts to stymie our mission, and our newspaper has been vilified as a one-sided machine by both sides. As always, we affirm our commitment to theentireMIT community. Like every other student and professional newspaper in this country,The Techhas become its own player in the campus climate, one that is under fire from all angles. The Techdoes not purport to stand by any frame of reference when engaging with campus tensions. Our staff, a diverse group of students from across the MIT community, holds a wide range of views; consequently, weabsolutely do not, as an organization, endorse a perspective on this war. This We Believe The Techdoes not endorse a perspective on this war, but wedotake a stance on the actions of the Institute’s administration: this administration is silencing those who seek to deliver the truths of the community, namely, the press. The administration has silenced the media: we’ve watched media correspondents’ removal from campus as they peacefully and lawfully carried out their duties. Our on-the-ground news teams have observed first-hand that professional reporters, camera crews, and photojournalists have been escorted away by administrators and officers during times of heightened action. We saw the dismissal of Al Jazeera reporting teams from campus grounds—which led to the May 1 pro-Palestinian protest and the establishment of a temporary second encampment on 84 Mass Ave. Our student reporters, who have just cause to set foot on campus grounds, have similarly been intimidated by several uniformed officers. We have been compelled to exit an area where we have a definitive right to reside. These were targeted efforts; our on-the-ground reporters have been specifically singled out for our reporting work. Our reporters have been photographed (and likely cataloged in some fashion by both uniformed and non-uniformed officers during points of tension on campus; we have been met with hostility by the entities that lead this Institute. When we analyze the significance of photography of students becoming evidence in hearings brought against suspended students, it begs the question of what intentions the administration had in taking ours. These actions constitute one word: repression. Do these actions truly champion the values of this Institute: excellence and curiosity, openness and respect, belonging and community? To you, the reader Above all,The Tech’s actions are centered around a commitment to accountability. When a shared space is taken up by a myriad of overlapping, conflicting voices, all vying for their perspective in a deeply politicized, nuanced, and multidimensional affair, our duty as an organization is to filter through these voices in search of a larger truth. When we can’t determine such an overarching truth, we narrow our efforts to faithfully represent each one within the context of a larger narrative. We want to share everyone’s perspective. That requires engagements between us and the many parts of the MIT community being made in good faith. We ask our community to meet us with a mutual commitment to accountability. We encourage you to communicate your voice authentically with the press. Represent yourself faithfully in interviews and discussions with reporters and seek out active collaboration with the journalists on the ground. Our work is at its best when we have unfettered access to the perspectives of the communities that we hope to portray, and this work is most accurate when a group’s actions match their sentiments. Regularly create official statements and press releases that clearly delineate your position as an organization and allow for perusal by journalists and the wider community. And lastly, have faith in a reporter’s ability to find the facts and portray your perspective appropriately. Trust us to tell your story. We have been through this ourselves: reporting requires taking risks and likewise our parties featured may face potential consequences. Not everyone will be positively impacted by a story, and we acknowledge that. Our work is always in search of the truth, and that truth is not always perfect. We strive to honestly and faithfully represent each perspective. The situation becomes greatly complexified when considering the media industry as a player in the same game as everyone else: we are compelled to conduct our work in the face of very real danger. For journalists on the ground in the US and elsewhere, the word “press” has become a target. Student and professional journalists alike all across the nation have not only been harassed and beaten but jailed and arrested during their reporting. To date, over 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war (some reportslist this as 108, and othersas high as 122. Many more have been injured and arrested. Foreign correspondents who are often in the line of fire, more so than any other representative of the media industry, have been charged with the ultimate burden of communicating scenes of carnage to the rest of the world. To be a journalist in this age is to consign oneself to an industry that is straining under the weight of scrutiny and public distrust. Finally, we call on the various coalitions in our community, representing the dissenting voices of the conflict, to re-engage respectfully with one another and with the press. A newspaper’s marker as “good” or “bad” should not be based on how well their reporting aligns with one’s personal beliefs, nor should it be based on how favorably one’s chosen groups are represented in reporting. Every group must recognize the merit of a critical lens—if anything, equal reporting of both strengths and faults can offer an opportunity to improve and acknowledge to the community one’s past mistakes. Seek out content that may center more around the uncomfortable and analyze it with an open mind. Reflect on how the world around you has been shaped by this ongoing conflict. To our community: trust us. Trust that our efforts lie in a devotion to the public good. Trust the many other parts of the media industry that are working day and night to faithfully represent the countless voices that have risen up in the wake of global upheaval. Our work matters. --- Editorials are the official opinion ofThe Tech.

stanforddaily_2024_29,"As a diverse group of Stanford alumni, many of us have been involved with the Palestine solidarity movement long enough to remember when it was an embattled, minorityposition. We are heartened to see the tradition of resisting injustice at Stanford continue during a time when Israel’s enterprise ofoccupation,ethnic cleansingandapartheidhas never been more brazen. Many of us have continued the advocacy that began on campus when we were students. Whether it was Students Confronting Apartheid in Israel (SCAI , Coalition for Justice in the Middle East (CJME , Stanford University Students for UNICEF (SUSU orStanford Out of Occupied Palestine (SOOP , Stanford is a place where alumni who have become international leaders first developed and solidified their social justice advocacy. Conversations with peers in the classroom, around our dorms and across shared meals transformed us and shaped our ethical frameworks. Our opinions changed, our perspective broadened and our empathy deepened precisely because of the kinds of conversations that are taking place every day at the sit-in. We, the undersigned, are bound together by an understanding that the historic injustices of the 20th and 21st centuries were often dismantled because college students throughout the world chose to stand against them. Werecognizethat the Stanford Sit-In to Stop Genocide strengthens the tide of history, which is turning against Israel’s cruel and inhumane systems of oppression. Past protests of this nature, such as Stanford Out of South Africa (1985 and the Hunger Strike for Low Wage Workers (1994 , have beenpivotalin shaping Stanford into a more just institution, and the present sit-in furthers that legacy. We lend our voices and support to the students in White Plaza who are playing a vital role in refusing to allow the public to look away asgenocidetakes place with the tacit complicity of Stanford’s endowment. Many alumni in this collective, some of whom are parents or siblings of participating students, have visited the sit-in, met with administrators to ensure the protestors’ safety, battled misinformation campaigns targeted toward participating students and insisted on the continued protection of free speech and the right to protest. Like many current Stanford students, we as alumni have been tremendously affected by the genocide in Gaza, as well as theongoingraids,extrajudicial murdersandkidnappingsin the occupied West Bank. Most tragically, Dr. Rajaie Batniji ’03 M.A. ’03, a former class president, has had over 60 members of his family — men, women and children — murdered by the Israeli military in Gaza over the past three months. Dr. Sammy Abusrur’s ’09 first cousin, Anas Abusrour — the director of a youth center in Bethlehem’s Aida refugee camp — was abducted by the Israeli military as he returned home to his newborn child and wife. In early December, he wassentencedto six months of “administrative detention,” an apartheid-style policy that allows the Israeli government tojailPalestinians without due process. Other Stanford alumni have been at the forefront of human rights advocacy for Palestine. Omar Shakir ’07 J.D. ’13 has served as the Israel and Palestine Director for Human Rights Watch for the past seven years, despite beingdeportedby the Israeli government in 2019. Dr. Tanya Haj-Hassan ’06 is a pediatrician member of Doctors Without Borders and has volunteered in both Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Fadi Quran ’10 is the campaigns director for the global campaigning organization Avaaz. He is a Palestinian community organizer and youth leader who has been arrested multiple times for his human rights work. Shakir, Haj-Hassan and Quran have been interviewed by and/or written for numerous media outlets (CNN, ABC, Time Magazine and Al Jazeera over the past few months, advocating for the rights of those affected by this unprecedented, ongoing tragedy. Meanwhile, many other alumni, faculty and staff at Stanford have eschewed the public eye and worked behind the scenes instead. Those who make this decision do so out of fear of negative repercussions to them, their families and their careers, a fear we have seenechoedin the dismissals ofcountlessworkers across allsegmentsofsocietyfor publiclyvoicingtheir support of Palestine. This is why it is so essential we support the students involved in the Sit-in to Stop Genocide. We see our younger selves in these students occupying White Plaza, and we hope that this letter, in situating their efforts within a long legacy of activism, fortifies their spirits. Deep fissures are opening underneath the edifice of theU.S.-backedZionist project that hasdisplacedandoppressedthe Palestinian people for more than 75 years. The weight of the Palestinian people’sdemands— a permanent ceasefire and lifting of the siege on Gaza; the internationallyrecognizedright of return for refugeesethnically cleansedby Israel in 1948, 1967 and thereafter; an end toapartheidagainst Palestinian citizens of Israel and an end to militaryoccupation,annexationand illegal settlementbuilding— becomes heavier and more urgent by the day. It is within this broader historical context that the International Court of Justice recentlyruled— by a 15-to-2 vote — that the Israeli government must “take all measures within its power” to prevent and refrain from acts in violation of the Genocide Convention, and to desist from further killing Palestinian civilians. The stakes for Palestine and the Palestinian people have never been higher. As Stanford alumni, our moral commitments require us to use our position to advocate not just for peace, but for justice. For these reasons and many more, Stanford students are sitting in. With their presence, they remind everyone on campus of the daily atrocities occurring in Gaza. Their movement inspires those of us who have since left campus to remain hopeful for the future. So, we thank the students for their tireless efforts. Furthermore, we extend our gratitude to the University and its administrators, who have chosen to protect the sit-in and safeguard the students’ free-speech rights. We urge them to continue this policy, and we welcome the university’s decision toestablisha task force that will address the anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim hate on campus, which significantly increased after Oct. 7. These students started their sit-in on Oct. 20, 2023, and have continued it throughout the winter break and into the new year, despite harassment, threats and inclement weather. In doing so, they have accomplished something historic: at 104 days and counting, it is thelongestsuch action to date at Stanford. They have compelled the Stanford community to reckon with both our complicity in this genocide and our communal responsibility to act. As their efforts continue and evolve, we as alumni stand beside them and offer our endless solidarity. This opinion was authored by a group of Stanford alumni supporting the sit-in efforts. While the initial draft was developed by a few authors, they circulated it among private networks to gather editorial feedback and support.

thetech_mit_2024_27,"Dear President Kornbluth, We, MIT faculty and staff*, are writing to you to voice our growing concerns about the safety of the MIT community. We have watched with disappointment and unease over the past weeks as the Institute has reacted disproportionately to student activists, as it stifled the voices of our student community members, and as the Coalition Against Apartheid’s guest posts on the MIT Student Life Instagram page led to the page being shut down within hours, all despite Israeli flags lining the windows of the Engineering Building along Massachusetts Avenue for weeks before they were removed. We think back on MIT’s historic responses to student activists engaged in other human rights protests. On MIT’s deployment of the Cambridge Police against students protesting the South African apartheid regime in the 1980s and 1990s. On its deployment of the same police against Vietnam War protestors in the 1960s and 1970s. On its treatment of student activists throughout the Iraq War. And we find the parallels alarming. We remind the MIT administration per the Faculty’s Statement on Freedom of Expression** that the Institute values “civility, mutual respect, and uninhibited, wide-open debate,” and “even robust disagreements shall not be liable to official censure or disciplinary action.” Given the deeply disturbing responses by many universities in the United States and Europe to student groups over the past weeks, including our own, we insist that the Institute administration confirm and support our right, as faculty, students, and staff, to non-violent assembly and to free expression without retribution or threat. It is striking that the administration felt it necessary to send out an emergency alert regarding the anti-war demonstration that crossed the Mass Ave. Bridge yesterday afternoon, warning the MIT community to “please avoid the area.” The use of the emergency alert system for non-emergency situations such as street closures increases the likelihood that members of the MIT community will ignore messages about true emergencies that occur at our institution such as regular chemical spills and other laboratory mishaps. Misusing the emergency alert system to warn the community away from a peaceful protest fosters a culture that fears freedom of speech. As an educational institution at the forefront of global science and technology, MIT holds a unique position. To quote the MIT Faculty newsletter, “with 42% of our faculty, 43% of our graduate students, and 65% of our post-docs hailing from countries other than the U.S., and 151 countries represented on our campus, MIT is truly ‘of the world.’” It is crucial for our institute to honor the diverse experiences of our students, staff, and faculty, and to equip our future leaders with the ability to navigate a global community. Honoring those experiences requires every member of our community to be empowered to speak out on issues of import, without fear of retribution that may endanger not only their academic careers but their visa status. MIT has an opportunity to serve as a leader for other universities globally on how to treat their students with respect and dignity as they exercise their right to free speech. We understand the complexity of the situations you inherited upon assuming your role as president, particularly given the unique tensions of a global institute. We encourage the administration to engage in open communication with the MIT community to find solutions that prioritize the well-being of the students while ensuring that MIT continues to uphold its commitment to free expression and the open exchange of ideas.

state_press_2024_8,"ASU may officially be known on billboards and banners as No. 1 in innovation, but the school has cultivated a different, less coveted national ranking over the decades: a widespread reputation as one of the top party schools in the country. Provocative publications like Playboy lauded ASU in the 2000s and early 2010s for its intense party culture. But back in the 80s, ASU students found their right to drink the partier s beverage of choice — alcohol — was under siege. In 1981, Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt proposed to raise the state s legal drinking age from 19 to 21. This sparked an impassioned student uprising across the state at all three of Arizona s public universities, according to The Arizona Republic. But in the end, the students lost. To ring in New Year s Day 1985, a state law signed the year before took effect, raising Arizona s minimum drinking age to 21. Just a year later, ASU partiers suffered yet another loss: The University, which had previously permitted alcohol on its grounds, became a dry campus, meaning that students of any age would be prohibited from drinking alcohol on its grounds. Fast forward to now, and the policy still stands — ASU has been a dry campus for nearly 40 years. While some view ASU s dry campus policy as an unenforced joke at a university still widelyconsidereda party school, others see it as a necessary safeguard for students well-being. Regardless, the school s dry campus policy doesn’t seem to have prevented alcohol use and abuse on and around campus, so what does it really do for students? Ultimately, it serves as a transparent curtain that s clumsily attempted to conceal the University s decadeslong reputation of revelry. But with liquor stores across the street from dorms, bars just steps from campus andThe Pubin the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU Downtown Phoenix, the dry campus policy only perpetuates a secretive culture around alcohol that threatens students safety and well-being. READ MORE:Satire: Yeah, we re definitely a dry campus ASU s current approach to managing alcohol use on campus is to ban it altogether, a mirror of the school s desert home: dry and barren. ASU strives to create a healthy environment in which the illegal or improper use of alcohol and other drugs and controlled substances does not interfere with learning, performance, employment, residential living, or development, states the University scurrent drug and alcohol policy, implemented on Nov. 1, 1985, as the philosophy behind the dry campus rule. It s essentially impossible for any student who s lived in an ASU dormitory to be unaware that any consumption of alcoholic drinks or ownership of kegs, bongs (beer and otherwise , shot glasses, alcohol funnels and any other type of alcohol or drug paraphernalia is prohibited in residential halls. It s an unbending rule that s plastered on hallway posters inside the dorms and repeated throughout the year by University Housing staff. It s a part of the culture — it s a dry campus. It wasn’t always this way, though. ASU s current alcohol policy is overly restrictive, but it used to be more open. The previous policy allowed students of legal drinking age to make the personal choice of whether they wanted to drink on campus. Under it, ASU was a wet campus, meaning that students of legal drinking age were allowed to consume alcohol on the University s grounds. The university is committed to maintaining an environment conducive to intellectual and personal development of students and to the safety and welfare of all members of the university community, the former policy stated. This includes encouraging responsible drinking habits by those individuals who consume alcoholic beverages and respecting the rights of those individuals who otherwise choose not to use alcohol. Take away the dry versus wet campus element, and the language of the University s previous alcohol policy is extremely similar to the current rule s. Both were born from the philosophy that every student should have the most educational, enjoyable and healthy experience possible on campus. The key difference is that now, even responsible, legal alcohol usage seems to have no place in this environment. Alongside the school s flat-out ban on alcohol, specific restrictions have also been added for different drugs over the years. As state and federal policies, as well as national attitudes, surrounding these substances have changed, ASU s policy feels stale and outdated. It seems the University figured students couldn t possibly pursue a worthwhile education and drink responsibly at the same time. But what if you can? Almost all ASU students know that Halloween is one of the school s premier holidays — students may be cloaked in costumes, but the University’s party school reputation is on full display. So it wasn’t atypical when Tatianna Gladu-Lesniewski, a sophomore studying forensic science, stumbled upon a pair of visibly drunk girls outside her dorm around Halloween 2022. Rather than abandoning them to their own devices, she and her friends checked up on the girls, provided them with water and electrolytes, and offered them rides home. Her experience that night pointed out the glaring need for students to be educated on safety precautions when consuming alcohol and partaking in the party culture that permeates and surrounds campus. Realizing the University had failed to sufficiently fulfill this need, she took this responsibility into her own hands and foundedSun Devil Sips, a club dedicated to creating a community of educated individuals that look out for each other to avoid potentially harmful situations involving alcohol, according to its Sun Devil Sync page. If people want to partake in alcohol and engage in those activities, they will find a way to do it, regardless if ASU is a dry campus or not, Gladu-Lesniewski said. That’s because rules don t create boundaries — people do. They do it for themselves, for one another and for entire universities. For many, college is an experimental version of adulthood. It s a time when many students awkwardly attempt to familiarize themselves with maturity for the first time, taking it on and off at will like a costume. A large aspect of that maturity is drawing hard lines for yourself regarding substance use. It s letting go of people who invade your comfort zone when it comes to substance use. It s saying no to Friday night party plans because you need time alone. It s knowing when to look at the substance use habits of yourself and the people around you, and when to decide something has to change. These are completely personal decisions. No policy or guideline will stand in the way of someone who wants to use a substance, so it’s not safe to act like it does. All it does is push those who want to use substances to do so in secret. Alcohol may be the name of the dry campus game, but it isn t students only substance of choice. As with alcohol, an all-out ban is also ASU s approach to the use of many drugs, even for some federally legal substances, like tobacco. In 2013, ASU became a tobacco-free campus after banning the use of the substance on all school grounds to promote health and wellness in the ASU community, according toASU News. Just six years later, in 2019, the University also prohibited vaping on campus for the sake of students health and safety, but some in the ASU community criticized the ban for demoniz(ing the habit, which is a popular alternative for those trying to quit smoking cigarettes, according toThe State Press. Vaping proliferates among college students — out of all adults, those aged 18–24 were most likely to use e-cigarettes, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in 2021. Just take a look at the rows of neon-colored, candy-sweet e-cigarettes that stock the shelves of convenience stores around campus, and it’s not hard to see evidence that supports the statistic in real life. Like any drug, nicotine alters users brain chemistry, compelling them to chase the same dopamine rush with every hit or drag. The more nicotine a person intakes, the more dopamine receptors the brain creates to handle the sheer amount of the chemical, a process known as upregulation. The brain is used to that nicotine being there to stimulate all those added receptors to increase the dopamine levels, said Scott Leischow, a research professor in the College of Health Solutions who studies nicotine addiction and the process of quitting smoking. So if you take away the nicotine, then the dopamine levels that a person is used to drop a lot. The absence of the added dopamine is why withdrawal symptoms occur. Along with the pain of withdrawal symptoms, Leischow said quitting the drug could only become more difficult if the user were in an environment where nicotine use is common, as the case may be for ASU students looking to kick the habit. In a 2019 survey byASU Wellness, over 1 in 8 students reported that they had vaped in the past 30 days, and over 1 in 20 reported smoking cigarettes within the same timeframe. On a campus where substance use is so common, Lesichow recommended that students trying to quit a substance place distance between themselves and the people around them who practice the habit they’re trying to break. If a person is dependent on a product and they want to discontinue it, there’s value in trying to stay away from the product and the use of those products, and that may mean staying away from the people that use them for some period of time, he said. Whether it be drinking, smoking or vaping, the bottom line is this: People create these boundaries only if they want to. No policies or bans can make the decision for them, so why keep pretending that these rules will? The dry campus way may be the only way at ASU, but not all universities take the same approach. In fact, travel a little over 100 miles south of ASU, and you ll find that the language of the University of Arizona scurrent alcohol policyis very similar to ASU s more permissive former policy. The University of Arizona recognizes that the use of alcoholic beverages by those of legal age is a matter of personal choice, UA’s rule states. The University requires that those who choose to drink on University property abide by state law and University regulations, and expects that such individuals will conduct themselves responsibly, mindful of the rights of others. Unlike ASU, UA is a wet campus, so students of legal drinking age can consume alcohol on campus — within reason. But UA s decision to allow of-age students to drink on campus has come with some repercussions, according to Trinity Gary, a senior at UA studying ecology and evolutionary biology, along with communication. Even though UA s wet campus rule allows students to drink on campus, the privilege applies to students of legal drinking age only. But enforcement of the school s ban on providing alcohol to minors and alcohol consumption by underage students is fairly relaxed, which can lead to unsafe situations, according to Gary. I have friends on the EMS teams here, and they ll get calls every weekend about someone on campus, some freshman in a dorm needing to go to the hospital because they’re so blackout drunk, she said. All drugs have been so normalized here. Wet campus or dry campus, ASU and UA are plagued by some of the same problems involving substance use and alcohol consumption. So is there really one correct policy? As of right now, there isn t. Instead, conversations about substance use need to go beyond policy — they need to be about people, about what best benefits the student body. I don t have all the answers or a steadfast solution. But I know through my personal experiences as a student that the dry campus policy has failed to keep every student safe, happy and healthy, which should be some of the school s top priorities. ASU s dry campus policy feels like a finger-wag while UA s seems to be no more than a shrug. Neither is what students deserve. Edited by Camila Pedrosa, Savannah Dagupion and Madeline Nguyen.

crimson_2024_9,"Despitewriting twoopen lettersand ablog postcriticizing our University leadership’s response to the events of Oct. 7, I take no joy in now-formerPresident Claudine Gay’s resignation. Only three months into her tenure, President Gay was thrust into an incredibly challenging situation — and while she has made several missteps, she did many things right. Her Oct. 27speech at Harvard Hillelwas powerful and moving. Many of us resonated with her definition of antisemitism as a “lie that has taken many forms, from Holocaust denial to the blood libel … to the denial of the Jewish people’s historical ties to the land of Israel.” I was also pleased to meet Gay at the Dec. 8interfaith vigil, organized by the Harvard Chaplains, that included speeches by both Hillel Rabbi Getzel Davis and Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid, among others. It was an essential step toward the healing that our campus sorely needs. In her letter, Gay announced that she resigned so that Harvard could “focus on the institution rather than any individual.” Indeed, our challenges are institutional rather than personal. Members of Congress and the general public were rightly angered when three university presidents, Gay included, gave legalistic and convoluted answers to the question of whether calls for the genocide of Jews violate university policy during a Dec. 5, hearing in the House of Representatives. The public’s response may have been very different if Harvard had a reputation for ironclad protection of freedom of speech. But this is not the world we live in. In 2017, Harvardrescinded the admissionof at least ten students for posting offensive memes in a private group chat. In 2018, a Harvard employee wasput on leavea week after a video was posted on social media of her asking her neighbor if she lived in affordable housing. In 2019, Harvarddeclined to renewthe appointment of Winthrop Faculty Deans Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson after Sullivan chose to take on Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of multiple rapes (and subsequently convicted on a number of charges , as a legal client. And in 2023, Harvardscored last out of 248 schoolsin the yearly free speech ranking put out by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan watchdog advocating for free speech at American educational institutions and broader society. Against this backdrop, Harvard’s actions in regard to campus speech following Oct. 7, were more than a little incongruous. On that day, Hamas terrorists slaughtered families, raped women, and kidnapped many civilians, ranging from a 9-month-old baby to an 85-year-old great-grandmother. The infamousstudent group statement released the same day,which called Israel “entirely responsible” for the attacks, was discussed ad nauseam, but Harvard students’ social media posts were much worse. Students celebrated the “decolonization struggle” and a student posted anonymously that the “US just cant support Palestine bc we got too many damn jews in state supporting our economy.” In apro-Palestinian protestjust a week after the attack (and before Israel’s ground offensive , a student speaker announced his “full support of the Palestine resistance” and said that “marginalized people … are always demanded to justify their means of liberation … they’re not terrorists.” Since then,protests have regularly included slogansthat many — myself included — interpret as calls for violence and ethnic cleansing, such as “globalize the intifada” and “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” (sometimes with its more explicit version in Arabic, which ends with “Palestine will be Arab” . Yet, Harvard has never shut down any of these protests. Somehow, when Jews were involved, Harvard rediscovered its commitment to protecting speech even when it is offensive. Can we find a way to move forward from this, and balance freedom of speech with safety and inclusion? I believe that the answer is yes. Ina recent op-edpublished in the Washington Post, Danielle Allen suggested that we can. For starters, Harvard administration should focus on the form of speech or protest rather than the content. A disruption to a class or invited talk is unacceptable, no matter how worthy the cause. On the other hand, we should learn to accept and be okay with the fact that there will be opinions expressed on this campus that we find offensive or even abhorrent. I strongly disagree with almost all ofKenneth Roth’s comments on Israel, but his experience and perspective make his presence valuable to our campus. Like Allen, Psychology professorSteven A. Pinkercalled on Harvard to protect freedom of speech and follow institutional neutrality without tolerating violence or disruptions. This does not mean giving up on inclusion. As Allen explains, “DEI bureaucracies have been responsible for numerous assaults on common sense, but the values of lowercase-i inclusion and lowercase-d diversity remain foundational to healthy democracy.” With the focus on rancor and missteps, we can sometimes forget what makes Harvard a special place. Every day, I am grateful for the privilege of spending time with our immensely talented students, who come from many different backgrounds and often teach me as much as I do them. I am thankful for my past and present colleagues who made discoveries that reshaped our understanding of the world and improved countless lives. For over three centuries, Harvard has been a powerful force for scientific and intellectual advancement in this nation and the world. To continue this mission, we must regain the trust of both our own community and broader society. I sharePresident Gay’s hopethat we can “recommit ourselves to the excellence, the openness, and the independence that are crucial to what our university stands for — and to our capacity to serve the world.” Updated: January 4, 2024, at 11:52 p.m. Boaz Barak is a Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science."
crimson_2024_20,"I believe that a university has two great obligations to society: To foster the discovery and dissemination of knowledge and understanding, and to prepare students for lives of meaning, purpose, and service. To fulfill these social obligations, a university must enjoy the right kind of independence from society. Take Harvard’s research mission first. “To advance new ideas and promote enduring knowledge” — whether in physics, history, philosophy, or any other field — requires a remorseless vetting process. As a professor and scholar, when I claim to have produced a novel contribution, the very first reaction I expect from my colleagues is skepticism. ‘What’s the basis for your claim? Have you considered an appropriately broad range of alternative answers to your question? What are the strongest objections to your view, and how do you rebut them?’ In short: ‘How would you know if you were wrong?’ A deep concern for truth motivates these questions, along with the awareness that some of the greatest obstacles to getting at the truth lie right in our own heads, in the form of biases that incline us to believe things even in the face of good reasons not to. Perhaps we are biased because our beliefs make us feel good, or because we take pride in being the ones who thought them up, or because they’re what our ‘tribe’ expects us to believe, or because there is money, power, or glory at stake in getting others to believe them too. If you want a reminder of how potent and dangerous these biases can be, just reflect for a moment on the polarized state of current public political discourse. The natural human condition is for these biases to flourish. The university, by contrast, should exist precisely to be an unnatural place, a place where these biases wither thanks to an entrenched scholarly habit of ruthless critique, founded on our collective knowledge of our own fallibility and our collective desire to overcome it. It is in this sense that Harvard must be independent from society at large. This is not the independence of ignorance, which understands us as entitled to pay no attention to what people outside our walls are saying or doing. Quite the contrary: People outside our walls constantly make discoveries or raise possibilities worth serious scholarly consideration, and it is often by attending to the broader conditions of society that we discover questions urgently needing addressing. But how we settle those questions is different. For this purpose, the demands of truth-seeking mean that it just cannot matter which answer is most preferred by politicians, or monied interests, or the ‘woke mob’, or (for that matter the ‘anti-woke mob.’ The same goes for Harvard’s educational mission. We do not teach primarily to produce the next generation of scholarly researchers: Most of our students go on to find other ways to contribute to society at large. We do (I hope aim to instill in our students certain scholarly habits of mind, especially the habits of mind that lead us to embrace serious, good-faith, curiosity-driven engagement with those who disagree with us. That means getting our students to wrestle with and understand, at a deep level, viewpoints they do not like or may even find abhorrent. It means ensuring that the student body itself features a broad range of viewpoints and life experiences so that students’ social interactions with one another provide a second, equally rich occasion for learning. Yes, we teach lots of plain old content. But, crucially, we must also focus on expanding our students’ horizons, getting them to the point where they can think — both individually and together — in a way that emphasizes learning from those who see things differently. And just as it would be a disaster to let outside influences affect how we answer our research questions, so too it would be a disaster to decide what or how to teach based on the whims or preferences of politicians, monied interests, or a ‘wokeness’-obsessed mob. We also need independence in our governance. That independence is now under threat, as demonstrated by former University PresidentClaudine Gay’s resignationand the events that produced it. Here is a version of events that could have happened but didn’t. A properly convened University committee, comprising Harvard faculty with expertise in Gay’s field, begins work examining the allegations of plagiarism leveled against President Gay. The committee does its work patiently, thoroughly, carefully — the way scholars are supposed to proceed. (Indeed, this is how accusations against students proceed: dispassionately, without politics, without bias. After a few weeks, the committee issues a thoughtful report, with recommendations. Maybe, in light of them, President Gay resigns. Maybe she doesn’t. We won’t ever know, because this wasn’t allowed to happen. That it didn’t — and that Harvard faces similar political pressures on its research and teaching — puts us at a moment of peril, possibly approaching that faced by universities during the era of McCarthyism. It would not surprise me in the least if politicians like Rep. Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y. — people who care not one whit about preserving colleges and universities as sites for the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, but who definitely smell blood in the water — press for yet more influence on institutions like Harvard. I’m prepared for the next headline announcing congressional ‘investigations’ into ‘woke curricula on college campuses.’ When these actors do turn up the pressure, the proper response won’t be to ignore them; even weasels arguing in bad faith can say things worth considering. But it will be to resist the temptation to respond with anything but a clear-eyed evaluation of the facts. Not because we owe nothing to the world outside our walls, but because we owe so much.

crimson_2024_98,"Class of 2024, as we gather today to celebrate our graduation, look around. When you see the empty seats near you, remember the members of our class not graduating with us. Namely, remember those who will not do so because they were punished this week — in flagrant disregard ofdecades of University precedent— for peacefully and civilly exercising their right to free speech. This follows nearly an entire school year of doxxing and harassment aimed at harming and intimidating pro-Palestine students. As my peers faced the most intense outrage the digital age has to offer, many felt shock. I felt déjà vu. In April 2022, while I served as president of The Crimson, the Editorial Board endorsed the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement, which calls for institutions to cut ties with Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. The editorial met withbacklashmore swift and intense than I could possibly have imagined. In the days and weeks that followed, we were lambasted by some of Harvard’s most prominent faculty members. Many of them, including a former University president, sought to strong-arm the newspaper out of its editorial autonomy, calling (ironically for a boycott of the newspaper. Senators, the Anti-Defamation League, and a host of social media pundits excoriated the editorial. But that’s just what was public. Behind the scenes, as the organization’s president, I received some of the most vile messages you could imagine. One message hoped that my children would one day suffer; that my parents would succumb to Alzheimer’s and forget my name; that I would die a slow and painful death. Another called me an antisemite and compared me to Hitler, promising to “make justice” should its sender be near me. I received hundreds of these messages over a period of weeks. At first, harassed online and facing sharp criticism from some of Harvard’s most powerful people — many, my role models — I felt panic. It was like drinking from a firehose. Before long, to endure, I became numb. I don’t know which was worse. Others faced similar treatment. Members of the Editorial Board were harassed on social media, their personal information posted on the doxxing site Canary Mission. I was told the threats and harassment became so intense that the University — unprompted — felt it necessary to increase University police presence near The Crimson’s building. Many of the people denouncing the editorial felt that it was antisemitic. As a Jew whose family has been chased out of its home country for centuries, I understand. Three days ago, I attended the graduation ceremony for Jewish students. For my first two years at Harvard, I was at Hillel almost every week — to study, socialize, eat Shabbat dinner, and attend events. My penultimate piece as a reporter for The Crimson investigated the University’sfailure to provide hot lunchto Kosher students. I understand the discomfort that many Jewish people feel when they think of BDS. As Crimson president two years ago, I did not personally agree with the Editorial Board’s choice to unequivocally endorse it. It is because of my family and my cultural tradition that I can empathize with the outrage that caused many at The Crimson to be doxxed and harassed, that brought me death threats and the worst months of my life. But it is also because of my family — journalists driven out of Colombia for holding power to account, the people that have inspired me to become a journalist — that I feel compelled to defend the student press and denounce their attackers, even when I disagree. Both a free press and freedom of speech are integral to a healthy university: Freedom of speech because it can push inquiry forward; freedom of the press because it can hold the structures of power at the university to account. It seems nearly everyone at Harvard, regardless of their social and political views, claims to agree. But in the months after the BDS editorial, I watched many of the prominent Harvard affiliates who most vocally advocate for free expression fan the flames of a firestorm against The Crimson and myself. A year and a half later, I watched in horror as many of the same people prosecuted an even more vicious campaign of harassment against my peers. Each day, it felt like I was reliving a small piece of those weeks of hell — every story about harassment, doxxing, or death threats made my heart beat faster. I felt echoes of panic I hadn’t felt in two years. Theoretically, sharp criticism of students’ speech is essential for healthy campus discourse. Much as it’s caused me pain, I believe it’s permissible for campus public figures to dedicate their substantial resources to denouncing, blacklisting, or calling for the boycott of the student press. Punching down is free speech too. But these figures should know what they do. They should know that their actions and the outside pressure they attract make this campus hostile to both freedom of the press and freedom of speech — values they often claim to champion. In part because of their action, it is increasingly the case that students — journalists and not — cannot engage with one another, with their professors, or with the relevant issues on their campus without fear of public shaming or professional retaliation. Influential campus figures who should be seeking to create a healthy, safe campus environment have instead created one that can frankly be called McCarthyist. As I watch dozens of my peers face harsh sanctions for peaceful protest that has historically faced almost none, it is apparent to me that the pressure created by influential figures — insiders and outsiders alike — significantly impacts how the school treats its students. Witnessing the College’serroneous suspensionof a Crimson reporter for proximity to the encampment, I struggle to believe the University has not folded to pressure to impose discipline this draconian, unfair, and overinclusive. Harvard boasts of a long, proud history of its graduates pushing forward the freedoms of this nation, including freedoms essential to the project of higher education. Now, outside actors pose an existential threat to the meaningful enjoyment of those freedoms. It falls to the University and its community to resist them. With this past week’s suspensions, it has failed. At Commencement today, we will listen to a speech from Maria Ressa, a pioneering journalist who won the Nobel Peace Prize for shedding light on the injustices perpetrated by undemocratic regimes. It will be a celebration of the essential importance of democratic freedoms — of speech, of the academy, of the press. It is a sad irony that the Class of 2024 will not hear it together because, when push came to shove, Harvard failed to protect those very rights.

rice_thresher_2024_9,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/5/24 10:09pm When the former Student Association president introduced a new constitution in April 2023, the Senate was ready. The document passed the deliberative body with just one no vote, then received 55% approval in a 48-hour special election with barely 10% turnout. SA leaders declared victory, but a particularly attentive student caught a glaring discrepancy. The constitution at the time required two-thirds of students to approve amendments with at least 20% of the undergraduate body voting, neither of which the hasty special election met. The student filed a complaint, and the University Court unanimously agreed. Thenew constitution was overturned. In November 2023, the Senate again passed a series of strikingly similar amendments. SA leadership decided to wait until the regular election to seek student body approval. This time, 36% of undergraduates voted on the amendments, 83% of them in favor. With those boxes now checked, SA leaders declared victory. But there was another problem. The ballot contained a bulleted list of “major changes” to the constitution, none of which included the most notable — and the most dangerous: Future constitutional amendments can pass with a simple majority without any minimum threshold on voter participation. Quick, low turnout special elections for power-grabbing referendums could become the norm. The ballot twisted distressing changes into something palatable, correctly trusting that students would not take the time to read the convoluted documents. The day after voting opened, a particularly thoughtful student filed a complaint with the University Court. “This is now the second time the student association senate has tried to subvert the will of the people they claim to represent,” the unnamed complainant wrote. “Last year they ignored the results of a properly run election and passed a similar amendment that did not get enough votes. When that failed they misrepresented the content of the amendment in order to pass an amendment that consolidated power in the hands of fewer people.” This student is completely correct. Last spring, the SA tried to push a new constitution through a quiet special election. This time, they passed it right under our noses. The ballot should have directly stated the dangerous changes the SA proposed. Instead, it advocated for it. SA leaders should have fought voter apathy and informed students about the proposals. Instead, the unnamed student alleged that they took advantage. We hope the University Court once again overturns this series of amendments. But regardless of the outcome, incoming SA leaders must learn from this complaint. To be clear, these last two referendums have been plainly undemocratic. The SA sought to increase its own power. The first time, they tried a quick, low-key election that obviously broke their own rules. The second time, they allegedly sought to misrepresent the changes on the supposedly neutral ballot. The new executive board members all said they would focus on connecting with the student body. This includes transparency, and it includes honesty. As we noted before the election,we do need a new constitution, and some of these amendments are strong. We urge the new executive board to develop a proper governing document with robust student input and a clear, fair ballot. When it comes to the constitution — the foundation of student governance at Rice — we can accept nothing less.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_77,"Just because you can say it doesn’t mean you should. Whether our campus relationships are healthy depends on choices we make about how we advocate our views. Last week, Iexplained the crucial distinctionbetween academic freedom and free speech. Academic freedom is specifically tailored to the context of higher education and safeguards the intellectual independence of faculty and students. Free speech is a broader right protected by the First Amendment that applies within the public sphere. Neither is an unlimited right to say whatever you please. Academic freedom and freedom of speech both make much speech permissible; they do not, however, make all speech permissible. Legal limitations restrict both categories of speech, prohibiting incitement, intimidation, harassment, extortion, libel, defamation, and dangerously misleading acts like falsely shouting fire in a crowded theater. Academic freedom faces additional constraints from professional protocols and institutional rules, including prohibitions on plagiarism, evidence fabrication, and research that fails to meet ethical standards. Free speech on campus is further limited by organizational protocols — the time, manner, and place requirements for demonstrations. We are watching these evolve in real time. Academic freedom and free speech both draw lines between impermissible and permissible speech. They do not, however, help us distinguish between good permissible speech and bad permissible speech. That distinction must come from standards of scholarship and the art of rhetoric. Importantly, permissible speech is not coextensive with good speech. More generally, many bad actions are legally permissible: smoking, gambling excessively, gluttony, being rude or insulting people, breaking informal promises, lying (legally permissible in at least some contexts , and peeing in the swimming pool. These actions, though legally permissible, are typically also cases of poor judgment or morally unacceptable or unethical behavior. Similarly, the fact that a speech act is permissible — under either academic freedom or free speech principles — and that someone therefore has a “right” to its utterance does not make it a good contribution or exempt a speaker from judgment or moral evaluation. Speech acts can be factually or morally erroneous, offensive, ad hominem, and otherwise fallacious or poorly argued — all scholarly failures. Or they might not only suffer from fallacious arguments but also display failures of judgment, emotional calibration, or expression, all types of rhetorical failure. Harvard’s values statement contains two guidelines that help distinguish between good and bad speech. Our behavior on campus should embody “respect for the rights, differences, and dignity of others” as well as “honesty and integrity in all dealings.” Scholarly standards and longstanding norms from the art of rhetoric make concrete how to live by these values. One logical cut distinguishes between the impermissible and permissible. Then a second, within the category of the permissible, distinguishes the good and the bad. Once we understand this, it becomes easier to figure out how to respond to problematic speech acts. Are they actually impermissible? Or are they permissible but bad? For now, I’ll focus on the impermissible category. I’ll discuss permissible but bad speech acts in my next column. Expressive acts alleged to be impermissible require adjudication and, if found to violate certain rules, require sanction. Our system of sanctions helps realize the expectation in the University values statement that we take accountability for our actions and our conduct within the community. To determine whether a speech act is impermissible, we ask a series of questions. Has the accused party violated the law, including workplace laws that prohibit the creation of a hostile environment? Have they violated campus policies, such as non-discrimination, anti-bullying, and time, manner, and place requirements for demonstrations? Our processes for adjudicating these questions are not yet stable. The same was true of early campus efforts to implement Title IX policies in response to sexual harassment allegations. It has taken years, and many proceedings before Harvard administrative boards, to refine adjudication procedures and establish usable precedents — regarding evidence procurement and due process, for example — to meet appropriate standards. Yet, answers to questions about how to adjudicate whether speech acts are impermissible are urgently needed. In 1990, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences established a committee of three highly-distinguished faculty members — Joseph S. Nye Jr., Henry Ehrenreich, and Michael J. Sandel — to develop the FAS policy on speech. That policy stands to this day and is the basis for the time, manner, and place norms we use now, as well as for key elements of the sanctioning structure for code of conduct violations. At the end of their report, they recommended a permanent student-faculty advisory committee on free speech, involving both graduate and undergraduate students. The committee could continually discuss ambiguities in the guidelines and occasionally meet with the administration and others to discuss how to strike appropriate balances of rights in hard cases. Unfortunately, this standing committee was never established. As a result, we currently face significant challenges. We lack a clear mechanism for clarifying the line between creating a hostile environment and exercising free speech. No existing governance body can help the University’s administrative boards develop a robust, precedent-based understanding of speech-related issues. Though the ad boards will eventually gain this insight over time, a standing committee could expedite and enhance our campus’s learning process. Such a committee, ideally integrated into a University-wide faculty Senate, could methodically work through cases to delineate clear principles about what constitutes impermissible speech, thereby guiding the whole campus with a consistent set of standards. Far better to learn and teach proactively than to rely on sanctions to do our intellectual work.

crimson_2024_61,"In late Sept., I joined philosopher Edward J. Hall fora discussion about free speech on campus, under the auspices of the Council for Academic Freedom at Harvard. I was not at the time a member of the Council but joined later in the fall (so scintillating was Ned’s conversation! . Little did we know, as we chatted genially in Boylston Hall that autumn afternoon, that these very questions would soon convulse Harvard’s campus. At the time of our panel, I was concerned that our thinking about academic freedom and free speech had become quite muddled. Now as we approach the end of the academic year, I worry that, for all the ferment, our thinking hasn’t made much progress. So many terms are floating around: “academic freedom,” “free speech,” “civil discourse,” “open inquiry.” I keep hearing from students that they are confused. In a series of five pieces for The Crimson, I will do my best to name and clarify some of the key concepts needed for the pursuit of high caliber academic and intellectual work at Harvard and on any campus dedicated to open inquiry. I believe these distinctions are necessary to address our challenges more effectively, and have important policy implications. Further, appropriate distinctions can help us make sense of — and crystallize our understanding of — the University’s values statement. Wait, what? A University values statement? You may be wondering if I’m referencing the University’s Statement on Rights and Responsibilities or the College’s mission articulation. But in reality, Harvard has a little-known enumeration of its University-wide values. Few people know this. In 2016, when the 55 of us — students, staff, and faculty — who served on the Inclusion and Belonging Task Force began our work, we were surprised to learn that a values statement was drafted and passed during the administration of former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers in 2002. As I remember it, we learned that there was one copy of the statement displayed on a poster in the basement of Massachusetts Hall. As best as we could tell, that was the only place where the statement then existed. Undaunted, we nonetheless proceeded to embrace the idea that a values statement could help a university orient its sense of purpose and strengthen its work. We lightly revised the Summers era statement, received approval for the updated version from then-President Drew Gilpin Faust, and recommended that it be broadly disseminated in our task force’s 2018 report. But, as with the 2002 declaration, this statement has languished in a few remote corners of campus websites, essentially unknown and unfindable. So let me introduce you to the Harvard University Statement of Values, the stepchild of our campus policies. It begins: “Harvard University aspires to provide education and scholarship of the highest quality — to advance the frontiers of knowledge; to equip students, staff, and faculty and academic personnel for fulfilling experiences of life, work, and inclusive leadership in a complex world; and to provide all members of our diverse community with opportunities for growth.” The Statement continues to argue that achieving these goals requires affirming five values on campus: “respect for the rights, differences, and dignity of others”; “honesty and integrity in all dealings”; “conscientious pursuit of excellence in our work”; “accountability for actions and conduct in the community”; and “responsibility for the bonds and bridges that enable all to grow with and learn from one another.” The events of this year have put pressure on these values and have also shown us ways in which they are perhaps not strong enough. In addition to respect, people need safety from attacks — both internal and external. Further, despite the statement’s preamble, it doesn’t name what should be our primary, guiding value: commitment to academic and intellectual inquiry, guided by the highest standards of truth-seeking. In the pieces that follow, I will describe the principles needed to support this open inquiry. I’ll discuss several key distinctions: distinctions between academic freedom and free speech, between the permissible and the impermissible, between the good and the bad, between the role of the enforcer and of the pastoral teacher, and among our professional, personal, and civic roles. The University’s value statement can help guide our commitment to fostering open inquiry by bearing these distinctions in mind. Perhaps it’s time to update our University’s values statement once more. Perhaps this time the first value should be a steadfast commitment to academic inquiry; the rest of the tenets appropriately support this overarching purpose. And perhaps this time, we could make sure the statement is at last broadly shared. Why not? Third time’s the charm.

ubyssey_2024_9,"April 4, 2024 Written byTova Gaster Tova Gaster is a fourth-year history and environmental geography student and the science editor forThe Ubyssey. In March 2022, UBC and mining company Teck Resources Ltd. announced aresearch partnershipto install copper coatings on high-touch surfaces in applied science buildings. The project’s stated purpose is to reduce the spread of germs using copper’s antibacterial properties. While antibacterial copper hasuseful applicationsin high-health risk areas like hospitals, the project also gives Teck an opportunity to distract from recent headlines and clean up its public image, which has been tarnished by several high-profile human rights and environmental violations. After years of pollution from Teck coal mines, the trout population in BC’sElk Valley watershed— which is deeply important to the Ktunaxa First Nation — is nearing total collapse. An investigation by The Narwhal also revealed that Teck and the B.C. governmentlobbiedthe federal government against investigating Teck’s water pollution, which impacts watersafetyand public health on both sides of the Canada/United States border. In 2024, Tecksoldmost of the stake in the mines to another transnational mining company, leaving itunclearwho will clean up the mess. Teck also invests heavily inresearch,educationanddevelopmentat UBC. While the Copper and Health project is relatively innocuous on its own, it’s part of a disturbing trend: fossil fuel corporations like Teck donatehundreds of thousands of dollarsto UBC research and operations each year. UBC declared aclimate emergencyin 2020 but has so far failed to decisively interrogate its own relationships with the companies that drive it. To address the climate crisis, we musttransitionaway from fossil fuels and towardsequitableanddemocraticrenewable energy systems. To do so requires eroding the social and economic power of the fossil fuel industry, which by nature will continue business as usual to maximize profit margins even as ecosystems collapse around us. When companies like Teck donate to institutions like UBC, they get a boost to their public images — and Teck has been upfront that the UBC Copper and Health project is a PR move. Its website states the project goals include “highlighting Teck’s involvement in creating safer public spaces.” According toresearchers, the Copper and Health project aims to decrease bacterial transmission in high-risk areas such as hospitals, where sterility can be the difference between life and death. This is an important mission. The fact that Teck is leveraging its connections to UBC to explicitly brand itself as a public health hero should raise questions, especially when companies like Teck consistently act as thebiggest obstacles to climate action. Teck profits from mining fossil fuels and metals, including coal and bitumen. Its sectorpollutes waterways, destroys ecosystems andraises global temperaturesto increase the frequency and costs of devastating disasters each year. According to a2022 Health Canada report, the climate crisis represents a direct threat to health and wellness — risks which hurt BIPOC, disabled people and other marginalized communities more than others. While Teck is increasingly transitioning its dirty coal portfolio into copper mining— a key component of batteries for renewable energy storage — that transitionremains slow. In recent years, Teck has begun to invest heavily in metals mining. It owns four major copper mines — a demonstrable incentive to position Teck Copper as a symbol for health and cleanliness, a more marketable narrative than its ongoing history of pollution and human rights violations. Teck’s copper mines have also been plagued by ecological and human rights issues. The Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project in Northern Chile was fined $1.2 million in 2019 for environmental violations, and in 2021 regulators served the company with eight differentenvironment-related legal charges. This followed years of condemnation for poor labour practices andlegal oppositionto the mine expansion from the Indigenous Ollagüe people, who assert they were not consulted in its approval process. This is the same copper which coats UBC door handles in the name of public health. The Copper and Health project is only the latest development in a long partnership between Teck and UBC. Beyond funding research, Teck was one of the major corporate donors to UBC’s 2008-2015 “Start an Evolution” fundraising campaign. It also funds scholarships, including the recently-announced $2M Don Lindsay Teck Award in Mining Engineering, designed to attract engineering students to the company. Former Teck executives are also employed in high-level positions at UBC. They include a formerTeck vice presidentwho left the company to found theCanadian International Resources and Development Instituteat UBC, which provides research, training and ‘public administration reform’ to world governments on mining governance issues. Mining research and policy impacts labour rights, Indigenous sovereignty and global environmental health. Research and policymaking around mining should not be left to those who stand directly to profit from it. This is an opinion article.

stanforddaily_2024_13,"Last evening, I had the honor and the pleasure to host a debate between seven candidates in a crowded field for the Associated Students of Stanford University Undergraduate Senate, with Mark Allen Cu and Dilan Gohill. The debate was an incredibly strong showing from all of the candidates, who demonstrated both passion and deep consideration on how to approach issues on campus. If you have the time and want to learn more about the candidates before you vote, I strongly encourage you to watch the recording, which is available onYouTube. That said, I understand two hours of debate is a lot to get through in the middle of midterm season, and some candidates undeniably had a stronger showing than others. On that basis, I’ve decided to make three endorsements for the Undergraduate Senate election. Before I get into names, I’d like to briefly explain my thought process, so that you can consider whether it aligns with your values as a voter. First, I am only endorsing candidates that showed up to the debate. Partially this is because engaging in a debate demonstrates the kind of dedication to the role and willingness to engage with disagreement I expect from my representatives. Notably, both Arvind Asokan and Noah Maltzman let me know that they could not make it to the debate due to personal circumstances or conflicts. Maltzman further impressed me by sending in written answers to debate questions in lieu of his presence: Among those answers, his proposal for grant application deadlines to be spread out throughout the year to spread out the workload of the appropriations committee stuck out to me as a pragmatic and well-articulated potential reform. Maltzman, I should note, writes for The Daily, though he is not involved in the Opinions section and primarily contributes to Sports. Ultimately, though, the only candidates I feel qualified to recommend are the candidates I questioned live. Second, because many of the candidates expressed similar views on policy issues, my endorsements are based largely on who I think will be the most effective and dedicated senators. I made that assessment, which is inherently uncertain and subjective, based largely on the clarity of a candidate’s vision for why they were running and how they would get their policy goals accomplished once elected. All that said, my endorsements are as follows. In the spirit of preferential voting, I’ve ranked them in order. #1 — Mandla Msipa Msipa was sharp and articulate throughout the debate. Not only did he regularly make the other candidates and myself laugh, Msipa quickly brought the issues back down to earth, making it abundantly clear that he understands the issues he aims to solve. On top of that, his platform is detailed and thoughtful, rich with targeted interventions to improve the student experience. My only criticism is that Msipa said his top issue was housing. While I find this an admirable goal, Msipa did not convince me that this was an area where the ASSU, faced with a lack of authority over how RD&E operates and RD&E’s general lack of receptivity to student feedback, could realistically make a large impact. #2 — Ivy Chen I’m a huge fan of incumbents who can demonstrate that their experience will help them get the job done. Chen did so in spades. She highlighted exactly how she plans to get things done as a senator, combining collaboration with faculty and administrators with dogged persistence and a firm commitment to upholding the interests of students every step of the way. #3 — David Sengthay Sengthay said it best themself — “I do everything from the bottom of my heart.” Not only were they articulate and informed, Sengthay’s passion and dedication came through in their debate performance, which foregrounded their ideals and commitment to community every step of the way. In fact, Sengthay was the only candidate from the first round of debate to stay and support his fellow candidates throughout the entirety of the second half. I’m not entirely convinced that their goal to eliminate all course fees is something the ASSU can accomplish, or that recording all lectures would, in the big picture, be a good idea, but I am convinced that, as a senator, Sengthay would know both when to compromise and when to never, ever back down.

ubyssey_2024_20,"Feb. 28, 2024 Written byEsmé Decker Editor s Note: After this article was first published, AMS Councildecided during its February 28 meetingto remove the referendum discussed here for failure to comply with the AMS Bylaws. Esmé Decker (any/all is a Japanese-Irish fourth-year student in Honours English Literature and Language, with a minor in Environment & Society. Esmé ran as Remy the Rat for AMS President in 2022 (second place and 2023 (first place , a joke candidate to promote informed democracy and social justice on campus, and served as AMS President from May to November 2023. The night that I found out about this year’s referendums, I had a trauma response. I was at my part-time job, which I kept working all along, on top of my 60 hours/week at the AMS when I was president, in order to still have at least one community I could trust. As I processed what the passing of the “greater representation” bylaws referendumwould mean, I washed dishes while my body shook and I held back tears. This referendum is putting up a front of bringing BIPOC representation to AMS Council. “But the majority of Council members have already been BIPOC for several years,” you might point out. “But why these specific BIPOC and minority representing clubs,” you might ask. I am a Queer, racialized, neurodivergent person who believes in Palestinian human rights, and these groups that claim to represent students like me do not represent me. If you read the fine print, this referendum proposes to bring 99 new unelected seats to Council, effectively letting the members in these seats take control of any AMS Council vote. There are currently 32 voting members of Council: the five executives who are voted on by all AMS members and the faculty representatives who are democratically elected to represent fellow students in their faculties. Each faculty gets one member, with additional members based on constituency population starting at two total representatives for over 4,000 students (for example, there are three faculty of arts councillors to represent over 14,000 students . In contrast, this referendum would grant four AMS Council seats to the Black Void UBC Instagram account, a group unaffiliated with the AMS. The remaining 94 unelected representatives are from the Black Student Union (20 , Social Justice Centre (15 , UBC Trans Coalition (15 , Women’s Centre (15 , UBC Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (10 , and “Indigenous Students” (20 . If you noticed that the “Indigenous Student” seats have no organization attached to them, this was not a mistake. The Indigenous Constituency was never consulted as to whether or not they wanted to be on the referendum and were never given the opportunity to vote on or discuss the details of the proposal before it was released in the referendum. The organizers of this referendum claim they are fighting for BIPOC power and decolonization, while at the same time explicitly ignoring Indigenous voices. It is no coincidence that this number of added representatives would comprise 76 per cent of AMS Council, the exact number needed to reach the 3/4 vote threshold to remove any AMS executive from office. These changes also allow the newly added councillors to remove members of the AMS include the ability of these added seats to remove the membership of any member of the AMS - this would mean the removal of access to the AMS Health & Dental Plan, the AMS Food Bank, all club, constituency and resource group activities and all other AMS benefits and services currently available to all students. This referendum is undemocratic and a thinly veiled power grab from a minority of students who are plaguing the campus community with petty politics under the guise of social justice. The organizers are anonymous, which is why I cannot be clearer about who is behind these actions, and I find it highly problematic that such a substantial change is being proposed by faceless individuals who therefore cannot take responsibility for the effects and repercussions of it. Power-playing behaviour like this is what made me leave my role as president. It is behaviour like this that had me crying in front of other AMS staff in the office every day from early August to the day I left in mid-November (and I do mean every day, because completing all the responsibilities in executive roles often means working seven days a week . Behaviour like this is what had representatives in Council meetings having panic attacks, including myself. It has led to undeserved character assassinations, rampant cyberbullying and students feeling unsafe on campus. I don’t want any students to have to feel unsafe on campus anymore. Some might compare this referendum to the miscellaneous bylaw changes included under the referendum from the 2023 AMS Election, which created the Indigenous Constituency and shrunk the size of Council. While I do not agree with this style of referendum because it does not allow students to decide on separate issues separately — an issue clearly coming up in the Food Bank, Palestine, and RBC Divestment referendum as well — the shrinking of Council was intended to make faculty representation more proportional, allow for better Council attendance and increase Council efficiency and effectiveness. Professionally, smaller boards of directors enable societies like the AMS to hold more productive meetings and discussions. We see this at theUniversity of Toronto Student Union(UTSU , where they also chose to reduce their Council seats, after years of less-than-ideal attendance and participation. Each member is now somebody more likely to be motivated to be informed and take responsibility since they must work together in a smaller group to fight for students. However, we can already look to student societies like the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS to see the disastrous results of unsustainable Council-packing and power-grabbing. This board structure at the SFSS hasled to constant in-fighting,unproductive meetings, and a waste of student fees and resources, which SFSS Councilmeeting minutesandrecordings reflect. At the SFSS, Council absences are at an all-time high and engagement is at an all-time low. Of the73 seats on SFSS Council, 27 are vacant. This is over a third of all seats. Well-meaning students who are not part of these SFSS in-groups end up having no training, and despite their best efforts to work hard and get the job done, they end up leaving the roles because of the toxicity of the environment that is driven by polarization on complex social issues. I am a victim of the AMS and I was also the head of it. I couldn’t save myself from the culture surrounding the AMS other than by escaping it. It was not the people within the AMS staff and councillors broadly who caused me to leave. It was the dehumanization and bullying I felt from other groups and that I didn’t want to lose big parts of myself that made me vulnerable: my empathy and my longing to trust people. I am so grateful for the support I received in my election campaigns. But once I was in the role and couldn’t do everything for everyone in the exact way they wanted me to do things, many people turned their backs on me and found new, more sinister ways to try to use me as a political tool for power. But only responding to the demands of special interest groups would have been a mistake. Every day that I was president, it was my responsibility to think about what was best for the 60,000 students I was representing: the students depending on the health and dental plan to not go bankrupt, relying on funds for clubs and constituencies to do community building on campus and counting on the AMS to prioritize the issues they care about without them having to worry. I am slowly learning how to trust again and not constantly be in fight-or-flight mode on campus. I have gone to therapy and bawled my eyes out to a poor young therapist who could not begin to understand what this microcosm of the world’s polarization is like. But it doesn’t need to be so divided on campus. I never wanted to be president of anything. I just responded to a student call for somebody who believed in the things I believe in to run for president. All I want to be is an English teacher who helps students build critical thinking and communication skills, because that is what the world so desperately needs more of. I ran to bring up voter turnout and get students to be more informed about their democratic opportunities on campus. I truly commend the students at UBC who have built up the experience as student leaders to be able to thrive in these roles that they put so much love into. I’m tired of the fear-mongering, the power-grabbing, and the petty politics. Don’t let this referendum take away your democracy on campus. Please, when voting opens on March 1, vote for the candidates who have the experience needed to truly work for you, and vote NO to this referendum. This is an opinion article.

crimson_2024_36,"Much to the surprise of my friends off campus and on, I decided to spend Thanksgiving week alone in Harvard Yard this past November. In my dorm room, I watched the final season of The Crown without headphones, and laughed without having to worry about disturbing my roommates. On Thanksgiving Day, I walked from Harvard Square to Boston’s Chinatown and back without company. While some might call these moments lonely, I felt fulfilled. When I arrived at Harvard, I felt eager but also pressured to put myself out there at all times. Though I have always considered myself an introvert, I was sucked into the culture of constant social presentation alongside my new classmates. At Harvard and beyond, we are expected to be on at all times. Whether that be in the halls of our dorms, walking through Harvard Yard, or studying in Widener Library, we are constantly surrounded by other people. When we step back to take some time alone, we’re often met with concern: “Where have you been?”; “Are you okay?”; “Let me know if you need to talk.” While these gestures are well-meaning, they reinforce the notion that we only want to be alone if there is something wrong — that there’s something a little bit pathological about introversion. That’s not right. We should all be taking time to ourselves, and not just when we’re at a breaking point. That quiet Thanksgiving break — the first proper alone time I’d had since college began — reminded me why I need solitude: It helps me feel grounded. Mining gold ore on Minecraft with Britney Spears blasting, I remembered life before college — before I entered the always-moving, hyper-social Harvard bubble. Break ended, but this change in my mentality didn’t. As my first semester progressed, I found myself more prepared to reject invitations to study with friends in Lamont Library or attend weekend gatherings when I really just wanted to spend time alone. Despite the peace I felt while alone and the reassuring knowledge that more opportunities to socialize would inevitably come, I still struggled to shake the guilt I felt each time I rejected a social interaction. That many people feel this way is a serious problem, not least because a growing body of evidence demonstrates the importance of alone time. Time spent away from social settings (within reason has the ability to reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. It can also help us to develop a stronger sense of self, separate of how others picture us or desire us to be. Additionally, researchers have documented that alone time can foster creativity. It is unlikely a coincidence that many great artists and academics have credited alone time as a source of solace and inspiration. Of course, feeling lonely isn’t a good thing. But alone time doesn’t entail problems with feeling alone. In fact,a 2020 reportby Harvard’s Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health found that Harvard students’ isolation and loneliness result in part from pressures to work harder and do more — an issue that normalizing unproductive time to oneself could help solve. As with all things, alone time is best in moderation. I am calling not for forgoing crucial time spent with friends but rather for reframing our attitude toward solitude. Unstructured alone time is just as valid a form of self-care as socializing. To find true balance, most of us need both. At an institution where students face unique pressures to make themselves and their successes known, it’s essential to protect and advocate for your alone time. Whether you prefer a daily walk, solo trips into Boston on the T, or laying on your dorm floor while you listen to a favorite album, consider the possibility that moments spent alone can — without guilt or shame — be your moments of greatest joy. Go, take a moment to yourself. You deserve it. Jasmine N. Wynn ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Thayer Hall."
crimson_2024_107,"As the cliché has it, Commencement is both an ending and a beginning. That is always true for the graduates as they go forth. In a sense that is not usual, I hope that this year, Commencement can mark both an ending and a beginning for Harvard. The last academic year has been the most trying time for the University in the last half century. We have seen evident antisemitism, leadership turmoil, extensive government investigation of the University, demands on Harvard from political leaders, and deep divisions over protests and the right responses to them. Regardless of our stance on any particular issue, we are all ready for this year to end. Former University President Derek C. Bok used to joke that the three best parts of academic life were June, July and August. We all need the respite. But before these summer months begin, I want to reflect on a new beginning for Harvard. It has been nearly 50 years since I first arrived as a graduate student and more than 40 since I first joined the Economics department. It was my immense privilege to serve as Harvard’s president for five years from 2001 to 2006. Since then, I have had the best job at Harvard: I am a University professor with the opportunity to teach students and interact with faculty across the campus. In all my time at Harvard and in government, I have asked myself, my students, and my colleagues several crucial questions. What are we doing that future historians will notice? How will they judge what we have done? And how can we do more that will matter? At Harvard, traditions, like commencement ceremonies, are deeply encrusted in our culture. Yet what is ultimately the true significance of Harvard, or any other great university, is its capacity to shape the future and alter the path of history. We teach, train, and shape students who make their dents in the universe. Many of those graduating from Harvard this year will become future scientific innovators, heads of state, transformers of culture, enterprising business leaders, and fighters for justice and freedom. I hope we have prepared them well. “Philosophical concepts nurtured in the stillness of a professor’s study could destroy a civilization,” Isaiah Berlin famously wrote. “But if professors can truly wield this fatal power, may it not be that only other professors, or, at least, other thinkers (and not governments or Congressional committees , can alone disarm them?” It is ideas that shape history. Scientific ideas underpin technology and its application in everything from curing disease to growing food, enabling cities, and reducing the need for humans to do tedious physically punishing work. Philosophical and humanistic ideas shape the organization of society, the moral codes that govern our interaction, and the ways we appreciate and create beauty. Universities are society’s institutions with the nearly unique charge to develop new ideas for the sake of knowledge itself. As we consider the future of the University after a very difficult year, it is essential to consider how we can best leverage our resources. With our vast financial assets, unmatched ability to assemble intellectual talent, and enormous reputation, we are uniquely positioned to make incredibly impactful contributions. I am reminded (perhaps unsurprisingly, given my field of study of an economic concept, originating from David Ricardo, that seems particularly relevant here — the idea of comparative advantage. This idea says that in a world characterized by specialized roles, each entity — individuals, institutions, and countries — should focus on activities where they have the most unique strength. We should do what will not be done if we do not do it. Take climate change as an example. Many institutions are able to generate public alarm, urge legislation, or subject heavy emitters to economic pressures. But only universities can train cutting edge atmospheric scientists, develop techniques for making policy judgements with long-term uncertain consequences, examine the history of international collaborations to find the most promising paths to global cooperation, and broadly produce intellectual seed corn. Similarly, in discussions about Middle East policy, there is no shortage of opinion writers, think tanks, and former officials offering their perspectives. However, only in universities can philosophers ponder the morality of responding to terrorists who use human shields in their defense. Where else can students strive to attain an even-handed understanding of the historical factors that have brought the Palestinians to their current situations? I could proliferate examples. But the point should be clear. Institutions contribute most when they do things others cannot. For Harvard and other great universities, this means staying away from day-to-day distractions or from political advocacy — those in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences only harm our University when theyundermine our disciplinary processesfor the sake of a political cause. Instead, we must focus on that which is enabled by remarkable intellects: the magic of interaction between teacher and student and the independence of the ivory tower. Some may argue that I am constraining the role of the university. They would suggest that even if teaching and idea generation are its primary functions, the university can still be a force for social justice advocacy that holds societies to account. I find this a dangerous view. For one, academic freedom rests on a delicate compact between those in power and those in the university. The government should not seek to shape what universities teach and study, and universities should not seek to pressure government policy or political choices. If we insist on doing the latter, we will inevitably lose the high ground in resisting the former. Furthermore, the credibility of Harvard’s scholarship and teaching is paramount. I am reminded each year that if I accept money from a private interest and advocate on their behalf without disclosing the potential conflict, I may undermine the credibility of others holding the title of Harvard professor. In the same way, if the University takes positions on controversial issues, it undermines the credibility of related research and teaching. Engaging in polemic debates undermines the credibility of our scholarship. I belabor these points because they are highly relevant to the division and strain of the last year. Disagreements did not stem from how best the University could teach students or advance knowledge. Nor were they provoked by questions of methodology in inquiry, the interpretation of research results, or advocacy of new theory. Instead, they were over issues largely separate from the main missions of the University — the main objects of controversy were issues like time, place, and manner restrictions on advocacy. These disputes, however resolved, have little to do with the most important work of the University and are unlikely to impact the history of our time when it is written years from now. What follows from all this? This is not the place for a detailed policy agenda, but I will offer three observations. First, as the late great Henry Rosovsky once pointed out, students are here for a few years, faculty for a generation or two, but Harvard is forever. Our fiduciaries, the members of the Harvard Corporation, are responsible for ensuring that the University remains focused on what is most ultimately important. Especially at a time when the University is being led on an interim basis, it is essential that the Corporation articulate the values they prioritize. As it sets policy, chooses leaders, and declares values, it is the Corporation’s responsibility to focus on Harvard’s core missions of teaching and research. If these are done extraordinarily well, all else will work out. If not, little else will matter. Second, maintaining focus is very challenging because it is human nature for faculty and students to leverage Harvard’s prestige for their own interests. Just as our ultimate fiduciary — the Corporation — sets rules limiting the use of academic affiliations for financial gain, it must also clarify that the University will not intervene in the political issues of the day, nor allow faculty or students to speak for it on political matters, just as it would not allow them to sell Harvard-branded merchandise. Third, akin to the tension between the Civil Rights Act’s protection against discrimination and the First Amendment’s free speech rights, there exists a similar tension between academic freedom and upholding community values. Academic freedom gives individuals broad rights to speak and write as they see fit without fear of reprisal or retribution. But academic freedom does not include freedom from criticism. While it is the responsibility of academic leaders to stand up for academic freedom, it is also their moral obligation to support those being subject to hate speech. Based on the number of calls I have received from Jewish students and their parents anxious about coming to Harvard, it seems that Harvard has fallen short on this dimension. Harvard as a university, like the United States as a country, possesses remarkable resilience. We benefit from the power of self-denying prophecy, where jeremiads of decline or failure actually spur efforts of renewal. Ultimately, everything all works out, thanks to a very strong foundation. I have been critical of Harvard over the last year. My intensity has come not primarily from disagreement over specific issues or even a concern over endangered students. Instead it comes from a belief that our ability to create and transmit knowledge is profoundly important but threatened when political activists are able to set our agenda. As commencement marks the end of this difficult academic year, I hope it will mark the beginning of a time when Harvard moves past the urgent to the historically important. Lawrence H. Summers is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and served as the 27th president of Harvard University."
crimson_2024_41,"Afterruling last summerthat Harvard’s use of racial preferences was unlawful, the U.S. Supreme Court upended a college admissions regime that had been in place for nearly half a century. Despite uncertainty about how admissions officers have adapted to this landmark decision, the process has remained opaque. Last year,Harvard revealed informationabout the racial and socioeconomic characteristics of the student body in late March, but this year it plans todelay disclosureof the racial data until the summer. These data will provide important clues as to what traits Harvard’s admissions officers have been prioritizing among applicants. As an expert witness in the litigation against Harvard, I worked with Duke University economist Peter Arcidiacono to examine ways Harvard could maintain high levels of racial diversity without using racial preferences. We demonstrated thatif Harvard eliminated its unfair admissions preferences for wealthy students and gave a meaningful boost to highly qualified students from disadvantaged and working-class families and communities, it could reduce its economic stratification and maintain high levels of racial diversity and superb academic standards. Under the prior, and now illegal, system of racial preferences, Harvard created a class that was racially diverse, but economically segregated. A majority of students admitted to Harvard in recent years have been non-white — a welcome development — but at the same time, the student body continued to have nearly15 times as manyrich students as low-income students. While the Supreme Court ruling proscribed Harvard’s use of racial preferences, the University has been under no legal obligation to adopt alternative paths to diversity. As the data trickle out over the coming weeks and months, I will be looking to see which of three major patterns emerges. The worst-case scenario: Harvard’s underrepresented minority numbers plummet and socioeconomic diversity remains abysmal. Harvard’sexpert witness saidthat if the College were to stop using race — and adopted no alternative steps to boost diversity — its share of admitted Black students would fall from 14 percent to six percent. By continuing to provide preferences for the rich and failing to provide additional consideration for less-advantaged applicants, the University will have forsaken its longstanding rhetoric that diversity is the “hallmark” of a Harvard education. Another seemingly better, but still not optimal, scenario: Harvard could report that its racial diversity numbers remained high, but its economic segregation persisted. This would align with trends from previous years, suggesting that Harvard continued to do what it has been doing for decades: employing large racial preferences and preferences for the wealthy. In response to this accusation, Harvard might claim that it complied with the Supreme Court’s ruling by considering student discussions of race in their personal essays, which the Court permits. But as I have previously explained in theJournal of College and University Law, both the majority and the dissent in the Harvard case made clear that the personal essay “loophole” is exceedingly limited. To comply with the law, Harvard has to apply the qualities it identifies as valuable in a consistent fashion across racial groups. Suppose Harvard said that the reason it had admitted Black and Hispanic students in large numbers was that their essays demonstrated they had overcome the adversity of racial discrimination, demonstrating values the university sought like perseverance and resilience — wholly legitimate criteria. Harvard would also have to provide similar extra consideration to students of all races who showed resilience by overcoming other types of adversity, like economic disadvantage. If Harvard remains racially diverse, but shows no noticeable rise in economic diversity, it would suggest an inconsistent application of the boost for students who had overcome obstacles. In other words, a covert racial preference. If it looks like Harvard is cheating by using the personal essay in a way not legal under the Court’s ruling, it could land back in litigation. The legal proceedings could end up having a chilling effect on other universities who wish to employ a legitimate use of the personal essay, thereby setting back diversity efforts for universities across the country. There is a third, best case scenario: Harvard’s new data would show that it maintained racial diversity and boosted socioeconomic diversity. This result would suggest that the admissions office employed authentic race-neutral strategies of providing a preference to economically disadvantaged students of all races and to students from economically under-resourced high schools — an approach that the Supreme Court recentlysignaled it supports. In subsequent op-eds for The Crimson, I will comment on the racial and economic diversity statistics Harvard reveals, and on possible changes it might consider in the future. For now, one can hope that Harvard has finally committed itself to opening up the University, at long last, to promising young students from all walks of life. Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85 is the director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute. He was an expert witness for Students for Fair Admissions in its lawsuit opposing Harvard’s use of race in admissions. This piece is the first installment in a series that will provide analysis and commentary on the culmination of Harvard College’s first admissions cycle following the United States Supreme Court’s curtailment of race-conscious admissions."
crimson_2024_16,"United we stand. Divided we fall. To former University President Claudine Gay: On the rainy autumn morning of September 29, 2023, I watched as your soulful stride and proud aura graced the steps of the platform before Memorial Church. The damp stairs could not impede the history about to be made. In the following days, my grandparents, aunts, and uncles all called me, asking if I had gotten a photo with you yet. “Not yet,” I replied, “but there’s plenty of time.” As a woman of renowned talent and academic achievement born into the loving embrace of two Haitian immigrants, the measure of your success will always exceed the limitations others would place on you. Dedicated to excellence, you have proved your capability well beyond what others could’ve expected — well beyond what is expected of a woman and well beyond what is imagined for a Black woman. From the moment your clipped coils took the crown of higher education, your character, your ability to lead, and your integrity have been called into question. But even now, even after the announcement of your resignation, any photo of yours used in the press depicts an elegant smile with your head held high. Thank you for this. Dearest dreamer, the photos tell me, worry not about the troubles you face. Although others might obstruct your climb — dream, dream despite. Even in this moment of struggle, President Claudine Gay, you serve as a beacon of hope to Black women across the world. As I watched you walk across the stage and accept the keys to Harvard, I couldn’t help but live through your success. To taste the unadulterated happiness as I felt our ancestors cheer you on. To know that my time at an institution built without reverence for people who looked like us would be placed in hands that looked like mine. You are my grandparents’ wildest dreams, and I remember with anguish the day I saw you in person and was too shy to ask for a photo. Your success marks a once-unachievable dream now brought within grasp. Your smile made my own high-flying dreams feel accessible and beat back the self-doubt of the racism I experienced as a child and the racism I experience now. To the dreamer, Claudine Gay, you have done what others will never do. You will forever be the first Black president of Harvard University. You claimed the highest honor in higher education and did it with effortless grace. I hope that in your resignation, you still feel the warmth of the Black community’s reach, at Harvard and beyond — a blanket against the cold world you and your family have faced in recent weeks. To make it abundantly clear, your tenure at Harvard and its impacts have not gone unnoticed. I hope your faith in your ability to be a pillar of hope for women who look like us remains unwavering. In your inauguration speech, you beckoned us in the audience to ask “Why not?” when we consider the University’s future. In light of these events, the question for Black women like myself becomes: “How could I not?” How could I not defy the racist remarks I receive? How could I not fight for the vision I see for myself? How could I not stand for what I know to be true and just? President Gay, you may see yourself as just the president of Harvard University, but for me, you were physical proof of the possibility of my grandest dreams. And so, to the dreamer, President of Harvard University, Dr. Claudine Gay, born to Claudette and Sony Gay Sr., I thank you for what you’ve done. Thank you for what you’ve meant to Black women everywhere. And in humble recognition of your persistence and resilience, I will continue your legacy as a Black woman. I am a Black woman dedicated to achieving her dreams. I am a dreamer too. Kelisha M. Williams ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Psychology concentrator in Kirkland House."
stanforddaily_2024_33,"The Stanford Daily thanks President Saller and Provost Martinez for reinstating our reporter, Dilan Gohill ’27, and for revoking his suspension. In light of the University’s decision, we now ask the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office to decline pursuing criminal charges against Dilan, which would be plainly unfounded. To be clear, Dilan appeared at the June 5 demonstration solely as a reporter covering the demonstration. Bearing and presenting valid press identification at all times, Dilan did not participate in or plan the demonstration. He had no prior knowledge of any plans to enter Building 10, entered only to report the news, and was unable to leave once barricaded inside by the demonstrators who entered it first. That another student formerly affiliated with The Daily participated in the June 6 demonstration had no bearing on The Daily’s and Dilan’s role covering it. Our reporters received a tip about the demonstration from an organizer, not this other student who participated in the demonstration without The Daily’s knowledge or permission. The Daily immediately demoted that student, who later resigned after a conversation with editorial leadership. The Daily takes no position on her standing with the University, or in any penal action brought against her. Independent student journalism benefits the entire Stanford community, and The Daily takes seriously its role upholding the highest professional and ethical standards.

state_press_2024_4,"A place on campus designated to help have these resources that cater to the specific needs of queer students would be beneficial. For more than a decade, LGBTQ+ student organizations at ASU that make up Rainbow Coalition, including TransFam and GRADient, have been advocating for a dedicated physical space on campus where LGBTQ+ students can find community in a safe environment. But despite their ongoing efforts, the University administration has not fulfilled this request. In a November meeting with the State Press, ASU President Michael Crow expressed no desire to create this space, stating that the University is trying to focus on what people need to be successful and, right now, we don t think that needs separate space. We want every person in every building to be treated the same, and if you start building buildings for this group or that group, all of a sudden you re now saying, well, that s who can go into that building, Crow said, stressing ASU’s policy to beopen to the public.We don t want spaces where you can t come in here. Despite Crow s reluctance to create a designated safe space, students like Anthony Scarmack, a sophomore studying journalism and vice president of ASU Confetti, express frustration at the University s inattentiveness to the voices of its queer students. I m just kind of confused and almost feel disrespected, Scarmack said. Your students are talking to you. Your students want something, and you re not listening to them. It feels like a slap in the face. You’re supposed to be a student-oriented campus. READ MORE:Rainbow Coalition s decade-long journey to build a space for LGBTQ+ students Recent incidents, including an altercation between aqueer instructor and members of Turning Point USAlast October and the hosting oftwo controversial Conservative figureson campus, spurred another movement by these organizations to establish this space — with or without the support of the University. There s been a culture developing that students have warned about for months, if not years, Ruby Maderafont, former facilitator of advocacy for ASU sRainbow Coalition, said. The first thing that comes to mind is the event that the now-defunct T.W. Lewis Center put on, which further emboldened people to undermine the fears of LGBTQ students on campus. The concept of safe spaces is nothing new; the term originated in the feminist and gay liberation movements of the mid-1960s. Queer bars provided individuals with a place where they could go out safely and be surrounded by others facing similar discrimination in a political environment still plagued by anti-sodomy laws. These places were few and far-between, but they were essential for people to temporarily ignore outside social and political oppression. With only 63% of Arizonans saying that homosexuality should be accepted according to a study done by thePew Research Center, that refuge is still very much needed. Though the political environment has changed substantially since the 60s with queerness becoming more socially accepted and the legalization of gay marriage in 2015, the need for a safe community has not faded. (The misunderstanding comes from this belief that the entire University is supposed to be a safe space. But you re talking about a historically marginalized group in a space where they are still the minority, Maderafont said. Yes, progress has been made over the course of many decades, but there are still challenges to existing as a queer person on campus. Not every space is accepting, whether it s overt or not. Nowadays, the term safe space is often surrounded by discussions about free speech on college campuses. The University of Chicago s 2016 message to incoming freshmen left no room for ambiguity in their stance, explicitly stating that safe spaces and trigger warnings would not be a part of their student s college experience. Our commitment to academic freedom means that we do not support so-called ‘trigger warnings,’ we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual ‘safe spaces’ where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own, the letter read. While the University of Chicago s statement may seem like a commitment to free speech and academic freedom, it greatly neglects that intellectual growth flourishes most in an environment where students feel safe and secure enough to have an open dialogue. Much of the argument against safe spaces surrounding free speech stems from concerns about potentially isolating students from differing perspectives. But the point of establishing these spaces isn’t, and has never been, to shield students from uncomfortable ideas unlike their own; it s about fostering a basic sense of inclusion and respect that allows all students to thrive. Given the political polarization of queer identities, LGBTQ+ students are in a very vulnerable spot, Maderafont said. A place on campus designated to help have these resources that cater to the specific needs of queer students would be beneficial. It would definitely speak to a wider need for acceptance and inclusion within the broader campus community at large. Contrary to the criticisms often aimed at space spaces, they don’t serve as a manifestation of oversensitivity but rather an acknowledgment that, for marginalized groups, physical and psychological safety is very much intertwined. Nearly one-third (32.6% of LGBTQ+ students experienced bullying, harassment, or assault at college, compared to 18.9% of non-LGBTQ students, according to areportdone by the Williams Institute at UCLA. As a result, LGBTQ+ individuals are more than twice as likely as heterosexual individuals to experience a mental health disorder and 2.5 times as likely to experience depression, substance misuse and anxiety, according to theAmerican Psychiatric Association. ASU establishing a safe space for its queer students wouldn t mark the first Arizona university to do so. Even ASU s biggest athletic rival, UA, established itsLGBTQ+ Resource Centerin 2007 with a mission to build, sustain, and strengthen a safe, inclusive, and open environment” for its LGBTQ+ students and faculty. The real problem doesn’t lie within the existence of a physical safe space — the real problem is a lack of empathy and understanding and not listening to the vulnerable individuals in your community when they tell you that there is something you could be doing to make them feel safer in pursuing their academic career. It is vital for ASU to provide a space for its LGBTQ+ students where they can focus on their academic journeys while safely being themselves. Safe spaces are not a concession, they are not a threat to free speech, they are not a community asking to be distanced from views that differ from their own; they are a demand for acknowledgment, respect, and equal footing. In creating these spaces and listening to their students, ASU has the opportunity to stand for progress and showcase its commitment to fostering an environment where everyone has the chance to thrive.

thetech_mit_2024_2,"Publisher’s note:this article was originally published in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning student magazine “Silt” (Vol. 1 and in the pro-Palestinian student magazine “Written Revolution” (Vol. 3 . “Draw the flags of your heritage.” That was the question for my first assignment in eighth grade U.S. History. I was startled, to say the least. I knew that in 1911, my great-grandparents escaped to the U.S. from antisemitic pogroms in Ukraine. But my assignment was in 2011. The Maidan Revolution and Ukraine’s reevaluation of its identity were still three years away, and in the view of global society, I was not considered a Ukrainian– just a Jew. In this world, a flag is your culture. Even though I had no family between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, I drew the Israeli flag, as that was the only flag that depicted the Star of David. My community (and much of the rest of the world told me that Israel was my homeland. The same community upheld Zionism, the belief that the Jewish right to self-determination depends on the existence of a nation-state with an exclusively Jewish identity, as the answer to our safety and survival as a people. Years later, I learned of the Nakba, the violent colonial settlement and occupation, expulsion, and exclusion of the indigenous Palestinian population on which Zionism rests. After rejecting Zionism, I began a deep search. What else could be the pillar of Jewish identity? How can we exercise self-determination as a people without a nation-state? Anti-Zionism alone could not solve these matters. Basing a group identity on fighting ethnonationalism is reactive and negative. I wanted something constructive that looked toward a future to be created instead of a present to bemoan. To quote the late Anarchist activist Aaron Bushnell (May his memory be a blessing : “What I m trying to say is, it s so important to imagine a better world. Let your thoughts run wild with idealistic dreams of what the world should look like”1 . Soon, I found Diasporism. Diasporism is rooted in the Jewish Labor Bund, an early 20th-century Eastern European Jewish political organization that fought for the rights of Jews and all oppressed peoples. In the Bund’s view, culture was what bound Jews together, not a place or nation-state. Resultantly, the Bund was opposed to the creation of a separate state for Jews (or any ethnicity , seeing Zionism as a form of escapism from combatting the antisemitism and oppression that existed in the Russian empire. The Bund’s mission was to make the world in which Jews lived safer, which could only be accomplished through collective organizing with non-Jewish society. For me, Diasporism means taking the Bund’s revolutionary spirit and imagining what a liberatory future would look like for Jews (and everyone . Diasporism allows us to affirm our Jewish identity as a positive, progressive force that can be the foundation for radical social action. Diasporism challenges the notion that any group should rely on a hegemonic nation-state to provide self-determination and survival. Who needs strictly defined borders and a homogeneous population when communities can create self-governance locally and develop mutually beneficial relationships with their diverse neighbors? Diasporism can serve as a springboard for a larger diasporic Jewish cultural revival. The vast number of expulsions, genocides, persecutions, and assimilations forced on Diasporic Jewish communities over the 20th century by hierarchical powers has led to a vast loss of our traditions. By reviving our many Jewish ethnic cultures, we can reconnect with and rebuild our identities, contributing to our autonomy and resistance. To this end, I’ve been learning how to play Klezmer music on the clarinet (a very useful skill for entertaining folks at Shabbat dinners , reading Ashkenazi history, and working on rebuilding Ukraine since the genocidal, unjust Russian full-scale invasion. Today, many indigenous people are fighting for cultural autonomy and non-hierarchical ways of sharing the Earth as a form of resistance. Jewish traditions, like the Bund, have sought to nourish and preserve our people, pushing against the Western European idea that rights should be based on ownership of land. Now, we have an opportunity to learn from our own history and pursue collective liberation in solidarity with the indigenous peoples continually fighting for cultural autonomy and non-hierarchical ways of sharing the Earth. To me, Diasporism is defined by the following principles: Doikayt(Yiddish for “hereness” - The home of the Jewish people is wherever they live, instead of a far-off land. Autonomism– Jews should be able to curate cultural, religious, social, political, and economic autonomy wherever they live. Collective Liberation– Recognition that the fight against antisemitism and all other hierarchical structures are intertwined and that true liberation for all will only come when Jews and non-Jews work together to dismantle systems of oppression. Anti-Authoritarianism– Opposition to hierarchical power structures in society, organizations, and human relations. Anti-authoritarian thinking embraces respectful and egalitarian human social relations. The story of the Jewish Diaspora is almost as old as the Jewish people itself. From the Babylonian Exile to Medieval Spain to the Pale of Settlement, Jews have had to live scattered amongst many nations. We’ve learned how to keep our traditions alive while contributing to the well-being of both Jewish and non-Jewish society and without being a dominant power. Even our traditional religion is built with Diaspora in mind—Rabbinic Judaism came as a reaction to the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the need to keep Jewish identity alive under dispersion. Temple services replaced prayers based on Babylonian exile-era practices, and oral Jewish law was written into the Talmud. Jewish people create home wherever we are and will continue to do so, no matter what happens. Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz (Z’”l , the late founder of the modern Radical Diasporist movement, said: “Diasporism joins those who see borders as lines to cross. Who seek the memory or possibility or value of motion, fluidity, and multiple vision... I posit a Jewish identity that embraces diversity and resists a closed circle. My hope is to join a debate about home, diversity, and justice” 2 . May we work to put Melanie’s theory in practice and do our part to heal the world.

stanforddaily_2024_25,"Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century. I tend to use some variation of that to open most of my job applications. I don’t claim it’s a good intro — it’s incredibly cliché, and it doesn’t say anything people don’t know — but I think we forget it too easily. In 2022,over a thirdof Pakistan flooded, displacing millions of people. In Florida last summer, water temperatures reachedover 100℉,bleaching vast swaths of coral reefs. We hear this discourse so much that we have almost become numb to it. It is in this context that Stanford is developing its new climate action plan, which is scheduled to bereleased this summer. Theprevious planwas released in 2009, and has helped push the University to become the relativelysustainable institutionthat it is today. There are more steps Stanfordcouldtake, but the University has reduced, or is set to reduce, its direct emissions about as much as it can. So what should this new climate action plan seek to do? I would urge the University to focus on making broader change, not just on campus, but also beyond the Farm. Stanford is not just any university — it is a world-leading institution with outsized power, resources and influence. This gives it both the capability and responsibility to serve as a key player in the clean transition. It is not enough for Stanford to simply make its own campus sustainable. It must leverage its unique resources and expertise to take action where it is needed most, and create future sustainability leaders. One major area of need is at the local government level. These jurisdictions are often severely limited in their capacity and funding, meaning that although many need or want to take steps to lessen their emissions, they simply cannot. Here, Stanford could provide services in a few ways. For one, it could serve as a direct research and analysis service, opening a structured online forum where governments could submit technical questions about the feasibility of certain sustainability measures, or how to take advantage of existing programs and funding. University researchers and staff could then use Stanford’s resources to provide a straightforward and actionable answer, allowing these governments to make an informed decision while saving time and money. Alternatively, Stanford could utilize the funding it allocates to carbon offsets to help facilitate real projects on the ground in communities. Offsets have been a subject of scandal in recent years, and such projects would allow Stanford to better monitor its emissions impacts while also helping entities who may be struggling to transition. Finally, where it makes sense, Stanford can help establish and support additional internship opportunities in local governments to increase capacity while providing useful job experience and perspective for students. Next, I would urge a deeper focus on sustainability in Stanford’s career resources. To meet the needs of combating climate change, even just here in California, will require thousands of trained workers across all sectors of the economy. There is room for a focus on climate mitigation in every field, and students should consider the impact they can have within their chosen career path. These opportunities must be made prominent, whether in discussions with advisors, on department websites, or in career-planning resources. Stanford should also create a new Ways requirement in sustainability, where students can learn about climate solutions and options to tie this into potential careers. The world’s economy needs to change significantly to actually combat the climate crisis, and Stanford must take the initiative to prepare students for this new economy and train future climate change mitigation leaders in all fields. Lastly, it is important to build a culture on campus informed about sustainability challenges and working toward solutions. Climate change is a global issue. It cannot be solved with a couple of small policy changes. Instead, sustainability will have to permeate throughout our lives and influence how we live, and how we view the world. Stanford should host more events highlighting decarbonization pathways, and provide people with ways to get involved around campus. Residences should host sustainability talks with new students to help people learn to live more sustainably and think about these issues in day-to-day life. Lastly, Stanford should continue its living lab fellowship program to give students more opportunities to be involved with campus sustainability efforts, while gaining good work experiences. If Stanford’s new plan doesn’t seek to make this higher-level change, it must at least target the major lingering sources of emissions — Scope 3 emissions. This is the hardest to abate category, encompassing things outside the direct control of the University, such as transportation emissions from students and faculty, embodied emissions in the products used around campus, wasteand more. Stanford has a real opportunity to pioneer Scope 3 reduction mechanisms, but to make real progress, it must be broad in its accounting, and prioritize the most efficient reductions. To maximize its impact in the fight against climate change, Stanford must accept its role as a world-leading institution, and use its funds and unique capabilities to make lasting change beyond campus. Similarly, we cannot take the actions of the Doerr school to be a substitute for Stanford’s climate action — we need the full weight and power of the institution behind this transition. Stanford must be willing to reach out to and engage with stakeholders to make progress where it is needed most. It must work to build a culture that values sustainability, and one where people are willing to prioritize that in their lives and careers after Stanford. Finally, it must innovate, and be willing to push the boundaries in its climate mitigation measures on campus. These goals must be enshrined in Stanford’s climate action plan if it is to succeed. Climate action is too large a task for everyone to fend for themselves, and Stanford should use its resources not just to be a role model, but also to help others.

crimson_2024_111,"If any saying could capture the logic of Harvard’s pro-Palestine encampment it’s this: Any press is good press. So imagine my confusion when I went to The Crimson’s website Saturday and saw that protesters haddecided to boycottthe only publication that’s given them consistent coverage. Why? In significant part, because The Crimsonchose to reportthe name of an adult who gave a speech in a public place calling the college protest movement the “student intifada” — a term that is newsworthy because, rightly or not, many take it to invoke a wave of terrorist violence that killed hundreds of Israeli civilians. The boycott is hardly logical. The speaker in question had already been prominently identified as a pro-Palestine activist bythe Boston Globeand WGBHand was giving a speech in a public place. But that’s not my issue. My issue is that, on a campus where asignificant proportion of facultyand students — myself included — believe Israel is committing atrocities in Gaza, the pro-Palestine coalition has managed to make itself so incredibly difficult to support. After a terrorist attack that, per capita, killed about 15 times more people than 9/11, itreleased a statementholding Israel “entirely responsible” for the bloodshed. Then, in the months that followed the bloodiest day in Israel’s history, it chose to chantlanguage widely understoodas calling forviolence against Jewsin Israel. Then, after months where it had been discredited, unfairly or not, as antisemitic by critics across the nation, it released an Instagram post featuringa cartoon so blatantly antisemiticit was featured in a book on the subject. I have listened to Harvard’s pro-Palestine activists respond to these criticisms so many times I can practically hear them now: “Israelissolely responsible.” “That’s not what intifadaactuallymeans.” “We need to reclaim ‘from the river to the sea.’” “The cartoon was an accident.” Every single time, I just want to scream: If you think you can help stop a war, you can’t afford abstractions and excuses. When it comes to mass movements, image is reality. It doesn’t matter what Harvard’s activists actually intended their words or actions to mean — what matters is what the millions of people whose attention they’ve drawn come away believing. Whatever the reality may be — whatever “intifada” or “from the river to the sea” really mean, whatever really happened with the antisemitic cartoon — the image of Harvard’s pro-Palestine movement is that it is callous, antisemitic, and radical. It has given critics fodder to smear it, using language that does not convince or mobilize a single person who wasn’t already convinced and mobilized. Of course, this does not have to be the case. The overwhelming majority of the protesters are decent and well-intentioned, and there is nothing innately radical about protesting the indiscriminate violence Israel is inflicting on the Palestinian people. It’s the opposite, actually — you would be hard-pressed to find an injustice more unambiguous, more immediately persuasive, than the live-time, live-streamed mass death of over 13,000 children. If the protesters would just tell people simply and directly that something disgusting is happening in Gaza, they would enjoy this campus’ widespread support and begin to earn the nation’s. They could chant about the sheer scale of the violence, print fliers with pictures of it, project videos of it onto buildings, take interviews dismantling the flimsy, bad-faith arguments made by many of their opponents. While many of Harvard’s protesters have attempted to do just this, they have become defined by the more extreme in their coalition. Before the eyes of the world, they shout catchphrases many regard as antisemitic, boycott the student press for doing its job, scream that College Dean Rakesh Khuranais “funding genocide”(he has about as much involvement in decisions about the endowment as I do , anddeclare ultimatumsthat are obviously empty threats. Zadie Smith wrotean essayrecently that made at least one obviously good point: “Anyone who finds themselves rolling their eyes at any young person willing to put their own future into jeopardy for an ethical principle should ask themselves where the limits of their own commitments lie.” True. I am writing about protest, not engaging in it. But I am not writing to question the content of their ethical commitments, or whether they’re sincerely held — I am writing to ask that they take action capable of making good on them. It is not enough to act at personal cost with righteous intentions — to die on the cross, to fall on the sword. The task of activism is to advance the cause, and the mere fact of the personal cost it incurs or the attention it grabs does not entail that it will do good. Many in this movement believe themselves to be the progeny of a lineage of college protesters that ended the war in Vietnam and dismantled Apartheid in South Africa. But this is not argument by analogy — it is an article of faith, a prayer repeated in hopes that scattershot outrage might end a war. Whether the students who protested the Vietnam War and Apartheid found a politics that succeeded — itself a historical axiom too little interrogated — says little about whether this college protest movement has. A better test by far is what we can see, and what I see is a movement with plenty of passion and absolutely no plan. As the semester comes to a close and Harvard’s pro-Palestine encampment dwindles in size, I would urge its protesters to find a politics that truly aids their cause. Without one, this movement will be remembered as a costly flight of fancy — not history. Tommy Barone ’25, a Crimson Editorial chair, is a Social Studies concentrator in Currier House."
crimson_2024_5,"Harvard is in the minority of universities that have no form of shared governance at the university level. There exists no body representing faculty and students as key internal stakeholders or constituencies to which the Corporation — the primary decision maker of Harvard’s two governing boards — would be held accountable or at least have formalized mechanisms for dialogue. Unlike this highly unusual paradigm, most universities employtwo common models of university governance. In a unitary-governance model, the authority over decisions concerning the university lies in the hands of one body. This body is either a governing board — a board of trustees — with members external to the university, or it is an academic senate or council with faculty and sometimes student representatives. In a dual or shared governance model, authority over university matters is shared between these two bodies, in a functionally complementary or asymmetrical way. Typically, the governing board makes strategic and financial decisions, while the academic council decides academic matters. When the governance structure is asymmetric, while this functional division still holds, the board has the ultimate say or veto on all issues. Across both types of governing models, the appointment or election of the key university officer — the president or the rector — varies, and the primary allegiance to internal constituencies or external stakeholders varies accordingly. A rector elected by academics and students owes its allegiance to these internal constituencies. Alternatively, the allegiance of a president appointed by a governing board is to that governing board, and by extension to donors or governments. Student representation in university governance is another interesting point of contention across schools. While some form of representative student bodies exists almost everywhere, the actual power of students in university governance varies greatly. One notable example is the Czech Republic where students have at least 30 percent of votes within the academic senates of higher education institutions. Conversely, at universities with authority vested in the hands of a board, students — if represented — may be consulted, but rarely have voting rights. In the United States, the legal authority over universities originates in their governing boards, and so these boards hold decision authority over all university matters. The governing boards generally delegate decision powers to appointed university officials — such as the president — and these officials then appoint other lower-ranking officials — such as deans. Sometimes members of these governing boards appoint faculty and students on search committees, but they never relinquish their ultimate decision authority. In a similar vein, most university governing boards in the United States have conferred some decision authority to faculty by creating a university faculty senate or council in their shared governance arrangements. But not Harvard. At present,members of the Corporation sometimes call on faculty for a private conversation— which is commendable — but far from a regular dialogue between the Corporation and faculty that could inform or vet the Corporation’s decisions. The present crisis at Harvard and the University’s damaged reputation calls for reform. Faculty and students should have a say in university governance. The Corporation itself would have to bring about this type of reform, changing Harvard’s laws and statutes to stipulate the establishment of a University faculty council and confer authority onto it. At the same time, faculty would need to play a role too, deciding on self-governance of a University faculty council. The establishment of such a body might draw on lessons from the recent establishmentof the Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard— a faculty organization with members from across Harvard schools joined to promote free inquiry, intellectual diversity, and civil discourse at Harvard. Reforms reimagining existing faculty councils — such as the FAS Faculty Council — may also be needed to deal with appointment procedures, sabbatical leaves for those serving, and questions of authority in school affairs. Students would also require representation through the University faculty council itself or via their own Harvard student council, with representatives from the College and graduate unions setting up their own self-governance arrangements. These reforms could promote direct dialogue with the Corporation and faculty and students, instead of resorting to occasional letters and informal meetings, or hand-picking faculty and students to serve on their presidential searches. This would bring more transparency, help create accountability of the Corporation towards faculty and students, and hopefully improve the Corporation’s decision-making. Just as we expect diverse opinions and constructive disagreement in the classroom to yield deeper learning, we can hope that diverse opinions and constructive disagreement on University matters will yield better decisions.

stanforddaily_2024_7,"When I attended Stanford in the 1960s, I led the campus protest movement against the Vietnam War. I was focused on effective persuasion, not venting my anger and causing disruption. Let alone violence. Let me tell that story — and how it governed my 40 years as a public policy advocate. It explains why the current protests against Israel’s conduct in its war against Hamas have been so completely ineffective. Early in my sophomore year, I came to believe that the Vietnam War was a total mistake. An outrage. America had become the new colonial power in Southeast Asia, replacing the French. I did not believe that Vietnam would become a satellite of Communist China (and it didn’t . So, once a week, I set up a table in White Plaza and handed out white armbands to those who felt the same way. When I started in late 1964, hardly anyone took an armband. Many students would yell at me. Some threatened me. Then when I graduated in 1967, I organized a protest in which about 25% of the students wore white armbands to the graduation. It was perhaps the first protest at a Stanford graduation. We were visible and respectful and, I am sure, effective. On a parallel track, in the summer of 1965, I landed my first Stanford in Government internship on Capitol Hill. I participated in many anti-Vietnam War protests but didn’t bring these into my Hill office, which might have destroyed my internship. Back on Capitol Hill as a SIG intern in 1967, I organized speakers for the SIG interns. We met with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, the leading advocate, at the time, for the Vietnam War. I sat next to him, and at the end I asked, “How are we going to persuade the Vietnamese to back us when we’re acting like the new colonial power, after the French?” He glowered at me and perhaps wanted to slug me. Instead, he left without answering my question. That summer, my roommate was a close friend of Al Lowenstein (formerly a dean at Stanford , who was busy on Capitol Hill recruiting a senator to run for president in the 1968 Democratic primaries on an anti-war platform. He landed Eugene McCarthy. In 1968, I went “clean for Gene” — now focusing on the political process and again not venting and disrupting. I worked in multiple primaries and was in a McCarthy storefront in Milwaukee when President Lyndon Johnson dropped out. We won in the political trenches, not the streets. All of us believed that our student pressure on Johnson had forced him to end his reelection campaign. The political process had worked. When I graduated from Stanford, I was accepted into the Peace Corps but deferred to attend law school. But in February 1968, all graduate deferments from the draft were ended. I planned to refuse induction and possibly go to jail, which would have ruined my planned career in the law. So, I renewed my Peace Corps application and was assigned to Nepal. Neither my local draft board nor the state draft board would give me a deferment, but the Peace Corps successfully processed a “presidential appeal.” I ended up serving in Asia in a rice paddy with a hoe rather than a gun. Throughout all of this, I was, in fact, angry, very angry. We certainly had a sense of urgency about the Vietnam War: As many as three million Vietnamese died, 300,000 Cambodians and 60,000 Laotians, plus 58,220 U.S. service members. But I focused on persuasion that would not lead to a “law and order” backlash. Others in the antiwar movement were violent, which undermined our cause. My engagement in these protests from 1964-70 then led to my 35-year career on legislative committees on Capitol Hill, two years in the Carter White House and my serving as the principal lobbyist for the entire biotechnology industry. Throughout my career, I did not demonize my opponents. I have always worked for Democrats but found ways to collaborate on a bipartisan basis. I did not view Republicans as my enemy. In Nepal, I had gained a high degree of tolerance for cross-cultural differences. I came to believe that political disagreements are also cross-cultural. My life as an advocate speaks to what works and what doesn’t. The bitterness and vitriol we now see from those defending the Palestinians, the harassment of Jewish students, the vilification of Israelis, the antisemitism, and now the violence… they have boomeranged. They have forced President Biden to denounce the protesters. Inevitably and intentionally, they have led to the intervention of the police. The protesters can vent their anger, but this is just narcissism. Utterly tone deaf. No strategy. It’s obvious to me that there is an inverse relationship between the vehemence of an argument and its effectiveness. It’s called “the theory of psychological reactance” and it arises when an advocate attempts to restrict a person’s freedom to agree or disagree — so they flinch and flee. An “anti-conformity boomerang effect.” It makes me sad that the Palestinians have perhaps the worst-led civil rights movement in history. They have legitimate grievances, but they are led by the incompetent and, in Hamas, by terrorists. By way of contrast, after thousands of years of being displaced and murdered, Jews had their own civil rights movement and it led to their surviving the Holocaust and founding the state of Israel. My lifetime in the political trenches tells me what works. Searching for common ground, respect for your opponent, quiet argumentation, and a willingness to compromise… that works. And it can also lead to a rewarding and impactful career as a public policy advocate. Chuck Ludlam ’67 is a Stanford alum.

crimson_2024_57,"When I arrived on Harvard’s campus almost three years ago, I was excited to meet new people, expand my horizons, and contribute to the community in any way that I could. It was this attitude that initially compelled me to run for a seat on Harvard’s student government during my first semester. Three years, two elections, and many great memories later, I now serve as co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Association. During my term, I have tirelessly served the student body. Last summer, I represented the student body at a panel discussion hosted bythe U.S. Department of Education, advocating for the protection of minority students in college admissions. Once the school year started, I led the HUA ininstitutionalizing fundsfor our summer storage program, ensuring that it continues to be accessible to students for years to come. We created countless new grants to help student organizations thrive. We mobilized our platform to advocate for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to keep the deadline to add and drop classes later in the semester, helping to ensure that students have thefreedom to choose class scheduleson their own time. These are only a few of the HUA’s accomplishments this year. However, over the last few weeks, I have been reminded that there is a dark side to student politics. You have probably seen my name in recent headlines. I want to take this opportunity to set the record straight. When I first ran for co-president in March of 2023, I was alerted to vile accusations and rumors posted about me on Sidechat — an anonymous forum frequented by Harvard students. I originally chalked these rumors up to dirty campaign tricks and assumed that they would go away after the election. I was wrong. After I won, the rumors only increased in frequency. It felt like they would flare up whenever I did something notable, like speak at Freshman Convocation or have my name mentioned in a news article. Unfortunately the rumors only grew. Despite a lack of any formal investigations or complaints filed against me, the social stigma around me ballooned. I was ostracized from friends, groups, and communities that I hold dear. And last month, conveniently just days before the HUA’s election cycle, one organization was alerted to these rumors andhastily decided to revoke my membership, causing them to mutate into a firestorm. Let me be perfectly clear: I unequivocally reject these rumors. Those close to me can attest that misconduct — of any kind — is antithetical to my character. The mere existence of these rumors saddens me deeply and has taken a considerable toll on my mental health and well-being. The individuals perpetuating these rumors about me seem to have three goals: discredit my administration’s contributions to the student body, damage my reputation, and scare me — and others like me — into abandoning our aspirations for public service. I refuse to let them succeed in accomplishing any of these goals. I’m not alone in these kinds of struggles. Students serving and succeeding in student government have been no stranger to baseless accusations in recent years. Two years ago, just before election season, a student government member faced allegations of losing or stealing $20,000 of Covid-19 relief funding from the Undergraduate Council. Of course, after the election passed and an audit was conducted, the student was fully exonerated. Harvard’s student government has become an unfortunate microcosm of the same endless mudslinging we see in our nation’s politics today. It does not have to be this way. This isn’t Washington — we are college students. I hope that someday, those in Harvard’s student government can find ways to be rivals or disagree without attempting to tear each other down. Now, I am facing a recall vote, although my term officially ends in just 10 days. However, I’m not worried, and I’m going to stand strong. I am confident that the truth will prevail. I am confident that the student body will recognize these rumors as baseless. I have served as HUA co-president for the last 13 months. In that time frame, I’ve been blessed to accomplish above and beyond what I had planned for this role. No matter the results of the upcoming vote, I’m proud to say that the work we’ve done — and the positive legacy we’ve built — will long endure. Most importantly, as I look towards the future, this ordeal will not deter me from using my voice. I will continue to step up to serve my community, both at Harvard College and beyond. John S. Cooke ’25 is a Government concentrator in Mather House. He serves as co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Association."
wildcat_arizona_2024_6,"Throughout history and generations, young people have often found themselves at the forefront of major social change. Whether it be peace-driven students protesting the Vietnam War, students demanding civil rights or fighting against gun violence within our schools — the desire to remain informed and create change remains timeless within each new generation of young people. Gen Z is hardly excluded from this narrative, etching ourselves into the record as perhaps the most passionate and strong-willed generation yet. Despite this, we are living in an era where media consumption is at an all time high — especially for Gen Z.In fact, according to a2022 Pew Research Center study, 97% of us report using the internet daily.So, while our hunger for knowledge has endured just as it did for our grandparents, the way we go about getting it couldn’t be more different than it was 50, even 40 years ago. This major deviation is also morphing into Gen Z’s biggest downfall. Within the past 10 years, American youth has climbed their way to the #1 spot in media fluency — or so we think. When we envision what political polarization entails today, we picture theJanuary 6 insurrection, tweens posting error-ridden Instagram infographics or adamant anti-vaccine rants at Thanksgiving dinners. While there’s no denying that these are concrete examples of how politically isolated we as a country have become, I fear that Gen Z frequently separates these instances from self. Often, we look down upon the older generation who is so often plagued by their own lack of media fluency. We receive odd Facebook news articles from our grandparents or wonder how our uncle has the time to subscribe to that many right-wing YouTube channels. These instances, while at times humorous, ultimately should serve more as a sign of caution for Gen Z than anything else. Shouldn’t we be better equipped to navigate the polarizing effects of the internet? The statistics behind our media consumption habits tell a different story. Another2022 Pew Research Center studyshows that 36% of X’s, formally Twitter, news consumers are adults aged 18-29,mostly members of Gen Z depending on where you make the cutoff. While the app has been the subject of conversation around misinformation for years, this past week has proven there to be no improvement. As Israel was attacked by Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, deceptive news flooded X.According to Cyabara, an Israeli analysis form, one in five social media accounts engaging in online conversation regarding the Hamas attacks are fake.This holds especially true on X, where it appears as though the app’s efforts to combat misinformation cannot keep up with the rate it is being spread —with even clips from ashort filmbeing posted with the intent to appear as real news. The interesting aspect of the rate in which this misinformation is deployed is not quite in its content but rather in the demographic that falls most susceptible to it. A testdeveloped by the University of Cambridgewas conducted on Americans of various ages in order to identify how often we can decipher fake news.It turned out that those who spent more than 9 hours of recreational time online each day only received a high score on the test 15% of the time. The test success rate doubled for those who reported 0-2 hours a day of internet time. These results heavily conflict with the common narrative that the older, “boomer” generation is far more susceptible to misinformation than younger, seemingly tech-savvy Gen Z. So, evidently, our media proficiency may not be as outstanding as we think. In fact, our time spent online (even if it’s not on Facebook may be having the exact opposite effect towards our activism efforts than we once thought. The truth is, young people today can spend all the hours on X or Instagram and repost all of the misinformation we please — our current cycle of excess media consumption is the direct recipe for our worsening media literacy. If Gen Z wants to avoid this trajectory, we should remain tenacious in our efforts to seek the truth through more traditional outlets — even if it’s not always the most convenient. The future generations might just thank us. FollowtheDaily WildcatonInstagramandTwitter/X Olivia is a junior studying journalism.

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. This guest opinion is adapted from an article written by UNC March for Our Lives, published in more than 50 student newspapers nationally. The original article was signed by 144 student leaders representing over 90 student groups across the nation. The tragedy at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde remains thedeadliestmass shooting in this country since 2019. The deadliest mass shooting in 2019?El Paso. The lastmass shootingof 2023 occurred in Austin. There have already been threemass shootingsin Texas this year, one of which occurred in Houston. Yosha Hamilton, whose 16-year-old son Shane, a star athlete who dreamed of becoming a professional basketball player before beingshot and killed in Baytown, summed up the collective conscience of so many in this state. “It’s hell.” Students in Texas are taught to love a country that values guns over our lives. Many of us hear the sound of gunfire when we watch fireworks on the fourth of July. All of us have heard the siren of an active shooter drill and asked ourselves:Are we next? By painful necessity, we have grown to become much more than students learning in a classroom — we have shed every last remnant of our childhood innocence. Our hearts bleed from this uniquely American — uniquelyTexan— brand of gun violence, and yet we remind ourselves that we love our country so much that we expect better from it. Despite calls upon lawmakers to do something about this epidemic of violence, our cries for action fall upon deaf ears. We are tired of being ridiculed as “radical” by lawmakers for championing common-sense gun reforms like expanding background checks, which aresupported by a majority of Texans.What is radical is the status quo, where gun violence is the leading cause of death among Texas youth — more than cancer and more than car accidents. Year after year,Texas loosens restrictionson guns, and year after year, the rate of youth gun deaths increases. But I write today, along with hundreds of young people around the country, because I believe that our country has the capacity to love us back. There are bullet-shaped holes in our hearts, but our spirits are unbreakable. I joined the gun violence prevention movement when I was 17 years old. Nearly every week, my brother, who was just in the 6th grade, would come home and tell us about a shooting in his school’s neighborhood in Lexington, Ky. In 2018, a student brought a loaded gun to my high school. The following week, a student at another school in my hometownlegally purchasedan AR-15 and made threats to shoot his classmates. The threat of violence was constant, but I knew I couldn’t depend on my legislators to pass policies to keep me or my loved ones safe. I remember watching my future friend and Team ENOUGH founding memberAalayah Eastmond’s testimonybefore the House Judiciary Committee. I shed tears, not from the horror she described from hiding herself under the body of Nicholas Dworet during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. No, it was Aalayah’s resiliency and bravery. To share her story, to honor her fallen friends through it and to fight to prevent anyone from ever enduring that pain inspired me. I joined Team ENOUGH because, like Aalayah, I couldn’t wait for elected officials to do the right thing. And I couldn’t wait to lose someone I loved to act. We believe that while it’s not fair that we must rise against a problem that we did not create, we have no choice: Our lives depend on it. Because for360,000 of ussince Columbine, the cursed emotional vocabulary of survivorship has become our story. We can’t stand by, waiting to lose the next Shane Hamilton or Nicholas Dworet before we are so compelled to act. We believe that we should not wait, and we will not wait, for individual trauma to affect us all before we respond together. In a country with a rich legacy of youth-led movements, from the Civil Rights Movement to protests of the Vietnam War, our words do not have to end on the page, but rather can be channeled into change. And so we invite you to join this generation’s community of organizers, all of us united in demanding a future free of gun violence. 2024 is a crucial election. It is a presidential election year. Ted Cruz is up for election. Every single seat of the United States and Texas House of Representatives is up for election. We are at a crucial junction for the future of this country and Texas. We have the power to set the agenda to ensure that those who hold the highest seats of power genuinely represent us.Record youth turnoutin 2020 set the stage for the passage of theBipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most comprehensive gun reform bill in nearly 30 years. This bill passed just a month after Uvalde. I have one request:Contact your representative. Make the pain that we feel, the fear we live under and the loss we have enduredunignorable. And if they continue to ignore our cries, the cries of everyone who loses a sibling to gun suicide, the cries of children who are shot in the street, the cries of mothers who lose their babies? Vote them out of office come November. As Aalayah says, “If you’re not with us,get out of our way.” Politicians will not have the shallow privilege of reading another front-cover op-ed by students on their knees, begging them to do their jobs. They will instead contend with the reality that by uniting with each other and among parents, educators and communities, our demands become undeniable. Our movement is not just moving away from the unbearable pain of our yesterday — we move toward an unrelenting hope for our tomorrow. Our generation dares politicians to look us in the eye and tell us they’re too afraid to try. Jan. 24, 2024 3:02 p.m. The national article was written by UNC March for Our Lives, not Team ENOUGH. This article has been corrected. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_6,"In a Februarypress conference, Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, responded to questions about U.S.-Mexico relations and the increase in migration. “We’re the United States, Mexico will do what we say,” Johnson said, implying Mexico to be inferior. This arrogant comment perpetuates the well establishednarrativethat Mexico is a lesser country and should be looked down on. A quick look at Mexico’s elections this year will convince you that Mexico is not a country to be overlooked, but rather admired for its progressive path toward change. Mexico will make history this June with the election of theirfirst female president. June 2, 2024 will be a historic day in Mexico, with voters electing the president, senators and local officials. The two presidential candidates in a close race for presidency areXóchitl Gálvez— a left-leaning candidate from the PAN party — andClaudia Sheinbaum— a Morena party member. Both candidates have STEM backgrounds; Gálvez holds a degree incomputer scienceand Sheinbaum has adoctorate in engineering, and has even spent time at aUC Berkeley lablearning about energy use in Mexico. According to recentpolls, Sheinbaum is the leading candidate for this election, her progressive goals reflect Mexico’s potential and serve as a beacon of hope for the future. Sheinbaum, a 61-year-old Jewish woman and former mayor of Mexico City, is well qualified for the presidency with her extensivepolitical careerandeducation. Sheinbaum maintains a platform ofscienceand reinvesting in the Mexican people through the fight against administrativecorruption. Sheinbaum’s campaign also prioritizes the expansion and investment inpublic transportation, as well as the promotion of sustainability. Sheinbaum’s ambitious agenda may appear to be a list of empty promises politicians typically make to attract voters, yet her record as mayor of Mexico City backs up her platform claims. As mayor, she supported science during theCOVID-19 pandemicby shutting down public establishments as well as increasing testing and vaccination rates for the city. Sheinbaum is also recognized for launching electric“Metrobus”lines in the city which contributes to a reduction of carbon emissions and increases transportation options. The fact that Mexico will be electing its first female president with a strong background in science and technology speaks multitudes. When compared to the election situation in the U.S., it is difficult not to note how much Mexico is outperforming. The U.S. is at a dead end. In November, we will witness an exact repeat of the 2020 election — both presidential candidates, Biden and Trump have received extensivecriticismand are considered to be unfavorable candidates among voters. The victory of Trump will set the U.S. back with the threat ofProject 2025, but the election of Biden will leave us in the same position we are now, with the same set of concerns and issues. It is time to stop overlooking Mexico’s potential and disregarding the country as inferior. Sheinbaum’s past work and plans for Mexico highlight the country’s potential and why it is crucial we pay close attention to these elections. Sheinbaum is not the only symbol of Mexico’s potential and upcoming growth. The amount of Americans choosing torelocateto Mexico contradicts the narrative of Mexico that is told. Mexico is frequently painted in themediaas a lawless, corrupt and crime-heavy country. However, the surge of Americans relocating to Mexico for abetter lifechallenges this stereotypical image of Mexico. Despite this narrative of Mexico being home to criminals, many international visitors havereportedfeeling safe in Mexico. The truth is that not all portions of Mexico are dangerous, and the danger varies by location, similar to the U.S. While Mexico has a long way to go in terms of reducing overall poverty, crime and corruption, these upcoming elections represent the country’s journey to progress. Claudia Sheinbaum represents change by being on her way to becoming Mexico’s first woman president and running on a progressive platform, which is something to celebrate. The media frequently concentrates on the negative aspects of Mexico, contributing to the idea that the country is too far gone for change. However, these elections will have Mexico demonstrating to the world that it is a force to be reckoned with. Zahira Vasquez is a Spring 2024 Opinion Apprentice. She can be reached atzivasque@uci.edu.

crimson_2024_94,"I came to Harvard proclaiming that I wanted to become a senator. Today, I stand on the brink of a graduation in which I will no longer walk, suspended and looking forward to a life of community organizing. I grew up trans in rural Maine, working in kitchens and painting houses. I’ve come face to face with the law, moved away from home at 16. Where I’m from, going to college is not a given and leaving the state is uncommon. But in the spring of 2020, living out of a garage loft without running water, I became one of the first openly trans valedictorians in the country and the first person from my high school to get into Harvard. Like many students from my background, Harvard presented a sea of firsts, a total transformation of my circumstances and opportunities. I will always remember driving to college for the first time: Crossing over the big bridge between Maine and New Hampshire — overwhelmed by hope, fear, and an unimaginable life ahead, I began to cry. I was finally free. Four years later, I have found the freedom I thought Harvard would offer, but not in the ways one would think. I came to Harvard wanting to make the world a better place through progressive politics. I studied Government and served on the board of the Harvard College Democrats. I lobbied government officials and interned on campaigns and in state senators’ offices. I tried to work within the system, unaware of and unexposed to another way. Everything changed my sophomore year, when Covid-19 restrictions fell away and campus organizing raged back to life. In 2021, amidst the Harvard Graduate Students Union strike — in which hundreds of graduate students went on strike in an effort to win higher wages, a union shop, and real recourse for survivors — I joined the Student Labor Action Movement and learned just what people power could do. Never had I felt so much potential for change as I did surrounded by masses of protestors and organizers fighting for justice. That year, I learned that real change does not come from working within the confines of institutions like this school or our government, but from hitting the streets and dismantling those very institutions from the outside in. Since then, I have continued to fight for labor rights with SLAM and the Harvard Undergraduate Workers Union; protested this University’s moral and material complicity in occupation and genocide with the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine coalition; resisted rape culture with the Harvard Feminist Coalition; and called for Harvard to divest its $50 billion endowment from the prison-industrial complex with the Harvard Prison Divestment Coalition. These fights have revealed that the portrait Harvard paints of itself as an institution dedicated to justice and social good is nothing more than that — a portrait, a facade. This university professes to educate, protect, and transform its students, but in truth, it union-busts; weaponizes housing and food against student workers and organizers; mobilizes resources to protect professors convicted by its own Title IX processes; upholds empire, exploitation, apartheid, and genocide on a global scale; and disciplines the students and workers who speak out against these injustices. Just this past month, as I built the Liberated Zone — Harvard’s pro-Palestine encampment — with my peers, I watched the administration turn the Yard into a surveillance state. I saw supplies and supporters kept outside the gates and was one of dozens put through disciplinary processes and placed on involuntary leave — functionally evicted, forced off meal plans, and fired from campus jobs — for peaceful protest. Throughout my time here, I have come to learn that Harvard does not stand for its students or the more just world I came here hoping to build. It is the antithesis of that world. But as I learned of Harvard’s injustice, I also learned how to organize — and, in doing so, learned what the path towards liberation looks like. What moves the world closer to justice and joy is not Harvard, but the organizers I have met here, who have taught me, shaped me, and led me to the work I want to do. I didn’t learn these things in a classroom, during an internship, or from a speaker event. I learned them from the incredible community of organizers who see through Harvard’s lies and have dedicated their lives to righting the University’s wrongs. I gained this compass for liberation on the streets, at rallies and teach-ins, in the basement of University Hall, and from the encampment in the Yard. Commencement is a celebration of graduating students and their accomplishments, an event that functions as a laudatory salute to Harvard itself. There is a sour dissonance in that fact that The Crimson’s Editorial Board has asked me to write this op-ed as a “notable senior” reflecting on graduation while Harvard withholds my degree until May of 2026 for fighting its investments in genocide in Palestine. I refuse to give Harvard the pat on the back that it craves. I sit here writing this with a middle finger raised to Harvard and the systems of oppression it perpetuates and depends on — and with so much love in my heart for my organizer peers and the liberated world we fight for. I don’t know when I will graduate, I don’t know what my next few days will look like, but one thing is for certain: I know we will never stop. Syd D.

rice_thresher_2024_5,"ByThresher Editorial Board3/26/24 10:58pm Dean of Undergraduates Bridget Gorman finally released the long-awaited Alcohol Policy Advisory Committee’s recommendations regarding the alcohol policy on March 22. We have to be honest — it could have been much worse. In terms ofsome immediate changes: Publics will be allowed to resume, residential colleges must submit plans for promoting Beer Bike week safety and the Martel morning public can occur as a quad-only event (Sundeck, you will be missed . Other implementations include changes to event capacity and ticketing, possible changes to amnesty and other smaller tweaks to current policy. When compared to the fears of a dry campus or forever-cancelled publics that arose last semester, we have to admit that these changes really aren’t that bad. In light of this report, we’re reminded that drinking on campus is a privilege, not a right. These past few months should serve as a lesson, though, and not an excuse to return to last semester’s ways with Beer Bike week approaching. Publics and big events can be taken away from us again just as easily, and we want to be able to both experience and preserve campus culture and tradition. As weurged last semester, it’s still vital to keep drinking safety in mind — especially with the return of publics after an extended hiatus and the fact that Beer Bike is our first major event post-prohibition. It may be easy to get over-excited with a week full of drinking events imminent, but now isn’t the time to go completely crazy. Know your limits, don’t be afraid to utilize resources like caregiving stations and just try to drink responsibly this next week. And, please don’t be afraid to reach out to higher forms of help if you need it — APAC’s intentions were not to scare students off calling REMS when necessary. Lastly, just look out for yourself and for your friends. We may always joke about the Culture of Care, but it’s real. Make sure your friend has a water bottle, feed them a slice of pizza and have a fun (and safe Beer Bike — we all deserve it.

crimson_2024_82,"Research scandals seem never-ending these days. At Harvard, in the last year alone, allegations of plagiarism or research misconduct have been raised against former University PresidentClaudine Gay, Harvard Business School professorFrancesca Gino, Harvard Medical School neuroscientistKhalid Shah, and Harvard’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion OfficerSherri A. Charleston. The problem, though prevalent here, is not isolated. Last year, the president of Stanford resigned amid scrutiny of his past research. The social sciences have had a replicability crisis for some time now, but recently the natural sciences have seen waves of paper retractions for fraudulent research. How could this happen? And what can we do about this sorry state of affairs? There are certainly several causes. A “publish or perish” culture has long driven academics to fraudulent behavior. Holes in the peer-review system have allowed it to slip through. When concerns are raised to journals about work published in their pages, there is evidence that they often fail to adequately respond. A crucial problem, however, is missing from this list, as well as from many of the ongoing conversations about plagiarism right now: Institutions pay far too little mind to uncovering misconduct that has already happened. Right now, so-called science sleuths — do-good vigilantes who look into research concerns — are doing a lion’s share of this work. They are on the lookout for everything from duplicated or suspicious pictures to statistical tinkering to good-old-fashioned verbal plagiarism. To investigate these issues, sleuths employ a wide variety of methods that require human attention and can’t easily be automated by journals or institutions. In recent years, an entire internet subculture has emerged around this activity. There are now dedicated discussion blogs such as PubPeer, where people comment on and discuss potential problems they have found in past research. One enthusiast created a game calledDupesy, which challenges players to look for pictures too similar to one another. Such grassroots efforts, while valuable, are indicative of the fact that there is not a formal and effective institutional framework for screening previous research. As opposed to the production of new research, there are few rewards for uncovering problems with previously published studies. That is, except for one enticing, but troubling, reward: the political ends you can achieve by motivated review of research. In recent months, finding research misconduct in the work of ideological opponents has become a weapon in American ideological disputes. This type of targeted review is present on both sides: While certainly ironic, the plagiarism allegations raised against Neri Oxman, the wife of outspoken Harvard critic Bill A. Ackman ’88, are, like those leveled against Claudine Gay, politically motivated. While genuine cases of misconduct have been raised as a result of these targeted investigations, this phenomenon leads to a narrow and skewed impression of a problem that is far broader. This is apparent in the recent targeting of Black female scholars, whose potential misconduct is being used to critique DEI initiatives. Without a benchmark measure of the prevalence of plagiarism in the work of other scholars, we have no way of understanding how unusual these issues really are. To make matters worse, while incentives to uncover misconduct are scarce or misaligned, obstacles abound. Those uncovering misconduct often get threatened or sued — in the case of vigilante sleuths, often without an institution to protect them. Moreover, advances in AI are likely to enable completely new ways to commit scientific fraud, further complicating amateur strategies. Generative AI, for example, makes it much easier to create unique images, rendering the sleuthing technique of finding pictures too similar to one another obsolete. Developments in AI can also be used to fight AI-enabled fraud, of course, but it is unlikely that the hobbyists who do much of the investigation now will have access to the cutting edge of AI detection technology. More generally, amateur detectives can lack the capacity to find problems in complex studies with expert fraud — often the ones that matter the most. In light of these issues, one clear way forward is to integrate sleuths more closely into the scientific process. More specifically, governments or large research universities should create internal divisions dedicated to searching for potential fraud. The review of past research should have its own career path in academia, next to research and teaching. This would introduce new incentives to sleuth while blunting the impact of legal threats. At the very least, more recognition and even material reward should be provided to anyone who finds legitimate concerns with published research. Across the Atlantic, the University of Bern is already pilotingsuch a program. Harvard has a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the research community and take the lead in such efforts. We certainly have the resources both to establish our own division looking for past misconduct and offer prizes for those who uncover serious cases. The job of spotting scientific fraud should become a specialized career with its own tools, practices, and code of conduct. Not only would this clean up our science, but it would likely have deterrence effects in the future. The sooner we professionalize science sleuthing, the better. Harvard should take the lead.

thetech_mit_2024_11,"Just after 5 p.m. on November 9th the MIT community bore witness to a scene that belongs in a dystopian fever dream, not a 21st century hall of learning. Dozens of MIT police officers stormed into Lobby 7, batons and pepper spray at the ready. Their target? A peaceful sit-in by students protesting the university s complicity in thegenocide of Palestinians. MIT police stood guard at all points of entry and barricaded the peaceful student demonstrators inside; even denying re-entry if students left Lobby 7 to access food, water or bathroom facilities. The next day,MIT police stood guard outside 10-250—where a pre-approved series of Palestine-relatededucationalprogramming (documentary screenings, lectures, and teach-ins was scheduled to take place—and barred anyone from entering. This was not the first time MIT police have oppressed members of our community under the guise of public safety. From enduring a SWAT raid in dorms to having guns drawn at us in parking lots, Black and brown members of the MIT community have long faced pervasive racial profiling and interrogation (see minutes 33:00 – 43:00here . The present escalation of oppressive policing that is being used to target students, faculty, and staff protesting genocide is rooted in the MIT administration’s failure to listen to Black students who have long fought to address anti-Black racism at MIT. The university cannot plausibly create an anti-racist environment while continuing down this path; now, MIT must choose. Empty Commitments to address anti-Black racism and public safety Nearly 4 years ago, students from the Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA and the Black Student Union (BSU released thepetition to Support Black Lives(SBL at MIT. The murders of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in the summer of 2020 seemingly illuminated the reality thatviolence and racism are inherent to policing itselfand that we must reimagine public safety in the U.S. The SBL petition was our way to bring this moment to MIT, and it was met with overwhelming support with over 5,000 individual signatures from students, staff, faculty, and others. One of the primary goals of the SBL petition was to reduce the scale of policing on MIT’s campus and reallocate resources to build other structures better equipped to address certain public safety concerns. In July 2020, former President Reif ensured that MIT would respond to this historic moment by creating a working group to reimagine public safety. This working group, which was composed of students, faculty, administrators, and MIT police officers, made a number ofrecommendations. One proposal, put forth in response to the MIT police department’s (MITPD self-reported statistics that over 90% of calls for service are non-violent concerns such as stolen bicycles, was to establish unarmed community service officers (CSOs and/or clinicians, who would respond to routine calls and mental health crises. This would have narrowed the scope of policing on our campus and prevented the current use of police force to surveil and intimidate MIT community members. The working group also recommended increased transparency on police policies and procedures, and a community advisory group to provide feedback regarding campus safety. None of these recommendations have been fully realized. MIT’s (in actions show how little the Institute values the community members that devoted over a year of labor to the ‘Reimaging Public Safety’ working group, and the Black and brown communities chronically and disproportionately impacted by policing. MIT’s (in actions reveal that the university s 2020 pledge to “address systemic racism at MIT” was only opportunistic alignment during the momentary “trendiness” of antiracism. MIT’s true values are revealed in the current moment, when the Institute is faced with a groundswell of justified anti-genocide protest. MIT’s Response to Peaceful Protest Against Israel’s Genocide of Palestinians in Gaza Over the past six months, students, staff, and faculty have raised alarms about the Institute’s complicity in the maiming, death, displacement, and starvation of 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza given MIT’s direct and unique research ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Rather than grappling with this serious issue, nearly 4 years after MIT’s empty commitments to addressing systemic racism and policing, the Institute has turned to using its police force to heighten the surveillance and intimidation of its own community members. Without any attempt to gather broad community input, MIT has permanently stationed police officers in Lobby 7. These officers have reportedly conducted random and potentially racially motivated MIT ID checks that resembleracist Stop and Frisk laws. Dozens of cameras have also been installed on campus (in Lobby 7, in front of 77 Massachusetts Avenue, and along the path to the student center without notification to community members. Police officers have consistently been stationed outside all events organized by student groups aiming to educate the community about the ongoing Palestinian Genocide; resembling the racist policies that the Reimagining Public Safety grouprecommendedwe discard. The Institute’semergencyalert system is constantly misused to notify the community of peaceful demonstrations passing through Massachusetts Avenue. In short, the facade of addressing antiracism and reimagining public safety has come crashing down. MIT Has A Choice To Make The suppression of anti-genocide and anti-Zionism protest inherently relies on and reinscribes racist policies, procedures, and policing. This reliance on policing has created fertile ground for the violent scenes we have witnessed at Columbia, NYU, USC,University of Texas at Austin, University of Minnesota,Emory, and in our own backyard at Emerson and Northeastern. If MIT is to seriously embrace its professed commitment toaddress systemic racism, MIT must abandon its carceral—surveillance, policing, and punishment—stance and engage with members of the MIT community in good faith. This means reinstating the Coalition Against Apartheid, rescinding the racist and unprecedented protest policy, and avoiding further police escalation. It also means engaging with and honoring the MIT community’s collective demands—todivestfrom research and financial relationships with the Israeli military and publicly call for a ceasefire. Finally, to affect long-lasting anti-racist change, MIT must re-allocate MITPD’s budget to developevidence-basedstructures proven to create real holistic safety. We have laid out some steps on the path to anti-racist actionsthat MIT can take if antiracism, not oppression, is the value MIT wants to reflect.Every member of MIT’s community has a choice in this matter and must decide to either let oppression permeate our culture or take anti-racist action to build a better world.Now, MIT must choose. This piece is cross-published in the faculty newsletter."
rice_thresher_2024_30,"BySarah Sowell1/9/24 11:04pm Editor’s Note: This is a letter to the editor that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. Letters to the editor are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for grammar and spelling by Thresher editors. Last semester,International Justice Mission’s anti-trafficking fashionInterwovenwas featured in the Thresher. The article concluded with a call from me imploring Rice students to consider the connections between social issues they care about and human trafficking. I am writing today to expand upon that call to action and to mobilize the campus to consider trafficking more deeply. Human trafficking isdefined by the United Nationsas the “recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring, or receipt of people through force, fraud, or deception with the aim of exploiting them for profit.” At its core, human trafficking is the exploitation of a person for personal gain. As noted in last semester’s article, over50 million peopleare currently enslaved, more than at any time in human history. However, when I talk to Rice students, many of them do not seem too concerned about this human rights violation. Instead, they dismiss the issue. One peer of mine even expressed skepticism that sex trafficking even exists. I wonder if they worry I am trying to sell them on building a border wall to block undocumented migration or a QAnon conspiracy about a pizza restaurant. I am not. Instead, I am calling on Rice students to include the issue of human trafficking in their advocacy and to educate themselves on the issue. Fundamentally, human trafficking is a women’s issue. The International Labour Organization estimates that4.9 millionwomen and girls are exploited through forced prostitution in the commercial sex industry. Sex trafficking is fueled by a misogynistic culture that demands access to a woman’s body, denying her right to autonomy. Yet, feminist organizations at Rice don’t speak up enough against sex trafficking, despite the fact that Houston rankssecond in U.S. cities for sex trafficking. Beyond sex trafficking, the ILO estimates that over22 million womenare trafficked through forced marriage, another example of how trafficking is fueled by the denial of women’s autonomy. Labor trafficking is also driven by the patriarchal desire to control a woman’s career, withresearch finding thatin countries where women are excluded from the traditional economy, they are at a heightened risk of trafficking due to their economic desperation. You do not need to consider yourself to be a feminist to care about human trafficking, but you cannot be a feminist without including human trafficking in your advocacy. As a student and feminist, I call upon all Rice students and feminist groups to educate themselves about human trafficking. Local anti-trafficking leaders recommend starting with exploringlifestory.org, viewing International Justice Mission’s vast catalog ofvideo resourcesor reading Rachel Lloyd’s, a survivor of sex trafficking, powerful memoir “Girls Like Us.”. These resources are extremely helpful and will lay the foundation for your understanding of trafficking. Beyond this, when anti-trafficking legislation comes before the Texas Legislature or U.S. Congress, support it by calling your representative and scheduling meetings with them. I am currently advocating for the passing of theEARN IT Act, an anti-child sexual abuse material bill, and invite you to do the same. Even if you do not have the capacity to call your representative, you have the capacity to care. We can all modify our decisions to be more conscious of trafficking, from refusing to purchase clothes that have been made by those experiencing trafficking toabstaining from watchingpornographic videos that feature women being exploited. It is first by looking inward at our own actions that we can start to change the systems that shape trafficking. As a feminist community, I call upon us all to start talking about human trafficking, advocating for its abolition and, more than anything, to care. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month.

rice_thresher_2024_31,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/9/24 11:03pm Despite their disappointing 45-21 season-ending loss to Texas State in the First Responder Bowl, the Rice football team has reason for optimism going forward: The Owls played in their second-straight bowl game while going 4-4 in their first season as members of the American Athletic Conference. Winning their most games in a season since 2014 and defeating crosstown rivals University of Houston in the Bayou Bucket has made this season a successful one for head coach Mike Bloomgren, who has significantly turned around this football program since he arrived in 2018. In addition to football, the Owls have remained competitive in numerous other sports. Specifically, the women’s basketball team has started their season strongly, with an 8-5 overall record and a 2-0 record against conference play, good for third in the AAC. Furthermore, the women’s volleyball team also had a great season, with players Emilia Weske, Nia McCardell and Danyle Courtley being named to all-conference honors last November. The team finished 18-11 last season while also making several cameos in the NCAA top 25 rankings early in the season. Aside from their success during the season, Football has remained active in improving their roster during the offseason. Bolstering their team in areas of weaknesses, the Owls attracted three-star transfer quarterback E.J. Warner, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Kurt Warner, three-star EDGE Michael Daley and many others. Bloomgren and his coaching staff will hope that these transfers and the incoming freshman recruits can continue contributing to the Owls on the field as Rice progresses into relevancy. The new semester brings new opportunities to support our student-athletes. From free basketball games at Tudor Fieldhouse to baseball resuming in just over a month, there are a multitude of opportunities for us students to rally behind the Owls. Student attendance at games is instrumental in boosting the morale of our teams and in turn giving them a bigger chance of success. As much as our athletes have had great progress, it is up to us, as students, to show up and root for our peers.

thetech_mit_2024_10,"On April 19th, members of MIT’s Graduate Student Union–UE Local 256 (GSU democratically adopteda resolutioncalling for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the MIT community to cut all research and financial ties with the Israeli military. The resolution passed witha 70.5% yes vote, and comes on the heels of a corresponding MIT Undergraduate Associationresolutionthat received a63.7% yes vote. MIT has received over $11 million in committed research funding from the Israeli Ministry of Defense Over the past six months, the Israeli Ministry of Defense has been credibly accused of war crimes including the mass killing oftens of thousands of civilians, including children,5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors; theforcible displacement of millions; the destruction ofuniversitiesandhospitals; the slaughter of countless medical workers,journalists, andhumanitarian aid workers; and theforced starvationof an entire people. As of this writing, mass graves containing hundreds of bodies ofbound-up individualsandchildrenare being uncovered at several besieged hospitals. MIT undeniably has a hand in these atrocities. Since 2015, the Institute has received over $11 million in researchfundingfrom Israel’s Ministry of Defense, with over $1.6 million allocated for 2023 alone. These funds support projects with clear military applications including:autonomous robotic swarms(LIDS , algorithms for pursuit-evasion strategies (LIDS , underwater persistent monitoring (LIDS , andquantum fiber magnetometry(RLE . Notably, as of March 2024, one of these projects, ‘field-capable bacterial biosensors with hyperspectral reporters for remote detection of analytes of interest,’ has been processed for renewal; autonomous robotic swarms was renewed in November 2023. This information was gathered from an internal grant management tool called Kuali Coeus; general access to this has been limited once the Coalition Against Apartheid (CAA published these findings. MIT’s relationship with the Israeli military apparatus includes special programs such as the Lockheed Martin seed fund, while Elbit, a member of MIT sIndustrial Liaison Program, manufactures many of the bombs that have destroyed every one of our peer institutions in Gaza, and continue to fall on displaced people. It need not be this way. A key call of both the undergraduate and graduate resolutions, as well as theScientists Against Genocide Encampment, is an end to research collaborations with the Israeli Ministry of Defense that make the Institute complicit in ongoing atrocities. Divestment is a tried, tested, and accepted practice at MIT Such a break is not unprecedented. In May 1970, MIT cited serious concerns about its complicity in the atrocities committed by US forces in Vietnam anddivested from its own special research center—the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, which was working on guidance systems for thePoseidon missile. Just two years ago, the Institute swiftly discontinuedthe Skoltech collaborationsthe day after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These divestments were morally urgent and neither was considered a breach of academic freedom . It is we — the students, staff and faculty of MIT — who have always been crucial in curtailing any negative societal impacts of the Institute’s research. Institute Professors Noam Chomsky and Henry Kendall have consistently spoken up against MIT’s complicity in militarism through forums likeScientists Strike For PeaceandBulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In 1987, the CAA erected ashantytownon Kresge lawn to urge the MIT Corporation to divest from Apartheid South Africa. This time is not any different. Faculty, we need your support! We know from the past that divestment is possible, and that the efforts of faculty will be crucial in making it happen. We call on faculty of conscience to use your positions of influence to: 1. Cease any and all research collaboration with the Israeli military.Further, we call on you to apply pressure to the Institute and your peers to end complicity in violent technologies, and to engage in conversations with colleagues about the impacts of research projects underway at MIT—especially their role in the current assault on Gaza and the continued oppression of the Palestinian people. 2. Organize with us on the groundby joiningother allied faculty and staffand making your support known to your students, your colleagues and the administration. As seen atEmerson,Harvard,Columbia,NYU,UT AustinandYale, the support of faculty members strengthens our movement, and protects all of us as we continue to organize. 3. Uplift Palestinian institutions of knowledge, especially by helping rebuildscienceandresearchcapacity in Palestine, similarly to what MIT has done recently forUkraine. Academics in Palestine ask that we collaborate with Palestinian researchers, invite them to give talks, and engage with them like other peers around the world. They ask that we assist them in accessing publications andacademic opportunities. The future of research must be liberatory It is incumbent on us as researchers at a powerful institution to constantly confront the purpose and impact of our research: who it serves, and who it has the potential to harm. We must recognize our place in a constellation of global, grass-roots organizers working towards a future free of imperialism, racism, exploitation, militarism and all other forms of oppression. It is our responsibility to ensure that our institutions support the liberation of all people: from Palestine to the Congo to Sudan and Haiti. In a recent video to the MIT community, President Sally Kornbluth reiterated her position that there is a “distinction between what we can say—what we have a right to say—and what we should say”.There is also the question of what wemustsay. We must speak against atrocities enabled by our science. We must emphasize the urgent moral distinction between what funding we can take—and have the right to take—and what funding we should take. MIT students are resolute in our call for all faculty to reject funding from the Israeli military. We believe in the emancipatory power of science: a science that is life affirming, invested in building sustainable and equitable futures, that strives to relieve suffering for our fellow human beings. As we reflect on our vision of science as a tool of liberation, not oppression, we remind you that we are not just your students, but your eventual colleagues and successors. We are building a future for academia that we will be proud to take part in. We invite you to join us. The MIT Graduate Students for Palestine (G4P is a member of the Coalition for Palestine.

crimson_2024_83,"At Harvard, the campus belongs as much to the tourists as it does to us students. For many of us, it is routine to stop and give directions to lost tourists on our way to a morning section. We weave through crowds gathered at the John Harvard statue and restrain ourselves from warning a toddler not to touch the germ-infested statue’s foot. We temporarily adopt the role of photographer as we are asked to take photos of families in front of Widener steps, Massachusetts Hall, Weld Hall, or any red-brick building that looks remotely historic or significant. As one of the top tourist destinations in Massachusetts, Harvard draws in more than eight million tourists each year. While the abundance of tourists is profitable for the Square and the University, it harms students and Cambridge residents. A number of studies have documented that tourism can drive gentrification. It seems to be no coincidence, then, that as tourists increasingly become key clientele for local businesses, affordable shops and restaurants are closing down, only to be replaced by more expensive alternatives. In 2018, Panera Bread was replaced by Tatte, a high-end bakery. Not long after, Crema Cafe was replaced by Bluestone Lane and Pinkberry by Pressed Juicery, where a small bottle of juice will run you $7. Similarly, upscale shops like Amorino, a gelato store, and Blue Bottle Coffee have opened, catering to well-monied clientele. While corporations may reap the benefits of the Square’s growing tourism industry, locals and Harvard students — especially those without money to burn — are forced to bear the brunt of the challenges. The Square must serve two disparate groups: tourists ready to splurge on vacation and the students and residents who call Cambridge home. Unfortunately, it has become less hospitable to the latter. And while we might only blame tourism for the $13 bowls at El Jefe’s Taqueria, the continuous flow of strangers through our gates poses deeper problems. While one could always choose not to eat out, we students have much less control over our safety and privacy, which are also negatively affected by Harvard’s many tourists. Those of us who live in the Yard must worry not only about the nosy tourists that try to catch a glimpse of first-floor dorms, but also those that slip through our doors behind us. I have personally found tourists inside my entryway, either curious to get an inside look at student life or searching for a bathroom. Crime is not unheard of on campus. In 2o22 alone, the Harvard University Police Department reported 34 cases of burglary. Just this month, Yard Operations notified residents of Hollis Hall and Stoughton Hall’s first floor — all freshmen — that they would be “retrofitting the windows with grates for security reasons.” This lack of security and privacy is no doubt exacerbated by the millions of tourists walking our grounds each year. We have to question whether the benefits of Harvard’s tourism industry truly outweigh the costs. Granted,turnstiles for dormsor a drastically heightened HUPD presence in the Yard aren’t the solution. The dorms are our homes, and while we want to feel safe, draconian security measures that make them feel the opposite of homey are not the long-term answer. Instead, the University can increase campus safety by simply limiting the access tourists have to the Yard. For example, the College can reinstaterestrictions on access to the Yardfor non-Harvard affiliates at certain hours of the day. The presence of tourists is, undeniably, an ingrained part of Harvard culture, and we should be sympathetic toward them. After all, many of us were tourists here ourselves at some point. Nevertheless, as tourism puts pressure on local affordability and threatens students’ sense of security, we need to consider whether opening Harvard’s gates to all might be doing more harm than good.

ubyssey_2024_4,"April 29, 2024 Written byUbyssey Editorial Board Editorials represent the opinions of the editorial board ofThe Ubyssey.This editorial represents the opinions of the105thUbysseyeditorial boardwhose term ends April 30, 2024. On April 8, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA unanimously voted toexclude Trans womenfrom competing with other women starting August 1, 2024. We strongly condemn this policy change. The NAIA is a collegiate sports league representing 83,000 student athletes, including UBC’s baseball, golf, softball and track and field teams. The rulingstates “Only NAIA student-athletes whose biological sex is female may participate in NAIA-sponsored female sports.” According to the ruling, biological sex is defined by “distinguishing characteristics and can be supported by birth certificate or signed affidavit.” Not only is this a vague definition, it s also not inclusive of intersex athletes. The decision comes during an ongoing conversation about Trans athletes in sport, with the biggest concern being if there is a biological advantage between those assigned female at birth and those assigned male. “The NAIA supports fair and safe competition opportunities for all student-athletes,” reads the NAIA policy. Except this ruling isn’t fair. The ruling said Trans women face a “competitive advantage” in sport. But, a2022 studyby the Canadian Centre of Ethics in Sports found there is no clear advantage Trans women have over cis women. If so-called ‘fairness’ is offered at the expense of inclusion, is it actually fair? The NAIA is masking its transphobia as fairness. Trans women are not trying to take away wins from cisgender women — they are simply competing in sports. Looking solely at biological sex, or even hormones, is also not a clear indication of how well an individual will do in a given sport. Endurance athletes require different abilities than sprinters which is different from hand-eye coordination required for golfers. And if the concern is over advantages, why is the NAIA not addressing financial privilege? Access to high-quality equipment,infrastructureandsports staffis also advantageous to improved athlete performances. What makes this advantage okay? Is it really coincidental that the line of an unfair advantage is drawn at Trans women? Although the NAIA is based in the United States where28 states have active bans on Trans women in sport, reactionary transphobic views are on therisein Canada too. The reaction from some members of our UBC community on a r/UBC subreddit thread plainly demonstrates why we needed to write this editorial in the first place. One Redditor wrote “Anyone who opposes this is delusional,” while multiple others commented “good” or “W.” Transphobia is unacceptable. Additionally, as of publication time, UBC Athletics has not condemned this ruling, despiteother universities doing so. The lack of swift action from UBC Athletics to protect its student athletes and to show support for the 2SLGBTQIA+ community — for which it does duringvolleyball’s Pride Night— is incredibly disappointing. Other collegiate athletics governing bodies are not in line with this policy.U Sports’s — which all other UBC varsity sports except rowing compete under — allows transgender athletes to compete in line with either their gender identity or sex assigned at birth, just not both during the same season. TheNCAAtakes a sport-by-sport approach to account for what advantage in each sport actually means. The International Olympic Committee hasstatedit is not relying on testosterone levels to determine significant advantages amongst competitors. When other sporting bodies have stepped up, the NAIA stance is clearly a step backwards. Sports are an incredibly important resource for better physical and mental health while also providing opportunities for better resilience and community building. Trans women should not be excluded from women’s competitions. To ban them from participating sends a very strong message that Trans women are not women and that they are not welcome in sport. All athletes deserve an equal and fair opportunity to compete.

newuniversity_california_irvine_2024_7,"Chancellor Howard Gillmanreferredto May 15 as a “sad day for our university” in a statement released late Wednesday night. There was no shame behind this statement. He placed blame on the peaceful encampment in solidarity with the Palestinian genocide. Gillman, without remorse, actively took opposition to the encampment — an arguably illegal maneuver by a man who is required to be politically neutral. I rarely am shocked by UCI’s administration and their decisions — over and over again, students and faculty alike have watched administration go against the morals a supposed R1 caliber research university should uphold. UCI, just like every other alleged elite public research university, should be at the forefront of all progressive issues. Whether it is housing insecurity, labor rights, foreign policy justice, racial justice, economic inequality or any other progressive movement, UCI students must be able to freely express themselves peacefully however they please. Over the last two weeks, Gillman repeatedly proved beyond any reasonable doubt that he is not the person fit to lead this school through adversity and into prosperity. His whiny statement vilified students and set a dangerous precedent: that if students do not conform to what he feels is just, they are at risk for arrest and police brutality. In what will almost certainly go down as the darkest day in UCI’s 59 year history, Gillman turned his back on students. He allowed them to be brutalized, arrested and jailed for organizing against a genocidal regime that has spent decades committing human rights violations. The courage of the students, activists, journalists and all those on the right side of history should be commended. Against the threat of rubber bullets and batons, hundreds of people stood strong opposite of evil. The encampment protesters may have dispersed for one night and leadership may have been arrested en masse, but they will be back. Students are resilient and demonstrated more courage standing unarmed against hundreds of cops than any police officer at the encampment could’ve dreamed to show. The fight of the student organizers is a reminder that there is hope in this world for change — but it will not come from anything but persistent pressure and calculated action. Gillman is scared, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Willie Banks is scared and every other university official that has the blood of students who were assaulted by police on their hands is scared. They know what their complicity in genocide has caused at UCI. The police presence at the beginning of the encampment did not work. The lies told in the press releases and statements did not work. The suspensions given to student negotiators did not work. Now, their police raid of the encampment with multiple arrests, did not work. As police carried off a professor, her voice rang out in support of students and activists. As Dr. Tiffany Willoughby-Herard was arrested, she yelled into news microphones about how much taxpayer money was being used to silence a peaceful protest. She shouted to reporters that the potential millions of dollars of resources being used could’ve been allocated to housing, tuition and other student benefits. Willoughby-Herard is absolutely right in her call for amnesty and reinvestment in students. Her words of courage were a spark of hope during a dark time at UCI. When multiple police departments are called in to crush a peaceful student led and faculty backed protest, it is clear who is winning. What’s next, Chancellor Gillman? How will you remedy this? Will you continue to blame students and activists? This is a stain on your legacy, and it will follow you for the rest of your academic career and life. You sign off every nasty statement you send to students and staff with “Fiat Lux”, Latin for “Let There Be Light”. Until you step down as chancellor of this once proud university, there will be no light at UC Irvine. Jacob Ramos is a 2023-2024 Opinion Editor. He can be reached atjacobtr@uci.edu.

crimson_2024_95,"To the student protesters barred from graduating on time: We are sorry. We are senior faculty members who served as your advisors while you underwent investigation by the Harvard College Administrative Board. Some of us encouraged you to accept terms of an agreement to end the encampment, and we all encouraged you to cooperate with the Ad Board and its recommendations. We offered this advice because, with a combined 69 years at Harvard, we trusted the administration to act in good faith and to adhere to the values it claims to uphold and has previously demonstrated. We never imagined that Harvard administrators would punish peaceful protesters in such an extraordinary way: suspension, probation, and, in at least 13 cases, denial of an on-time graduation. Interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote to the encamped students that he would “encourage the administrative boards or other disciplinary bodies within the schools to address cases expeditiously under existing precedent and practice (including taking into account where relevant the voluntary decision to leave the encampment , for all students, including those students eligible thereafter to graduate so that they may do so.” We read President Garber’s language as a clear commitment to having seniors graduate on time. We believed the administration would respect past precedent in sanctioning student protesters.As two of us havewritten previously, Harvard has consistently employed restraint and forbearance in dealing with peaceful protests in the post-Vietnam era. We spoke with activists from four student movements — the 1986 anti-Apartheid encampment, the 2001 Living Wage occupation of Mass Hall, the 2011 Occupy encampment, and the 2015 Divest Harvard occupation of Mass. Hall — and not one could recall a case in which a student was suspended, had to lose a scholarship, or was prevented from graduating. In fact, we found no instances in which students faced any significant punishment at all. Given decades of precedent and the Ad Board’s stated commitment to pedagogical, rather than judicial, goals, we believed the College would not impose disproportionate penalties on you. Surely the College would not jeopardize our students’ careers over a peaceful protest. Most of all, we believed that Harvard would prioritize the well-being of its most precious asset: its students. And you are not just any students: Several are seniors set to graduate with honors. The group includes two Rhodes Scholars and a prestigious Harvard-UK fellowship winner. Accordingly, when Ad Board members recommended that you forgo appearing before the Board to defend yourselves in-person to accelerate the proceedings, we saw it as a good-faith effort to expedite the process and allow you to graduate. We encouraged you to comply. We were devastated to learn that we were wrong. You, graduating seniors, have fulfilled every requirement for a Harvard degree. If not for the capricious actions of the Ad Board, you would be leaving the University in a matter of days with that degree in hand. Even a successful appeal of the Ad Board’s decision would delay your degree conferral, causing significant disruption to your lives, plans, and prospects in the meantime. You are the best of Harvard: talented, hard-working, and principled young people with a deep commitment to public service. Rather than focusing narrowly on your own careers, you’ve engaged with the most pressing crises of our world. You are precisely the kind of student the College aspires to foster. Yet, by failing to live up to its values, Harvard failed you. It also failed us, by misleading us into participating in a procedurally compromised and unduly punitive disciplinary process. We and many other faculty members feel betrayed, and we know you do, too. The Ad Board’s bad-faith actions have damaged something that is essential for our great University to fulfill its mission: trust among faculty, students, and administrators. We hope our leaders have the courage to repair it — immediately. Ryan D. Enos is a professor of Government. Alison Frank Johnson is a professor of History.

rice_thresher_2024_4,"ByMegan McDonald3/26/24 10:59pm Editor’s Note: This is a guest opinion that has been submitted by a member of the Rice community. The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. I’m hungry. Oh wait… …the serveries are closed. …no third parties are open. …I forgot to pack lunch today. …pasta is the only vegetarian option, again. …I don’t want water chicken three days in a row. …I ran out of Tetra. …Rice Village is too far and too expensive. …the shopping shuttle only operates on Saturdays. …going off campus will take too long. …getting Chaus isn’t feasible between classes. Rice students have lots to say about access to food while on and around campus. Rice’s unique foodscape lives and breathes the school’s motto of unconventional wisdom by helping accommodate a diverse group of students. But to a certain extent, it could benefit from a taste of conventional wisdom. Implementing other universities’ foodscape features at Rice would benefit our students. I began researching Rice’s foodscape last semester in Research Methods (SOCI 381 with Dr. Considine. This semester I continued the research by comparing Rice’s foodscape to those of other Texas universities. I traveled to Texas Christian University, Texas A&M University - College Station, University of Texas at Austin, and Texas Southern University to understand student experiences and to tour their foodscapes. When I started the fieldwork, I quickly realized the extent of Rice administration’s control over our university’s foodscape. Though not widely perceived among the student body, Rice is situated completely in alow-access food desert(as designated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service . Therefore, Rice serveries profit by being the key provider of food to students on campus. Being the only player in the market, Rice is a price setter. The university requires all on campus students to purchase Meal Plan Awhich has a weekly meal plan price that is 21% higher than the national average.Students are not only forced to pay high prices by market economics, but also by pure university policy. Rice’s monopoly on the foodscape allows them to charge high prices across campus. Rice’s use of Tetra can be compared to mining companies perpetuating cycles of poverty. Fixing prices and costs in an old mining town mirrors artificial subsidization of student-run businesses at Rice. While Tetra has its perks, it is not meeting its full potential. Most campuses I visited had a form of Tetra thatcould be used at local businesses off campus;even meal swipes could be used at on campus third-party providers. By only artificially subsidizing on campus food options, the university disincentivizes students from venturing out of the Rice foodscape, keeping profits within the hedges. The crux of the matter lies in the degree of centralized power each university administration possesses in its foodscape. At the universities I visited, students exercised some freedom in their on campus food choices between university sponsored and third party providers. At Rice, university-sponsored and third-party providers are one and the same. The administration influences operations and policies at serveries and third parties alike. Students merely have the illusion of choice. On top of that, no third party chains operate at Rice, which makes serveries the only option. It appears that the sole purpose of these top-down policies is to protect Rice’s precious serveries. Rice invested too much money for them to fail, so the administration fixed the market to ensure their own success. Rice must adapt to support students, but adapt in what way? Take a bite from the other universities’ foodscapes by welcoming independent third-party operators on campus, a strategy that Rice students support. In an impromptu MEOS 404 focus group, of 14 Rice students tasked with creating an additional food provider at Rice, an overwhelming majority (approximately 90% favored a third party chain over another servery. Rice students have spoken. Diversify the foodscape. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like.

rice_thresher_2024_27,"ByThresher Editorial Board1/23/24 9:40pm As this year’s Student Association election cycle officially begins in early February, let’s not forget last year’suncontested slate of candidatesand the“Dilf Hunter” write-in campaign. The student body’s dissatisfaction with the SA has been clear, with many even calling for change in the way the SA operates, or questioning the allocation of theircurrent resources elsewhere. If you’re one of the many jaded about the SA, we pose a question: Why not run for SA yourself? Despite sometimes common belief, the SA has, in past and recent years, done actual, important work for the student body. Many of the resolutions the SA has passed have been unanimous and contributed greatly to improvement of student life. In November 2023, theyallocated $2,000to the Student Success Initiative’s pantry. In 2020, SA leaders helpedinitiate the servery meal swipe donation program, which has now grown to provide over8,000 meal swipes to students. Theyintroduced the munch meal period and expanded dining hoursacross the serveries. The SA has even passed resolutions on more controversial — but pressing — topics. On Dec. 4, 2023,a resolution was passedaffirming support for the Rice University Faculty Statement of Solidarity with Palestinians. In March 2022, the SA passed a resolutiondenouncing the statementsof Rice swim coach Seth Huston regarding the participation of transgender students in college-level sports. And, in November 2021, it was SA that lobbied torelocate the Founder’s Memorialin the academic quad, contributing to thestatue’s ultimate removal. Regardless of whether you agree with some of these resolutions, their importance is obvious — they give students a voice. Use yours, too. We also want to commend Solomon Ni, who announced his resignation as SA president on Jan. 22. During Ni’s time as SA treasurer, he was vital in drafting a resolution to make the2024 Election Day non-instructional, which was eventually passed by the Faculty Senate. They helpedimplement changes to the Survey of All Studentsto gather student feedback on off-campus housing and personal finance and completely rebranded the SA. Despite Ni’s resignation, we believe his tenure is a testament to changes students are capable of making. There’s also been a significant amount of student activism on campus the past few years.We’ve found that it kind of works. At the core of many of these moves in activism is the SA and the passionate student leaders that participate in the organization. This coming year is a chance to keep that momentum going — but only if the student body cares. Once upon a time, we did. Elections used to be far more contested than they are now — and contested elections will be key in getting more students attentive to this election cycle. There even used to bedrama within SA elections. Maybe it’s time we bring that back. While the SA doesn’t always make decisions the entire student body can agree with, they do always make decisions. If you want to be a part of making this difference, or even stop other people from making a difference, consider running for SA this year.

crimson_2024_4,"Over the past two months, Congress has shown strong interest in intervening in Harvard’s governance. On Dec. 5, then-Harvard President Claudine Gaytestified beforethe House Committee on Education and the Workforce about the University’s efforts to address alleged antisemitism on campus. Later, the Housepassed a resolutioncondemning her responses to a line of questioning about what speech may violate Harvard’s conduct policies. Then, the committeebegan investigatingallegations of plagiarism against the former president. The committee’s chair, Rep. Virginia A. Foxx (R-N.C. ,requested a sweeping collectionof materials, including “any non-public guidelines or policies” about plagiarism and potentially sensitive information about students and faculty disciplined for academic integrity violations. Following Gay’s resignation, Foxxgave Harvard two weeksto produce what could amount to thousands of documents about alleged antisemitism; Jewish enrollment; foreign donations; diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; student and employee discipline; and internal communications between Havard’s leaders. This pattern of congressional interest in Harvard is hardly new. Over the summer, after Harvard lost its affirmative actionSupreme Court case, barring it from practicing race-conscious admissions, U.S. Senator J.D. Vance (R-Ohio wrote to all Ivy League schools asserting that their reactions to the Court’s ruling may be unlawful. He threatened Senate investigations and demanded answers to several questions about their new admissions processes. But that’s not all. The Department of Education isinvestigating Harvard’s useof legacy and donor admissions preferences to determine whether they racially discriminate. The Department is alsoinvestigating Harvard’s responseto alleged antisemitic harassment to determine whether the University discriminated against Jewish students. What do all these interventions have in common? In each instance, Harvard’s federal funding has been the government’s leverage. The Constitution does not give Congress unconditional authority to regulate private universities. That’s why many laws that regulate universities apply only to schools that accept federal funds — includingTitle VIof the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the basis of Harvard’s affirmative action case. Moreover, Congress can threaten to revoke its funding to motivate universities to take actions that are not legally required, such as complying with requests to provide documents. Reasonable people can disagree about how Harvard should govern itself. But I believe that many more people can unite behind the idea that preserving universities’ independence from government control is key to maintaining a healthy education system in a robust democracy. That’s why Harvard should give up its federal dollars. According to Harvard’smost recent financial report, federal funds account for about an eighth of the University’s revenue, and this comprises 66 percent of Harvard’s research funding. A much smaller piece of federal funding supports financial aid — less than six percent of Harvard students’ aid. Thus, forgoing federal funds would not come without costs. Harvard would have to scale back some research projects. But the costs are likely to be smaller than one might think. Harvard could direct funds to its most promising projects, and in the past, it has successfully replaced federal funding through private sources. In 2001, when then-President George W. Bush severely limited federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research, Harvard researcher Douglas A. Meltonsecured private fundingto continue that research. Harvard is probably the best-positioned university in the country to eschew federal financing.At nearly $51 billion, its endowment value is the largest for any university endowment in the country. Moreover, Harvard receives the most private donations of any American university – nearly $1.4 billion last year. Debates about how Harvard should operate will continue — but they are made far more polarizing when the federal government is involved. Without federal funding, Harvard would be free to craft its own policies concerning free speech, admissions, and other issues, regardless of loud critics. But these critics could not say that their tax dollars are supporting those practices. Political polarization is tightening its grip on Harvard, but the University is not helpless. It’s time for Harvard to free itself from ballooning congressional intervention by ditching federal funds. Jacob P. Winter ’24 is an Economics concentrator in Leverett House."
stanforddaily_2024_6,"Some people haveputit bluntly: If you follow organized religion, you must be deluding yourself, living with severe cognitive dissonance or cherry picking to only accept ideas that make you feel comfortable. You are either notreallyintellectual or notreallyreligious — you must belackingin one or both of those areas. “As for what little religious belief remains among their colleagues, most professional philosophers regard it as a strange aberration among otherwise intelligent people,” wrote John Messerly for the Richard Dawkins Foundation. Of course, I’m not saying all atheists think this. There have been many prominent atheist thinkers like the“four horsemen” of New Atheismwho debated religious thinkers while showing respect for the latter’s intellectual engagement and capacity to make arguments, even if they disagreed on the validity of those arguments. However, it’s not surprising why some nonreligious people think that religious people are anti-intellectual. There is a clear trend of anti-intellectualism, especially in the last decade, among some subsets of American Christians. Many Christians embraceQAnon conspiracy theories. Many refused to getCOVID vaccines. They vehementlyattackleading U.S. universities for “spreading the woke agenda” and say universities serve anet negativefor society. Not only does this behavior lead many nonreligious people to believe that Christianity is incompatible with intellectualism, but many Christiansalsoseem to believe that. Theycite Christian faithas a leading motivator behind anti-intellectual actions like why they believe in conspiracy theories and despise universities. A vocal minority There’s a dissonance between the behavior of extreme, anti-intellectual Christians in the news versus what I and many Christians who live quiet lives outside national news coverage believe. It is unacceptable for church leaders and members to use a Christian rationale to justify actions like the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. I would describe QAnon conspiracy theories as a “Pseudo-Christian Extremist Movement,” to borrow the words from the Global Network on Extremism & Technology. This brand of anti-intellectualism is a manifestation of some Christians’ arrogance and complacency of thought, which contradict values taught in the Bible. I think many of these extremist Christians are a product of “cultural Christianity.” While people use this term tomean a wide range of ideas, I am using it to describe individuals (usually a subset of people raised Christian from birth , who have not rigorously examined their faith but identify as “Christian” because they identify with the aesthetic and cultural practices of Christianity, rather than holding genuine faith. I feel that extreme, anti-intellectual Christians uplift cultural homogeneity and a desire to feel superior to others above genuine, introspective belief in God and Jesus. They seem unwilling to grapple with the relationship between knowledge and living a Christian life. They seem to choose the comfort of culturally and spiritually stagnant environments over deep inquiry. I have always known Christians of all ages and nationalities who love intellectual curiosity and thrive both in the classroom and in church. But the older I became, the more disparities I noticed between the Christians I know and the angry, radical believers portrayed in attention-grabbing news. I also felt that I had to turn to the Internet to ask questions about Bible and Christian life. Before I came to college, it was rare to come across pastors who proactively dove deep into Christian theology topics during their sermons. I worry that Christians, especially young Christians living in homogenous environments, will feel pressured to give up their curious mind because of anti-intellectual Christians’ rejection of contemporary thought and well-established science. I also worry that nonreligious people will stop conversing with Christian people (and perhaps religious people at large, by extension because they deem religious people to be incapable of intellectual curiosity. Many Christians couple faith with intellectual inquiry It is a myth that religious belief entails flimsy intellectual inquiry.Much has already been writtenabout how earlier eras in Christian history featured a robust intellectual tradition. Martin Luther, Thomas Aquinas, Søren Kierkegaard and Saint Augustine are among the Christian pioneers whose scholarship has earned them respect in nonreligious and Christian domains alike. Many prominent US research universitieshave divinity schools offering graduate degrees, including Yale, Duke, Harvard, and University of Chicago. These programs of study oftenrequirecourseson Biblical language, systematic theology and Christian ethics. There are already many Christians in the Stanford community who have brilliant scholarly achievements and also publicly discuss their faith.Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who was raised as Muslim then became aprominent atheist intellectualand Dutch parliament member,converted to Christianity publiclyin 2023. She is now aresearch fellowat the Hoover Institution.Donald Knuth, a professor emeritus of computer science, creator of the TeX typesetting system, and winner of the A. M. Turing award, has writtenmultiplebooksabout hisChristian beliefand gave a lecture series in MIT about faith and science. The above scholars all characterize their personal faith on different terms, and they sometimes make competing claims about how to interpret and apply Christianity to life. Countless scholars throughout history have applied their intellectual curiosity not just to their academic pursuits, but also to their Christian faith. How I approach my Christian faith from an intellectual perspective In the last few years, using my intellectual curiosity to dive deep into my Christian beliefs has given me an expanded sense of faith with greater fulfillment than ever before. My endeavor of studying Christian theology and practicing Christianity will be a work in progress for the rest of my life. By no means is this the “ideal” or “comprehensive” way. However, I believe there is value in sharing about the efforts I and other curious Christians make to rigorously examine our faith. My approach and habits evolve over time to reflect new ideas I get from conversing with believers and nonbelievers. First, I study history and context beyond the words written in the Bible. I ask pastors and discuss with other churchgoers about which editions of the Bible include helpful, robust supplementary research and commentary about who wrote each book of the Bible, how the manuscript was discovered, and what language it was written in. I read essays comparing various English translations of the Bible and the unique methods and motivations behind each. Some Bibles feature extensive annotations diving into the grammar of the original languages (Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and the variety of interpretations that can arise from alternate translations. There is also a rich offering of Christian books which have resonated with non-Christians and Christians alike. Writers like C.S. Lewis, Tim Keller, and John Piper have published extensive essays and books advising how to wrestle with and how to apply Biblical lessons to life, spanning topics as diverse as suffering, grief after death of family, marriage and forgiveness. Scholars and pastors are also adapting to contemporary media. I watchYouTube videosand podcasts explaining the Bible and Christian life. I also enjoy exploring how Christianity intersects with modern American politics, art, media, and interpersonal relationships. I’ve watched movies like Martin Scorsese’s “Silence,” Terrence Malick’s “The Tree of Life,” and Paul Schrader’s “First Reformed — allacclaimedby Christians and non-Christians alike. There has been asurge of Substack newsletterswriting about Christianity. Finally, I talk to other Christians, atheists and people who follow different religions. One of the values Jesus emphasized most is humility, and I strive to implement that value in my intellectual life in addition to my personal life. My ethos of intellectual curiosity involves curiosity, challenging and wrestling with claims and lines of reasoning, flexible thinking and respect for people who put in the same effort. I hope that my nonreligious peers can come to understand and appreciate Christianity’s deep intellectual tradition, even if they don’t agree with its conclusions. And, I encourage more Christians to live up to that tradition and examine their own belief. You’ll probably find it more rewarding than you expect.

crimson_2024_56,"I forget how many people make Cambridge their home, that is, until the sun comes out. We emerge in droves, seeking the sun’s supple rays, hoping to grab and let them spill through our fingers like liquid gold. *** On Monday, instead of chasing the path of totality alongside tens of thousands of eager New Englanders, I decided to explore Cambridge alone. I started in the park outside of Peet’s Coffee. I managed to snag one of the picnic tables before the gaggles of eclipse-seekers infiltrated the small green space. A musician played the guitar in front of me, resting his instrument every few minutes to look up at the shadowed sun. Without eclipse glasses, his wrinkled hands shaded his squinted eyes. A girl noticed and approached the man with outstretched hands. I thought she was going to give him a dollar, but she handed him her glasses instead. I saw the musician’s lips softly shape the words “thank you.” I headed back to my dorm for a quick work call, running into a friend along the way. She lent me her glasses, and I looked to the sky for the first time that day. The sun was a fiery sliver of bronze against the glasses’ black, translucent film; its mouth was curled in a soft smile. The rest of the walk back to my dorm felt like a dream. Little pockets of people dotted the Cambridge landscape. Everywhere I looked, people stood in clusters, gazing up in wonder, unable to stop themselves from giddily laughing with those around them. I watched as onlookers traded and bartered eclipse glasses and exclamations of awe — currency transcended the U.S. dollar. After my call, I made my way towards the river. The moon slowly moved, and the sky became less and less overcast. Warmth returned to the sun’s rays. I sat at my second rickety picnic table that day and began to write about how much I valued being alone. While lines of cars snaked through the countryside, picnics were planned, champagne bottles popped, and the sun and moon engaged in their hypnotic dance, I sat alone, in the liminal space I had carved out of the buzz. I was reminded of my freshman year, when Covid-19 restrictions curtailed virtually all forms of in-person interaction. At the time, any residual solitude felt like a social regression, an erosion of what this “college thing” was supposed to be. Sophomore year brought House life and roommates and legal gatherings of over four people — campus was battered by the unrelenting waves of a roiling social ocean, and we all craved participation in the chaotic spontaneity. Saying no to a plan, then, felt impossible, because we had been forced to do exactly that for months. We couldn’t bear to waste any more of the “best years of our lives.” Alone time became stigmatized, as college was meant to be experienced, not necessarily processed. God, it was glorious — trashing our bodies for the sake of memories that ended up half-forgotten. That was how I spent my first two years here, teetering between the poles of social ecstasy and isolation. I seized moments of connection and clutched onto them like my life depended on it. That is no longer how I feel. I no longer stew in weekly, ritualized anxiety. Over the span of seven semesters, I went from worrying if I’d see anyone in a week to weekends that started on Wednesday, brimming with plans. I now swim in the social ocean, treading water with ease and excitement, and I will miss it, dearly, when we all say goodbye in two months. I have built a beautiful network of friendships, and it — in the spirit of dialectical reciprocity — has built me. But, just as moments of socializing were rare freshman year, moments alone are even rarer senior year. And so, Monday was precious, sacred even, colored in the same anomalistic joy those first social interactions freshman year were. As peers huddled together, their eyes searching the sky, my mind grew weary of its own company. Frankly, this didn’t bother me — it was exhaustion well-earned. *** I end my journey on the steps of Memorial Church. The building envelopes me in a warm embrace, and somehow, the complexities of my relationship withthe structureand all thatit representsmelt away. I turn my gaze to the scene before me, the final residue of the eclipse. The sun is setting, and my fingers are cold and brittle. People still mill about, walking in crisscross patterns across Tercentenary Theater while others play spikeball or enjoy the company of their friends, lounging with interlocking limbs on picnic blankets. The sun bathes Sever Hall in golden light, and the red bricks look like they are on fire. Ellie H. Ashby ’24, a Crimson Editorial Comp Director, is a Social Studies concentrator in Adams House."
crimson_2024_110,"For many of us faculty members, these past few months have culminated in a series of superlative highs, wrought with a flurry of seemingly endless lows. We’ve endured the whipsaw experience of the great hopes for Claudine Gay’s presidency, fierce controversy on how to address antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus, the dispiriting political morass of congressional hearings, Gay’s ultimate resignation, and a series of targeted plagiarism charges against high-profile faculty and senior staff, particularly Black women. Even today, we continue to grapple withongoing student protestsagainst Israel’s conduct in its war on Hamas. In light of these matters, two constant threads characterize my discussions with faculty in the social sciences and humanities. First, there is an acute sense that Harvard has not put forward an effective narrative about the real tenor and nature of scholarly activity, teaching, or the vibrant character of day-to-day life on campus. And, second, many are profoundly concerned that too many important University decisions emerge without faculty understanding or input. Faculty have made their message clear: Governance at Harvard must change. I wholeheartedly agree. But I reject the notion that such change should include the formation of afaculty senate. I say this as someone who has held tenured faculty appointments at three other institutions with longstanding faculty senate structures, and who has served on two of them. Let’s be frank on three points: First, no one joins the Harvard faculty to spend their time serving on a slate of faculty senate committees. Second, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences enjoys a privileged position in University life, with the College as the acknowledged heart of the institution. I could not possibly imagine this status being preserved under a University-wide senate structure. Finally, Harvard’s selectivity has historically been a critical element in its incredible vitality and preeminence. In my experience, structures such as a faculty senate are consensus-seeking and prioritize an eventual regression to the mean, rather than a fidelity to seeking true excellence. In our current moment of apparent crisis, FAS faculty understandably want and deserve three things: greater voice in key policy decision-making; increased transparency in the processes and rationale behind major policy decisions; and elevated accountability of top leadership, especially the Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing board. It is not clear that these goals would be well served by a faculty senate. There are more effective means of accomplishing these ends without requiring the creation of a vast bureaucratic structure that would demand an enormous amount of already sorely taxed faculty time. Many alternative changes to current rules and practices are worth considering. For one, now that the dean of FAS — not the president — chairs FAS meetings, faculty can more effectively articulate their concerns within these gatherings. We should seize this opportunity to have our voices heard. Instead of a faculty senate, the Corporation should formalize avenues of communication with the faculty by adding several ex officio positions for them on the Corporation, with FAS always assured at least one such seat. The academic leadership council — a body of Harvard’s academic deans and other University leaders — should also be empowered to call for the removal of one or more members of the Corporation in a three-fourths vote. We should not let the traumas of recent months lead us down an unnecessary, ineffective, and potentially counterproductive path. The basic structure of governance at this University has served its stakeholders — faculty, students, staff, alumni, the surrounding community, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and indeed the nation and our richly diverse world — very well over a remarkably long stretch of time. We should tamper with that time-tested structure reluctantly and only after the most careful deliberation. Wide internal consultation, carefully-paced reflection, and caution are crucially important here. As we embark upon such a process, we should insist on a laser-sharp focus on the outcomes we wish to achieve. Unlike several of my fellow faculty members whom I deeply respect, I do not believe a faculty senate, however designed, is the surest path to achieve the outcomes that matter most in light of recent unsettling events. A variety of intermediate steps might better promote transparency, leadership accountability, and faculty voice in decision-making that we want and deserve. Let us not be seduced by a slogan or model for which there is at best weak evidence of general efficacy — much less any evidence of clear suitability for an institution of Harvard’s well-earned and time-tested preeminence. Lawrence D. Bobo is Dean of Social Science and the W. E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard University."
thetech_mit_2024_3,"We write this statement as Jewish alumni who have been disappointed by the administration’s handling of the Scientists Against Genocide Encampment (SAGE and related protests on campus. There have been numerous statements in support of SAGE participants already, yet we felt the need to add the perspective of Jewish alumni who see great harm being done to MIT’s Jewish community. We are proud of our Jewish heritage. A heritage encompassing a beautiful diversity of religious practices, other intersecting identities, andyes:adiversity of views on the State of Israel. We are frustrated and concerned by the way the MIT administration has ignored and erased this diversity, weighing some Jewish perspectives far more heavily than others. This is in part due to institutional bias—much of the infrastructure for the MIT Jewish community, such as MIT Hillel and the MIT Israel Alliance, has mobilized in support of the State of Israel. We demand the MIT administration think critically about systemic power imbalances and recognize that the perspectives of MIT Jews for Ceasefire (J4C are no less valid because they lack this infrastructure. We have heard directly from J4C students how their input has been repeatedly excluded from campus initiatives regarding discourse on anti-Semitism and the situation in Israel/Palestine. Administrators’ capitulation to the notion of legitimate and illegitimate Jewish voices is incredibly dangerous and has already caused harm to Jewish students on campus. We have been heartbroken hearing pro-Palestinian Jews’ experiences of harassment at MIT. There are many reports of pro-Israel demonstrators taunting Jewish SAGE participants as “self-hating” and “not real Jews.” Pro-Israel demonstrators saying encampment members, again including Jews, should be raped, murdered, and traded as hostages. These behaviors are despicable, yet there have been zero public consequences or even acknowledgment from MIT leaders. J4C is engaging in an authentic and passionate movement grounded in their Judaism, not in spite of it. We see them carrying on the Jewish organizing tradition ofdoikayt, Yiddish for ‘hereness.’ American activist Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz described it as “the right to be, and to fight for justice, wherever we are…across lines that might divide us, to work together for universal equality and justice” 1 . We wonder: where on campus can these students observe and explore their faith tradition communally? For many of us, years ago, Hillel and Chabad at MIT were critical parts of our Jewish experience at MIT. If we were students today, however, we do not believe we would be welcome there. Jewish students and other community members at MIT who do not support the Israeli government and military have no Jewish home on campus. And they are not alone: a recentNew York Times articlequoted a student from Columbia University saying “a rabbi at Hillel…told her that Hillel wasn’t supposed to be a resource for Jewish students who don’t support Israel” 2 .We are deeply troubled by so many universities providing consideration and protection for Jewish students who hold certain political positions but not others. We, as pro-ceasefire alumni, and students of J4C,aremembers of MIT’s Jewish community as well, whose voices deserve recognition. We call on administrators not to ignore the experiences of Jewish students like this one, submitted among letters to theAlliance of Concerned Faculty, “It is challenging to be Jewish now at MIT not because I feel personally unsafe, but because my identity is being invoked to make arguments and policy that I often do not agree with” 3 . We know MIT leadership takes charges of anti-Semitism seriously and that they face internal and external pressure to address these charges. With this in mind, we encourage them to engage seriously and thoughtfully withALLJewish community members, including those standing in solidarity with Palestinians."

stanforddaily_2024_24,"As health professional students, staff, faculty, and alumni across Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford Health Care, and Stanford Children’s Health, we support establishing the strongest possible guardrails in the University’s relationship with the fossil fuel industry. Our support for these guardrails stems from our extensive historical experience in medicine with the role of unchecked industry influence on honest scientific inquiry. Climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels is also profoundly a crisis of health and equity. Without guardrails, the University essentially signals to the fossil fuel industry that business as usual is acceptable. Business as usual is already harming the health of our patients and communities, and stands to grow worse without a significant course correction in our emissions. Climate change is thegreatest threat to global health of the 21st century. The science is clear: we need a rapid transition off fossil fuels to avert the worst impacts of climate change and to protect our health and our future. We are already seeing more pregnant individuals experiencingpremature birthdue to extreme heat exposure, more children arriving withrespiratory complaintsfrom poor air quality days, more episodes ofcardiovascular eventslike strokes and heart attacks from bothheatand wildfires, and a worsening mental health crisis in partdriven by climate changeand understandable concern about the future. All of these health impacts are deeply inequitable. In the United States theymost impactlow-income communities and communities of color. Globally they most impact the developing countries which did the least to contribute to the problem. Pollution from fossil fuels (e.g., exhaust from cars and trucks, emissions from gas stoves is also a significant source of air pollution that is making our patients sick right now. Twenty percent of premature deaths globally — that’s 1 in 5 — are attributable to exposure to air pollution caused bycombustion of fossil fuels. This pollutiondisproportionately affectspoorer communities and Black and Hispanic communities, contributing to the long history of environmental racism in the U.S. The fossil fuel industry continues to slow progress on climate solutions and to sow doubt about climate change. The State of California recentlyfiled a lawsuitagainst Chevron, Exxon, BP, ConocoPhillips, and Shell cataloging how long industry leaders have known about the dangers of fossil fuels, how these companies suppressed this information from the public and policy-makers, and how they have historically and continue to fund misinformation campaigns to slow the transition off fossil fuels. As the Doerr School of Sustainability seeks to fulfill its mission of developing “high-impact solutions to pressing planetary challenges”, accepting funding from fossil fuel companies will stymie rather than facilitate this aim. As health professionals, we’ve seen a very similar situation before with Big Tobacco, which heavily influenced research to achieve pro-industry results prior to the enactment of strict regulations and guardrails. When the science became clear on the links between tobacco and lung cancer, Big Tobacco engaged in a campaignto cast doubt on the science. The same is true for the pharmaceutical industry, where evidence shows that pharmaceutical industryfundingof clinical researchers is strongly associated with pro-industry results as well as evidence of trial design and publication bias. Companies like Exxonfollowed a similar playbook. This likely occurs throughmultiple mechanisms, including subtle favoritism and overt “ghost management” of studies. If the Doerr School accepts funding from the fossil fuel industry without guardrails, history has taught that industry interests will prevail over the mission of the school to solve the climate crisis. With the future existence of humanity itself on the line, we must ensure every dollar spent toward seeking solutions for the climate crisis is used in an ethical and productive manner. To protect health, we supportthe plan for basic guardrailsforwarded by six graduate students at Stanford who have varying opinions on industry dollars but agree that rules should be in place to protect the integrity of research. At a minimum, this requires ensuring that companies who provide research dollars are adhering to credible transition plans off fossil fuels, are making the data for their transition transparent and available, and are not engaging in or funding anti-renewable or misinformation campaigns. Big Oil companies have stated that they stand ready to address the crisis. We have the ability to hold them to their promises by not providing false cover in the form of academic partnerships with elite institutions like Stanford. If we are to solve the climate crisis and protect the health of this generation and the generations to come, we need to act with a clear moral compass on the path forward. We call on leaders at Stanford to act, understanding that the health of current and future generations is on the line.

state_press_2024_5,"It s all the same. The things that protect us, that intervene in our lives physically and emotionally, we should be able to have access to those things. Last week s Arizona Supreme Court decision demonstrates that the fight for access to safe abortions cannot be reactionary, and advocates have to be proactive to defend the safety and autonomy of women. On April 9, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that an 1864 anti-abortion law could come back into effect. This law, which passed before women had the right to vote in America, would criminalize medical professionals who offer abortions. The sole exception is if the mother s life is at risk. This law has been on the books for over a century but was kept at bay by the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision, which protected abortion access at the national level. When the courts reversed their decision in 2022, the legal battle began in Arizona to bring back the 1864 law. While the Supreme Court s ruling revives the 1864 near-total ban, I will not let overzealous county attorneys take this as an opportunity to target any individual. As long as I am Governor, no Arizonan will be prosecuted by extremist county attorneys for seeking abortion care. Roe v. Wade was a monumental success in the fight for access to safe abortions, but overturning that single Supreme Court decision led to awave of anti-abortion laws. It s easy to understand that with foresight now, but it was a mistake not to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. Lexsiri Coronado is a junior at ASU studying English literature and a steering committee member for the Phoenix branch of theParty for Socialism and Liberation. She is one of many women disappointed in the Democratic party for not enshrining abortion access in federal law. In 2022, when the Democrats had the Senate, they had the House, and they also had Joe Biden and the presidency, Coronado said. They didn t codify Roe v. Wade, they didn t do anything to protect women s rights. They didn t put pressure on the Supreme Court when they could. The reliance on the Roe v. Wade decision harmed Arizona women, too. The state legislature had passed a law allowing abortions before a 15-week deadline. But, because the 1864 law was still on the books, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that it should be implemented instead. Rep. Stephanie Stahl Hamiltonbrought a bill to repeal the lawearlier this year, but it did not receive a committee hearing. Leaving the 1864 law on the books, especially after the Roe v. Wade decision in the 70s, was a massive oversight. It left a future bomb that abortion advocates now have to defuse to protect the health and safety of women. But this moment can also be a learning opportunity. We have now seen the consequences of protecting abortion with just one ruling and centering laws around that one ruling. Now, there is an opportunity to rebuild abortion access in its most potent form. Here at ASU, there are already students building their ideal future for abortion access. Abortion should not be seen differently than ... other aspects of healthcare, Coronado said. It s all the same. The things that protect us, that intervene in our lives physically and emotionally, we should be able to have access to those things. As a member of the PSL, Coronado organizes protests, holds educational events and uses social media to spread information and awareness. A post shared by PSL Phoenix (@pslphoenixaz For her, this issue is both political and deeply personal. I found myself in a situation where I did have to have an abortion because I was in a predatory relationship, Coronado said. I got pregnant, and I had to have my abortion in isolation. Coronado explained that experiencing an abortion alone is risky because she had to monitor her blood loss to ensure she was not losing a dangerous amount. A support system could have helped her monitor this while giving her time to rest and recuperate. When building the future of abortion access, this is something to consider — there can be a preemptive effort to give women support systems if they do experience an abortion. Notably, support systems are far more difficult to maintain when abortion is criminalized, as it often forces women to seek unsafe abortions orprocedures in different states. Right now, the immediate goal should be to restore basic access. In Arizona, this may be by repealing the 1864 law or byvoting two Arizona Supreme Court justicesout in November. But this is also an opportunity to look further into the future and rebuild a system that avoids the mistakes made previously. For example, abortion access could be considered part of a more holistic approach to reproductive health practices. Devils in the Bedroomis a club at ASU that shares resources and information for safer sex practices. A member of their board is Bee O Callaghan, a junior studying psychology. She explained how abortion and sex education are inherently linked. People are saying that people who get abortions are doing it because they re not being responsible whenever they re having sex, O Callaghan said. That s not the case. They just don t know sometimes that if (for example you put a condom in a car, it can deteriorate. If people are more educated about sex, and especially if the topic is less stigmatized, they can make more informed decisions. Abortion is already an immensely personal and challenging decision; it makes sense that women should be educated and empowered with sex education before even having to consider the choice. We should start talking about consent and boundaries when we re toddlers or very young children, said O Callaghan. If you can have bodily autonomy right from the get-go, then you can have safer sex practices. Sex education is still just one piece in a more holistic understanding of abortion access and sexual health. People with uteri often need access to supplies. Luckily, this is where Devils in the Bedroom can be a resource for students on the Tempe and West Valley campuses. DITB offersPeer-to-Peer Distributionof sexual health supplies, including emergency contraception, menstrual supplies, and condoms for free. The (emergency contraception pack we give is about $100 anywhere else, O Callaghan said. The Plan B pill is roughly $30 to $50. We give two because they should not have to worry about it at all. READ MORE:Devils in the Bedroom destigmatizes sexual education, focuses on creating safe space PSL and DITB are community groups that are deep in the work to rebuild abortion access as a matter of healthcare and safety. However, they are just a piece of the rebuilding effort. It should be up to everyone who considers themself a supporter of abortion rights to keep pressing forward. Right now, the exact future of abortion access in Arizona is uncertain. After the decision on April 9, there is a 14-day pause to hear additional arguments. There will be an additional 45-day period before the law can be enforced. This leaves time for the legislature to repeal the 1864 law. It is also likely that theArizona for Abortion Accessconstitutional amendment will be on the ballot in November after it was announced that their petition reached over 500,000 signatures. In the meantime, there is no shortage of community groups or volunteer opportunities to participate in. “The fight for every movement goes through ebbs and flows, Coronado said. The fight for abortion has been in its downturn period, despite Arizona having an almost complete ban on abortion. But the positive side of that is that we can really focus on politically educating and training the people who do and getting them more involved with the larger and broader movement. We can not become complacent with the sorry state of abortion laws, especially in Arizona. Instead, we should keep envisioning a better future and commit to voting, organizing and supporting abortion access that can not be taken away.

crimson_2024_17,"About a month ago, I co-authoredan article in The Crimsonabout antisemitism at Harvard. Since Oct. 7, another story has developed in parallel to the antisemitism on Harvard’s campus — the story of the public’s reaction to it. This piece is about that story. My brother Caleb is currently taking a gap year in Israel, just as I did over two years ago. In the weeks following the Oct. 7 massacre, my mother told me about several conversations she had with her friends. Her friends would ask, “How’s Caleb doing these days?” Then their eyes would widen with concern, and they’d follow up with, “and how’s Isaac? I hear it’s really awful over there…” As if I was the one who had spent my holiday in a bomb shelter. As if I was the one living in a warzone. In the weeks following Oct. 7, I felt I was in a bizarro world. People cared more about a provocative, thoughtless, andreprehensible statementby several loosely affiliated Harvard clubs than the real world events the statement described. My home country of Canadabroke from a patternof voting in favor of Israel at the United Nations, a significant shift that barely made headlines in comparison. Media outlets seemed weirdly intent on interviewing my peers when people in Israel and Gaza were suffering on a daily basis. Groups felt the need to squander their time and money commissioning aridiculous airplanewith an equally ridiculous message about Harvard’s antisemitism problem as well asdoxxing trucksthat flashed the names of students even tangentially associated with the statement, eliciting an eye-roll at best from passersby, while inflicting real hurt on those targeted. The shockwaves from the crisis at Harvard reverberated throughout the highest echelons of American political society. As the United States government juggles its policy in two overseas wars and grapples with serious political instability andrecord low approval ratings, major outlets and political figures remain focused on college discourse. Rep. Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (the supposed hero of the Jewish people in the fight against antisemitism on college campuses actively campaigned in 2021 for a congressional candidate who had praised Hitler (and who subsequently apologized and unwaveringly supports Trump even after his2022 dinnerwith Kanye West and Nicholas J. Fuentes, both widely known for their antisemitic rhetoric. Despite her ties to these figures, Stefanik exploited the Harvard fiasco and catapulted herself into the national spotlight. I felt, at times, like a political football. Nevertheless, former University President Claudine Gay’s repeated failure to respond well to Stefanik’s questioning and categorically state that calls for genocide against Jewish students constitute a violation of Harvard’s code of conduct, even if legalistically justifiable, was disgraceful, deeply hurtful, and seemingly contradicted the University’s commitment to combatting bigotry. While some celebrated Gay’s resignation, apparently believing that antisemitism had somehow been vanquished, we had no clear path forward and no concrete commitment to institutional change at a time when leadership and vision were desperately needed. To those claiming victory, I believe it is a Pyrrhic victory at best that will long fester as an open wound on our campus. Over these months, my faith in Harvard as an institution has been rocked to its core throughwaves of indecision,gross mismanagement,and convolutedstatements thatsomehow seemed to talk about me, but never to me. It will continue to frustrate me that Harvard seems more willing to expend their nearly unlimited resources on repeated attempts to salvage their own image than on honest efforts to understand my community and others. It will continue to be difficult to look at some of my classmates the same way after seeing their posts denying rape or justifying murder because it is politically easier than accepting complex truths. And it will continue to profoundly disturb me to hear chants of “globalize the intifada” while I’m heading to class. But that’s just the thing: I head to class. I head to class, and then I have dinner, and then I do some work, and then I go to sleep. Because, at the end of the day, I’m still a college student. Because, on this campus, we are all still college students. Over three months ago, I spoke to a Harvard alum whose son is serving in the IDF. Much of his son’s unit was murdered on Oct. 7 — his son had thankfully been off-base due to the holiday of Sukkot — and he wanted to hear updates from his alma mater. I didn’t know what to tell him except not to worry about it. Thousands of people had been killed at the time of our conversation, and hundreds remained in captivity. Many on both sides of the Green Line had not yet been buried. I assume the groups responsible for the initial statement that thrust Harvard into the public spotlight were well aware that it would attract significant media attention. That, generally speaking, is the sole purpose of a public statement. The media apparatus — ostensibly appalled and enraged — amplified the statement into the stratosphere. The aftermath sparked a conflagration that, if anything, drastically increased polarization, fear, and hostility, and somehow outraged everyone for different reasons. Almost no one is better off because of it. One of the first things that I now do each morning is look through the faces of people who have been killed overnight and pray that I will not recognize any of them. I am sure that many Palestinians do the same. Suddenly, what’s going on at Harvard does not seem as immediate. Isaac R.

On Jan. 24, we published a student-writtenpieceentitled “We will not wait for the next school shooting” in 50 student newspapers from across the country, all on the same day. A teacher once told me that his nightmares as a child were framed by the Cold War in the United States. His nightmares consisted of frantic dashes to bunkers and the ominous wait for a feared nuclear threat to dissipate. In my generation of Americans, these nightmares are set in the familiar walls of our lecture halls. We hide behind desks and crawl on floors littered with shattered glass and bullet casings, as the ever-present specter of gun violence looms over our lives. Mass shootings, with their tragic immediacy and scale, naturally dominate our national discourse on gun violence. Yet, by focusing predominantly on these events, we risk neglecting other aspects of gun violence, including homicides, accidental deaths and, most notably, suicides. These dimensions of gun violence, frequently pigeonholed as criminal justice issues, demand a broader dialogue around mental health, overall well-being and firearm safety. Consider the deeply intertwined issues of mental health and firearm-related suicides. According to the Gun Violence Archive,56%of the 43,000 firearm-related deaths in 2023 were attributed to suicide. Without a firearm, only5%of suicide attempts are fatal. With a firearm, that figure jumps to85%, making gun ownership — quite simply — a major risk factor for suicide. Alarmingly, a 2022 study found that aroundone thirdof people who reported symptoms of depression owned a firearm. These alarming statistics reveal that gun ownership is inexorably linked to physical and mental well-being. It is imperative that our healthcare system treats firearms as a significant risk factor and determinant of patient health. Medical professionals should routinely ask patients about firearm ownership and provide counseling on safe storage and handling practices. However, firearm safety is a topic that many physicians are afraid to broach. Many physicians feel unqualified to provide advice on safe storage practices or temporary transfers of gun ownership. A study in Ohio involving primary care pediatricians revealed that only39%of pediatricians felt they had received adequate training to counsel families about firearm safety. Despite72%of pediatricians agreeing about having a responsibility to discuss firearm safety, the actual practice of screening for firearm ownership and providing counseling was rare. Yet, the safe storage and handling of firearms is particularly important in the pediatric setting, considering that guns are the most likelycauseof death among children and teens. In addition to doctors feeling ill-prepared to discuss firearm safety, patients often fail to see the relevance of such discussions. In a survey conducted by the University of Michigan School of Medicine,more than halfof adult patients skipped a question about gun ownership on a questionnaire provided in the clinic waiting room. It is not a topic anyone is comfortable with. Addressing the genuine public health risks posed by firearms therefore necessitates a shift in how we approach doctor-patient conversations. This is precisely the aim ofTeam SAFE(Scrubs Against the Firearms Epidemic , an organization co-founded by Dr. Dean Winslow and Dr. Sarabeth Spitzer at Stanford University. Their mission is to equip healthcare providers with skills to advise their patients, communities and legislators on firearm use and ownership. With chapters in medical schools across the United States, Team SAFE is integrating firearm safety into medical curriculum via training on firearm-related injuries, firearm anatomy and patient counseling. Through these resources, Dr. Winslow “hopes that a doctor, psychiatrist or psychologist has the knowledge to inquire about firearms and encourage safe practices.” Whether or not you are a current or aspiring healthcare professional, we are all bound together by our role as patients. These crucial dialogues represent more than just preventative measures: They can be life-saving interventions. Patient-doctor conversations around firearm safety can be uncomfortable, but that is exactly why they are necessary — they are a small price to pay to prevent more lives from being lost.

crimson_2024_40,"When my mind wanders at Harvard, I often think about the students who came before me. Perhaps J. Robert Oppenheimer, Class of 1925, ate dinner in my House’s dining hall, or Natalie Portman ’03 sat in the same seat as me in Memorial Hall. In a recent, astronomy-focused lecture, my mind drifted to the Harvard Computers. The Harvard computers were a group of more than 80 women hired by Harvard professor Edward C. Pickering, Class of 1865, to analyze astronomical images. They were called computers because they did tedious mathematical computations by hand, work that has now been replaced by modern computers. Their work led to a new classification system for stars, and was critical to the advancement of the field. Despite their intellect and computational acumen, they were overworked, significantly underpaid, and unrecognized — all because they were women. Yet, many continued this work, holding fast to the valuable opportunity it provided them to engage in the sciences. Sitting in classrooms not unlike those in which these women worked, it is easy to forget their struggles. They seem foreign to me, as I attend science classes taught by incredible female professors, and interact with brilliant female research mentors and peers. While this no doubt reflects strides toward gender equity in STEM fields, I saw the limits of this progress recently when I helped to host the Harvard Women Engineers Code conference. Held annually, the WECode conference brings together hundreds of female undergraduates interested in computer science from around the world to learn more about technology from leading women in the field. What surprised me about these attendees is how incredibly eager they were to be there. Many cited this weekend event as a novel opportunity to meet other women in tech — the first time, some indicated, that they truly felt a part of a community in STEM. This was startling. If we have really made science more accessible to women, why do so many still feel left out? The truth is that existing progress still isn’t enough. It is no secret that women still make up a minority of many science fields, including computer science, engineering, and chemistry. Moreover, women in STEM still earn less than men in equivalent positions:A recent studydemonstrated that female tenure-track faculty were compensated less for their research than men in several top research institutions, with some earning thousands of dollars less than men with equivalent research productivity. This structural undervaluation could contribute to women feeling unwelcome in science. Underrepresentation of women in STEM could also result from societal norms. If girls are underestimated and discouraged from pursuing science and math at a young age, they may be less likely to one day pursue careers in these fields. (Indeed, many women who do then face bias and sexism. There has been some success though in changing this perception for young girls. Some activists and trailblazers, for example, have publicly rejected the phenomenon of “pinkification,” the exposure of young girls to everything pink and “girly,” pushing to redefine what it means to be feminine. Other challenges to women in STEM are more concrete, including insufficient maternity leave and lack of work-life balance. So long as women are expected to dedicate their time to housework and childcare — as was the norm in the early 20th century and is still the norm in many countries — it will be significantly more difficult for them to compete with their male counterparts to explore and succeed in STEM careers. As we celebrate Women’s History Month, I am especially appreciative of women like the Harvard computers, who quietly set a precedent that made it easier for students like myself to participate in science. More than anything, though, I am reminded by the computers that there is more work to be done to make STEM truly equitable — to allow the next generation of women to be valued as more than just computers.

crimson_2024_106,"Four months ago, interim President Alan M. Garber ’76 appointed a presidential task force to consider how antisemitism has reshaped aspects of life at Harvard University. Since receiving our charge, the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism has heard from several hundred Harvard affiliates across all of the University’s campuses and professional schools. As its co-chairs, we decided that our first step must be to open channels of communication in non-confrontational settings, providing opportunities for community members to talk, listen, and share their concerns about a very difficult year on our campus and beyond. This work has taken time, causing some of our students and alumni to be disappointed with what they thought was the slow pace of our work. But, if we are going to help make positive, lasting changes, we need to do things right. We spoke with students, faculty, staff, and alumni in both private conversations and over 40 group listening sessions. We also carried out joint sessions with the Presidential Task Force on Combating Anti-Muslim and Anti-Arab Bias. While many of the individuals we have spoken to were Jewish and/or Israeli, a number were of different faiths and national backgrounds. What we found in these conversations was often appalling. We have spoken with students and faculty who love Harvard deeply and have spent years here. Still, many of these same people have told us that something important that once characterized their time at Harvard is missing today. Though Harvard is home to Jewish students, staff, and scholars who are delighted and proud to be a part of this great institution, the Jewish community — while itself diverse in backgrounds and opinions — largely feels under siege. As has been the case at other universities over the past several months, the pressures felt by Jewish students have been manifest in both interpersonal relationships and the classroom. We have heard from Jewish and Israeli students who believe that their Jewish identity has regularly come between them and full participation in Harvard’s educational program and social life. Students have shared stories of lost friendships, shunning, and doxxing. We have heard from many Jewish students that their peers demand they take a public position on Israel or the Israel-Hamas war. In such situations, an unpopular answer can end present friendships or prevent future ones. Even worse, we have heard from many Israeli students that they are not even given a chance to express a public position before their peers, avoiding joining certain clubs for fear that they will face social sanction for supporting Israel’s right to exist. In today’s Harvard, students seem less likely to seek to build lasting relationships with those whose backgrounds differ markedly from their own. Political disagreements that might have once been set aside or talked through have become hard barriers to any kind of human relationship. Social media has vastly amplified the expression of hateful views. Jewish students, and their relationships with their peers, suffer from all these changes. We have also heard from students who were derided by their instructors or did not take certain classes because they believed the instructor would treat a Jewish or Israeli student unfairly. These different forms of exclusion have left Jewish and Israeli students feeling disconnected from a community that appears to be unable or unwilling to provide space for their grief and pain. Divides within the diverse Jewish community compound this effect, leaving some students feeling completely alone. It is not only Jewish students who are feeling isolated. We have also met non-Jewish students — including those who identify as Arab and Muslim — who are bewildered by how global politics has transformed our campus and separated them from their Jewish friends and roommates. A lot of energy has gone into debating if certain phrases or behaviors are antisemitic. Some of what the task force has observed clearly falls within the rubric of antisemitism, understood as identity-based bias against Jews irrespective of their national origin or personal beliefs. Our observations have emphasized a pressing need for greater awareness of the kinds of words and deeds that cross the line into antisemitism. Still, one does not have to argue about fine points of definitions to know that shunning, excluding, and intimidating students is wrong regardless of their identity or beliefs. It flouts the core values of our broader community and may well violate existing University policies. In order to get a deeper understanding of the campus climate the task forces have justlaunched a survey, and we will shortly submit preliminary recommendations designed to deal with the most urgent problems affecting our students based on its results. Over the summer, the task force on antisemitism will delve deeper into the Jewish experience at Harvard, both past and present. In doing so, we will build on our own observations from both listening sessions and documentary research to date as well as the work of former President Claudine Gay’s Academic Advisory Group on Antisemitism. We plan to include the widest array of sources and to take them into account as we propose final recommendations via a substantial public report in the early fall. We appreciate that some may find this schedule frustrating, but we aim to bring to the challenge a body of research, policy proposals, and thoughtfulness that is proportionate to the dimensions of the problem, and that necessarily takes time. Although our task force focuses on Jews and antisemitism, the reforms we will be proposing aim to improve conversations and interactions across lines of difference within Harvard as a whole. We need to create an atmosphere of inclusion and respect that will foster informed conversation about controversial subjects. Healing our fractured community will require time and effort. Recognizing the distinct ways in which Jewish and Israeli students have been hurt is an essential part of that process. Derek J. Penslar is the William Lee Frost Professor of Jewish History. Jared A.

stanforddaily_2024_12,"Over the past few years, graduate workers at Stanford — and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Southern California and beyond — have organized in overwhelming numbers to form unions. As we celebrate presenting our economic platform to Stanford, it’s imperative to remember the issues Stanford has been quietly refusing to address for months. A union contract is not just about wages and benefits; our contract establishes a host of protections — now in place at many of our peer universities — that can truly shift the balance of power for graduate workers across Stanford in our favor. A strong union contract is the most effective way that we can stand up for and support each other. Any one of us individually can face harassment, discrimination, abuse of authority, delayed information from the Bechtel International Center, dangerous working conditions or late pay. Having a strong union with the resources to enforce our contract will empower us to act collectively to force our employer to address these issues and protect each other. Building a powerful union that can enforce our contract is going to take all of us, united together in a union shop. Union shop is a system where all workers contribute financially to ensure that our union has the resources to organize, enforce and improve upon the gains we all win together. It is a critical foundation for a strong contract. Labor lawmandatesthat the union represent all bargaining unit members whenever they face issues on the job — both those who become union members and those who do not. However, when issues invariably arise, it is easy to dismiss the concerns of union members when “members” include only a small portion of the employee group. It is exactly on this premise that right-to-work states have successfully been reducing the strengths of labor unions in their states. If Stanford were to have their way, we would have an open shop in which graduate workers are not automatically in the union. Instead, we would have to solicit them to join, creating a significant drain on the time and finances of the existing union members. At the same time, our union organizers would have to spend countless hours away from their own work bringing in new members every quarter, which would increase burnout. Non-members would pay nothing at all, despite receiving all of the benefits and protections of a dues-paying member, significantly reducing the resources the union has to enforce its contract. By contrast, we propose a union shop system that includes everyone, with provisions to include an opt-out system. Under an agency shop (one version of union shop , those who choose to not join the union still pay the costs associated with representing them. Plus, resources can be devoted to contract enforcement, rather than recruitment. Agency shop is the current standard in recent union contracts at MIT, UChicago, Northwestern and Johns Hopkins, with a dues rate set in the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (Stanford Graduate Workers Union’s parent union national constitution at 1.44% of stipends. Union dues build the financial stability needed to effectively enforce our contract, and how they are collected is vitally important to ensure things like arbitration fees are covered when a labor violation occurs. The simple fact is, as an institution grows, we leave behind the realm of “if a problem happens” and enter “when a problem happens.” Thus we now ought to choose between ensuring ample resources or gambling against the future. No dues are taken until we have won a contract (which will contain a raise significantly higher than the percentage of dues , and dues money goes to building the infrastructure of our local union here at Stanford. Stanford has deep pockets and can spend significantly more on legal fights against our grievances than our union can. For cases where the union needs to pursue a grievance all the way to independent, third-party arbitration, we will need to have our own resources to get anywhere near an even playing field to defend our workers’ rights. These resources are needed to protect graduate workers directly, such as through a strike hardship fund. For this reason, union shop can sometimes more accurately be called union security. When institutions like Stanford (or other large scale, anti-union employers likeMercedes,Amazon,Alphabetand more do their best to weaken union organizing, they are not doing so only for financial reasons. Strong unions challenge the employer’s monopoly on power. Employers want to be able to make profitable choices without considering the needs of the person creating the profit. Employers know this very well and, in an attempt to weaken unions, have pushed so-called “right-to-work” legislation that denies union shop security in all workplaces. In other words, the modern union-busting strategy is a long game: weaken and divide. The arguments against union security are often framed as a “freedom of choice,” that each worker should have the freedom to choose whether they are members of the union. The reality is that unions without union security consistently win lower wages and fewer benefits than those that have a strong union security clause in their contract. This is whyallof the existing contracted unions on campus — including the unions for education workers, nurses and public safety officers — all have a union shop clause in their contracts. Furthermore, other graduate workers’ unions also provide clear examples of why union shop is so important. Harvard University and Brown University’s graduate workers have both negotiated their second contracts. AtHarvard, graduate workers just received a 3% raise July 1st, following 5%, 4%, and then 3% raises in the last three years respectively. AtBrown, graduate students will soon receive a 7.75% raise, followed by a 7.25% and 6.5% raise in the following years. How can we explain the disparity in pay raise? Harvard didn’t have a union security clause in their first contract, and Brown did. “Freedom of choice” and “right to work” arguments rely on fear, but the data shows that all of us will be better off standing up together. With all workers paying union dues,everyoneends up with more money in their paycheck than without a union shop provision. As a private institution in California, we are lucky as workers that we have the legal right to a union shop. We need to make sure it is included in our contract so we can secure wins, both now and in the years to come. Union shop also maintains equality within the bargaining unit. Every union member will have the right to run for union office, serve as a department steward, attend union meetings and vote in union elections. In short, everyone will be able to equally and fairly participate in the practices and priorities of our union. If, on the other hand, we were to adopt an open shop, all that unity breaks down. Suddenly, the graduate worker body is divided into members who vote on a contract and non-members who are bound by that contract, despite not considering themselves a part of it. Suddenly, our union has to have annual or even quarterly membership drives. Union shop allows us to focus on enforcing our contract, building power and making gains for future contracts and future graduate students instead of constantly running membership drives. Union shop allows us to build on our wins with each new contract instead of having to fight to maintain what we have already won. All workers are bound by the rights and benefits that come from the union contract — all workers should also have a democratic voice in how that contract is negotiated and enforced. Our immediate goal is to secure a strong contract. We know from the experience of other unions that a contract without union security won’t be strong enough to meet the needs of all graduate workers. We cannot lose sight of the importance of building a strong and lasting union in which all workers are united. Standing together gives us the power to successfully negotiate to improve our working and living conditions and our ability to hold Stanford accountable to all graduate workers. Bargaining up till now has taught us that the only thing Stanford responds to is visible outside pressure. They don’t want to be embarrassed, and they know they can’t refuse us if we stand together. So please make your voice known, and your opinion shown. Attend SGWU events,get involvedin the union shop campaign, talk to your coworkers about union shop, put union shop posters in your labs and offices, and sharesocial mediaposts. We need to show Stanford that silence is not a viable tactic, and that we are willing to stand up for a strong union. We fought to win our union because we know it’s the most effective vehicle to address our needs. Now we need to ensure that our union remains strong for years and decades to come.

crimson_2024_37,"“Seeing my people in pain.” It’s my go-to answer to the classic “biggest fear” question — whether it’s asked in a group of friends, during an intimate conversation, or as an icebreaker. It’s also the reason why, for most of my life, I refused to engage with media that emphasizes Black trauma, like “12 Years a Slave” or Toni Morrison’s oeuvre. For years, I avoided such works — despite their cultural significance and global acclaim — precisely because they raise questions I didn’t always want to ask, let alone answer. More recently, though, I’ve learned the power of engaging them head-on. Take “The Strange Thing About the Johnsons,” a short, satirical drama on sexual assault — a taboo subject, especially within Black families. While disturbing, the film has equipped me with many of the tools necessary to have nuanced conversations about uncomfortable truths of the Black experience. Engaging critically with these issues has given me the space to decide where I stand, what I will tolerate and what I must speak out against, and who to surround myself with. Ultimately, engaging with Black trauma — as much as it scares me — is the best way to learn how to protect myself from it. In the movies, books, and now too at Harvard, it is only by facing these fears that I snap out of complacency and grow. My first field trip at Harvard brought me to the Royall House and Slave Quarters, one of the last preserved freestanding quarters for enslaved people in the North. The best way to describe how I felt upon arrival was unsettled. I’d spent my entire life actively avoiding spaces like this one; I was overcome with an uneasiness in the presence of a history I had always known. The enslavement and systemic oppression of Black people in America are inextricably intertwined with everything else I know about my people’s history. Neglecting this history for years made it all the more glaring when I finally confronted it. From “Selma,” a historical retelling of the 1965 voting rights campaign in the South to “Get Out,” a horror film which explores benevolent racism — Black trauma, including my own, transcends genre. It was not until I watched these films that I gained insight into a narrative deeper than any abstract history textbook could offer. It was not until I entered the Royall House and Slave Quarters that I could place myself within the treacherous history I once thought I could know without truly confronting. By facing these often terrifying narratives head-on, I have learned to navigate the realities that plague the world I inhabit. Racism is alive and well, and while I attend an institution that has implemented initiatives to combat this truth, there is still much work to be done. It is easier to leave history in the past if you choose not to recognize it staring you in the face in the present. By engaging with generations of Black trauma, I can more clearly identify and cope with it in my own life. Fear, while often valued for its crucial role in survival, should also be celebrated as a motivating, empowering force when faced and overcome. After all, it is from grappling with fear that we learn some of life’s most valuable lessons. And by fears I don’t mean roller coasters or the mice in our dorm rooms — I mean the intangible fears that we so often choose to ignore under the guise of protecting our peace. For those who may not relate, allow me to illustrate: I am afraid that my physical appearance creates a preconceived notion of inferiority so I feel pressure to either speak with eloquence or remain silent indefinitely. I am afraid of not being able to afford my current or future education, so I work throughout the semester and during breaks. I am afraid of being looked down upon by those I care for most, so I strive to prove myself to them in any way I can. I don’t aim to suggest that fear should dictate our lives. Rather, I present these examples as proof that fear instills a vital sense of urgency in each of us, reminding us that complacency can kill. Confronting fear is ugly and sometimes unhealthy but often necessary. Fear is raw and real; to suppress it would be to deny human nature. In fact, facing my fears — especially those that stretch generations — has helped me realize the truest version of myself: Fear has driven me to seek change, achieve goals, and strive to better understand the world around me. If engaging with generational trauma is my greatest fear, then my greatest hope is that doing so will not only be an instrument for my individual growth, but also one step in a journey toward collective improvement and societal progress.

crimson_2024_60,"To the Class of 2028, Welcome! This upcoming weekend marks Visitas, when many of you will descend on our campus. Over the course of two jam-packed days, you’ll get a taste of life here: what it’s like to attend classes, eat in Annenberg, and stroll through the Yard. We are two current first-years who had vastly different Visitas experiences this time last year. Nevertheless, we both decided to commit to Harvard and since then, we’ve never looked back. Catherine’s Story — A Less Than Optimal Experience Since I did not stay with anyone I knew, I was assigned to live in the Quad for the weekend, an experience so memorable that it drove myinitial disappointmentat being “Quadded” on Housing Day. For the fifteen minute walk from the Quad to the Yard, it was pouring outside and I was lost, frantically loading Google Maps to find my way to Memorial Hall for the first event. I remember those two days in chunks of time. The frenzied extracurricular fair, lunch in Annenberg, the academic open houses, a coffee break — the events filled my schedule with little time in between. Though it was helpful to observe the various aspects of Harvard culture, it was chaotic and overwhelming. I shared some moments with a few people I already knew, but spent the majority of my time alone. My dinner on Sunday consisted of a Cliff Bar from the vending machine in the basement of the Science Center (prefrosh were expected to eat dinner in their host’s house, and there was no way I was walking back to the Quad in the rain . As I ate alone, uncommitted to any college at the time, I was scared that I had not found a home where I was meant to spend the next four years. Adar’s Story — A Pleasant Experience One of my closest friends was a first-year at the time and offered to host me for Visitas. She lived in the Yard, with close proximity to the dining hall and most events. Throughout my time at Vistas, my friend guided me to various club fairs, department open houses, and cultural programming. She was able to answer specific questions about campus life from housing to classes. I remember attending a Black Student Association talent show that showcased dances, poetry and singing. I grew excited to join BSA and become a part of similar extracurricular activities. I remember walking through the pouring rain, laughing and smiling as my host shared story after story about her first year, from Harvard-Yale to River Run. We walked until we reached Annenberg, where we stopped by Brain Break. I met other prefrosh and we bonded over hot chocolate and cereal. From trying Jefe’s in the Square to getting lost in the Widener stacks, I knew — from the second I set foot on campus — that Harvard was the place for me. Our Advice to You While Visitas can be representative of the Harvard experience, it isn’t necessarily so. Ultimately, the fabled weekend is just two days, and it can go very well — or very poorly — for any number of reasons. Just one sunny day, for example, would have made a big difference in both our Visitas experiences. And despite our differing experiences, when we returned home, we both rushed to our computers to commit to Harvard. We were able to see past the chaos and the unfortunate weather to imagine all that Harvard could really represent — opportunity, transformation, and intellectual curiosity. Not everyone will have the ideal introduction to Harvard. We can confidently say that neither our Visitas accounts — one good, one bad — fully reflects everyday life at Harvard. The point of Visitas is not to solidify your new friend group or decide exactly what classes and extracurriculars you wish to pursue, but rather to engage with future peers and professors for the first time (of many! and explore a small fraction of what Harvard has to offer. Our advice to you: Take Visitas with a grain of salt. Enjoy the opportunity to experience Harvard through the lens of a student, but try not to let it completely shape your view of Harvard. Even if you have a suboptimal experience, you belong here and can be excited to attend Harvard next fall. So have fun during your visit here, and don’t take anything too seriously! And be thankful that, unlike last year, the weather forecast is clear and dry! Adar M. Abdi ’27, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Matthews Hall. Catherine E.F.

As a former Harvard researcher who fell out of favor at the Kennedy School after daring to uncover information Meta would rather keep secret, I have seen first-hand where the limits of that support lie. Academic freedom only holds weight if every member of the academic community is committed to safeguarding academic freedom from external pressures. At Harvard, defending academic freedom is crucial. Today, universities worldwide are subject to significant influence from corporations, donors, and governments, shaping research agendas and educational missions. For Harvard to move past recent scandals and upheavals, it must prioritize the protection of academic freedom for all, a duty shared by faculty, students, staff, and administrators alike. When universities yield to these pressures, they betray their core promise to uphold academic freedom, allowing prestige to be exploited for profit and political gain. Recent controversies, such as billionaires’ attempts to influenceHarvard’s Board of Overseersand HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf’s rejection ofhuman rights defender Kenneth Rothas a fellow, highlight the urgency of this issue. I speak from personal experience. My commitment to academic integrity led toconflicts with University leadershipwhen I sought to study Meta, a massive company with close ties to Harvard. In fact, when I began researching Meta in October 2021, Harvard was close to receivingone of its largest donations ever— $500 million from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a multi-billion dollar philanthropic organization created with Facebook wealth. At this time, Harvard’s endowment held hundreds of millions in Meta stock,currently its largest publicly-disclosed holding. Despite contractual obligations and available research funding, my research into Meta led to my position at Harvard ending abruptly. I was recruited to the Harvard Kennedy School from the Data and Society Research Institute in 2018, where I led a team focusing on media manipulation and disinformation. Initially directing the Technology and Social Change project at HKS’ Shorenstein on Media, Politics and Public Policy, I was promoted to Research Director in February 2020. As adjunct faculty, I taught a popular course on media manipulation and createdthe Media Manipulation Casebook, documenting tactics disrupting democracy. My team studied how platforms facilitated hate speech, harassment, and incitement, and our research became widely utilized by governments, security agencies, newsrooms, academics, civil society, and tech companies worldwide. It was an exciting time to be researching communication and democratic practices. My troubles with Harvard began when I obtained crucial documents, known asThe Facebook Files, exposing corporate wrongdoing at Meta. In my whistleblower disclosure, I describe how I invited professor Latanya A. Sweeney and the Shorenstein Center’s leadership to collaborate on a public archive of Meta’s corporate documents, which we named the FB Archive. Rather than pursuing an academic article or forming a closed consortium, I believed it imperative to involve international academics, civil society, and journalists in examining the contents comprehensively. This initiative triggereda clash with HKS’ Dean Elmendorf, who maintains a decades-longpersonal relationshipwith former Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91. HKS leadership’s attempts to suppress my scholarship and undermine my credibility as a scholar culminated in a meeting with Elmendorf in August 2022, where he told me the University owned the rights to my research, latertelling The Crimsonthat this and other aspects of academic freedom are reserved for faculty. I was puzzled. Despite being granted principal investigator status with autonomy over my research agenda and working as adjunct faculty, I was somehow not entitled to full academic freedom. Before long, I became the target of bureaucratic suppression, strangled in red tape for broaching the topic of Meta. Elmendorf claimed Harvard owned the rights to my book, Meme Wars, before he had seen it — even though it was written off-campus and under a private contract. To avoid a lawsuit, my co-authors and I signed a legal release written by Harvard stipulating that the University owned the copyright jointly with us. It felt like HKS leadership did everything it could to push me out. I could tell that I was under increased scrutiny, received legalistic messages that felt like threats, and suddenly faced difficulties hiring for my research team. Yet HR didn’t recognize any evidence of workplace retaliation. Other faculty told me they were afraid of getting involved. Alone and terrified, I confided in my friend, Maria A. Ressa, former Shorenstein Fellow and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who introduced me toWhistleblower Aid. In December 2023, I went public onCNNandNBCand in theWashington Postwith mywhistleblower declaration. What’s most jarring is that it’s precisely Elmendorf’s job to protect academic freedom. What does it say about the state of academic freedom at Harvard that he did the reverse? HKS’s response to my research exposed broader issues of institutional integrity and academic freedom that then reached a fever pitch when professor Claudine Gay resigned under less-than-transparent circumstances after powerful donors called for her downfallpublicly and behind closed doors. By prioritizing donor interests over academic freedom, Harvard’s leadership has failed in its duty to uphold the principles of free expression and intellectual honesty. The future of Harvard will require limits and oversight of faculty and administrators’ financial and personal ties to actors and industries under study. The quest for a new University president will undoubtedly attract considerable attention from factions with political designs for Harvard, desiring to make it more a hedge fund than a center of higher learning. Already, Meta’s Mark E. Zuckerberg — a former member of the Class of 2006 — tried, but failed, to install an ally on the Board of Overseers. As sociologist Max Weber wrote, a useful professor teaches students to confront inconvenient facts, regardless of their ideological leanings. Similarly, members of the academic community must uphold academic freedom as a sacred principle, defending it against all attempts at suppression and co-option. Only then can universities fulfill their vital role in advancing society through the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Everything else is public relations. Joan M. Donovan was the research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. She is now Assistant Professor of Journalism and Emerging Media Studies at Boston University."

The views expressed in this opinion are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the Thresher or its editorial board. All guest opinions are fact-checked to the best of our ability and edited for clarity and conciseness by Thresher editors. In view of the deafening silence coming from Rice’s upper leadership, I want to bring my opinion about an incident to the broader Rice community, and put it in the context of the Rice Code of Conduct. On Thursday, Feb. 15, I attended apresentationby Antonio Neri, Chief Executive Officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprises. The presentation was organized by the Rice Center for Engineering Leadership and was attended by approximately 200 guests. Some of the guests chose that opportunity to loudly express their opinion contrary to HPE activities in Israel. They screamed the usual themes of genocide, “from the river to the sea,” and similar phrases that have become quite common. Many attendees, including guests from HPE and myself, felt intimidated and threatened by these chants and by the protesters’ attitudes, body language, tone of voice and words. This was certainly not the venue, nor the way to express an opinion about war in Gaza. In public discourse about similar incidents at Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and other schools it became clear to me that these type of slogans (“from the river to the sea,” Israel genocide are not freedom of speech, but are really hate speech. The silence from Rice leadership, from the president down to the deans and department chairs, is deafening. What happened to the promise to protect Rice students from harassment and threats? Or is Rice leadership only concerned with the perception of free speech and not with the implications of hate speech? I understand that the matter was referred to the Rice University Police Department. This is a good step but it does not replace academic and administrative measures that Rice should take against students and student associations and clubs who organize and participate in these demonstrations and blatantly break theCode of Conduct. I expect that hate speech will not be tolerated, and that stark disciplinary action including expulsion or suspension would be imposed on those who ignore it. This is an institutional matter, and I wait for an institutional reply from the Rice president, provost and other authorities. April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.

crimson_2024_76,"Being a Jewish student at Harvard can be hard. Recent events on our campus not only surfaced antisemitism from Harvard students and faculty, but also demonstrated the administration’s failure to protect its Jewish students. Since Oct. 7, antisemitism has surrounded us. The murders of our friends and family in Israel were celebrated on social media, and “Zionist,” a word that describes the vast majority of Jews, continued to be used as a slur on this campus. However, antisemitism at Harvard is not a new phenomenon. It is rooted in our institution. When the number of Jewish students enrolled in the University rose in the early 20th century, the administration deemed there to be a “Jewish problem.” Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell founded the committee on “Methods for Sifting Candidates for Admission,” to reduce the number of Jewish students at Harvard and solve the school’s “Jewish problem.” To convince a Jewish professor to join the committee, Lowell claimed that greater Jewish enrollment would spur more antisemitism at Harvard, and therefore Jews should support efforts to limit their numbers. In Lowell’s eyes, our presence was the cause of Harvard’s antisemitism.The Harvard community has always found reasons to justify our exclusion. Today, students continue the University’s legacy by finding new reasons to ostracize Jewish students. They call us “colonialists” for living in our indigenous land. They claim that we control the media and Harvard itself. They try to convince us that the antisemitism we experience at Harvard is not real, claiming that antizionism is not antisemitism and anonymously posting messages including “love how u manage to make it abt urself.” The Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee is just the latest actor in a long, long history of antisemitism on this campus. When the PSCposted a cartoonthat depicted Jews as money-grabbing puppet masters, lynching an Arab and a Black person, they were peddling ancient antisemitic tropes. After facing backlash, they removed the post. When students chant “globalize the intifada,” they invite violence against Jews and Israelis around the world. When they say that “all of you Zionists are the same. Killers and rapists of children!” They say that the vast majority of Jews are despicable human beings. When they call “from the river to the sea Palestine is Arab,” they call for the ethnic cleansing of Jews of their ancestral land. Looking at the history of this institution, and the recent wave of activism, we can easily expect Harvard’sknock-off encampmentto bring the same level of unsafety to our Jewish students at Harvard as it brought to those at Columbia. After protesters surrounded and yelled at Jewish students at Columbia and pointed signs at them, describing them as “Al-Qasam’s Next Targets” — referencing the military wing of Hamas — a rabbi at Columbia urged students to return home over safety concerns. Hopefully, Harvard’s rabbis won’t have to do the same. Lowell would have been content with the current situation. Nowadays, the administration doesn’t need to intervene to solve their Jewish problem: Jewish students are scared to commit to Harvard. But the rise of antisemitism and the escalation of recent events are precisely the reason that you, a Jewish admit to Harvard, must come to this University. To not attend is to let the antisemites win. We have been working for two thousand years — since we were exiled from our ancestral land — to have the right to belong. Our presence is not the cause of antisemitism at Harvard, but the cure for it. If we learn anything from our history, it should be that when antisemitism spikes, the world stands idly by. It shouldn t be just our job to fight antisemitism, but unfortunately, no one else will do it for us. I know this is a lot to put on your shoulders as a high school senior. But I genuinely believe in our power — your power — to change this place. Being a student at Harvard gives us a say in its future. Together, we can hold the administration accountable. We can have a voice in campus life. We can tell our stories and the stories of our people to our classmates. In this challenging year for Jews at Harvard, something special has also happened. In the months following Oct. 7, the Jewish community has come together like never before. Hillel became our second home. Weorganized vigils, createdspaces to mourn, and found one another. When one of us was down, we lifted them up. As the months passed, these connections blossomed into beautiful friendships that we will cherish for many years. Before coming to Harvard, I didn’t embrace my Jewish identity, but the last few months have given me a newfound appreciation for my heritage and people. They have shown me that being Jewish is core to who I am. While my family is thousands of miles away from me in Israel, I know I have a second family here at Harvard. And if you come to Harvard, you will, too. Maya Shiloni ’26, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a double concentrator in Government and Economics in Mather House."
crimson_2024_21,"Let’s go back to how Harvard’s current crisis began: charges of antisemitism. Why antisemitism seems to be a problem at Harvard and other universities is one of the still-unanswered questions that precipitated the University’s downward spiral. But, it surely is not Claudine Gay’s fault. It is not because Harvard admits antisemitic students or hires antisemitic faculty. No one is suggesting there are comparable antisemitism problems in other kinds of institutions — such as hospitals or libraries — so there must be something that uniquely happens in universities. That something must be the source of our woes. *** Unapologetic antisemitism — whether the incidents are few or numerous — is a college phenomenon because of what we teach, and how our teachings are exploited by malign actors. The Harvard online course catalog has a search box. Type in “decolonize.” That word — though surely not the only lens through which to view the current relationship between Europe and the rest of the world — is in the titles of seven courses and the descriptions of 18 more. Try “oppression” and “liberation.” Each is in the descriptions of more than 80 courses. “Social justice” is in over 100. “White supremacy” and “Enlightenment” are neck and neck, both ahead of “scientific revolution” but behind “intersectionality.” Though word frequency is an imperfect measure and the precise counts are muddied by duplicate numberings and courses at MIT, this experiment supports the suspicion that the Harvard curriculum has become heavily slanted toward recent fashions of the progressive left. For example, “intersectionality” was almost unattested before the year 2000, while published uses of “decolonize” have more than tripled since then. Merchants of hate are repurposing these intellectual goods that universities are producing. When complex social and political histories are oversimplified in our teachings as Manichaean struggles — between oppressed people and their oppressors, the powerless and the powerful, the just and the wicked — a veneer of academic respectability is applied to the ugly old stereotype of Jews as evil but deviously successful people. While Harvard cannot stop the abuse of our teaching, we, the Harvard faculty, can recognize and work to mitigate these impacts. The political bias in our faculty is now widely accepted. One solution is to use a kind of affirmative action program for conservative thinkers to change the faculty, but that idea is noxious and misses a crucial point. Professors should not be carrying their ideologies into the classroom. Our job as teachers of “citizens and citizen-leaders” is not to indoctrinate students, but to prepare them to grapple with all of the ideas they will encounter in the societies they will serve. Instead, individual faculty might diversify what they teach. Committees and departments could enforce a standard that curricula exhibit intellectual diversity and a variety of agreed-upon topics and techniques. If done correctly, it would not infringe upon individual academic freedom to allow our faculty colleagues to have a stronger role in shaping each others’ syllabi and curricula. Nor would it be improper for the Board of Overseers — with its elaborate Visiting Committee structure — to weigh in on the evident political biases and ideological vectors in our educational program. As obvious as this all may sound, it would be a big change from the present. Over the fifty years I have been on the Harvard faculty, the expectation has evolved that individual Harvard professors are free to teach whatever they wish to whomever they wish. It was once the norm for faculty to rotate through courses of unpredictable size and with stable curricula, but now enrollments are predetermined quite rigorously and even introductory courses may change their reading lists and lecture topics drastically when new professors take charge. Curricular committees theoretically vet these courses, but not annually, and not for the kinds of political biases that have skewed undergraduate education. The result is to favor the hip, current, and “relevant,” over foundational learning — what instructors personally believe to the exclusion of what students should learn to participate knowledgeably in the world outside our gates. *** The leftward shift of Harvard’s faculty deserves scrutiny. Judicious changes to the hiring and promotion process can thwart intellectual inbreeding — just as the current tenure system, now tired and manipulable, was once an innovative revamp of a system that resulted in ethnic and gender homogeneity. Now is the time to change a system that will take decades to alter the composition of the faculty. But there is no need to wait for that reform. The goal is not to give students a choice between courses reflecting different ideologies. Harvard should instead expect instructors to leave their politics at the classroom door and touch both sides of controversial questions, leaving students uncertain where their sympathies lie. Professors should have no more right to exclude from their teaching ideas with which they disagree than students should expect to be shielded from ideas they find disagreeable. All that is required is for faculty to exhibit some humility about the limits of their own wisdom and embrace the formula for educational improvement voiced by Le Baron R. Briggs, a Harvard dean, more than a century ago: “increased stress on offering what should be taught rather than what the teachers wish to teach.” Harry R. Lewis ’68 is a Gordon McKay Research Professor of Computer Science. He served as Dean of Harvard College from 1995 to 2003."
crimson_2024_8,"It’s obvious what must happen now that Claudine Gay has resigned from Harvard’s presidency. All institutions of higher education must commissionindependent reviewsinto the work of their respective presidents, tenured faculty, and other top academic officials. They must weed out anyone who made citation errors like Gay — even if these errors were minor, and even if they were made decades ago. The new standard is not excellence, not brilliance, but perfection. To commit to anything less would be to admit that Gay was singled out for being a Black woman. To do anything other than dust off the dissertations and research papers of every academic in a leadership position — leaving racist, sexist, and ableist stones unturned — would be to acknowledge that what happened to Gay wasn’t about upholding academic integrity. These reviews can’t simply investigate potential incidents of plagiarism. Given that college campuses are rapidly diversifying, the investigations must also address other errors that may undermine institutional integrity. A white faculty member who wore blackface in 1995? Slurred a Black colleague or fellow student with the n-word in 1998? Maybe “owned” someone in the 1850s? They should all be shunned — the living fired and all memory of the dead erased. After all, we wouldn’t want non-traditional — read: non-white — students to get the impression that imperfect people can guide them into adulthood. But let’s be clear. Gay’s infractions pale in comparison to those listed above and even in comparison to other, more severe forms of plagiarism. Sloppy citations should hardly raise questions about one’s academic integrity. This is what’s so grating about this saga: Gay was pressured to resign largely on the basis of slight academic misdemeanors. Her resignation sends a sobering message: Harvard is not capable of standing firm in the face of external pressure from bad actors. When it came to bending to the billionaire-backed right, or defending its own leader, a Black woman under relentless racist attack, Harvard chose the former. This was never just about Gay. The right-wing, racist campaign for her resignation is led by those who forged an attack on crucial work to uproot harmful traditions, undo entrenched inequalities, and replace these systemic evils with something resembling equity and equality. No one ever gave a darn about sloppy citations in Gay’s 1997 dissertation. The people most adamant about ensuring Gay would have the shortest presidential tenure in Harvard history arethe same peoplewho support laws and policies designed to suppress the accurate teaching of this country’s racist past and present. They’re the same people allied with those who want young students to believe Black people benefited from enslavement. These bad actors want to turn back the clock and force everyone to accept their ideologically narrow, twisted definition of academic truth. With Gay’s resignation, they’ve secured a real win for their cause. As I watched this saga play out from afar, I yearned for the moment Gay would scream “kiss my Black ass,” a message to her bad-faith critics that she belonged and would not relent, even as the winds howled. That she would let excellence be her guide and brilliance be her anchor. How I longed for her to remind everyone that one doesn’t just become the first Black woman to lead Harvard without proving oneself first. Instead, Gay’s resignation has reinforced a cruel reality: Black people must be superhero-like to gain society’s permission to walk the same path that others — with much less to overcome — have been welcomed onto with open arms. Gay’s resignation signals that not even Harvard — with its unparalleled prestige and enormous endowment — could purchase the kind of spine that higher education needs in the face of vitriolic external pressure and extremist interests. Make no mistake: Her departure opens the door for increased attacks. There’s blood in the water, and the sharks are circling. Issac J. Bailey was a Nieman Fellow in 2014."
thetech_mit_2024_26,"On Saturday, February 17th, the MIT Coalition For Palestine (C4P , an alliance of 14 student and staff/faculty groups on campus, coordinated two actions at the 50th annual gala celebrating and honoring the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This event, hosted by MIT’s president Sally Kornbluth, aims to celebrate the life and legacy of the inspiring civil rights activist and revolutionary whose words echo throughout our history books. On Saturday, the Black Student Union (BSU and Black Graduate Student Association (BGSA led the C4P in actionto ask a very pointed question:are we at MIT truly respecting the legacy of MLK? Prior to the start of the event, community members gathered at a rally outside the Boston Cambridge Marriott hotel, the venue of the gala, to lodge their protest against MIT administration srecent suspensionof the student groupCoalition Against Apartheid(CAA , which has been actively campaigning on campus and locally to end thegenocideof the Palestinian people being perpetrated by the Israeli government and military. On the night of Sunday, Feb. 11th, Israel resumed its carpet bombing campaign in Rafah, an act of aggression which even United Statesspokespeople have saidwould not receive American support. These sudden events prompted the CAA to lead anemergency rallyon Monday, 2/12 in response to the escalation of bombing in Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians have been forced to set up makeshift refugee shelters to flee the Israeli aggression. Despite attempts atopen communication with administratorsto ensure safety, the CAA was subsequently suspended as a student organization, and 13 of its student leaders were temporarily banned from all leadership positions on campus, even those without any relation to CAA activities. Additionally, these student leaders face disciplinary charges which could include “permanent suspension,” putting their international members at risk of deportation. President Kornbluth communicated the details of the group suspension in apublic videodespite aninstitutional policy of confidentialityin disciplinary cases. In response to this blatant suppression, the BSU and BGSAled the coalition in a rallyon Saturday, Feb 17th. Addressing over 150 community members as well as the gala attendees entering the hotel, the speakers noted the deep irony in having MIT administrators participate in an event honoring MLK, whose legacy of protest, direct action, and civil disobedience is perhaps best exemplified at MIT through the Coalition. The gala itself, organized by staff, faculty, and students who form a crucial support network for Black students and community members at MIT, represents an inspiring effort to honor the rich history of Black liberation; however, the C4P made it clear that they find the attendance of MIT administrators who have enforced suppressive free speech policies to be an absolute disrespect to the memory, legacy, and ongoing struggle of this movement. To confront these administrators with their contradictions, student attendees of the gala participated in a resolute display of solidarity and protest, voicing their support for the CAA and making the following demands: Reinstate the CAA and retract threats to student organizers. Remove the suppressive free-speech policies (e.g., “time, place, and manner” restrictions which have been used to suppress protest on campus. Cut research and corporate ties with the Israeli Ministry of Defense. Inside the gala, a disruption occurred during the end of remarks given by Austin Cole, the graduate student speaker for the event and a Masters student in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP and Sloan School of Management. Austin called on the attendees to rise from their seats in honor of Dr. King’s legacy and words. He asked that they continue to stay standing if they agreed with additional statements, which connected Dr. King’s struggle with the genocide in Gaza and unjust reprisals on MIT’s campus. Most of the crowd stood throughout, though notable MIT administrators sat down once the CAA was referenced. As people stood, students handed out pamphlets detailing the hypocrisy of the administration and outlining the C4P’s demands. Finally, dozens of students and MIT community members joined Austin on stage in front of the crowd, linking arms while reciting a joint statement. A transcript of this powerful speech, including the disruption, can be found below editorial comments in brackets . Transcript: Good evening, my name is Austin Cole, and I’m a grad student in urban planning and business here at MIT. I am here by the grace of God, the will of my mother, and the love of my beautiful partner. I believe part of developing both intelligence and character is the process of crafting our place in this world. This process is fundamentally about how we relate to others, to the earth, to the moral universe, and to ourselves. In his letter from a Birmingham jail, Dr. King wrote: “All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” This quote has always resonated, but it feels especially pertinent today when we are in another extended battle for the soul of this country and campus. Dr. King’s idea of relationship and mutuality came up for me while I was a college summer intern at the state department. I remember sitting in a conference room watching as the news flipped between the murder of Mike Brown in Ferguson and the so-called migrant crisis at the southern border. As a Black man in the US studying political economy in Latin America, I felt the connections of the physical violence of a state murder of an unarmed Black teenager with the structural violence of our foreign policy and immigration system. Those connections might not have solidified had I not offered to my team of Latin American experts that maybe we should think about solutions to the migrant crisis in the context of the US destabilizing those countries from the 50s until today. As you can imagine, I was met with silence and blank stares and after a moment the conversation changed. This was an early career reminder that the institutions that depend on upholding structural inequalities are not going to provide the solutions. How could I honestly be in relation with the masses at our border or the crowds in Ferguson while upholding such institutional norms? It was in Dr. King’s understanding of mutuality and relationship that late last year I suggested to senior MIT administrators that a reason the institution struggles to confront racism is because it is intertwined with a racist, violent, and unfortunately profitable military project. Like most universities, MIT remains comfortably enmeshed within the three evils of US society that Dr. King decried in a 1967 speech:racism, excessive materialism, and militarism. Yet, the suggestion that MIT might start to divorce itself from militarism, just like my 2014 comment at the state department, was met with dismissal. Such dismissals only forestall a more just future, and because of this it is incumbent upon me and others to struggle inside and especially outside of these institutions of extreme intelligence and questionable character. I feel called to oppose the complicity of this institution and others in the genocide in Gaza, the ongoing Nakba, the criminalization of our youth, and deadly militarism at home and abroad. While I am called to oppose this loudly, we all have different roles to playin this long struggle of societal reconstruction. If we don’t see a role for ourselves in advancing this reconstruction, then we consign ourselves to complicity in genocides and injustices because we are benefiting from their violence. While this is difficult, to truly honor the legacy of Dr. King, some things must be done because they are right despite, as he said, being quote, Neither safe nor politic nor popular. In closing, Dr. King told us, and young people of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee showed us, that we need to be “creatively maladjusted” to the institutions that direct or are complicit in the injustices we fight, or else we perpetuate their injustices ourselves. For me this has meant organizing on and outside of this campus and I have found a beloved community in doing so. I hope that from bottom up, this spirit of justice will emerge from allcorners of this institute because thus far we’ve failed to heed the warning of Dr. King that, “When scientific power outruns moral power we end up with guided missiles and misguided men”. At minimum, I hope that each of us considers what it means to honor Dr. King and to carry the torch of justicewhile within this institution or others. As for me and mine, we choose to fight and build collectively. Like Dr. King, we choose to be among those creatively maladjusted to injustice wherever it may surface. I hope that you will join us. And to show that you will not be alone, and in the name of education being both intelligence and character, I would ask everyone who is able to to please rise if you believe in the dream of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King’s and his words that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere , if you cannot stand please raise your glass audience stood Now please stay standing if you believe that standing against injustice, in whatever role you can do so in, aligns with your moral character and values during this time, students began handing out pamphlets shown in Figure 1 Please stay standing if you believe in Dr. King’s legacy that supporting or remaining neutral to the genocide and destruction of a people s land qualifies as an injustice Please stay standing if you believe that it is reasonable for people of conscience – students/staff/faculty/community members – to fight for the beloved community by protesting against injustice and institutional complicity without being threatened with suspension, expulsion, or firing MIT administrators sat I thank everyone who’s standing, and I invite all of you to come up to the front and stand together. students, faculty, and staff began walking to the front of the stage For those of you who have sat down or lowered your glasses, I ask you to grapple with why you did so: is it fear, worry, uncertainty, disagreement? These are understandable feelings, and can be overcome by solidarity, bravery, moral clarity, and a willingness to learn. I encourage all of us to think about what we are willing to stand for and in this time of a genocide in which this institution is directly complicit, what are we comfortable with not standing for or supporting? For example, are we comfortable with CAA student members not being allowed to use conventional pathways to report harassment after reading Dr King’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail as a form of protest against suppressive free speech policies on campus? On behalf of the large movement inside and outside this room, I thank the MLK Committee for your steadfast work and the love and care that you have shown us students and this institute despite all the challenges of this year, I thank those of you who stood or raised your glass for your solidarity and bravery, I thank those who may not have stood but will consider the gravity of this space and legacy and find a future role for themselves. For those gathered up here at the front, we will read a short joint statement, please repeat after me: We members of the MIT communityrepeated by students at front - students, staff, faculty -repeated recognize the importance of honoring Dr. King’s legacy of actionrepeated . We recognize the work of the MIT Coalition Against Apartheidrepeated , both historically and todayrepeated , to free us from complicityrepeated In colonial and oppressive military projectsrepeated .

Please bow your heads.audience bows heads Thank you, as we all take our seats, let us remember the words of Dr. King: “He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it.

This prospect could be devastating to the most vulnerable on campus, and students deserve access to free, accurate COVID tests. Since May 2020, ASU has offered saliva PCR tests on all campuses through theDevils’ drop-off program. The clinical testing laboratory within the Biodesign Institute offers highly accurate COVID tests, with results delivered within 48 hours. However, in May 2023, the program removed many of its drop-off sites. There are now only three drop-off locations on the Tempe campus and one location each for the West Valley, Downtown and Polytechnic campuses. The remaining locations are primarily in high-traffic and high-visibility locations, with none remaining in residence halls. The demand is reduced, Vel Murugan, an associate research professor at the Biodesign Institute and technical director of the clinical lab, said. We started seeing (that in many locations, we didn t even have any samples for days. It s just a demand to reduce it so that we can operate more efficiently. However, there is a genuine possibility that the Devils drop-off program may be eliminated altogether. Carolyn Compton is the medical director of the clinical testing lab. In an email, she discussed the current and future status of the lab. We no longer have that source of funding, and demand for COVID testing has dropped, Compton said in her email. For both reasons, we have had to close down many of our Devils Drop-Off sample collection sites. Further, the future of the lab is somewhat uncertain. The source of funding Compton is referring to is the state. Joshua LaBaer, the executive director of the Biodesign Institute and scientific director of the lab, said that the state was paying for many of the tests being run. If there were enough people using it, then I think the University might (still do it, LaBaer said. A big difference, of course, was back then, the state paid us to do those tests. The financial burden of the clinical lab is not insignificant, nor is the labor that goes into running a clinical laboratory, which has to meetstrict standards of accreditation. Tests must also be transported across the campuses to the clinical lab in the Biodesign Institute, although now there is no test pick-up offered on Friday or Saturday. At the height of the pandemic, the lab required daily upkeep to meet the demand. We set up that lab, LaBaer said. We got a bunch of new robots. We got all kinds of new automation, and we were meeting seven days a week, every day at 8:00 a.m. This work paid off through keeping the community safe and providing valuable data to the state. In October 2021, the clinical lab completed its1 millionth test. It should also be acknowledged that COVID is not a pressing concern for many students, especially with better medical technology to combat the virus, such as vaccines,Paxlovidand rapid response tests. In fact, one reason the demand for Devils drop-off may have been reduced is the prevalence of rapid response tests. A big thing that affected us was people getting the protein tests that they can get at the pharmacy, LaBaer said. That test is very fast. It s not quite as accurate as our tests (and doesn t get reported to the state like our test does, which is useful because the state can then track how often it s happening. CVS offers rapid-response COVID tests from $10 to $20 with delivery options available. The federal government also offeredfour free rapid test kitsper household in November. However,rapid kits are less reliable than PCR kits, with a higher rate of false negatives. This is why having free, highly reliable kits was such a boon to the community at the height of the pandemic. But even now, there are many reasons a community member needs either a free test or a more reliable one. At this massive school, there are students facing financial difficulties and community members who are immunocompromised or who live with immunocompromised people. People may also prefer a more accurate test to guide their decision-making, like when they return to classes or a job after testing positive. A free test in an easily accessible location may also increase the chance that students will test at the first sign of illness. The barriers to the test include cost, distance and even the fear of missing class or work. These hinderances may keep students from testing at the first sign of illness, which puts the most vulnerable members of the community at risk. Every student may not appreciate the Devils drop-off program, but for those who need it, the program is invaluable. It should also be noted that the leadership of the clinical lab is not necessarily the ones advocating for the end of the lab. They were also unable to say what the program s future will be, as it is still under discussion. We are trying really hard to keep an active clinical testing lab within ASU moving forward, Murugan said. ASU should remember the full value of Devils drop-off as it decides the future of the clinical testing lab, and community members who value access to these free tests should take advantage while they still can.

stanforddaily_2024_28,"In early conversations about what we wanted an equity special issue to focus on, we kept coming back to the power structures that form the lifeblood of the University: the admissions process, the hierarchies of academia, the social capital, the various ways we learn to navigate this place. We chose to focus broadly oninstitutional equity. With this theme in mind, we challenged our writers to examine how Stanford, as an institution, shapes the lives of students, faculty and staff. The Daily has routinely overlooked issues and communities on campus that fall outside of the mainstream. We signed on to edit the Equity Project with the hope of filling those gaps in our coverage. The Equity Project’s existence has in the past depended on the availability of interested editors.

thetech_mit_2024_30,"What could make an elderly senior faculty at one of the nation’s leading institutions of higher education so upset that he stood up, banged his cane on the floor, and demanded that the discussion of recently suspended MIT students protesting against the genocide in Gaza come to an immediate halt because of the turn it had taken. On May 15, 2024, at an MIT faculty meeting with record attendance, this professor was reacting to a senior administrator evokingthe danger posed by rapistsas part of the justification for the temporary suspensions that were levied, without any due process, against students who had been part of theScientists Against Genocide Encampment(SAGE on campus. Most of these students, like the senior faculty, are Black and Brown; and, most shockingly, the administrator compared the reason for the suspensions to the urgent need to stop rapists in their tracks in order to ensure the safety of potential victims. The rationale: The suspensions were as urgently needed as in the hypothetical rapist case — in order to preempt irreparable harm to the community. As the images ofEmmett Tillin his coffinremind us, this comparison echoes racial stereotypes that have long been fatal to minoritized individuals in the US. Yet, what the students were protesting against is MIT’s complicity with theactualirreparable harm caused by Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Why, then, would they be compared to rapists? That’s what things have come to at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — in spite of our slogans #MITMindHandHeart for #BetterWorld. Regardless of where you stand on Israel’s war on Gaza, you might agree that the students’ suspensions and the beyond-the-pale comparison with rapists are part of a larger campaign to suppress free speech at MIT — in this case, the righteous demands of students engaged in peaceful protest butfalsely accusedof creating unsafe conditions for the MIT community. Some of those students, along with their families, werethreatened with housing eviction— including an Air Force veteran with his 5-year-old daughter. Some were unable to graduate because the timeline of lifting the temporary suspensions interfered with their finishing up their last classes. So their futures still hang in the balance. These temporary suspensions could have permanent life- and career-related consequences. At another faculty meeting, on May 17, 2024, an MIT faculty member compared the SAGE protests to racist attacks against Black people, comparing Zionists on campus to Black people feeling unsafe because of white supremacy. This comparison inverts well-known power relationships. It’s as if Zionists as a group were like Blacks living under racial oppression — and as if Zionists were not the ones in control of a nuclear, supremacist ethno-state unconditionally backed by the US and armed with US-built 2,000-pound bombs that behead and burn babies alive. In reality, the SAGE students, like anti-genocide protesters across the globe, resemble David fighting against a Zionist Goliath. It is easy to find the facts of what transpired at the encampment — facts that illustrate the power and impunity of the Zionist faction at MIT. Theonline worldis full ofimages and videos of aggression, not from the SAGE students, includingMIT Jews for Ceasefire, but from the counter-protesters (many from the MIT Israel Alliance, which includes students, faculty, and staff —often directly threatening or mocking SAGE studentsandcovering SAGE posters and artworkwith Israeli and US flags while MIT police and administrators looked on. I myself have been the target ofsurveillanceby MIT Israel Alliance. The MIT Police itself, which has been reported as harassing SAGE students, is headed by Chief John DiFava who, in a trip sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League (a Zionist organization , receivedcounter-terrorism training in Israelwhere he stated, in an overt case of racial and ethnic profiling, that one potential source of terrorism at MIT is from foreign students “from countries that aren’t necessarily friends of the United States per se.” There’s also documentation showing deliberatemistranslationsofArabic used to fuel the flames of this “unsafety” claim. This mistranslated video, a version of which was shown at a CSAIL faculty meeting with erroneous credits that included the names of students who were not even filmed in the video, was subsequently mis-used as “evidence” by the MIT Administration to suspend students who were later un-suspended when the “evidence” was shown by the accused students to be false. Juxtapose these false accusations of SAGE students with the impunity of Israeli students and their supporters from off campusdancing, at an MIT-sanctioned event, to the beat of an anti-Palestinian song, “Harbu Darbu,” withgenocidal lyrics, which they were playing loudly near the encampment to celebrate Israel Day. But let’s go back to the MIT administration. In person and in email on May 17, 2024, to MIT President Sally Kornbluth, I’ve raised one question about her stunning claim on that day that faculty are “out of bounds” when present atstudents’ protestsinfront of her home, then another question about her and her administration’soft-repeatedstatementthat academic freedomjustifiesMIT faculty’s collaboration with Israel’s Ministry of Defense. I still have not received any answer. So I’ll ask again here: Are MIT professors really “out of bounds” when present at student protests? How about our own freedom of speech? How aboutfacultywho, applying said freedom of speech and their moral principles, joined students in protesting the Vietnam War? How aboutfacultywho joined students in protesting apartheid in South Africa? Were they all “out of bounds” due to their noble ethical imperatives toward a #BetterWorld? Now when it comes to MIT Administration’sOrwellian(that is, doublespeak appeal to “academic freedom” for licensing complicity with genocide, let’s look at yet another case of double standards that apply directly to me as a senior professor at MIT: For nearly 6 months now, my colleagues at MIT Linguistics have heightened to an unprecedented level their scrutiny ofa “Special Topics” seminarthat I have proposed for Fall 2024 on “Language and linguistics for decolonization and liberation and for peace and community-building from the river to the sea in Palestine and Israel to the mountaintops of Haiti and beyond.” I doubt it’s a coincidence that this exceptional level of scrutiny — in effect, censorship — is led by my department head, an Israeli, who had previously yelled profanities at me and accused me of being “out of my mind,” in a Zoom meeting in the presence of my 6-year-old-daughter during which he criticized my anti-genocide writings on social media? This yelling was triggered by his disagreement with my use of terms like “genocide,” “Amalek,” “apartheid,” “settler-colonial Zionism,” “antisemitism,” etc. He would have preferred the use of “ethnic cleansing” over “genocide”; he rejected my analysis of Israeli leaders’ use of the biblical “Amalek” figure as denoting genocidal intent; he disagreed with my opinion that Zionism is a form of settler-colonialism; he took it as “antisemitic” thatmy letterto President Liz Magill of UPenn highlighted the role of Zionist Jewish donors in pressuring her to attack freedom of speech in order to silence criticism of Israel... A few weeks after apologizing for yelling at me, my department head was joined by all the other MIT Linguistics faculty in raising “concerns” that my course might not “fit” our linguistics curriculum, then they claimed that I didn’t have the required expertise to include contents about the Middle East — even though, among already confirmed guest speakers, theseminarwill rely on eminent specialists on the politics of language, on meaning and power, and on language-related issues in Israel and Palestine. Then I was also told that the reason for this unprecedented review was the unprecedented political climate at MIT. Please note that this climate — an updated version of McCarthyism — was created by, among others, the antagonistic congressional leaderVirginia Foxx. This is the climate in which Danny Fox, MIT Linguistics & Philosophy Department Head, and other colleagues would decide what we can or cannot teach at MIT, as determined by fear of political backlash! This saga is all documented ina very long email threadfrom December 5, 2023 to June 9, 2024. But in retrospect I should not have been surprised by this Palestine exception in my department under the veil of curricular “fitness” or lack thereof. In addition to its political motivation, this particular Palestine exception seems related to an overly narrowmission statementthat separates our linguistics curriculum from the central roles of language ineducation,human rightsandsocial justice for Indigenous communities. Given linguists’ work on these key issues, I’ve offered anamended mission statement, to no avail — as if liberatory linguistics, the revitalization of Indigenous languages and the role of language for social justice were all outside the scope of linguistics proper! Then, in trying to justify their censorship of my course proposal, my MIT Linguistics colleagues, after appealing to our outdated and narrow mission statement, appealed to a paragraph in MIT’sReport on Free Expressionregarding freedom of teaching whereby “faculty do not have total discretion over their course content. For example, a class titled ‘Beginning Chinese’ cannot be taught as an advanced calculus class.” In effect, my colleagues are saying that the study of language and linguistics for the sake of decolonization and liberation — a topic that I’ve worked on for decades — is equivalent to the study of Chinese in a calculus class! Am I the “invisible man” of MIT Linguistics? On June 7, 2024, in the latest round of this saga about genocide-related language — a saga that started with yelling and profanities from my department head on December 8, 2023 — I am now being told by the same Department Head and by the Directors of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies at MIT Linguistics that my course proposal is still not approved because I have not “engaged inproductive conversationabout my proposed class” and because their “efforts to initiate anyreal communicationwith me wererepeatedly rejected” (emphases added . Such statements are yet another round of Orwellian doublespeak when we considerthe 39-page email thread about this course, includingthe 2-page course descriptionthat I provided since April 10 — with many more details and much longer in advance than any previous proposals for “Special Topics” linguistics seminars in my 28 years at MIT. I have provided extensive details about my course, in writing, even though I had already realized that I was the target of a Palestine exception. Do the linguists at MIT really considerwrittencommunications with all sorts of details about my course proposal — themes, readings, guest speakers, learning objectives, etc. — outside the category of realcommunication”? Should I follow the lead of my department head and yell profanities to express disagreement with my colleagues in order for me to engage in what they call “productive conversation”? Now, to go back to MIT President Kornbluth, if, despite freedom of speech and academic freedom, she still judges that I am “out of bounds” for joining protests against genocide and against MIT’s role in it while I am also being censored by my department apparently due to political disagreements about Palestine and Israel, how can the same Kornbluth appeal to “academic freedom” as a license for MIT faculty’s complicity in genocide with an Israeli state whose Prime Minister calls her own students “Nazis” when they protest this complicity? And, perhaps most importantly, what about MIT’s “red lights” principle, adopted from theSuri reportwritten after the university’s fiasco with an actual rapist, Jeffrey Epstein? This report led to an “elevated-risk project review process” that prohibits MIT faculty’s collaboration in projects whose “research outcomes will be used in ways that would infringe on political, human, or civil rights in a foreign country, or where the engagement will indirectly legitimize violations of political, human, or civil rights in that country” or projects with “the risk to the MIT community of providing support for actions that run counter to MIT’s core values, or that are not aligned with its academic mission, or that might lead to discrimination between members of our community.” Are MIT’s “core values” compatible with MIT faculty aiding and abetting genocide as part of their “academic freedom”? Are MIT’s “core values” compatible with attacks on the academic freedom of MIT faculty proposing a seminar to help demystify the weaponizing of language in service of genocide? Those students in the encampment were demanding nothing more, and will accept nothing less, than MIT applying the red lights in Suri report, which entailsa halttoMIT’s collaborationwith the Zionist project and with the red line that Israel has crossed in Gaza — collaboration that violates MIT’s core values, but that MIT president Sally Kornbluth calls “vibrant.” Recall that MIT faculty who collaborated with Epstein were asked by MIT administrators to publiclyapologizebecause of their engagement with a pedophile rapist — not an hypothetical one. Now it’s a senior administrator who compares the SAGE students to some hypothetical rapists in terms of the alleged threats they represent to the MIT community. Kornbluth herself appeals to “academic freedom” in order to trump human rights and allow MIT’s complicity with genocide to continue. Yet she and no one in her administration are saying or doing anything to preempt actual violations of academic freedom as in the case of my proposed seminar. This raises four final questions for now: Why is the MIT Administration so disproportionately punishing students who have broken relatively minor rules in their acts of civil disobedience while the same administration is breakingthe very rulesthat were explicitly designed to put“red lights”on MIT’s contributions to the worst crimes against humanity? Why this Palestine exception? Why is MIT willing, in order to defend Israel, to sacrifice the very essence of what an institution of higher education means and is supposed to stand for? Why have my colleagues at MIT Linguistics, for the past 6 months, attempted to censor the contents of a seminar whose very objectives — including analyses of language in the service of dehumanization and genocide — are in line with MIT’s mottos #MITMindHandHeart for a #BetterWorld? Michel DeGraff is professor of linguistics at MIT, co-founder and co-director of the MIT-Haiti Initiative, and a founding member of the Haitian Creole Academy.

rice_thresher_2024_11,"ByThresher Editorial Board2/27/24 10:16pm Rice reached a $33.75 million settlement on Feb. 23 in the financial aid “cartel” lawsuit that alleged Rice, as well as 16 other peer institutions, unfairly limited aid for students at need-blind universities. Nine other universities have also settled in the case. Rice maintains that it has provided the necessary financial aid for students and did not collude to decrease aid. But with tuitionset to increase by 4.5%for continuing students and 9.9% for matriculating students, simply providing aid may not be enough. Rice must be more transparent about exactly how financial aid is calculated so that students can better advocate for their needs. In recent years, Rice has endeavored to expand its financial aid policies with varied results. The Rice Investment, launched for the 2019-2020 school year, granted an additional $7 million in aid, Vice President for Enrollment Yvonne Romero da Silvatold the Thresher at the time. However, international students arenot eligibleto apply and information about inflation increase over time is not given on the Rice Investment website. For eligible students, the program has beendeemed a success, but not all students are eligible and the amount of aid they may receive can be unclear. 75% of Rice graduatesare debt-free, with an average federal student loan debt of $13,460, according to The Rice Investment’s 2021 Impact Report. Rice touts itself as meeting 100% of demonstrated need. Despite this,Thresher reportinglast semester showed that some low-income students struggle to receive the money they were promised, demonstrating a greater need for transparency in not only how financial aid packages are disbursed, but also how they adequately address socio-economic gaps. As wages across the country remain stagnant while inflation rises, it’s critical that Rice shares the extent to which the The Rice Investment has actually increased in response to inflation and pledges to match increases in tuition accordingly. Beyond increased transparency, there are other ways that Rice can expand the financial aid that it provides. Although Rice is considered a need-blind university, this policy does not apply to themajorityof international students, whomake up 13%of the class of 2027. Brown Universityannounced in Januarythat it would extend its need-blind admissions policy to international students. Other universities such as Dartmouth and Yale are also need-blind for international students. By following their lead, Rice could increase global diversity and make enrollment more accessible to students who may not be able to afford a total cost of attendance that now exceeds $80,000. Whether or not these universities have actually limited aid to deserving students, need-blind aid policies as they are currently applied seem to be more blind to students than they are to administrators, particularly at elite private colleges like those included in the lawsuit. 57% of Rice undergraduates receive financial aid, so the majority of students are reliant on receiving some or all of their tuition from the university with little recourse if something goes wrong. As with last semester, students feel that they are still being left in the dark by an unresponsive, secretive institution while their concerns for theirs and their family’s finances steadily loom. Like our peers at theBrown Daily Heraldand theEmory Wheel, we encourage the Rice administration to do more to make higher education accessible and to be transparent about financial aid. Tuition continues to rise disproportionately compared to inflation and thus to the aid given by The Rice Investment. International students, undocumented students and many others are too easily left behind by the current system of financial aid distribution. Students deserve to know why they are granted the money that they get and receive adjustments if they feel that it is insufficient to cover the costs of a highly selective university like Rice. Continuing to disburse financial aid in a closed-off and out-of-touch manner will only serve to limit opportunities for students and diminish their trust in Rice’s institutions.

April is the month of many things: Beer Bike, a solar eclipse, the last day of classes and, perhaps lesser known, Earth Month. As Rice launches a series of Earth Month events, I would like to address our potential as a campus community to be more environmentally conscious, particularly in an effort to make this campus more friendly to birds. The academic year’s close means this issue will be our last until the fall semester, which gave us some time to reflect on what our editorial for our last issue should look like. S.RES 02, titled “Student Association Boycott and Divestment from Corporations Complicit in the Ongoing Genocide in Gaza,” was presented to the Student Association on March 25. This resolution proposes the creation of an Ethical Spending Advisory Board designed to ensure that Blanket Tax funds are not dedicated to corporations that are complicit in Israeli colonial violence and apartheid based on guidelines created by the BDS movement.
