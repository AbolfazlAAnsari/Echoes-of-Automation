minnpost_2024_110,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Your name was a mystery to me until I set out to become a historian of ancient Rome.“Res Publica” was the Latin designation for the Roman state, adopted when sovereignty rested with its people, as opposed to a king. It meant the “people’s thing.” Here the Roman people exercised power through assemblies that elected officials and passed legislation.Your founders did not imagine a democratic state on their own. From the Greeks and Romans, they borrowed building blocks for a new country where the people held power and prevented would-be tyrants to the greatest extent possible.These former colonists shaped executive, legislative, and judicial branches to collaborate and limit each other’s power, in part modeled on the balanced organs of the Roman Republic.The adoption of “Republic” as your name acknowledged the debt.So I ask you, how is it that we have acted so out of step with the Roman Republic? How is it that your U.S. Supreme Court has granted immunity to the President for all official acts — even after the expiration of the office?Even the Roman statesman Julius Caesar would have been liable to prosecution when he lost the magisterial power (what Romans called “imperium” accompanying the political offices of “consul” and “proconsul” that he was to hold between 59 and 49 BCE.The consulship was the chief executive office of the ancient Romans (proconsuls held power comparable but limited to a defined region . Unlike our presidency, however, the Romans had two consuls at a time, elected annually, to avoid having one individual with too much power. One consul could veto the other’s political action.In 59 BCE, when Caesar was consul for the first time, his consular colleague Marcus Bibulus tried to block his efforts, which included passing measures through the Roman people’s assemblies rather than the state’s advisory body of the senate. This approach was legal but unusual, elevating the power of the masses over the aristocracy (championed by the senate . Bibulus preferred aristocratic interests and so tried to thwart Caesar by declaring day after day religiously inauspicious and so inappropriate for public business.Caesar, however, understood that true piety played no role for Bibulus. He pressed on with his agenda, to the agitation of many senators.After his consulship, Caesar secured a proconsulship over Gaul (largely modern France and carried out a ten-year campaign of conquest. The position expanded his prestige and resources in advance of a second run for consul.Caesar knew that upon his completion of the proconsulship in 49 BCE, his enemies would bring him to trial, claiming his actions as consul were illegal. As a result, he planned to run for consul again in 49 for 48 BCE. In this way, upon election, he could postpone prosecution.In the Roman Republic, an important inspiration for you, the Republic of the United States of America, executive authority was not without limits. There was no perpetual immunity for official acts. After one’s year as consul (or other government position with imperium , one could be prosecuted for acts in office determined to have been illegal.Yes, it is possible that political enemies could abuse the system for partisan purposes, perhaps as Caesar’s enemies desired to act. In fact, they were so enthusiastic they accelerated termination of Caesar’s proconsulship in 49 BCE, requiring him to return early to Rome to stand trial. The attempt led Caesar to initiate a civil war, leading to his temporary mastery over the Roman state . Perhaps the Supreme Court’s decision to entrench presidential immunity for official acts may help to prevent this range of disorders.But it is a gamble — one Romans refused to take. They understood, it seems better than us, that a Republic is fragile and needs the strongest safeguards possible.The Supreme Court has just eliminated one of them.So, my Republic, I fear for you now more than before.I grew up in a labor household that cherished you and the democratic precepts that gave all your citizens a stake, power and security in your well-being. I wish I did not now need to explain this aberration to my children. It has impoverished their democratic inheritance.Jason Schlude is a professor of Classics and history at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John’s University."

There s a sharp difference between what’s promised in the rhetoric vs. what actually happens when the cost of reality sets in.If you’ve ever run a small business or talked to a business owner, you might have heard the phrase “under promise, over deliver” as a strategy for customer service.Unfortunately, when it comes to school voucher planslike those being considered by Pennsylvania lawmakersthis spring, what happens is the opposite of a sound investment: a lot of overpromising ahead of woeful under-delivery.As an experton school vouchers, I think about the idea of what’s promised in the rhetoric vs. what actually happens when the realcost sets in. To hear voucher lobbyists tell it — usually working forbillionaires like Betsy DeVos, or Pennsylvania’s ownJeff Yass— all that’s needed to move American education forward is a fully privatized market of school choice, where parents are customers and education is the product.AsI testified to Pennsylvania lawmakerslast fall, however, vouchers are the education equivalent of predatory lending.One promise that never holds up is the idea thatstates can affordto create voucher systems that underwrite private tuition for some children, while still keeping public school spending strong.Other states that have passed or expanded voucher systems have rarely been able to sustain new investments in public schools. Even when those voucher bills also came with initial increases in public education funding.Six out of the last sevenstates to pass such bills have failed to keep up with just the national average in public school investment.But for children and families — especially those who have been traditionally underserved by schools at different points in U.S. history — the cost of school vouchers goes beyond the price for taxpayers.Although most voucher users in other states (about 70% were, in fact, in private schools first, the academic results for the kids who transfer are disastrous. Statewide vouchers have led to some of the largest academic declinesin the history of education research— drops in performance that were on par with howCOVID-19 or Hurricane Katrinaaffected student learning.Although school vouchers have enjoyed fits and starts of bipartisan support from time to time, today’s push for universal voucher systems across the country is almost entirely the product of conservative politics.All 12 statesthat created or expanded some form of a voucher system in 2023 voted for Donald Trump in 2020. Of those that passed voucher laws since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, only two (Arizona and New Hampshire voted for Joe Biden that election year.In states likeArkansasandIowa, voucher laws either immediately followed or immediately preceded extreme new restrictions on reproductive care, aweakening of child labor laws, and other conservative policy priorities.And this isn’t just about electoral politics. The right-wing origins of school vouchers have real day-to-day implications for who gets to use them and who is left out. We know from states likeFlorida,Indiana, andWisconsinthat the latest voucher bills allow schools to discriminate against certain children if schools can claim they do so for religious reasons.Today’s push for universal voucher systems across the country is almost entirely the product of conservative politics.Who pays that particular price? Examples includestudents with disabilitiesand children and parents from LGBTQ families, who may be asked to leave or not even admitted at all. And that’s because when it comes to vouchers, it’s not really school choice at all. Families don’t get their choice of schools; instead, schools get their choice of which families to admit.And the price tag for all of this usually comes in wildly over budget anyway. The big culprit for those cost overruns goes back to who actually gets a voucher. Because most voucher users werein private schools first— paid by the private sector before — voucher costs are actually new expenditures taxpayers have to make. In the worst-case scenario, Arizona, vouchers costmore than 1,000%beyond what their advocates first promised.Despite claims some supporters make that vouchers are part of an efficient education market, the result is really the opposite of any strategy a successful business would recognize.To put it plainly: The promises rarely pan out, and eventually, the check comes due.Joshua M.

But it’s not Biden. | OpinionRecently, a dozen or so residents of myRoxboroughretirement community piled into a handicap-accessible van, bound for a matinee ofLadysitting, now at the Arden Theatre. Lorene Cary, Philadelphia’sfavorite novelist-playwright-librettist-arts-impresario-Penn professor, had turned her acclaimed memoir of the same name into a play about one very old person: her centenarian grandmother. The play is about Nana at the end of her life, when she moved in with Cary — and her family. It wasn’t pretty. So Cary wrote about it.In another recent world-premiere play,My Mama and the Full-Scale Invasion(recently at the Wilma Theater , the playwright’s mother, Olga, is insisting on toughing out the current war in Kyiv, Ukraine, bombs be damned.The two plays couldn’t be less alike; their protagonists’ nationality, class, history, and current situations are wildly different. Yet, I couldn’t help noticing similarities between the two old women at the center. Olga and Nana are at the ends of their tethers, but not too far gone to be stubborn — to whine, sulk, insult, and guilt-trip.“My whole address book is dead,” moans Olga in Kyiv.“You want me dead,” blurts Nana to her granddaughter, as the younger woman loses patience with her patient.After seeing both, one thought came to mind:So that’s how they see us. Hmph.On a purely personal level, those of us over the age of 75 are described by turns as pains in the butt and pitiable. On a deeper level, there is a begrudging respect for our sheer tenacity and courage in the face of pain, loss, and terror. And history.When I see younger people talking about my cronies, they seem to give us credit for surviving war, scarcity, injustice, and pestilence. But what was our alternative?To be sure, we had our share of misfortune — we grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression and World War II. We lived through the twilight of Jim Crow. These were not auspicious beginnings. (Anyone who thinks the world needs to be Made Great Again wasn’t born Black, LGBTQ, Jewish, Asian, disabled, or female in the 1930s. But too many people forget about all the lucky breaks we got. Many of us have, in the end, benefited from relative plenty, liberating innovation, progress in medicine and science (I was 17 years old when the polio vaccine appeared , the arc of history’s bent toward justice, and, just in time, Wikipedia — what we have instead of brains.I was 17 years old when the polio vaccine appeared.From childhood on, we’ve been the most scrutinized, criticized, idealized, spied-upon, attention-grabbing group in history.As teenagers, we scared the pants off our elders, includingJ. Edgar Hoover, who warned in 1953, “The nation can expect an appalling increase in the number of crimes that will be committed by teenagers in the years ahead.” On the heels of Alfred Kinsey’s report on our sex lives, scientists soonbrought us the birth control pillin 1960. Next thing you know, along with having sex without getting pregnant, we were reading Betty Friedan’sFeminist Mystique(1963 , reinventing pop music, heeding the calls of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, marching for civil rights and against the war, and making trouble — good and bad. Yet, they call usthe Silent Generation. Are you kidding?(Of course, baby boomers — the generation after mine — were there for some of that, too. But this isn’t about them; they get enough attention. It’s the job of each generation to challenge those who came before, but none of our uppity behavior sat well with our parents. I recall family dinner table conversations among veterans who’d landed on Normandy’s beaches and peaceniks protesting the Vietnam War. We called our elders sexist, racist, homophobic Neanderthals. They called us degenerate, unpatriotic, clueless jerks. In the end, we tolerated — and loved — each other, because, again, what was the alternative?It is, in the end, the job of young people to misread their elders, and the job of elders to endure it and laugh. Now we’re the elders, and it’s our turn to be misread, and to endure it.(For the sake of argument, I’d define my cohort as hardworking, skeptical, cautiously rebellious, and resilient. Recently, after the popularTV seriesThe Golden Bachelor(featuring a 72-year-old bachelor , The Inquirer ran astory about the sex lives of local seniors. A professor of geriatrics at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine was quoted saying there are retirement homes in Philadelphia resembling “college dorms, with people hopping in and out of each other’s apartments at night.”I haven’t polled my peers aboutthatsubject. If I had, they’d have likely answered, “None of your beeswax” — the schoolyard parlance of the 1940s. But we are your business, just as you — our children and grandchildren — once were ours.In any case, I hope all the talk of 80-year-olds around the upcoming election doesn’t turn against our age group. Because while our ranks are thinning out along with our hair, a tsunami of old folks is approaching in the form of aging baby boomers. If you think we’re trouble, just you wait.Rebecca Pepper Sinkler was an editor at The Inquirer in the 1970s and ‘80s. She lives in Roxborough."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_260,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Before we explore this divisive issue, I want to be clear that I believe capitalism has done more to lift people out of poverty than any other social and economic system in history. But don’t kid yourself that we live in a country that embraces “free market” capitalism. As we embark on this exploration, please know that I’m not suggesting we embrace policies that create disincentives to work, and work hard. Nor am I suggesting that we embrace policies that guarantee equal outcomes for all Americans. Rather, we need to evolve capitalism and break out of the political narratives that constrain that objective.I write a lot about dogma and political narratives and how they are shaping our culture. One of the primary political narratives that impede progress is the notion that the GOP’s “conservative” policies are responsible for driving economic growth. We will revisit that in an upcoming article. Another, and the one that I want to explore today, is the narrative that the Democratic Party’s economic policies are tantamount to “socialism.” The crux of the issue is that the political right has weaponized the word “socialism” to vilify any policy that helps the working class. To highlight the absurdity, Fox News once used “socialism” to criticize Warren Buffett when he publicly supported raising taxes on the very wealthy.So here’s my question: Philosophically, is there really a difference between what the GOP asserts as “socialism” and, let’s say, the Paycheck Protection Program and employee retention credit monies, or trillion-dollar bailouts, or massive tax cuts for the ultra wealthy that the GOP supports and advocates for? If you’re able to see the proverbial elephant in the room (pun intended , you’ll be forced to conclude that the only difference is … the recipients of the money. When the top quartile (e.g., the investor or shareholder class gets a government subsidy, then it’s the epitome of “free market capitalism,” but when the bottom 70 percent get it, then it is“ socialism.”Let’s remember that most countries in the world — including the United States of America — have mixed economies and none of them fit neatly into one economic model. The word “socialism” has basically lost all practical meaning in political discourse.Unfortunately, both sides of the aisle have demonized and reframed words like “socialism” and “capitalism” to their own political ends. Yet, the political parties in America rarely align their ideology with either system. The fact is that the traditional definitions of socialism and/or capitalism don’t actually fit the current political narratives in the United States. Let’s take a look at where these terms came from and where they are across a political spectrum.So what do all these ideologies mean in simple terms?Capitalism is centered on private ownership and the free market, allowing individuals and corporations to seek unlimited profits. However, unregulated capitalism can lead to issues like wealth concentration, child labor and environmental harm.Communism aims for a classless society where the government controls production and distribution. This system seeks absolute equality but often results in authoritarian regimes due to its reliance on force for wealth redistribution.Socialism combines elements of capitalism and communism, advocating for some free market mechanisms alongside significant government control of major industries to distribute wealth more equitably. However, it is prone to corruption and can lean towards authoritarianism.Democratic socialism supports social ownership of key industries and rejects authoritarianism. It favors strong social safety nets and believes workers should receive a fair share of profits, opposing Soviet-style planned economies.Social democracy blends free-market capitalism with government intervention to ensure social justice. It promotes gradual, peaceful change, prioritizing equality of welfare and opportunity over absolute equality. Social democracies maintain strong social safety nets within a capitalist framework.So where can we look for a common sense approach to a more moderate form of social welfare that closes the wealth gap and leads to better outcomes for our citizenry? Social democracies are indeed capitalist systems with really strong social safety nets and have proven to be very successful at promoting fairness within their citizenry.Have you ever wondered why Scandinavian countries are doing so well? According to many, they are successful because their politics and economy are based on a political ideology that does not reject capitalism, while at the same time offers a form of socialism. It sounds contradictory, but social democracy is an ideology that does just that. Even more interesting — and maybe it’s cultural — but these countries also rank highest on a well-respected“anti-corruption” index. You’ll note that the good old USA ranks 24th on this list.We need to realize that if we don’t course correct, and quickly, we will find ourselves in the midst of a second American Civil War. Even before the assassination attempt on the life of former President Trump, Ray Dalio wrote in Time that the odds are increasing of a Civil War.Isn’t it time to stop believing the rhetoric and dogma that is tearing us apart so that we can begin to marginalize the extremes in both parties, and their ideologies and fear-mongering?There are concrete ways that we can modernize and adapt capitalism that would lead to better outcomes for society as a whole, end the class wars that divide us, and work to ensure that the American Dream survives and thrives into the next century.Sturner, the author of “Fairness Matters,” is the managing partner of Entourage Effect Capital.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
suffolknewsherald_2024_15,"Published 4:05 pm Wednesday, July 3, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy Jason StumpUntil Thursday, June 27, I had not watched a presidential debate, or State of The Union Address, since sometime shortly after 9/11. Frankly, they didn’t serve any good purpose for me. I get my news from what I hope to be better places, and I hate to see the poor behavior and lack of decorum from so-called leaders and public servants.However, I decided to try again recently. I lasted two minutes. Two minutes before I just couldn’t see any value in adding one more second of it to my life, or the country, and community, I love.Now, don’t get me wrong. I do my absolute best not to miss an election. Even when it’s “just” a local election or primary.That night reminded me that debates have long ago lost their value. In a good debate, one with a greater cause in everyone’s mind, ideas could be presented orderly. They would be listened to, reflected upon, and thoughtfully countered. If everyone is truly there for a greater cause than simply “winning” a verbal version of a professional wrestling cage match, thoughtful people might actually find common ground, and later they, or others, could collaborate on helpful solutions.The wise words of the former rap star, Vanilla Ice, “Stop! Collaborate and Listen” seems like some of the best advice political figures could take these days. Well, we all could benefit from that.The evening of the debate, and the next day, my social media feeds were full of people in shock over just how bad it was. Really? You didn’t see this coming? You may think that’s a dig at the two men in that debate. It is. It’s also more than that. It’s a dig at us. I’ve witnessed local elections and meetings in several states. I’ve seen the behavior of adults in policymaking and problem-solving from the parish halls to city halls. It’s sadly — more often than it should be — just like that debate.Not long ago, I was in conflict with someone in a church setting — someone I care about very much. I decided to take the time to review an old book on conflict management from seminary. Doing so reminded me that my top two conflict styles are persuasion and collaboration. Both are useful, depending upon the setting, but in this case, both myself and the other were relying initially upon persuasion. It was the wrong choice in this case. Trying to disprove, discount or downgrade the other’s opinion wasn’t the right choice. Thankfully, we never did that to each other’s character, just our positions. Mutually, we decided to switch our approach to collaboration. We actually took the advice of Vanilla Ice. We stopped, paused for a period of time, listened to our own words, and others, and then started from where we found common ground. Truly, it was a loving experience. Sure, we might still disagree on things, but we found those things which are more important than that. We also found value even in our disagreements.Many of you are familiar with the parable when Jesus speaks of the seed sower throwing some seeds along the path, the rocks and the thorns, none of which would bear fruit. Still, some seeds did land in the good soil, and they produced “a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.”My good people, finding common ground from which we can collaborate is that soil. You may have to dig deep with each other to get there, but we must. We must set the example at the most local and personal levels of our lives and government. Most of our lives, that’s the level of government we will spend the bulk of our time with. Sow those seeds now. We may never eat of their fruit in our lifetime. However, when we finally come through whatever mess we have ourselves in now, perhaps enough of us will have set the example for a new generation of public servants and voters to do better.I have hope, and I’m committed to creating more of it in this world. How about you?The next time you find yourself in need of some good advice,might you consider that of Vanilla Ice?The MLB schedule today is not one to miss. The outings include the Los Angeles Dodgers squaring off…Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field. Among those contests is the Los Angeles…"

The energy in the convention center, the range of engaging performances and displays, the diversity of people in Honolulu, all combined for an amazing experience even if I could only attend for a couple of hours.Like many people from Hawaii Island, I was privileged to attend a small part of the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture, or FestPAC. The energy in the convention center, the range of engaging performances and displays, the diversity of people in Honolulu, all combined for an amazing experience even if I could only attend for a couple of hours.Because so many of our Pacific colleagues were on Oahu, there was also opportunity to convene higher education meetings. In these meetings we discussed shared opportunities and challenges, and made commitments to work together.Rather than looking at the Pacific as a barrier that separates island states, territories, and nations, we understand through these collaborative conversations that this vast ocean actually connect us. At UH Hilo we have standing partnerships that draw us closer to other Pacific communities. One of these, of which I am particularly proud given my interest in undergraduate student interest, is the Islands of Opportunity Alliance, funded by the National Science Foundation Louis A. Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP .This partnership provides undergraduates, particularly first-generation college students and/or historically underserved students who are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders, with funds to take on research, present their research, and gain important professionals skills and opportunities. UH Hilo is the lead campus, but the Alliance includes Manoa, Chaminade, Hawaii Pacific University, the University of Guam, and community colleges in Guam, Northern Marianas, Palau, Marshall Islands, American Samoa, and Micronesia.LSAMP programs are geared toward STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math careers, and our Islands of Opportunity Alliance encourages students to combine traditional knowledge and modern science as they address the problems of today, such as climate change and endangered species protection. We know that indigenous island communities were resilient long before the advent of modern scientific thinking and that they have much to contribute to our current conversations. What makes these programs in Pacific Islands so powerful is the interweaving of knowledge from different sources, the generations of lived experience combined with the theories of modern science.Far too often, indigenous students and students of color generally had historically been made to feel that they are at a disadvantage, and the way in which higher education was designed to serve only the privileged meant that an important part of our populations felt unwelcome. Colleges and universities in the past sought to improve their reputations by how many people they left behind. By treating indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage as the asset that it so clearly is, we level the playing field, to use the cliche.Another asset our students often bring is knowledge of a language other than English. Students who master English as a second (or third language tend to out perform those whose linguistic experience is limited to a single language or only a class or two in that second language. By looking at difference in new ways, those of us working at universities open our own thinking as well. Embracing the confluence of knowledge, truly tapping into its power, might help us to address another common problem, that of out migration from our islands.Seeing the rich variety of cultural, artistic and linguistic traditions on display at FestPAC is truly inspiring. If we see islands as isolated, we fail to recognize the richness and combined strength of Pacific culture. Certainly leading institutions that are spread across different islands presents some true challenges, but it also makes us more creative. We are not only different people, we do things in different ways than those who live on those large continents on either side of us. Our students learn the importance of resilience; they learn the value of their own identity and heritage, and they realize that even with the differences among us, we have important things in common as well.Island cultures, steeped in centuries of sustainable practices, disaster recovery, and cooperation, have much to teach the rest of the world, and our Pacific Island universities can lead the way.

minnpost_2024_83,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In Minnesota, hogs outnumber humans. With roughly 15 million pigs sold each year, Minnesota is the second largest pork producing state in the nation.As of Jan. 1, new animal welfare legislation known as Proposition 12 took full effect in California, impacting thousands of Minnesota hog farmers. Approved by California voters in 2018 and upheld by the Supreme Court in 2023, Prop 12 establishes minimum space allowances for egg-laying hens, breeding pigs and calves raised for veal. The law also prohibits the sale of meat and eggs from producers that do not comply with these requirements.As some Minnesota hog farmers adapt to Prop 12, we have an opportunity to reconsider conventional agricultural practices and raise the ethical standard for animal farming in our state.Many Minnesota hog farmers use gestation crates, which prevent breeding pigs from comfortably turning around or lying down for most of their lives. Under the new law, Minnesota hog farmers who choose to sell their pork products to California must provide each animal with a minimum of 24 square feet of floor space. According to recent reporting in the Star Tribune, Minnesota pork producers state that the costs to upgrade their facilities to comply with Prop 12 are significant.The extreme confinement of breeding pigs is just one of the many horrors of hog farming in Minnesota. Hogs are highly intelligent and emotional animals, but roughly 98% of pigs in the U.S. spend their lives confined to factory farms. Packed into industrial warehouses by the thousands, pigs are unable to properly socialize or express natural behaviors. In these grim conditions, pigs suffer extreme boredom and isolation, without access to dirt, companionship or sunshine.A recent investigation of a pig-breeding operation in southeastern Minnesota owned by pork giant Holden Farms revealed egregious abuses. Undercover video depicts workers feeding mother pigs a mixture of dead piglet intestines, bodily fluids and feces. Additional footage shows workers beating mother pigs on a routine basis, including those who are too sick or injured to walk. One undercover investigator described Holden Farms as a “house of horrors.” (Editor’s note: Holden Farms, inresponding toallegations in a federal complaint, said it adheres to “high-quality animal care standards” .According to polling data, most pork consumers in the U.S. believe that the use of gestation crates is objectionable. California voters aren’t the only ones taking action to better align their agricultural practices with their values. In 2016, Massachusetts voters approved similar legislation, banning the sale of pork products from breeding pigs confined to pens. Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, and Rhode Island have all banned gestation crates.Acclaimed primatologist Jane Goodall once said: “Farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are far more aware and intelligent than we ever imagined. They are individuals in their own right.”Research supports Goodall’s claim. Farm animals are surprisingly intellectually and socially complex. Cognitive assessments rank pigs’ intelligence above dogs and even 3-year-old human children. Pigs form strong social bonds show empathy towards fellow pigs and express a diverse array of emotions, such as joy, sorrow and stress. Some studies suggest pigs may even act altruistically, seeking to help another pig if it is confined to a separate enclosure from the rest of the group.To protect our moral legacy and show kindness to the animals born into our food system, the least we can do is provide them with enough space to turn around, lie down and extend their limbs. Prop 12 creates challenges for many Minnesota hog farmers, but the challenges are worth embracing. As a leading agricultural state, Minnesota must raise the standard of care for farm animals and pave the way towards a more humane future."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_149,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It is somehow fitting that the International Criminal Court prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants against leaders of both Hamas and Israel in connection with mass slaughters carried out since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and Israel’s response.ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.All parties unsurprisingly expressed outrage that they would be deemed equally complicit in an endless war that in its latest iteration has resulted in the deaths of more than 30,000 noncombatants.Linking Israeli and Palestinian leaders in this fashion is a tragic and thoroughly depressing reminder that there were once more hopeful times. In 1994, their predecessors — Israeli leaders Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat — were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for moving from avowed eternal enmity and armed force to attempted reconciliation.“We who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today, in a loud and clear voice, enough of blood and tears,” Rabin said to Arafat in a 1993 White House ceremony. “Enough!”The Oslo Accords intended to pave the way to Palestinian statehood were never fully embraced. Arafat was discredited by Islamic activists for making peace, and his successors lost control of Gaza to Hamas. Rabin was assassinated in 1995 by an Israeli claiming to be acting on orders from God, and his successors encouraged continued Jewish settlement on Palestinian lands in the West Bank.Before Oslo, there were the Camp David Accords, which resulted in mutual recognition of Egypt and Israel, return of the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula to Egypt and a commitment to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The notion of “land for peace” became current. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat were awarded the 1978 Nobel Peace Prize.Sadat was assassinated in 1981.Begin, Peres and Rabin, Arafat and Sadat — they were spokesmen for bitter enemies, who attempted to destroy the other, much as Netanyahu and Gallant promise to destroy Hamas and Sinwar, Deif and Haniyeh vow to destroy Israel. They all succeeded at killing tens of thousands of people, including their own. After doing so, the earlier generations of warriors and terrorists turned into peacemakers, but they are now gone, and the momentum for destruction remains.Enemies who were once connected by peacemaking efforts are now enemies who may be linked soon in arrest warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The important point is not legalistic arguments over who bears the greatest moral or legal responsibility. The point is that they are linked. Neither side earns a Nobel Peace Prize or an arrest warrant without the other, nor are they ever likely to.However committed each is to eliminating the other from the face of the Earth, neither has much chance of success.

Or have you thought about or planned a family trip to a place you’ve never been before, and it’s just a matter of time and funding that hinders or prevents you from going or visiting?As they say, stop waiting; start living now — this present moment. You’ll be glad and grateful you did. Life in the present moment is precious.As a student of life and literature, I’m inspired and challenged, which made me ponder and contemplate doing something positive besides writing this article after reading a simple but thought-provoking poem, ‘Muere Lentamente,’ in English, ‘You Start Dying Slowly.’ Purportedly written by Brazilian poet Martha Madeiros, it was originally attributed to 1971 Nobel Laureate Pablo Neruda.Born Ricardo Eliecer Naftali Reyes Basoalto (1904-1973 , Pablo Neruda was a Chilean poet, diplomat, and politician who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971.Considered the national poet of Chile, Neruda wrote various poetry styles like historical, surrealistic, political manifestos, and passionate love poems.His poem “You Start Dying Slowly” captured my attention as I try to enjoy my golden years. What struck me most about this poem was its direct simplicity in stating what one can expect if one doesn’t do something to keep oneself busy while alive.Neruda’s poem, ‘You Start Dying Slowly,’ starts with conditional phrases or statements using the conjunction ‘if.’Have you considered doing, changing, or modifying something that can motivate or inspire you to get busy and productive while trying to enjoy or live your life to the fullest while alive and well?Do you see yourself experiencing any of Neruda’s situations? What do you think? What plan will you have, if any, to revive, enliven, and transform your life?How you should lead your life is the central theme of Neruda’s poem. Simply stated, it’s up to you how you live your life to the fullest, to be meaningful and worthwhile or worth living. If you want to leave a lasting legacy, a memorable life experience that’s worth sharing and remembering, just do it now and not later on. Who knows, that “later on” may not happen.Neruda’s life experiences remind us of positive things that can help prolong our lives on earth.There you go, folks.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_237,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In the gilded, overwhelmingly ornate main room of his Mar-a-Lago resort and estate, former President Donald Trump stood in front of four huge American flags Thursday and pinballed through a press conference unlike anything ever seen in presidential campaigning.Trump performed much like those steel pinballs that bounced and banged off spring-cushioned blobs beneath the glass tops of those flashing, clanging bar game machines that were all the rage in the last century. Trump bounced and banged from one false claim to nasty name-calling to fake statistics to feel-good promises and then back to the next false claim.If you thought each seemed astonishingly unrelated to whatever came before and/or was about to follow, well the problem wasn’t you. America’s 45th president seemed determined to become a one-man public works jobs provider for media fact-checkers.Actually, there was one organizing theme to Trump’s pressorama: size matters. He returned to the theme he fixated upon on Day One of his presidency, when he ordered his press secretary to tell you Trump’s Inauguration crowd was the largest ever. On Thursday, Trump kept returning to brag about his crowd sizes.When a questioner asked about Vice President Kamala Harris’s large and enthusiastic crowds, Trump responded by pinballing wildly. All that follows here was in one answer (which I have condensed as a favor to your sanity :“Oh, give me a break. …I’m so glad you asked, what did she have yesterday? 2,000 people. If I ever had 2,000 people, you’d say my campaign is finished. It’s so dishonest the press.…“I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size…. If I were president, you wouldn’t have Russia and Ukraine, would’ve never happened. Zero chance. You wouldn’t have had October 7th of Israel. You wouldn’t have the horrible withdrawal… from Afghanistan…. We wouldn’t have had these soldiers killed, and we wouldn’t have had 45 soldiers obliterated, no legs, no arms, the face, none of that would have happened, and you wouldn’t have had inflation….“You wouldn’t have had any inflation, because inflation was caused by their bad energy problems…. But the day after the election, if they won, you’re going to have fuel prices go through the roof. Everybody’s going to be forced to buy an electric car…. People want gasoline propelled cars….“So, but on crowd size in history for any country, nobody’s had crowds like I have…“I have hundreds of thousands of people in South Carolina and 88,000 people…”Whoa. Well, let’s at least fact-check something. How about Trump’s South Carolina crowd of 88,000? Turns out it wasn’t a Trump crowd, after all. He just went to the state’s biggest football game – the Palmetto Bowl, Clemson vs. South Carolina. The announced crowd was 80,172. At halftime, South Carolina’s Republican Gov. Henry McMaster and Trump walked to the center of the field, Trump waved and walked off the field. That’s all.Later in his press conference, Trump compared his Jan. 6, 2021, rally crowd size at the Washington Monument with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s crowd size at the iconic 1963 civil rights “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial.“Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me. If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech – his great speech – and you look at ours, same real estate, same everything, same number of people. If not, we had more.”Today, as we look with our mind’s eye at the visuals of Trump pinballing through a Mar-a-Lago press conference, we can envision the scene of Number 45, if he becomes Number 47, pinballing through America’s presidency. We envision. We decide.EPILOGUE: We also remember another revealing thing about Trump’s Jan. 6, rally where he urged the crowd to go to the Capitol and fight to prevent Congress from certifying his 2020 Electoral College defeat. We especially remember the important testimony – that has just become more poignant than ever – where his aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, testified that Trump told his Secret Service to remove the magnetometers because his rallygoers who had guns weren’t entering the site.“I don’t f-ing care that they have weapons,” she quoted Trump as telling his agents. “They’re not here to hurt me. Take the f-ing mags away. Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here.”We remember. We decide."
minnpost_2024_147,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Among the many Allied military unitsstorming the Normandy coaston June 6, 1944, was the 16th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army’s 1st Infantry Division. Its members faced a particularly daunting task: As part of the first wave of the largest amphibious assault in history, the regiment was assigned to clear the Omaha Beach landing sectors code-named “Easy Red” and “Fox Green.”This was no ordinary assault. Omaha would become themost deadly of the five D-Day landing beaches, as the U.S., U.K. and allied nations attacked Nazi-occupied France in World War II. The liberation of Europe hung in the balance.As the regiment’s members sat down to a steak dinner the night before the invasion, they no doubt thought about the legacy of their unit. As amilitary and oral historian, I researched this particular regiment’s service in Vietnam and became fascinated by its earlier history as well.The 16th Infantry hadfought in the Indian Wars, chased Mexican revolutionary leader Pancho Villa, fought in theBattle of San Juan Hillthat made Theodore Roosevelt a national hero, andsaluted Revolutionary War commander Marquis de Lafayetteat his tomb in Paris as the U.S. entered World War I. By D-Day, the regiment had already participated in the World War IIinvasions of North Africa and Italyin 1942 and 1943.The regiment was so well thought of by the American public that when author F. Scott Fitzgerald created his infamous antihero Jay Gatsby in 1925’s “The Great Gatsby,” the title character was described as aveteran of the 16th Infantry. That steak dinner the night before D-Day, recalledCharles Hangsterfer, then a captain in the 16th Regiment, was “just like they would give a convicted murdererhis last meal on the evening of his execution.”The invasion plan had called forheavy bombardment from warships and airplanesto weaken the German defenses, and for amphibious tanks – which could travel through shallow water and on land – to support the infantry as they hit the beaches.But as dawn broke on June 6, 1944, bad weather intervened. Low clouds meant the bombardments largely missed their targets. Rough seas – swells between 3 and 6 feet, and 25 mph winds – swamped most of the tanks.The troops themselves wereseasick from the pitching and rollingof the small boats they were using to get to the beaches from larger ships offshore, and learned upon landing that their arrival was later than expected, and often far from its intended destination.Ted Lombarski, a sergeant in the 16th’s F Company, recalled:“We were the first wave to hit the beach, Companies E and F of the 16th Infantry. Almost all the tanks that had gone in before us were sunk. The tank crews had a rough time, and so did the navy personnel who drove us in. … As we went in, we knew that the air force had dropped their bombs too far inland and that the navy shelling had done likewise. The first wave went through hell that day.”As they approached Omaha Beach, the men of the 16th Infantry Regiment were met with a wall of enemy fire. The bullets and shrapnel made the oceanappear to be boiling, according to an oral history of the regiment.The landing craft didn’t go as far toward the shore as the soldiers had hoped, Capt. Everett Booth recalled:“They didn’t get us very close to the beach, I’ll tell you. … We ran off into water about chest high. We were met with machine-gun bullets hitting all over the water. … The enemy was riddling the beach with machine-gun fire.”And Lombarski recounted:“Being in that first wave waslike committing suicide. If you exposed yourself, you were dead.”Burdened with weapons, ammunition, equipment and heavy packs, many soldiers were overcome by the sea and drowned. Those who made it to the beach found themselves up against the352nd Infantry Divisionof the Nazi army, a unit with significant combat experience against the Soviets in Eastern Europe.Wounded members of the 16th Infantry Regiment wait for evacuation from the beach on D-Day.National ArchivesDespite the heavy losses and powerful German defense, as the day wore on it became clear that the 16th Infantry Regiment had secured a foothold on Omaha Beach. The soldiers fought through concrete and wooden obstacles the Nazis had placed on the beach, destroyed machine-gun emplacements and cleared enemy troops from key locations one by one.There was no shortage of heroes that day – there were almost too many to count. Two of the four Congressional Medals of Honor awarded for actions on June 6 went to men of the 16th. At the beginning of the morning,1st Lt. Jimmie Montiethexposed himself to enemy fire numerous times, includingleading tanks through a minefield. He led his troops off the beach, organizing the various companies to hold the enemy positions gained by the 16th. Just hours later, he waskilled in a German counterattack.Technician 5th Class John Pinder Jr., though wounded multiple times, made several trips into the fire-riddled surf to collect communications equipment. He helped establish radio contact with his commanders offshore before succumbing to his wounds.They were among thenearly 1,000 casualtiesof the 16th Infantry killed, wounded or missing on D-Day. Despite these heavy losses –roughly one-thirdof the unit’s troops – the regiment’s relentless assault began tobreak through the German defenses, allowing the follow-up forces to push farther and farther inland. Victory was not guaranteed, but it was at hand.Their courage and sacrifice were honored in a July 2, 1944, ceremony at achateau 15 miles inlandfrom the beach. The regiment had earned aPresidential Unit Citationfor its role in the invasion. During the presentation, Allied commander Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower told the regiment:“I’m not going to make a long speech, but this simple little ceremony gives me an opportunity to come over here and, through you, say thanks.You are one of the finest regiments in our army. I know your record from the day you landed in North Africa and through Sicily. I am beginning to think that your regiment is a sort of Praetorian Guard, which goes along with me and gives me luck.”Joseph Harris Carpenteris an oral historian in the Department of History at the University of Texas at Arlington.This article is republished from The Conversation."

minnpost_2024_151,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Clouds of doom continue to hover over the debate about teens’ mental health and the role of technology. This spring, the warnings come from the bestselling book “The Anxious Generation” by sociologist Jonathan Haidt. Some parents and educators are calling for a ban on smartphones and laptops in schools. Others are trying to press pause on the panic by pointing to research that needs a longer look.People feel forced into binary camps of “ban tech” and “don’t ban tech.”But there is a way to reset the conversation that could help parents, educators and kids themselves make better choices about technology. As writers and researchers who focus on thescience of learning, we see a gaping hole in the debate thus far. The problem is that decision-makers keep relying on only two sets of questions and data: One set focuses on questions about how youth are feeling (not so great . The other focuses on how kids are using their time (spending hours on their phones .A third set of questions is missing and needs to be asked: What and how are children and youth learning? Is technology aiding their learning or getting in the way? Think of data on tech and learning as the third leg of the stool in this debate. Without it, we can’t find our way toward balance.Haidt’s book focuses primarily on well-being, and it’s great that he recognizes the research on the importance of play and exploration offline to helping children’s mental health. But play and exploration are also critical for learning, and parents and educators need more examples of the many different places where learning happens, whether on screen, off screen or some hybrid of the two. Parents are at risk of becoming either too protectionist or too permissive if they don’t stop to consider whether technology is affording today’s kids opportunities to explore and stretch their minds.Harvard professor Michael Rich, author of the recent book “The Mediatrician’s Guide,” argues that our children are growing up in a world in which they move seamlessly between physical and digital information, with mountains of experiences and learning opportunities at their fingertips. This is their reality. Today, even children from under-resourced environments can virtually visit places that in the past were well beyond their reach.Many parents and teachers know their kids can gain valuable skills and knowledge from using different forms of tech and media. In fact, they are already factoring in the potential for learning when they make decisions about technology. They restrict phones and laptops in certain contexts and make them available in others, depending on what they believe will provide a good learning environment for their children at different ages and stages.Sometimes the technology, and the way kids explore and build things with it, is integral to what kids need to learn. This year, for example, students have been working in Seattle public libraries withUniversity of Washington professor Jason Yipto build tools and games intended to help other kids identify and avoid disinformation. One game is an online maze built within the world of “Minecraft” that shows what it feels like to fall down rabbit holes of extreme information. “Digital play can open up a number of potentials that allow children to experience unknown and difficult situations, such as misinformation, and experiment with decision-making,” Yip said.More focus on the effect of technology on learning — good and bad — is needed at all ages.Studies of young childrenshow that when parents are distracted by their phones, they are less able to help their kids build the language skills that are key for learning how to read. Maybe parents should model different behaviors with their phone use. Also consider astudy at the University of Delawarein which researchers read books to 4-year-olds live, via video chat or in a prerecorded video. No significant differences in learning were found between the children reading live or via video chat. This study and others provide clear evidence that children can learn when people read storybooks to them online.Instead of fighting with children over smartphone use, we should be making sure that there are enoughteachers and mentors to help all kids use those phones and laptops to support learning, whether they are collaborating on science fair projects or creating video book trailers for YouTube. Kids need teachers and parents who can give them opportunities to explore, play and grapple with hard things in both the digital world and the real world.Our society is good at creating polarization. But we don’t have to devolve into extreme “ban” or “don’t ban” positions on smartphones, laptops or other technology today.Parents and teachers should make decisions about technology after viewing the issue from three perspectives: how much the kids are using the devices, how the devices are affecting kids’ well-being and — the missing leg — how the devices are affecting their learning. Maybe adding this new piece could even help adults see more than just an “anxious generation” but also one hungry to learn.Kathy Hirsh-Pasek,Roberta GolinkoffandLisa Guernseyare authors of several books on children’s learning and founders ofThe Learning Sciences Exchange, a fellowship program and problem-solving platform at New America.This story was produced byThe Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.Sign up forHechinger’s newsletter."

If this doesn t change, I can t continue.I love teaching, but at the end of this year, I will likely quit. Quit Strawberry Mansion High School, where I teach. Quit the school district. Quit teaching altogether.Kids love school, even the teenagers of Strawberry Mansion. I’ve lost count of the students who’vesaid they’ll never return, only to sheepishly creep in the next day. But a school has to love its children back, and I’m not sure the School District of Philadelphia loves all of its children.In the coming weeks, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker will make decisions onschool board appointments. These decisions will have a profound impact, as the policies of district leadership trickle down not only to the children and families of our city but also to teachers like me, who teach with our full hearts.I’m bracing myself for what will come, but after years of being disappointed, I’m tired. I’m tired of watching bad decisions hurt our most vulnerable kids, especially those with disabilities. I’m tired of watching the ever-churning machine of systemic oppression eat my students whole.» READ MORE:Unflinching hope in the Philly neighborhood that the most people have abandoned | OpinionThe Philadelphia school system is broken in many ways. A history ofinequitable fundinglingers inasbestos-filled walls and broken air-conditioners. With Lower Merion’s per-pupil spending and Advanced Placement classes just seven miles away, there is no hiding from the institutional injustices my students face. One hundred percent of students at Strawberry Mansion are considered “economically disadvantaged.”Nearly half qualify for an individualized education program, or IEP, a plan designed to support students with disabilities. At Carver High School of Engineering and Science, which students must apply to get into, that number is just5%.Many of the students at Mansion sit in the middle of the intersectionality of race, disability, and poverty; they are an especially vulnerable population that we, as educators, should be purposeful in our efforts to protect. Yet I watch as my students are pushed aside by the district intended to serve them — through suspensions that turn into dropouts, disciplinary placements that aren’t so temporary, and the ensnaring tentacles of the justice system.There is a substantial body ofresearchthat shows the inequitable use of discipline on students of color and those with disabilities.Among children with disabilities, one in four of those who are Black will be suspended at least once, but among white children, only one in 11receive the same punishment.Each time a student is kicked out of their school — either via a suspension, alternative placement, or “disciplinary” transfer — there can be enormous consequences. A short suspension may seem harmless, but each removal of a student from their educational environmentincreases the likelihood they will drop out or come in contact with the police.There is even a name for how we marginalize our students out of school and into cells: the school-to-prison pipeline. Students are funneled from their regular schools into disciplinary and juvenile placements and then pushed toward incarceration. The students we pick for this are those we find the most challenging, the most difficult to understand — the ones who don’t listen and test our patience. They may love their school, but it won’t love them back. The unrequited love of the school system burns them the worst.Not surprisingly, students with disabilities are overrepresented in our justice system. At the Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center,46% of students have an IEP. AtPennypack House, a school for teens facing adult charges,57% of students have an IEP.The best thing for kids at risk of falling into the justice system is to keep them in school, asresearchhas found that a student’s connection to school is a “protective” factor that reduces their risk of entering the school-to-prison pipeline. But instead of protecting our most vulnerable students from this future, we add to their risk. During the 2021-22 school year,26% of district studentsinvolved in disciplinary incidents had an IEP, despite comprisingless than 16% of the student population. For 2022-23,50% of district students identified as Black, but65%of student “offenders” were Black.As educators, we see the realities of these disparities in our hallways every day. To us, those statistics aren’t numbers; they are children. We say their names and smile at them each morning. How many students will get pushed aside before we start real conversations around how to serve them?I know my absence will be a loss for my students. But I don’t belong in public school anymore.I became a special education teacher because I acutely remember being 12 years old in math class, having the feeling of “This is not the place for me.” I tried to reel in my ADHD brain, like leashing a wild dog. I want my students to know that different isn’t less, needs aren’t weaknesses, and every brain is beautiful.I am a true believer. I believe in special education and individualization. I believe in doing my job the right way in compliance with state and federal laws written by people smarter than me. I believe that, with special education, we see students — especially our most challenging ones — flourish instead of flounder. Yet, here I am, standing in a classroom and thinking, “This is not the place for me.”As Mayor Parker begins her tenure, I am pleading for change. I need her and other leaders to overhaul our discipline system so students aren’t sent to alternative placements for nonviolent behaviors. I need her to instill in our schools the values of restorative justice, with a commitment beyond lip service to making it work. I need her to stress accountability so that every student with an IEP receives an appropriate education, even if that looks different or messy or takes more patience, labor, and time.The city teachers’ union has a role to play, too.Retiring union president Jerry Jordanacknowledged that the rate of Philly teachers leaving the classroom is largelydue to inadequate working conditions, yet he offered no action to address this exodus. In the post-pandemic transition back to buildings, there was no influx of counselors, social workers, or community partners, only students in the midst ofgriefandmental health crisesexhibiting challenging behaviors in underequipped schools. I hope the incoming union leadership is able to effectively advocate for working conditions that support both the best interests of teachers and students.As teachers, we need to see that student mental health needs are adequately addressedso we know our lessons can have an impact. Only then will we be able to stay in our jobs without watching the students we love struggle as we helplessly stand by.I need Parker to do all this so I can focus on my students while knowing their rights are protected, so I can teach them to read without worrying they’ll be suspended once they cross the threshold out of my room. I want to focus on imbuing in my students the power their education provides. But I need them here, in school, not at home, not at a disciplinary placement, not sitting in an overcrowded juvenile justice cell.I need her to make space for my students in our schools. I can teach them — just let them in and, please, let them stay.Colleen Gibbons-Brown is a special educator who has taught middle and high school students for the past seven years.

Inside today’s edition, we look back at the events that led up to the merger and talk with a few city officials about its impact on their departments. You will hear from Suffolk Fire and Rescue, Suffolk Police Department, and a few other city departments, who talk about the merger, its impact, and how they plan to commemorate the 50th anniversary throughout the year.A special thank you goes out to Kermit Hobbs, who graciously and thoroughly researched the merger’s history and contributed a detailed description of the years and months leading up to it.Many of us were not born when the merger happened or were very young — too young to have understood or taken an interest in what was happening. However, through the years, we have all heard opinions passed down from family, friends, and former political leaders. No matter what those opinions are, the fact is the city we all know and love recently turned 50, and we should all celebrate where it came from and where it is heading — even if you don’t fully agree with its current trajectory.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_221,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Louisianan Mike Johnson became House speaker by accident, when eight renegade Republicans voted with the Democrats to eject the unfortunate Kevin McCarthy from the chair in October. After a number of more senior members failed to win enough support, the booby prize went to Johnson.Johnson has been an exceptionally weak speaker, and not just due to the narrowness of his majority. He gave in to the right-wing mob to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas on fake charges and he jumped to obey Donald Trump’s reckless command to scuttle the Senate’s hard fought bipartisan measure on immigration reform. The amount of actual legislation passed by this Congress on behalf of the country is a record low.But on Saturday, Johnson did right by America and right for the world in bringing to the floor several bills to provide desperately needed military aid to democratic allies in Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan under attack from the nasties of the globe: Russia, Iran and China.Each aid package only passed on Democratic votes, as isolationist cranks in the GOP said no to all three measures.To their credit, every Democrat backed the $8 billion for Taiwan and not a single Democrat voted against the $61 billion for Ukraine, as the pro-Putin caucus captured the party of Ronald Reagan with a majority of the Republicans saying no to Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he tries to fend off the Russians.There is also a shamefully anti-Israel claque on the left of the Democratic Party (including New Yorkers Nydia Velázquez, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman that rejected the $26 billion for Israel, which is fighting Hamas terrorists in Gaza and Iranian ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.But overall, there were large majorities for standing with our friends overseas under siege by Moscow, Tehran (and its Hamas and Hezbollah buds and Beijing.That all the bills relied on the Democrats and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is a slight against Johnson within his party’s conference.

Joining her was Thomas Massie and Paul Gosar, a pair of Grade-A kooks.Johnson had 218 on his side for the Saturday roll calls compared with Jeffries’ having 213, but that GOP total immediately dropped by one when Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin resigned right afterwards. Gallagher was one of only three Republicans to vote against the terribly wrong impeachment of Mayorkas (another dissenter resigned a month ago .And next week is a special election in Buffalo which should add one more Democrat, so the balance will be 217 to 214, making the Three Stooges of Greene, Massie and Gosar as kingmakers.If they try another coup to topple another speaker, the Democrats will need to save Johnson. That will further weaken him within his own party and strengthen the GOP’s outer fringe, but the center can hold.Johnson’s political career may not last past this year, but his short tenure will be remembered for when America came to the aid of Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_29,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Labour leader Keir Starmer reacts after winning the constituency of Holborn and St Pancras during the UK general election on July 5, 2024, in London. (Leon Neal/Getty Images/TNS The Labour Party’s demolition of the chaotic Conservative Party in Britain’s July 4 general election is another marker of the reassertion of sensible, fiscally sound centrism and, above all, the rejection of leaders who bring either revolt or chaos.The new customer service-oriented prime minister, Keir Starmer, a fiscally shrewd moderate already known as “No Drama Starmer,” arguably is as far removed from his chilly socialist predecessor atop Labour, Jeremy Corbyn, as he is from Rishi Sunak, the technocratic British leader he defeated Wednesday and who had been forced to deal with the mess his predecessors Boris Johnson, a reckless maverick, and Liz Truss, a reckless libertarian, progressively wrought. Voters were exhausted by all the Tory dysfunction; they correctly intuited their government was not delivering the services the British people needed.Sunak, both a wealthy and a decent man, took to the podium Friday morning outside 10 Downing Street prior to tendering his resignation, opened his mouth and said, “to the country, I would like to say first and foremost, I am sorry.”That’s a far cry from an embittered and defeated Donald Trump ginning up supporters to go march on the U.S. Capitol. Many of them went to jail and saw their lives ruined; Trump may well get a second term in office.So there’s the first lesson for the United States. Normal democratic transitions have not gone the way of the dinosaurs. They are alive and well across the Atlantic. Minus Trump, they’d likely be living here too.But there’s another, more worrying illustration for Democrats in the U.K. results. Demolitions can be sparked from small swings. Labour, Starmer would do well to remember as he holds off the left wing of his party, won only 1 percentage point more votes than when it lost under Corbyn in 2019. But that was enough for 200 more seats in Parliament and headlines like “Labour Landslide” and “Tory Wipeout.”Labour actually won only a third of the popular vote.Granted, Britain has somewhat stronger third parties, such as the Green Party and Reform UK, and there are many other systemic differences. But it still is striking that just 700,000 more votes going to Labour in a country with a population of 67 million was so transformative. That’s what happens in a so-called “winner takes all” system. Those swings in the polls may appear to be slight, but they can beget transformations, nonetheless.Public reaction as reflected in polls still is emerging in the U.S. following the Joe Biden debate debacle, but any Democrat who believes what appears to be a small current overall swing toward the Republicans couldn’t have a massive impact on races for the U.S. Congress is simply not paying attention.That’s surely why Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas spoke out and said, speaking for embattled colleagues who don’t want to be collateral damage, that Biden should leave the race.One look across the Atlantic should tell Democrats that the status quo carries more risks than many in their party seem to realize.—Chicago Tribune"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_108,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°In the wake of Donald Trump’s felony conviction, Republicans are furious.“Democrats cheered as they convicted the leader of the opposing party on ridiculous charges,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson. “This was a purely political exercise, not a legal one.”Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida agreed. “If the defendant were not Donald Trump, this case would never have been brought, the judge would have never issued similar rulings, and the jury would have never returned a guilty verdict,” he wrote on the social platform X.Kari Lake, an Arizona Republican running for the Senate, called the ruling “an outright mockery of the rule of law,” and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, currently vying to join the Trump ticket, said it was “Un-freaking-believable.”Other Republicans aren’t just mad; they want revenge.Stephen Miller, a top adviser to the former president, raged against the verdict on Fox News. “Every facet of Republican Party politics and power has to be used right now to go toe to toe with Marxism and beat these communists,” he said, blasting Democrats with his preferred terms of abuse for political opponents.Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is also angling to ride with Trump as his running mate, slammed President Joe Biden — who had nothing to do with the trial — as “a demented man propped up by wicked and deranged people willing to destroy our country to remain in power.” It was time, Rubio concluded, rendering the message with fire emojis rather than actual words, to “fight fire with fire.”And in National Review, John Yoo, the legal architect of the George W. Bush administration’s torture program, urged Republicans to retaliate against Democratic elected officials. “In order to prevent the case against Trump from assuming a permanent place in the American political system, Republicans will have to bring charges against Democratic officers, even presidents,” Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote.At no point, you’ll notice, do Republicans deny that Trump is a criminal. They’ve made no effort here to defend his honor or to say he’s innocent of the charges levied against him. They almost seem to accept, as most Americans do, that the former president is guilty of fraud. But they don’t accept the verdict. They don’t accept the idea that Trump could be tried in a court of law on these charges. They reject the authority of the jury. For Republicans — no matter the law, no matter the evidence and no matter the testimony — the conviction is illegitimate. In their view, Trump is sovereign, and the law is not.This gets to one of the real transformations in American politics since Trump came down that escalator to announce his campaign for president nine years ago this month. Trump ran as the embodiment of the legitimate people of the United States. He governed on behalf of those people — a narrow, exclusive people defined in racial, religious and ideological terms — deemed them “the People,” to whom the country rightfully belongs. He tied his authority less to the Constitution than to this quasi-mystical connection. He was “the people” and “the people” were him, and he could do anything on their behalf, up to and including an effort to overturn the constitutional transfer of power. What is an election — what is the Constitution itself — when set against the people as embodied in Trump?This vision of Trump as tribune of the “real America” has trickled down from Trump’s most devoted acolytes to the rest of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.You see it in the Republican embrace of the Jan. 6 rioters, in the open skepticism of the results of the 2020 presidential election and the suggestion, coming from prominent figures on the political right, that there is no legitimate outcome short of a Trump victory in the 2024 presidential contest.This is more than idle talk, of course. It demands action. If institutions — courts, bureaucracies and the electoral system — won’t bend to the people, as personified by Trump, then they must be bent toward him. They must be cowed, brought to heel. And so we’ve seen, over the past week, strident attacks on the legal system as illegitimate for its willingness to hold the former president to account, as well as legislation designed to circumvent it, should legal officials attempt to do so again.The chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, wants to target prosecutors overseeing cases against Trump, while a group of House conservatives have pushed Johnson to hold a vote on a bill that would give current or former presidents the right to move any state case brought against them to federal court. A law like this would have allowed Trump to avoid a Manhattan jury and possibly even get a judge who owes his or her seat on the bench to Trump.Separate from their attack on the legal system, Trump’s allies are also trying to undermine the infrastructure of elections throughout the country, challenging thousands of voter registrations in key swing states and hounding local officials who won’t arbitrarily drop voters from the rolls.There are also the explicit plans to remake the federal administrative state in Trump’s image, so that it will operate as an extension of his will, regardless of what the law allows or what the Constitution permits. “What we’re trying to do is identify the pockets of independence and seize them,” said Russell T. Vought, a Trump ally who ran the Office of Management and Budget under the former president and one of the figures involved in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a second Trump administration.Most of this effort to bend and break institutions in the name of Trump’s illiberal claim to personal authority is the opportunistic grasping of ideologues who see the former president as a vehicle for their aims. He will help them expel immigrants, destroy the welfare state and roll back the political and cultural settlements of the 1960s, the 1970s and beyond.But among more ordinary supporters of Trump’s authoritarian designs, there is fear at work, too. Fear that the country has been lost. Fear that elections won’t be enough to win it back. And a belief, fueled by that fear, that democracy is an obstacle to putting the nation back on track.Which is just to say, in another form, what we already know to be true: Trump can lose in November, but as long as millions of Americans feel this fear as deeply as they do, Trumpism will endure.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_276,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°It was a scene to behold: a union president delivering a booming, barn-burner speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee — “the first Teamster in our 121-year history” to address the Republican Party, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien told the cheering crowd.While the union hasn’t endorsed former President Donald Trump (yet , O’Brien’s appearance — and Trump’s pick of Ohio Senator and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance as his running mate — aimed to solidify the bizarre notion that the Republican ticket is pro-labor and “economic populist.”O’Brien’s speech was rousing and provocative as the union leader railed against “an American worker being taken for granted. Workers being sold out to big banks, Big Tech corporates and the elite.” It was a fiery populist speech you’d expect at a union convention, not promoting a Republican Party whose policies enable these conditions and oppose pro-worker solutions.The convention didn’t cheer quite as loudly when O’Brien urged “legal protections that make it safer for workers to get a contract … Americans vote for unions but can never get a union contract.” As he rightly noted, “It’s only when Americans band together in democratic unions that we win real improvements on wages, benefits and working conditions.”One big problem: Trump, Vance and the Republican Party have opposed every effort to support workers and unions.AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler immediately countered the idea that Vance is pro-labor: “Working people know talk is cheap. J.D. Vance opposed the PRO Act, has a bill to let bosses bypass their workers with phony company unions and voted against pro-worker NLRB and DOL appointments. No matter what he says, he’s refused to show up for working people where it counts.”Vance also cosponsored the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act, along with Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fl., which would effectively undermine labor unions by allowing voluntary “employee involvement organizations,” which would not be covered by collective-bargaining agreements and could be dissolved by an employer.Trump, despite all his allegedly populist rhetoric, has a deeply anti-worker record from his first term.In outlining “50 reasons the Trump administration is bad for workers,” the Economic Policy Institute wrote in 2020 that President Trump “systematically promoted the interests of corporate executives and shareholders over those of working people and failed to protect workers’ safety, wages and rights.”The previous Trump administration failed to protect essential workers during the deadliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic; undermined workers’ right to organize into unions; and betrayed all his promises to Rust Belt manufacturing workers by promoting the offshoring of manufacturing jobs through policies that “resulted in continued offshoring, including the net loss of nearly 1,800 factories between 2016 and 2018 and 740,000 manufacturing jobs since February 2020.”Terri Gerstein, Director of the NYU Wagner Labor Initiative, may have said it best: “Pro-worker is raising the minimum wage, ensuring people get overtime, supporting paid sick and family leave. Play-acting as working class by dressing up in jeans and acting aggrieved doesn’t do anything for real working people who are struggling.”"

It s a special community that deserved better than to be told it would be gone within a week.To me, thesudden news on May 31 that the University of the Arts would close within the weekfelt like a death in the family.I taught writing and film at UArts for 15 years. I was a student in therenowned Saturday Schoolas a teenager and worked at the college as an artist’s model while a student at Temple. My late wife,artist Maddy Gold, was an undergraduate at the school when itwas still known as the Philadelphia College of Art, and then began teaching there while she was a graduate student at thePratt Institute.Maddy taught at UArts for 35 years. Her father, World War II combat artist and renownedsocial realist painter and illustrator Albert Gold, headed the illustration department for nearly 40 years.My mother-in-law, painter Aurora Gold, met Albert as a student at the college — their love story at the school preceded Maddy’s and mine. Aurora also taught there for nearly 20 years. My brother-in-law, composer and pianist Bob Gold, got his master’s in music education from UArts.The University of the Arts was such a part of Maddy’s and my life that our wedding rings feature a carving of that famous Hamilton Hall facade.Our wedding rings feature a carving of that famous Hamilton Hall facade.Whenwe were high school sweethearts,we would steal kisses in the studios in the basement of Hamilton Hall, the smell of modeling clay and linseed oil all around us.There was nowhere in Center City Maddy and I went where we didn’trun into one of her UArts students. One night after midnight Mass on Christmas Eve at St. Mark’s Church at 16th and Locust, we walked to Rittenhouse Square. It was snowing lightly and the scene was pure Currier and Ives. As we leaned in for the first kiss of Christmas, we heard, through the muffled snowy quiet, “Ms. Gold! Maddy Gold!” One of her students ran up to us in the park, wishing her a Merry Christmas.For so many years, UArts was the locus of our lives. We spent New Year’s Day standing on Hamilton Hall’s steps watching the Mummers Parade in our teens and college years. Faculty art shows, film festivals, student events, holiday parties, graduations — on our calendar, UArts was always present.Because more than anything, UArts was a community, a small liberal arts college in a big city that catered to the fine and performing arts. Its students were immensely talented and eager to be part of that camaraderie and closeness one rarely associates with big-city schools.That tight-knit, artistic community cannot be replicated elsewhere. It was distinct to UArts. Sometimes in my writing classes, we could hear music students performing. UArts had the atmosphere of a small New England college in a big city where music students could leave their classes and head to the jazz clubs on the Avenue of the Arts, or theater students could get cheap seats at the Wilma or the Merriam. UArts was a center for Philly’s independent film scene and festival circuit.So many artists and entertainers began their careers at that school, and we all felt the light of promise emanating from it.I loved teaching at UArts — the students, the school. I loved sharing a connection withboth my wife and in-laws.» READ MORE:My wife loved the Eagles. On Sunday, I’ll turn Maddy’s picture to face the TV. | OpinionWe all knew there were issues with enrollment and funding even before the pandemic. Maddy left in 2012 and went to teach at Drexel after the school shut down the department in which she’d taught for over three decades.Still, none of us were prepared for the abrupt announcement that it would close entirely. The subsequent days brought little clarity. The administration announced a meeting with students, faculty, and media for late Monday afternoon, butcanceled it minutes before it was scheduled to begin, with only a cursory statement that it wasn’t possible to address the issues and the university simply had no option but to close.The school’s president, Kerry Walk,resigned on Tuesday, wreaking further havoc by causing the cancellation of a bargaining session on the terms of the closure, leaving faculty and staff in limbo over payments, benefits, and severance. On Wednesday,the faculty filed lawsuitsagainst the school.What a mess.And a totally avoidable one. When the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts announced it was closing at the end of the 2024-25 school year back in January,it provided a planin which juniors, seniors, and Master of Fine Arts students on track to graduate in 2024 or 2025 would still be able to do so.Why didn’t current UArts students get this level of respect? And what about incoming first years, now high schoolers from all over the country, who had chosen UArts as their college? What about them? Imagine how this news hit them — their sense of loss and betrayal. Where will they go now? Where will current students go now?While Templehas said it is exploring a merger, Temple is a vast campus ofmore than 30,000 students, hardly that compact campus Maddy and I taught at where everyone knew everyone. Not the campus that angry, wounded community membershave been protesting overoutside Hamilton Hall since the news of the closing first hit.I’m angry that so little care was given to that community Maddy and I were so deeply invested in for so many years. I can’t imagine how painful this would be for my wife to witness, and how devastated she would be for our friends and for the students.The UArts community — both past and present — deserved better than last week. Most importantly, we deserve a chance to keep the doors open. We deserve, somehow, to let the legacy continue.Victoria A. Brownworth is a local writer and reporter.

This will mark the first time in over 50 years that a major party nominee was selected outside of the democratic process of primaries and caucuses.Many Democrats had already begun discussing how to replace Biden. They worried that having the convention delegates, the majority of whom werepledged at first to Biden, select the nominee would appear undemocratic and illegitimate.The Republican Speaker of the House has claimed that having the convention replace Biden would be“wrong” and “unlawful.” Others have conjured up the image of the return of the “smoke-filled room.” This term was coined in 1920 whenRepublican party leaders gathered in secretin Chicago’s Blackstone Hotel and agreed to nominate Warren G. Harding, a previously obscure and undistinguished U.S. senator from Ohio, for the presidency. He won that year, becoming aterrible president.The tradition of picking a nominee through primaries and caucuses — and not through what is called the “convention system” — is relatively recent. In 1968, after President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not run for reelection, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, was able to secure the Democratic nomination despitenot entering any primaries or caucuses. Humphrey won because he had the backing of party leaders like Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, and these party leaders controlled the vast majority of the delegates.Many Democrats saw this process as fundamentally undemocratic, so the party instituted a series of reforms that opened up the process by requiring delegates to be selected in primaries or caucuses thatgave ordinary party members the opportunityto make that choice. The Republican Party quickly followed suit, and since 1972 both parties have nominated candidates in this way.The Democrats are worried that a new nominee, selected by the convention, will, like Humphrey, lack legitimacy since she or he will have secured the nomination without direct input from Democratic voters around the country.In response, they’ve suggested what’s being called a “blitz primary” in which Democratic voters will decide on a nominee aftera series of televised candidate town hallshosted by politicians and celebrities like Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.From the perspective of ascholar who studies political parties and elections, this proposal seems like wishful thinking since there’s no mechanism for setting up a workable election process in such a short period of time. The usual process of primaries and caucuses takes months, if not years, of preparation.While many associate the convention system with less than impressive nominees, like Harding, the record isn’t that bad.At thevery first convention, held by the National Republicans— ancestors of today’s Republican Party — party leaders and insiders nominated Henry Clay for president. Although Clay lost to Andrew Jackson the following year, he is consideredone of the greatest politiciansof the 19th century.The convention system in both parties went on to nominate Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, all of whom were elected president. Of course, conventions also nominated lesser figures like Horatio Seymour, Alton Parker and John W. Davis.But who’s to say that the current system has done any better to produce electable candidates?Yes, there’s Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, but there have also been less successful candidates like George McGovern, and weaker presidents like Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush.Furthermore, had the old system been in place this year, there’s a chance that the Democrats might have avoided their current predicament.To the extent that Democratic Party leaders were aware of Biden’s decline, they might have been able to ease him out in favor of a better candidate — if they had been in control of the nominating process. In fact, party leaders in previous decades often knew more about the candidates than the public at large and could exercise veto power over anyone they thought had serious vulnerabilities.For example, in 1952,U.S. Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennesseecame into the Democratic National Convention the clear favorite in party-member polls. He also won the most primaries and had the most delegates.Party leaders, however, had serious reservations about Kefauver since they considered him too much of a maverick who might alienate key Democratic constituencies. The party bosses also knew thatKefauver had problems with alcohol and extramarital affairs.As a result, party leaders coalesced around Illinois Gov. Adlai Stevenson, who was not even a candidate before the convention started. Stevenson ran a losing but respectable race against theimmensely popular and probably unbeatable Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition, Stevenson’s eloquence and intelligenceinspired a generationof Democratic Party activists. Not bad for a last-minute convention choice.With Biden’s withdrawal, it remains to be seen if the new Democratic nominee will be a strong candidate or, if elected, a good president. But there’s no reason to think that this year’s unusual path to the nomination will have any effect on those outcomes.Philip Klinkneris the JamesS.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_299,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Sadly, political violence is as old as politics itself, around the globe and, yes, in the United States. However, the last decade has seen a marked increase, especially in the United States.Rhetorically, one might argue — and those on the political right will — that heated words and actions that could lead to political violence originate from the broad spectrum of ideologies. Agreed, but it is hard to ignore the focused and brazen words and images coming from the political right.Fueled by a decade’s-long pugilistic legislative style, the ease and anonymity of online conspiracies and threats, and the rise of an elected political class determined to stoke the flames of discontent, the political right is not just encouraging violence, but it seems to have become a central plank of its ideology.Republican members of Congress, not crackpot internet trolls, have repeatedly made online posts and even campaign videos encouraging violence against political opponents. Often using assault weapons and targets for props, they talk about eliminating perceived “threats,” vilifying specific opponents repeatedly and using their official time in Congress, such as floor speeches, to spread inflammatory conspiracies.Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Mike Collins and Paul Gosar come to mind. Still, there are many others who have used words and imagery to allude to violence. Perhaps they think this is just an efficient way to convey “strength” or elicit generalized disagreement with their political opponents, but it’s not hard to see how these actions magnify throughout the internet, finding their way to militant elements of the political right.While Democrats and those on the political left do use words that can elicit emotional responses, the sheer volume coming from the right drowns this out tenfold. You also don’t see the left producing anything approaching the level of explicit references to violence that comes from the right.We haven’t talked about the “spiritual” leader of this yet. Former President Donald Trump has made vilification and references to violence against his perceived opponents a predictably regular menu item on social media and in his speeches since he first entered the political arena.Trump has repeatedly said this or that group of people should be “shot”; called for the execution of people he disagreed with or who disagreed with him; constantly dehumanized a wide range of people but predominantly minority groups; and fomented the gathering near and the march on the Capitol that ended in a violent insurrection.Trump as president, and since his 2020 defeat, has also continually sidled up to and sided with violent authoritarians in other countries. His perpetual personal grievances permeate throughout his political base.This constant and reckless approach does have consequences. Recent calls for unity, followed closely by Trump and his allies with further inflammatory language (and fund-raising appeals! , fall well short of a change of heart even in the wake of an apparent assassination attempt that could have taken his life.And now, the opening speaker at the Republican National Convention, which started AFTER the shooting at the Trump rally and his lukewarm calls for unity, recently said that “some folks need killing” in a rant about political enemies. Not only was he chosen by the political right, the Republican Party, to kick off its national convention but Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is also a candidate for governor of North Carolina.Yes, everyone, and I mean everyone, needs to cool off and take care of their words. The political right has, though, been pointing their fingers at the left over the past several days without an ounce of self-recognition or even a whisper about much-needed gun restrictions. We will not make any progress toward the elimination of political or gun violence if the political right, clearly more active in encouraging violence, does not join the political left in disarming._____Don Kusler is the national director of Americans for Democratic Action.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_91,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It’s hard to imagine a clearer violation of journalistic ethics than pretending to hold beliefs you don’t, asking Supreme Court justices if they agree, and surreptitiously recording their answers at a no-media dinner. The novelty of the stunt, however, shouldn’t distract us from the real takeaway, which is precisely that the recordings yielded nothing we didn’t already know.The key conclusions are that Justice Samuel Alito is a religious man; his wife Martha-Ann likes political flags; and Chief Justice John Roberts is genuinely committed to the (somewhat unrealistic idea that only elected officials — not judges — should make moral decisions.The recording was obtained by liberal documentarian Lauren Windsor at the annual dinner of the Supreme Court Historical Society, itself a rather misunderstood event. As someone who’s been to the dinner (I was the speaker one year after writing a book on Supreme Court history let me try to set the scene.The dinner is a reasonably accessible way for a non-billionaire to hobnob with the justices: Anyone who buys a $500 ticket can attend, which is how Windsor got in. That might sound like a lot of money, but it’s much less than many non-rich people pay to go to sporting events or Taylor Swift concerts.Yet the dinner feels elite. The dress code is black tie. The cause — supporting the society’s work on the history of the court — is worthy, but niche. And the dinner, which is supposed to be off the record, takes place in the great hall of the Supreme Court building, all marble and very grand.The key point is that, at the dinner, the justices are comfortably at home (it’s their office, after all . They are also, to a degree, the effective hosts of the event. They seem relaxed and friendly, and they get to be real people. Or at least, they used to — now they will have to know they can be recorded by their guests.Windsor’s recordings show the justices as the familiar figures we know. She got Justice Alito to say that in contemporary America, “there can be … a way of living together peacefully, but it’s difficult … because there are differences on fundamental things that really can’t be compromised.” Um, yes? That statement seems incontrovertibly true.The false-flag journalist then insisted that people who believe in God must “keep fighting … to return our country to a place of godliness.” Alito agreed. Although godliness here is left vague, it’s hard to imagine a genuinely God-fearing person answering otherwise.As for Mrs. Alito, she of the scores of flags flown at two homes, the most the provocateur could get was that she had been considering flying a Sacred Heart of Jesus flag to respond to a Pride flag in her neighborhood during June — but that her husband had asked her “Oh please, don’t put up a flag.” The exchange appeared to confirm Alito’s letter to two senators in which he essentially said (in the chastened tones of a beleaguered husband that his wife likes flying flags and all he can do is ask her not to.As for Roberts, the chief responded to Windsor’s prompts by giving his patented mini-lecture about how justices are just lawyers who shouldn’t take moral right and wrong into account. He also firmly rejected the suggestion that the US is a Christian nation and that the justices should be guided by that idea.Those were great messages, ones Roberts deeply believes. They certainly echoed his famous comparison of a judge to an umpire whose only job is to call balls and strikes.But before jumping to the conclusion that Roberts’ answers make Alito’s look bad, notice the limits of the idea that morality has no role in judicial decision-making. It’s hard to see how a court could make decisions about racial equality or abortion rights or gun control without taking some kind of moral stand. Justices Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great, morally driven advocates for equality who carried their moral values into their Supreme Court service. Even Justice Neil Gorsuch, a non-moral textualist by his own account, is clearly morally motivated in Indian law cases by the profound injustices done to the tribes over centuries. That seems praiseworthy, at least to me.Justices are human beings, not machines. We should allow them to be humans, even at social events. And we should grow out of the fantasy of justices as perfectly impartial automatons free of human fallibility.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt. season."

Ignoring them won’t change that.I am writing you in response to your publication’s recent article “What Your Louisville High School Says About You.” While I would agree with the staff’s position that entirely too often Louisville’s citizens use the question “Where did you go to high school?” to help them better understand who they are talking to; there are several concerns I have for the manner in which you chose to address the issue. My major concern regarding the article is that it stereotypes people badly, and stereotyping is not very productive if your goal is to reach a more inclusive Louisville community.In 2022 attended an ASALH national conference that centered the study of African American life and history. One of the breakout sessions included a deeper dive into the role of newspapers in pre-Civil War America. Ads for run-away slaves was a big money generator for the publications and so, while the newspapers may not have been actively participating in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, their well-being and, in some cases, mission became intertwined with the mission of legalized forced labor that was chattel slavery. When I read an article like “Where did you go to high school?”I have to wonder where the newspaper’s loyalties lie.Redlining in Louisville and across the country developed and cultivated a divided group-think by geographical area by limiting perspectives historically. Your article seems to understand this division, but does not adequately address the positive cultural connections that are being cultivated across community boundaries and a deeper dive is needed. To move forward we must recognize our unconscious bias to make decisions based on these same limited perspectives.I am also troubled by the timing of the piece. As a JCPS teacher who is working hard to keep our students engaged as we recover from a historic pandemic, I really do not appreciate an article that could be interpreted as pouring salt on the wounds of public education. There are serious decisions that must be made within our JCPS and Kentucky public education systems on the table as I write. The future depends on getting these issues resolved in such a way that our most vulnerable are lifted up. Please publish articles that emphasize inclusion rather than division in the future.Sincerely,–Greg TichenorIt is the ignoring of these stereotypes and division that let’s them fester. My advice is to read more of LEO’s articles if you want to know where we stand, and have historically for over 30 years. We are certainly concerned about how all communities are treated, but we are not above making fun of the things that have been used to stereotype or divide us. Even in today’s school system the question, “where did you go to school,” has implications for categorization. We’d suggest that your concern be better placed on the transportation and whether or not your students have schools to attend next year.Iskimmed this article and found a couple funny and spot on. Then I read what you said about Moore High School and thought you all were better than being racist. And Valley wasn’t much better.Kind of disappointed if I’m being honest.–Angela BrayKids at Moore H.S. of all stripes and colors wore gold teeth in the ‘80s. The yearbooks tell all tales. We’d also invite you to check the history of the South End of Louisville including Valley Station and Shively. Perhaps read about the bombing of a Black family’s home in the ‘60s.RItttenhouse SchmittenhouseI finally sat down and read through the last issue (March 27 and I really appreciated your column on the Rittenhouse event at WKU. I hate everything that criminal stands for. While many were calling for the cancellation of that event, I was uneasy about saying “Yep, cancel that talk”, and frankly until I read your column I hadn’t been able to articulate why. Now I’ve got the words, your words. Thank you. Keep writing!–Mark RountreeYour article was fantastic thank you.–Mary Nestor O’Toole*** ."
minnpost_2024_95,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.A group of aging baby-boomers gathered recently to celebrate the 55th anniversary of Minnesota’s leadership in expanding political engagement by our state’s youngest citizens — an anniversary that’s highly relevant in today’s hostile political environment.The June 22 reunion marked action by the 1969 Minnesota Legislature to put a state constitutional amendment lowering the voting age to 19 on the 1970 ballot. The state’s voters ratified the amendment by an overwhelming vote of 700,449 to 582,890. But, because Minnesota’s constitutional amendment process requires approval of a majority of all those voting in the election, the amendment was ratified by a mere 6,186 votes — a margin of less than one-half of 1%.Within days of the amendment’s ratification, an aggressive effort was launched to register the newly enfranchised voters, coupled with a parallel initiative to strengthen civic education in the state’s high schools.But by early in the 1971 Legislature, it became clear that — in college towns and around the campus of the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities campus — there were very real fears that students would turn-out in sufficient numbers to determine the election of local elected officials and pass local bond issues. So, an ultimately successful campaign was needed to defeat legislation discouraging students from registering and voting in the communities where they attended college.Meanwhile, in 1970, Congress passed an amendment to the 1965 Federal Voting Rights Act lowering the voting age nationally to 18. But the U.S. Supreme Court held that Congress could not change the voting age for state and local elections by statute.So, to avoid having different voting ages for federal, state and local elections, Congress quickly moved to nullify the high court’s decision. And, on March 23, 1971, Minnesota became the first state in the nation to ratify what became the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The required 37 additional states followed suit and all 18-to-20-year-olds were eligible to vote in the 1972 and subsequent elections.These initiatives were all organized and run by young people through the Minnesota Coalition to Lower the Voting Age and Minnesota Youth Franchise Coalition that included College Republicans, Teen Age Republicans, Young Republican League, Young Democrats and college and high school student government organizations. MCLVA’s leadership included a future state senator and congressman, a Nobel Peace Prize nominee and a slew of attorneys, journalists and non-profit and corporate executives. At their recent reunion, they all credited their work more than a half-century ago for successful careers and extensive volunteer civic and community leadership.It’s important to note that legislators in both political parties authored these state and federal constitutional amendments and — in the state referendum campaign — they were joined by a bipartisan coalition that included a “Who’s Who” of political, business, labor and other civic and political leaders and organizations ranging from the Americans for Democratic Action to the American Legion.Both state political parties also made financial contributions to the campaign, as did a number of labor organizations, including the Minnesota AFL-CIO, Teamsters, United Auto Workers and others. The Minnesota Education Association donated thousands of dollars in printing and copying service. Of special note were daily and weekly newspaper and radio ads financed by more than a dozen of Minnesota’s largest corporations that were members of the Minnesota Association of Commerce and Industry.Strong support also came from non-partisan civic organizations, including the Jaycees, League of Women Voters and Congress of Parents and Teachers. This was a bipartisan, broadly-based coalition that could never be assembled in today’s toxic political environment that includes efforts to discourage — not expand — voting by young people and other historically under-represented citizens. These efforts are misguided and must be repelled.Of equal importance is support for policies and programs like those the Minnesota Legislature has already enacted to pre-register 16-year-olds and mandate civic education in the state’s high schools.A strong argument can also be made to further lower Minnesota’s voting age to 16 or 17.Eighteen-to-20-year-olds have historically had a disappointingly poor record of voting. One reason may be their high degree of mobility as they leave their home communities for college, work and military service. Establishing a pattern of well-informed voting while still in high school could help produce a life-long pattern of voting and other civic engagement.Regardless, Minnesota’s national leadership in expanding eligibility for voting by its youngest citizens more than a half-century ago is well-worth celebrating. And so is both protecting and enhancing voting and other civic engagement by all Minnesotans in the years and decades to come.Jon Schroeder worked on the 1970 referendum campaign and was the chief lobbyist on student residency issues and ratification of the 26th Amendment. He later worked for the Citizens League, Scholarship America and U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger, published a rural newspaper and worked on education policy through a joint venture of the Center for Policy Studies and Hamline University."

suffolknewsherald_2024_78,"Published 5:21 pm Tuesday, August 13, 2024ByStaff ReportsChris QuilpaPropaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view. It’s communication primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented.Simply put, propaganda is spreading ideas, information, or rumors to help or harm an institution, a cause, or a person. It’s information, ideas, opinions, or images that give one part of an argument and are broadcast, published, like in a poster, etc., to influence people’s opinions. Its main goal is to shape people’s opinions so they think a particular way or convince them to support a specific cause or political candidate.The earliest known use or example of propaganda was the Behistun Inscription (c. 515 , which detailed King Darius the Great’s rise to the Persian throne.Scientists and academicians, philosophers and politicians, teachers and military officers have played a role, knowingly or unknowingly, in using propaganda for whatever reason, such as indoctrination, to advance causes or competitions among themselves and countries that aim to foster dominance or supremacy over the other.Every nation or country wants to be the first, on top of every category, the so-called “pioneer” in every field of endeavor, including sports or athletics. Thus, rivalry arises, and secrecy, indifference, suspicion, and surveillance come with that. There’s increased tension among nations and people as they continue their quest for recognition to be the top and the best in everything possible.Propaganda is still used today, with classic tactics such as name-calling or bandwagoning used to sway the audience towards or against a particular belief or idea. It plays a big part in world power, dominance, or domination, and supremacy, especially regarding prestige, popularity, economics, profitability, and superiority.Now, let’s talk about regulations. If no regulations are imposed on us, what will become of us, our community, society, our league of countries, and our world? Will there be peace and order, civility and decency of living? Or will there be chaos, turmoil, disorder, disunity, and destruction of the human race?Would we prefer not to have strict regulations because we view them as obstacles to our freedom and independence as a people, as a nation, independent and sovereign and not a subject or a vassal to any powerful country or so-called “superpower?”Do we see regulations as a threat to our freedom? Or do we see them as reminders that, as human beings, we’re not perfect? We have limitations, strengths and weaknesses, uniqueness and peculiarities, commonalities and differences.What do you think? What’s your take on these topics or issues mentioned above? Have you been aware of any propaganda use or regulations that, in your mind, can be beneficial yet/or controversial?The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_124,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Minnesota Governor Tim Walz introduced himself to Americans on Wednesday night as a regular guy who knows their pain and frustration because he’s lived it. A former high school teacher and football coach, he knows what it’s like to raise a family on a tight budget.Walz was chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris not just because the two share great chemistry. And not just because he has racked up an impressive record of Democratic goals in office. He is an everyman in a way that few running mates in modern history have been.Harris is making a symbolic point. She is the daughter of immigrants. He is the son of teachers, raised in a prairie state. The contrast with billionaire Donald Trump, a son of inherited wealth, whose only lodestar is his self-interest, could not be greater.Walz’s speech accepting his party’s nomination for vice president was short — just 15 minutes — plain-spoken and straight from the gut. He presented Americans with the choice before them. “When Republicans use the word freedom, they mean that the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office,” Walz said.“Corporations — free to pollute your air and water. And banks — free to take advantage of customers. But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love. Freedom to make your own health care decisions. And yeah, your kids’ freedom to go to school without worrying about being shot dead in the hall.”In describing the road to the White House, Coach Walz delivered a pep talk to an arena-sized huddle. “It’s the fourth quarter. We’re down a field goal,” he said. “But we’re on offense and we’ve got the ball. We’re driving down the field. And boy, do we have the right team. Kamala Harris is tough. Kamala Harris is experienced. And Kamala Harris is ready. Our job … our job for everyone watching, is to get in the trenches and do the blocking and tackling. One inch at a time. One yard at a time. One phone call at a time. One door knock at a time.”Walz has never been one for flowery oratory. But he has a knack for cutting through the clutter that is a far cry from the policy-heavy, jargony speeches typical of Democrats in the past. This is the man who, vying against a heavyweight roster of potential running mates, got on TV and with one word, “weird,” reset the entire Democratic campaign framing for how to attack Trump.His story — a small-town kid who joins the military, serves his country for 24 years, becomes a beloved teacher and coach, then goes to Congress and on to governor — sounds like it was scripted by Hollywood. His fashion choices run toward battered Carhartt barn jackets and flannel shirts that, as former President Barack Obama said during his convention speech, “come from his closet” and not some political consultant. And those shirts, Obama said, have “been through some stuff.” (At this, Gwen Walz, his wife of 30 years, burst out laughing and mouthed “So true.” That’s become a punchline. But it’s also part of what connects him to working-class America. If Harris wanted another polished lawyer, she could have chosen Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a former Attorney General whose state holds a treasure trove of electoral votes.Walz’s accomplishments in Congress and as governor also are emblematic of what Harris would like to achieve on a broader scale as president: a government that lifts working- and middle-class families, a government that fights for average people to live the lives they choose.His fashion? Well, that’s just Midwest. We wear a lot of flannel up here.In an introductory video about her husband’s life, Gwen Walz related how they met as school teachers sharing a classroom divided “right down the middle.” His commitment to service, she said, “all comes back to the values we grew up with: love your country, help your neighbor and fight for what’s right. Because that’s what America is all about.”As Walz spoke about the fertility treatments that allowed the couple to have children, Hope, 23, wept and made a heart sign, while Gus, 17, stood sobbing and pointing to the stage, saying “That’s my dad.”Walz fired up an attack on Trump and his running mate JD Vance. “We know if these guys get back in the White House, they’ll start jacking up the costs on the middle class.” Walz told the crowd Trump and Vance want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, gut Social Security and Medicare, and ban abortion across the country. It’s an agenda, Walz said, that “nobody asked for, that serves nobody except the richest and most extreme amongst us and … does nothing for our neighbors in need.”And in what has become his signature word, Walz said, “Is it weird? Absolutely. But it’s also wrong. And it’s dangerous.”Beyond the attacks, the life story, the quips that launched him into the media stratosphere, Walz brings one other valuable asset that Harris would do well to maximize: a political trajectory that has both compromise and democratic principles at its heart. Those skills could pay dividends not just during the campaign, but in pushing through a Harris-Walz agenda should they win in November.He started his political career by unseating a longtime Republican congressman in GOP farm country. His moderate message and working-class backstory proved appealing to voters there and he was reelected five times. When he ran for governor, the district reverted to Republican hands and has remained in GOP control.In Congress, Walz ranked among its most bipartisan members. He considers himself progressive, but says his policies grow out of the same concerns and issues he and his wife faced raising their family.Minnesota is not the U.S. Neither is Harris’s home state of California. When the convention glow wears off, they’ll need to be ready for the brutal, no-holds barred fight ahead. But bet on a team that holds out a bright, inclusive vision for this country’s future that centers on average Americans."
philinquirer_2024_82,"A violent coast-to-coast, riot-cop crackdown on campus protests threatens the right for all dissent on the eve of the presidential election.The moral insanity of America’s long war in Vietnam — protested by 1960s kids who were on the right side of history, even if the grown-ups didn’t see it in real time — came to be defined bythe unnamed U.S. majorwho told journalist Peter Arnett after the particularly deadly 1968 battle of Bến Tre that “it became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it.”History doesn’t repeat but it rhymes, gratingly. Asa new generation of young peoplespeaks out against attacks on women and children halfway around the world — this time in Gaza — college administrators fromBostontoL.A.are racing to call in heavily armored riot cops to shut down protest encampments at campusesthey’d sold to applicantsas bastions of academic freedom, open expression, and historic demonstrations that had changed the world.They are destroying the American university in order to keep it “safe.” In a week whendecades happened, the lowest moments in what became a nationwide assault on college free speech bymilitarized policeveered from shock to tragicomical irony.At the University of Texas in Austin, right-wing authoritarian Gov. Greg Abbott ordered a large helmeted brigade of state troopers to march through the heart of his state’s flagship campus and shut down a pro-Palestinian protest that he’dbranded as violent and antisemiticeven before the event had actually started. Prosecutors laterdropped all criminal chargesagainst 57 UT students and others arrested by Abbott’s army, saying the arrests “lacked probable cause.” The riot cops were photographed marching past a UT promotional sign, “What starts here changes the world…”what starts here changes the worldpic.twitter.com/ZV0ojR4vQuStudents at two large Midwestern schools — Indiana and Ohio State Universities — who grew up on active shooter drills were shocked to look up during their campus protests to see what appeared to be trained police snipers aiming long guns at the action. IU officials stayed mum about what seemed to bephotographic proof. In Ohio, where the volley of National Guard shots that killed four students at Kent State University ata May 4, 1970, protest still echoes today, OSU officials called the rooftop officers just spottersbefore admittingthey’d “switched to long-range firearms” at night “once the troopers began using force on the students.”Apparently “using force on the students” wasn’t a problem for them.Some of the most shocking footage came from Atlanta, involving police and the state troopers who in 2023 hadshot and killed a protesteragainst the police training center known to foes as “Cop City.” Multiple videos from Emory University showed a string of violent arrests, including a young Black man who wasshot with a Tasereven though officers had immobilized him on the ground. When an Emory economics professor, Caroline Fohlin, saw a cop violently arresting a student and screamed, “What are you doing?!,” a second officer grabbed her andslammed her hard to the ground,her head against the hard pavement, as she screamed, “I’m a professor.” Fohlin, who was shown on video doing no more than raising her voice, was charged with “battery” against a police officer.One of the most chilling videos from Georgia, ironically, shows no violence at all. In it, Noëlle McAfee, chair of Emory’s philosophy department, stylishly dressed, handbag slung over her shoulder, isled away in handcuffsby a masked officer. She later told a faculty meeting that, like Fohlin, her supposed crime was questioning an officer making a violent arrest of a student.In her regular life as a distinguished academic, McAfee wrote a book,Democracy and the Political Unconscious,which argues that America’s untenable “global war on terror” showed a need to keep reliving the trauma of the 9/11 attacks — a concept that must have crossed her mind as a militarized cop led her away. She turned to a videotaping studentand asked, “Can you call the philosophy department and tell them I’ve been arrested?”I’d kind of like to call the philosophy department myself, in the hope that some beautiful mind there can explain to me how college presidents can morally justify calling armed police officers against their own students to clamp down on free speech, beyond their desperationto stay employed. Or maybe someone in Fohlin’s economics department could pick up the line and do the math for me on why America’s best universities valuetheir biggest donorsover their students’ free expression.The most tumultuous week on U.S. college campuses since May 1970 resulted inat least 600 arrestsat 15 different schools as of Saturday, with more surely on the way. It’s going to take even longer to tally all the students facing suspension and in some cases expulsion for speaking out onthe bloodshed in Gaza, or the now-ruined careers of principled professors who stood between their students and a nightstick.Not to mention the lasting psychological scars for young people who saw their dream college summon cops to arrest them or even fire rubber bullets or canisters of tear gas at them, which would be considered a war crimeif used in Ukrainebut is apparently OK in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s hometown of Atlanta.The notion ofcollege as the American dream— fostering not just upward economic mobility but a nation of informed citizens taught to think critically — has been steadily dying since the originalright-wing backlash against student protestin the 1960s triggered the end of taxpayer support for low tuition, which caused a $1.75 trillion student loan crisis. The maelstrom around the war in the Middle East has given the enemies of higher education — and they are many — a chance to move in for the kill.Their ammunition is the complicated relationship between student protests for Palestinian liberation and against Israel’s current conduct in Gaza, where its more-than-six-month assault has killed at least 33,000 people — the majority of them women and children — and the constant scourge of antisemitism. Even though some advocates lump political criticisms of the state of Israel underan overly broad definition of antisemitism, there’s no question that the despicable harassment and assaults on Jews on or around college campuseshave risensince the Oct. 7 start of the war (as they also havefor Muslims .A few of the claims linking the worst antisemitism to the student protests have been disingenuous, such as whensome journalistscited a nonstudent and well-known antisemite stationed a block from the Columbia University main gate as an example of protester hate speech. At Boston’s Northeastern University,administrators sent in policeSaturday who detained 100 students based on a shout of “Kill all the Jews!” that veteran journalists on the scene said came from a Jewish demonstrator waving an Israeli flag, apparently seeking an escalation.But there has also been some instances of antisemitism that are indeed the fault of pro-Palestinian student protesters. In the most egregious example, an encampment leader at Columbia posted a video in which he said “Zionists don’t deserve to live!”He’s been bannedfrom the Manhattan campus, and rightfully so. Just as it was a relief when the Cornell student who made vile antisemitic threatswas arrested. It shows that the tools to single out and punish the perpetrators exist. So why instead blow up the entire ivory tower in a cloud of tear gas and paranoia?» READ MORE:Fear and loathing on America’s college campuses as free speech is disappearingThe biggest driver is right-wing authoritarianism. Red-state governors like Abbott in Texas or Georgia’s Brian Kemp have watched the new hero of U.S. conservatism, Hungary’s Viktor Orban, makecrushing his homeland’s once freethinking universitiesthe centerpiece of his strongman governance. Now they are importing the strategy. The Gaza protests have given governors and their fellow travelers on Capitol Hill a golden opportunity to squelch the notion of a liberal education while squeezing out a few more tax-cut dollars for their billionaire donors, and creating a nightly Two Minutes Hate of young peopleon Fox Newsthat distracts from the 88 felony counts against their presidential candidate.The hypocrisy is astounding, especially from the likes of Abbott, who actually signed a 2019 law he insisted would protect students’ freedom to speak their mind. “Some colleges are banning free speech on college campuses,”Abbott said five years ago. “Well, no more.” Well, that’s exactly what Abbott and his tin soldiers did last week, even though months earlier the governor was silent when the Texas Republican Partyrejected a ban on associating with Nazi sympathizers.The complexities of never-ending conflict in the Middle East is what allows the cynical Greg Abbotts of America to get away with this. Too many would-be Democratic critics are too wedded to years of deep support for Israel, ignoring that a the right-wing extremismof Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies is not your father’s Israel and b the assault on campus free speech has much deeper implications than the current crisis. Too many college presidents have displayed extreme cowardice, caught in the headlights between Republican bullying andbillionaire donors, who likely fear the protesting students might eventually question the brand of capitalism that made them billionaires.Topping off this perfect storm is a critical failure on the left, which over the last couple of decades has emphasized a particular brand of campus identity politics that didn’t take the free-speech question seriously, despite warnings from folks who remembered how hard students fought in the 1960s and ‘70s to win those rights. The safe-spaces crowd is now seeingthe “safety” issue turned against themat places like the University of Southern California, where administrators’ fear of a Muslim valedictorian led to the cancellation of commencement for 65,000 people.But the biggest problem is the large mass of Americans sitting on the couch and saying absolutely nothing, glued to the nonstop Trump Court TV that cable news has become, watching pundits fret that democracy will die in the November election even as a runaway police state already clamps down in April. Look, the threat ofa Trump 47 dictatorship is real, and last week’s three-hour Supreme Court debate over whether any presidentis above the lawwas riveting, even if in a healthy republic it would have lasted just three minutes. Too many boomer “Trump Resistance” types see the wave of college arrests as a distraction, a sideshow. Trust me, this is the entire ballgame.Ending free speech on college campuses is the leading edge of a bigger war against dissent that could already be lost by Nov. 5, and any contest of the election result that follows. I’m sure Congress and President Joe Biden have some valid concerns about Chinese ownership of TikTok, but I doubt lawmakers would have moved so quickly to threaten a large media platform with extinction were it not for fear thattoo many young people are exposed to ideasthey find dangerous. The chaos on college campusesis already being citedto curb other protests, such as moving demonstrators far away from July’s Republican National Convention so they can’t be heard. Democracy defenders might find the battle to stop a second Jan. 6 coup was lost on the playing fields of Emory.By the time a returned-to-the-White-House Trump makes good onhis vow to send out troopsand tanks to put down any Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration protesters, America might be numb to such images. That’s why the time to speak up for America’s young people and everyone’s right of free speech — to your neighbors, or in church or at the coffee shop, or even at the family dinner table — is today. We can’t trust the job to feckless college presidents who are willing to watch their students get slammed to the ground to save their jobs. Will somebody please call the philosophy department?» READ MORE:SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter"

It may also trigger memories of our government’s acknowledgement of the threat to our nation when, in September 2022, Congress authorized the stand-up of the Foreign Malign Influence Center under the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. So what’s new here? In a cowrie shell, the intensity and breadth of the operations, stemming from the use of AI.Recall that good influence campaigns build on a kernel of truth and exploit preexisting societal conditions (like tensions , fanning flames and channeling angst in a desired direction. That said, consider how this may be employed against us, members of U.S. society, through current controversies.The unprecedented felony conviction last month of former President Trump (one of the most polarizing political figures in our history and the upcoming presidential election, which may feature this same personality, provide ample grist for bad actors’ foreign influence mills.“Propaganda works best when those who are being manipulated are confident they are acting on their own free will.” — Joseph Goebbels“What should we look out for?,” you ask. First, understand that the recent court ruling would have provided ammunition in the covert influence wars irrespective of the verdict, as will be true with the election and its outcome; the polarity of the issues and the person involved are what make them ripe for use against us.Next, look for signs that the issues are being used to grow divisions and leverage the divide for the benefit of our adversaries (reducing aid to Ukraine, weakening resolve for defending Taiwan, recognition of a Palestinian state, undermining support for professional journalism and our security services, eroding the checks and balances that underpin our government’s stability .Be particularly sensitive to indications that the narrative is trying to cast doubt on the value of our constitutional republic (and democracy more broadly by attacking our judiciary, which is still upheld as a gold standard across the globe. Foreign efforts like these are largely aimed at discrediting the much-envied U.S. way of life, to convince the citizenry of authoritarian states that their hopes for democracy are misplaced, that they should accept limited freedom under the unchecked strongman leadership of Xi, Putin, and Khamenei.An unfortunate side effect, however, is that this can fuel authoritarian sentiments in disgruntled pockets of democratic societies, including our own, and turn firebrands against the rule of law and judicial process in favor of party power or the advancement of controversial agendas.Need proof? Look no further than the growing talk in U.S. political circles of reviving the short-lived schedule F civil service track (implanting sycophants of the country’s ruler into otherwise independent bodies of government , something seen in communist and totalitarian states and despotic regimes in the Middle East and North Africa. Look at the domestic political chatter about a “post constitutional” America.Irrespective of your position on the Trump verdict and election, this column has in a few installments equipped you with media literacy tools to inoculate yourself against any efforts to manipulate your views (and your vote , to make you what Russian dezinformatsiya agents call “useful idiots.” So … be informed, not influenced.

leoweekly_2024_35,"For Democrats to change candidates, it’s too late.They knew in 2020 that Joe Biden was aged. Now, despite the other things we know to be true, for the sake of all the roles that make up an administration and judges likely to be appointed, Democrats need to calm down and think past the President. We are four months from an election. We don’t have time for this.Yes, Joe Biden is old and ignoring Israel’s slaughter of Palestinians, but Trump is batshit crazy, full of Project 2025 rhetoric and money that threatens the very fabric of our democracy. Americans don’t have the best of choices, but one definitely makes the absolute most sense in terms of a future for this place.America is bigger than one man, and despite Biden’s poor debate performance, he knew what he was talking about. He stuttered over some words and fumbled a sentence or two. When he was on point, he was on point with truth and logic. The other candidate wanted to inject you with bleach and shine lights in your asses. So let’s cool our ageist jets and get a bit more clear.We have to live past this one election and our country cannot handle another four years of the absolute chaos of Donald Trump. Injected bleach will kill us, and we can’t kill germs with lights in our rectums. We can’t have another “Jan. 6” (where someone did actually die , and we can’t fund the infinite amount of lawsuits he is involved in. More than that, we cannot withstand the very risk that the people propping him up want to put our democracy through.Project 2025 is not just a spooky warning. It is a 900+ page treatise about how the Republican party wants to gut every single department of our government and stock it like convenience store shelving with people who only blindly support Donald Trump. If that sounds reasonable to you, and you don’t see a problem with losing medicare, food programs, putting Trump supporters in the Treasury, State Department, Department of Justice, etc., then just ignore what I’m saying, and replace Biden or vote for Trump.If you think the police are out of control now, wait until the man who took out a full page ad against five innocent kids in New York, gives them a license from the very top of our government to do whatever they want.Elections, compromised … The Supreme Court, filled with purchased and paid for judges like Clarence Thomas … More strange military entanglements and damaged relations with our true allies.I could go on, but hopefully the picture is clear, and the risks are made real. This is not a personality contest nor is it about the sane man’s age. Yes, his age can make his performance a little slower, but his cabinet can help prevent the total collapse of the last bits of freedom we retain.Perhaps some of this is hyperbole, but perhaps you haven’t read into the Project 2025 document, “Mandate for Leadership.”The point is simple, Trump already showed us the level of absolute chaos that he can create. His lack of action during COVID alone resulted in the deaths of thousands of American people. We can’t go back to that just because Joe Biden got older.Instead of the foolishness of replacing the top of the ticket four months before we vote, we need to be sure that the right people are ready to support an agenda that protects American people. We should spend that energy protecting poll workers in what is sure to be a very dangerous job this year.Is it a perfect solution, no.But we can’t be short-sighted or scared.Erica Rucker is LEO Weekly’s editor-in-chief.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_173,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°In quietly halting a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel last week, President Joe Biden at last began exercising U.S. leverage to halt a full-scale invasion of Rafah, the final refuge in Gaza for about a million Palestinians displaced by Israeli destruction elsewhere in the besieged territory.It’s the right move, even though Israel may have a sufficient stockpile from previous U.S. shipments to press forward.Biden has tried to walk a line between supporting Israel in its effort to destroy Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack that killed about 1,200 people, and pressuring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to limit civilian casualties. Until now, that pressure came only in the form of words. The Gaza death toll is nearing 35,000, and much of the strip has been obliterated. Survivors face starvation because Israel cut off access to corridors for delivery of food and other humanitarian assistance.Pressure from Biden succeeded in reopening some aid routes, but Israel has since limited their use.Israeli has launched airstrikes in Rafah and its troops and tanks entered the area on Tuesday. But as of yet there has been no large-scale bombing. On Wednesday, Biden said publicly for the first time that the U.S. would stop supplies of some offensive weapons if Israel launches a full invasion in Rafah.Congress, under pressure from Biden, approved $26 billion in aid to Israel last month, and administration officials said the president intends to deliver all of it.But for now, the holdup in delivery of bombs backs up U.S. warnings against destruction of Rafah.There is precedent for withholding weapons in order to exert leverage on Israel. In 1981, President Reagan delayed shipment of F-16 fighter jets in response to Israel’s bombing of Beirut and other military actions in Lebanon. The next year, amid Lebanon’s civil war, he halted delivery of cluster artillery shells.Reagan demanded that Prime Minister Menachem Begin end Israel’s “holocaust” in Lebanon, and Biden — then a senator from Delaware — reportedly demanded that Begin block construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. But Begin later said Biden was so adamant about defending Israel against invasion that Begin had to talk him down.According to Begin, who died in 1992, Biden said he’d use force to repel an invasion of Israel, even if it meant killing women or children.“According to our values,” Begin recounted telling Biden, “it is forbidden to hurt women and children, even in war. … Sometimes there are casualties among the civilian population as well. But it is forbidden to aspire to this. This is a yardstick of human civilization, not to hurt civilians.”That yardstick has been broken repeatedly beginning on Oct. 7, first by Hamas, but then again and again, by Israel. An older and wiser Biden has tried to get Netanyahu to remember and abide by that measure but has failed. Let’s hope the halt in bomb shipments, however temporary and modest, serves as an effective reminder.—Los Angeles Times Editorial Board/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

minnpost_2024_56,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As Minnesotans start to think about spring and the next boating season, we want to take a moment to celebrate the past season and the impact boating, and the marine industry, has on outdoor recreation.The Land of 10,000 Lakes is not just a nickname, but a testament to our love for water and the many opportunities it provides for leisure, recreation and economic growth.Minnesota is a boater’s paradise, with a vast network of incredible waterways. Whether you’re a serious angler, a family looking for a weekend getaway, or someone who enjoys the serenity of being out on the water, boating is an integral part of our way of life. Our beautiful lakes and rivers have long drawn people from across the nation and beyond, making Minnesota a top destination for boating enthusiasts.Beyond the undeniable charm and allure of Minnesota’s waterways, there is an often-overlooked engine driving our economy: the boating industry. Marine manufacturing plays a crucial role in shaping our state’s economic landscape. It supports thousands of jobs and contributes significantly to our overall economic prosperity.Minnesota’s recreational boating industry has a $6.9 billion annual economic impact, supporting 25,887 jobs and over 700 businesses.The economic ripple effect of the boating industry extends far beyond the factory floor. It stimulates local economies by supporting suppliers, service providers and retailers, thus driving demand for a wide range of goods and services.Additionally, our magnificent lakes attract tourists and outdoor enthusiasts who not only spend on boating but also on equipment, accommodations, dining and other leisure activities. This tourism boosts our local economies and tax revenues.Our boating sector and state agencies are working together to support and nurture this thriving industry by recognizing the potential for growth in the boating sector and the positive effects it has on the livelihoods of countless Minnesotans.Through the newly formed Outdoor Recreation Industry Partnership, a collaboration between four state entities — including Explore Minnesota, the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Employment and Economic Development and Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation — we’re working together to sustainably and equitably grow Minnesota’s economy through outdoor recreation opportunities and participation. That includes growing our marine manufacturing sector and investing in infrastructure, education and workforce development to help Minnesotans access the good jobs within them.Business leaders, environmental advocates and public safety officials worked to pass new boater safety laws last legislative session — an effort supported by the National Marine Manufacturers Association — and we’ll continue promoting ways to enhance boating by promoting responsible boating practices and preserving the natural beauty of our waterways. We can protect the very assets that make Minnesota a boating paradise.Also during the 2023 session, the Legislature and Gov. Tim Walz approved $149.9 million in investments to enhance outdoor experiences in Minnesota. Known as the Get Out MORE (Modernize Outdoor Recreation Experiences initiative, the funding centers on five key areas, including enhancing fisheries and fishing infrastructure, modernizing boating access, restoring streams and modernizing water-related infrastructure to support outdoor recreation.The boating industry is not just an integral part of Minnesota’s cultural identity; it is also a cornerstone of our economic strength. Let’s celebrate the achievements of our marine manufacturing sector and work together to ensure that the boating industry continues to thrive, bringing prosperity to our state and the people who call it home. Minnesota’s future is, indeed, on the water, and the possibilities are as numerous as our waters.Lauren Bennett McGinty is the executive director of Explore Minnesota and Bruce Nustad is president of the Minnesota Retailers Association."
eugeneweekly_2024_33,"We ve got issues. We live in a post-truth world where feelings matter more than facts. If you believe there are factual truths — for example, that climate change is largely the result of human activity, that vaccines protect us from the worst effects of COVID-19, and that Trump lost the 2020 presidential election — then how do you account for the millions of people who ignore these facts in favor of alternative ones? In aNew York Timesessay from June 2023, Maureen Dowd offers a disturbing explanation. “Some would say that Americans are being taken over by group think, slogans, conspiracy theories, lies and emotions, to the point that they have become unrecognizable … with an increasing abdication of the responsibility to think for oneself, surrendering to whatever germ is in the water. There’s no calm, no deliberation, no chance to change your mind about anything. Just a collapse of individuality, the very trait the country was founded on.” As we approach the 2024 election cycle, there is little chance that we will have calm and deliberation in our civic discourse. Donald Trump’s recent campaign allegations offer a preview of coming attractions: “The corrupt government cartel is once again destroying our country. We are a nation where free speech is no longer allowed, crime is rampant like never before, terrorists are invading our southern border, and the economy is in a recession. We are a nation that is hostile to liberty, freedom, and faith.” Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Are these statements truths, falsehoods or lies? How would we know the difference, and should we care? For those of us who want to know what’s true or false, what sources of information are trustworthy? Lee McIntyre, a research fellow at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University, talks about different forms of post-truth. There are falsehoods, when people say things that are untrue without meaning to do so. There are outright lies, which are falsehoods made with the intention to deceive others. There is a willful ignorance of facts, when people spread untruths without bothering to take the time to find out if their information is accurate. There is self-deception, when people believe in falsehoods that are shared by others in their friendship circle or online chat group – the “group think” that Dowd talks about. Sometimes post-truths are purposefully spread through corporate greed. The tobacco industry’s claims that smoking was safe is well-documented. Disinformation about climate change came from lobbying and advertising schemes made by the coal and petroleum industry. But more importantly, post truths flourish when people are susceptible to believing them in the first place. For example, we tend to accept information that already conforms to our existing beliefs. We don’t feel comfortable with information that suggests that we’ve been mistaken and should consider revising our opinions. We gravitate towards the same news feeds that confirm our values. Sometimes we convince ourselves of falsehoods by creating rationalizations. For example, people opposed to government-sponsored food stamps might rationalize that recipients are lazy, government-dependent and disinterested in finding work. We can be blind to even the most obvious truths if we find ourselves in the minority. Group-think and social conformity apply powerful emotional pressures for us to view the world the way that others do. And there is a skepticism among many of us that we can trust the media to inform us with factual reporting that brings meaning and context to the news. Which reporters and journalists should we consider trustworthy? With all of these potential pitfalls in finding the truth, it may be just easier to give up and accept living in a world of post-truths. But when we accept that we’re not alone, and that others also yearn to view the world with calmness and deliberation, then it’s in our best interests to seek out people in face-to-face discussions where we can subject our ideas to the scrutiny of others. On Wednesday Jan. 10, the downtown Eugene Public Library will host the first of six public discussions, free and open to the general public. These Community Philosophy Circles, co-led by Carolyn Lundquist and myself, will be held on the second Wednesday of each month. The Jan. 10 discussion is called “Living in a Post-Truth Era” and will begin at 6 pm. We hope to see you there."
minnpost_2024_0,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.While the buzz over Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz being selected as the vice-presidentialrunning mate for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris swirled around the world, I was on alecture tour in Sri Lanka — the country of my birth.An “adopted Minnesotan,” having Perham as my “birthplace” in America, I was widely asked about Walz and his credentials. I was delightfully affirmative: he is a life-long geography teacher, a high school football coach, and a great public servant.At this trying time of our republic, Walz is a leader that this nation desperately needs to carry on the legacy of other great figures from the Land of 10,000 Lakes.Leaders like Abraham Lincoln — who was Minnesota’s first U.S. president — have alwaysemerged unexpectedly to keep the country united and restore peace.At the crossroads of the American Experiment, Hubert Humphrey became the vice president under President Lynden B. Johnson when the nation was at war abroad in Vietnam and facing significant unrest at home amidst the Civil Rights Movement. Working alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the vice president spearheaded the Civil Rights Act, proposed the idea of a Peace Corps, and introduced the PL 480 Food for Peace legislation. With these enduring programs, Humphrey was an apostle of American altruism to the world.Following Humphrey’s progressive leadership, Walter Mondale transformed the office of vice presidency under President Jimmy Carter. He also conducted several landmark international negotiations behind the scenes during the tumultuous years of nuclear threats, oil embargo, and high inflation.Born inCeylon, Minnesota, Mondale was highly influenced by his Methodist father’s religious beliefs, including the charity for all of humanity as well as the support for civil rights and gender equality.Democratic presidential nominee Mondale selected Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate against the Reagan-Bush ticket of the Republican Party. Under the leadership of Tom Nides as the Midwest field director, I served as a volunteer in the1984 Mondale-Ferraro presidential campaign. Mondale’s choice of the first female vice-presidential contender was momentous in American history — paving the way for other leaders like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris.Sen. Amy Klobuchar has recently reminded us that Minnesota is the “Land of Vice Presidents.” In addition to that, the heartland of the nation is the home of great public servants in both Democratic and Republican traditions. Along with Mondale while at the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, I had a distinct privilege to know and work with several of them.After graduating from Perham High School as its first American Field Service (AFS exchange student, I had a month-long bus tour to Washington, D.C., where I had the great fortune to meet with Sen. Rudy Boschwitz and Vice President Mondale before returning to Sri Lanka.These leaders — along with my AFS family and friends in Perham — encouraged me to return “home” to Minnesota when the civil war broke out in my country of birth. Thanks to Boschwitz, I served on his staff in theSenate Foreign Relations Committeeat the time when the Republican and Democrat leaders used to work collegially for the cause of freedom and democracy beyond U.S. borders.While at the Minnesota House of Representatives and the University of Minnesota, I had the opportunity to work with former Gov. Orville Freeman — President John Kennedy’s secretary of agriculture — while he was at the Humphrey School. I told him that I had been a recipient of Humphrey’s Food for Peace program while growing up in rural Sri Lanka and inspired by the visiting Peace Corps and 4-H volunteers to travel to the United States.Equally, Gov. Harold Stassen — a signer of the UN Charter and President Dwight Eisenhower’s secretary of peace — was a friend of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the world’s first female prime minister. After I received theHarold Stassen Award for UN Affairs, we often discussed my work as the vice president of the UN Association of Minnesota and the civil war in Sri Lanka.Less known but influential Secretary of State Frank Kellogg under President Calvin Coolidge was the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom and a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. After World War I, Kellogg was a drafter of the Treaty of Versailles in Paris. His endearing legacy encompasses the multilateral Kellogg-Briand Pact — a treaty which renounced war as a national policy — negotiated with his French counterpart, for which Kellogg received the Nobel Peace Prize. Overwhelmingly, the Senate ratified the agreement, and almost all other nations followed the American lead.With the infectious spirits of President Lincoln, the “North Star” for the nation has produced an assortment of legendary public servants. A “happy warrior” like Humphrey and a devoted public servant and ambassador like Mondale, the exuberant Walz has now brought the DNA of the “Minnesota Nice” to the presidential campaign.Indeed,Vice President Harris chose the football “coach” and the geography “teacher” from rural Minnesota wisely — hoping to bridge the gaps between and among polarized groups and political factions in America.The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., recognized that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” In this spirit, Humphrey, Mondale, and other public servants from the “Heart of the Nation” built a mountain of everlasting programs, legislations and treaties. These have generated great things for America and the world.The continuing American Experience now has the chance to be led by yet another Minnesotan.Dr. Patrick Mendisis a presidential advisor to the National Security Education Board in the U.S. Department of Defense, an appointment by the Biden-Harris White House. He is an alumnus of the Perham High School, Minnesota State Community and Technical College-Fergus Falls, and the University of Minnesota."
suffolknewsherald_2024_39,"Published 6:17 pm Tuesday, May 21, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardMemorial Day is a solemn national holiday that like many other days of remembrance, and for reasons both seasonal and societal, has had its meaning largely subsumed.Don’t let it be.We won’t print a paper here, but we will look at the somber ceremonies and the ongoing commitment of many of our fellow citizens. We have our share of important symbols of their sacrifices made here in Suffolk and encourage you to visit one.One of those is the annual Memorial Day observance at 10 a.m. Monday at Albert G. Horton Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery, 5310 Milners Road.The ceremony honors and remembers all men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation, from the Revolutionary War to the present day. In one of the most beautiful patriotic displays you will see, American flags will be placed at each grave in the cemetery by volunteers prior to the ceremony.The event is free, and you won’t regret attending. In fact, you’ll be a better person and citizen for having gone.The ceremony will feature a keynote address delivered by Colonel Michael Winstead, a retired U.S. Army officer.Whatever you do this weekend, guard against the inertia and blissful ignorance afforded us by having our all-volunteer armed forces and a modern style of warfare that sometimes conceals the magnitude of their challenge. Don’t allow Monday to be entirely about the finishing of school years, opening of pools and shopping for sales. Take more than a cursory pause between bites of barbecue and leaps off the diving board.Memorial Day was actually initiated as a way to honor those who died fighting the Civil War, but it was rightfully expanded to encompass all American casualties.As our nation is increasingly divided by political squabbles of the day, a time to honor those who gave their lives to defend our freedom and the principles of our democracy is even more meaningful. Men and women have found common cause in more trying times than these and given everything to ensure we are able to maintain our way of life and form of government.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_165,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°There is a good chance that Donald Trump’s polling lead in the 2024 presidential election is more fragile than it looks.The most immediate problem for him is the fact that he’s on trial in a criminal case. Even if Trump isn’t convicted, the trial keeps him away from the trail.There is also the issue of the campaign itself, which is a smaller affair than his 2020 effort, with fewer resources. “The situation has alarmed GOP officials in key states, like Arizona, Georgia and Michigan, who have yet to receive promised funding, staff or even briefings on the new plans since the Trump team took control of the Republican National Committee in March,” The Washington Post reports.Trump could very well hold his lead through the summer and into the fall but still fail to turn stated preferences into actual votes. What looks solid in the numbers could turn out to be ephemeral in the final tallies.It’s much too early to say whether the polls are right or wrong. What we can say, however, is that the former president and his allies are already laying the foundation for an effort to contest — or even try to overturn — the results of the November election if voters don’t return Trump to the White House.For Trump, a man who seems to live in the eternal present, “stop the steal” never actually ended. He maintains, as he did Nov. 3, 2020, that he won the presidential election that put Joe Biden in the White House. Last month, he told an audience in Wisconsin, “We won this state by a lot.” (He lost it by 20,682 votes. He told Time magazine, in a recent interview, that he “wouldn’t feel good” about hiring anyone who believed that Biden was the legitimate winner of the last presidential election. Asked if he would accept the results of the 2024 election, Trump said that he would, “if everything’s honest.”Of course, for Trump, if he doesn’t win, then it isn’t honest.But it isn’t just Trump priming Republican voters to reject the results of the November election if Biden prevails. His allies are doing the same.Sen. JD Vance of Ohio told CNN on Sunday that in a “free and fair election,” he and every other Republican “will enthusiastically accept the results.” Meaning that if Trump does not win, then the election will not have been free and fair. Vance, who is so eager to serve as running mate to Trump that he made a pilgrimage Monday to the Manhattan courthouse where the former president is on trial for paying hush money to cover up his affair with a porn actor, has also said that if he were vice president in 2020, he would have told states to submit alternate slates of electors.Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., has said that she will accept the results if they are “constitutional,” and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has said that he will accept them if “there’s no massive cheating.”Now what, for this crowd, would constitute an unfair, unfree, unconstitutional election in which the results were shaped by “massive cheating”?Recall that after the 2016 presidential election, Trump blamed a wave of illegal voting for his popular-vote defeat. “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” he said on Twitter.Illegal voting was a useful boogeyman for a president-elect who ran on the fantasy that the United States had been besieged by illegal immigrants. It remains a useful boogeyman as the former president revs up his supporters with spittle-flecked attacks on immigrants, who he says are “poisoning the blood of our country.” If one set of Trump allies is spreading the notion of an unfair election, another set is building out what that might mean by placing the specter of illegal voting by migrants and immigrants living in the country without legal permission at the center of their rhetorical agenda.“We all know intuitively that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections, but it’s not been something that is easily provable,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said last week at a news conference he called to support a new bill that would ban immigrants living in the country without legal permission from voting in federal elections. This is already illegal under existing federal law, but Johnson insisted on the measure as necessary prevention in the face of uncertain information.Johnson, who voted in 2021 to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, was joined at the news conference by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, two so-called constitutional conservatives who initially urged the White House to try to contest and overturn the 2020 results in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. “We owe it to ourselves, to each other, most importantly to the American people, to make sure that those making decisions on behalf of our government and who’s going to serve in government in elective office are indeed empowered to make those decisions,” Lee said, validating the fiction that recent U.S. elections have been shaped, even stolen, by rampant illegal voting.Also present was Stephen Miller, the MAGA apparatchik behind some of the former president’s most viciously anti-immigrant rhetoric, who railed against noncitizen voting in characteristically apocalyptic fashion. “Democracy in America is under attack,” he said of the “wide-open border and obstruction of any effort to verify the citizenship of who votes in our elections.”With all of this, we are getting a first look, of sorts, at the next “stop the steal.” Yes, Trump could win the November election outright, in which case, there is no need for an elaborate conspiracy to explain the results. The election, as Vance said, will have been “free and fair.”But let’s say Biden recovers lost ground. Let’s say he wins the Electoral College with narrow victories in key swing states as he did in 2020. Let’s say that a few of those margins are exceptionally slim — a few thousand votes here, a few thousand votes there. We know what will come next. Trump will cry out “illegal voting,” and most of the Republican Party will follow suit. They’ll say that Democrats encouraged it with “open borders” and demand that states overturn the results. And Trump, notably, has not ruled out the use of violence to get what he wants.If the Republican Party could, for a moment, break itself from Trump’s influence, it would see that there’s a much easier explanation here: that Trump, for all of his bombast, is not actually an electoral juggernaut and that the solution to this problem is just to put him out to pasture.Most of the time, when their standard-bearers can’t close the deal with the voting public, U.S. political parties move on. Not so with this Republican Party. It can neither move on from Trump nor accept that he’s a divisive and unpopular figure for a large part of the American public.Some of this, it’s true, comes from the fact that much of the party is caught in the snare of the former president’s cult of personality. But some of it runs much deeper. The Republican Party never moved on from Richard Nixon’s “silent majority,” from the notion that it alone represents the supposedly authentic people of the United States. Democrats, no matter how many votes they get or how many elections they win, cannot, in this view, legitimately claim to represent the nation.From the Tea Party to Mitt Romney’s “47%” to Trump’s make-believe tales of fraud and illegal voting, Republicans treat Democratic voters and Democratic majorities as not quite right — not quite real, not quite American.

leoweekly_2024_23,"It is bad enough that we are subjected to “conservatives” making hate into legislation in our government systems but now their spawn are inviting the very detritus of humanity to speak at universities to our children. Kyle Rittenhouse is scheduled to speak at Western Kentucky University on Wednesday, March 27, at 7 p.m. The “Rittenhouse Recap” is supposed to cover the Second Amendment (this played-out conservative dirge and the “lies” of the Black Lives Matter Movement — because there is no one more qualified to speak about a Black life than a murdering, uneducated mouth breather who has never lived as a Black person. But, hear me out, let him speak.In case you don’t remember who Kyle Rittenhouse is, and my sarcasm above wasn’t enough to trigger the memory, let me refresh it for you. Kyle Rittenhouse was 17 when he fired anAR-15during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin killing two people and injuring another. He claimed self-defense because one of the men he murdered grabbed the barrel of his gun, likely afraid to be shot or to prevent others from being harmed by Rittenhouse who ran “Rambo” style into a crowd of protesters. Another of Rittenhouse’s victims swung a skateboard… yes, a skateboard at Rittenhouse and tried to grab the gun probably for a very similar reason. The third man, who was wounded by Rittenhouse, was the only person who approached him with a weapon intending to disarm him… or the good guy with a gun, an activist and paramedic, who wanted to stop Rittenhouse from shooting anyone else. Yanno, all wild speculations because two men are dead who can’t tell their stories and the third was wounded and wants to change his name because of conservative harassment. The wild part of this whole debacle is that Rittenhouse was acquitted because no one waited until he killed someone first when they saw the assault rifle.Rittenhouse is named in at least two civil lawsuits related to this event.Back to the issue at hand, Rittenhouse has become the poster boy for conservatives’ circle jerk over the Second Amendment and they’ve put the proverbial lipstick on a pig and paraded this monkey all over creation… coming soon to our own backyard.All gibes aside, Kyle Rittenhouse should not be celebrated for coming to speak at a university. He’s not really qualified to speak on either of these topics with any authority other than being the subject of a murder trial.Should he be allowed to speak?As a supporter of letting people take their lumps in public, I am not opposed but it shouldn’t be tied to some conservative circus like TurningPoint USA that lets Rittenhouse be sequestered and salivated over only amongst his bible-beating, flag-waving peers. He should have to take the stage for all students to have access and for all students to have the chance to debate and engage with his rhetoric without having to share their email addresses with this group. With that said,tickets are free, so all who are willing or interested should jump right in. That TPUSA is building their email list from this is sickening.A university is a place where one goes to be educated and, to be fair, this is a perfect chance to be educated in how America props up violence and white mediocrity — Rittenhouse is a Lakes Community High School dropout.At the time of the shooting and subsequent trial, Rittenhouse was a 18-year-old, doughy hothead who got lucky on a technicality. He’s certainly no marvel in this nation. He’s just another one in this nation’s long history of producing and celebrating the worst people. So should students be protected from him? No. Should he be on a stage? Not really, but here we are. So let him come, put him on a public platform for all of the kids (and adults at Western.WKU is attempting to wash their hands of any direct responsibility. In their statement issued March 14, the university said, “Since this event is not sponsored by WKU, we do not have any additional details to share. You are encouraged to contact the event’s organizers with any questions. While WKU’s commitment to free speech includes allowing groups to invite guests to campus, that does not mean that the university supports, endorses or agrees with the views of those individuals.”Even if WKU is not sponsoring the event, this event is happening at a public university, it has public implications and the university can’t sit this one out. They do bear some responsibility and if anyone is injured or hurt during the protests that are planned, they will have to take some heat and probably some insurance adjustment.Ultimately, Kyle Rittenhouse is another tool for conservatives to prop up during the demise of America democracy and the sell-off of our safety in their quest to take the United States back to a pasty, fictional past where Ozzie and Harriet represented the perfect American life — a life based on the fear of anything different. Kyle Rittenhouse just represents another person whose fear made him willing to kill to keep folks inside the lines of what conservatives imagine America to be.There are multiple calls to stop the show but I propose we let the show go on and meet it face to face. A wise man I met in a bar once said to me, “the only way out is through,” and he’s been right so many times. The only way we get out of this conservative nightmare is to plow our way right through the bullshit and meet it head on.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_44,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°US Chief Justice John Roberts arrives before President Joe Biden delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on Feb. 7, 2023. (Jacquelyn Martin/Pool/AFP via Getty Images/TNS In an ideologically-split 6-3 ruling Friday, the Supreme Court overruled what’s known as Chevron deference, a longtime legal principle that held that when administrative statutes are not explicit, federal agencies have latitude to interpret them, particularly when it comes to regulations. It’s not a widely-known principle but has undergirded the functioning of government for more than 40 years.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the overturned presumption “is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.” In isolation, this might make sense. Interpreting statutes is the judiciary’s whole bread and butter. If and when things aren’t laid out explicitly and in detail, we need an arbiter to make a final decision.But the courts have neither the ability nor knowledge to intervene in every case of ambiguity. The administration of a government the size and complexity of ours is not largely about resolving occasional broad statutory questions. Agencies all around the country rely on subject matter experts and career officials to make determinations about thousands of granular, often technical matters.These determinations are in furtherance of enacting the goals of Congress, because it turns out that Congress itself does not remotely possess the capability to do this itself. Legislators are sent to Washington to represent the interests of their constituents, not to understand the proper storage conditions for biohazardous materials on commercial transport flights or the control group requirements for human trials of heart drugs under FDA consideration. For that matter, judges should not be the ones parsing these things, basically because they can’t.On this Editorial Board, we do our best to dive into multiple areas of public policy and society, talking to experts and stakeholders to come up with informed opinions on everything from public transit to health delivery to immigration. We often disagree with certain policy decisions or their implementation; what we don’t do is believe that we have the capacity to overrule technical experts on the base-level facts.Do you, reader, know what polyfluoroalkyl substances are? These “forever chemicals” didn’t exist a few decades ago, but increasing bodies of research show that these chemicals are now in the bloodstream of practically every human on Earth, and are toxic in various ways. The Environmental Protection Agency is now endeavoring to limit the use and production of these chemicals. Does this fall into the EPA’s regulatory authority? What’s the proper way to safeguard public health and the environment in this matter?The query overlaid over all those others is: who should answer this question? Should it be medical doctors and PhDs in chemical engineering, or federal court judges, who will move even slower than internal agency deliberations?Now multiply that by every issue in every agency and you start to see the problem. Chevron’s detractors always maintained that companies wouldn’t begin to frivolously challenge practically every regulation enacted upon them by agency experts. Now we’ll find out, and we might all have worse air, worse products, worse consumer and labor protections and worse medical outcomes for it.— New York Daily News"

eugeneweekly_2024_25,"We ve got issues. Right before Christmas, my partner and I received a termination notice from our landlord. I lurched in shock, and then I got online to look for a new place. After a couple days of intense scrolling we found a modest dog-friendly rental in town that seemed perfect, so we hustled. On Christmas Day, I sent a letter by email to the property management agency describing us as “two adults near 70 with a three-year-old medium size poodle, prepared to sign a 12 month lease, including pet rent and security deposit.” I expected ageism to play in our favor, thought we would be treated like the ideal tenant, but I was wrong. The response we got from the property manager was a link to an app where adults over 18 must pay $45 each to register for individual credit and criminal investigations. That’s a nonrefundable $90 just to be considered. This we discovered is quite common. I guess it filters out the riff raff. Elitist, but effective. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. I’m good with apps and we were willing to lose the money, so we jumped on their merry-go-round. But I wondered what a more economically challenged household would do if they had to pay $45 per adult just to apply to be considered for a new place? My partner has been the resident caretaker of an estate where he lived for 19 years and where I lived for three. He has worked at the same business in town since 1995. But that meant nothing to our prospective landlord. We were treated like potential criminals until we signed the lease. The tenant portal required digital literacy. We had to have credit cards, smart phones, email accounts, personal computers, internet access and navigation skills, dexterity with password management, double authentication, downloading and uploading, taking photographs and sending attachments. This is also an economic filter as the underlying infrastructure for these skills costs thousands of dollars a year. Now I should say that I was a landlord in Boston from 1987 to 2000, and I appreciate the myriad ways tenants can grift a landlord. We lived in a three-family house with two tenants, and it was a lot of work to keep the place occupied and in good repair. It’s reasonable for landlords to want to protect themselves. But during all that time, I interviewed prospective tenants face-to-face, took them at their word, and trusted my instincts, never asking for proof of anything. We had many tenants, and I was only wrong once — if you don’t count the college students who painted their bedrooms black. Anyway, I appreciate the intention of the digital application process to protect the landlord and the neighbors. After we paid the $90, and before we met a human, each of us had 48 hours to produce digital records for government issued photo IDs, Social Security numbers, three months of bank statements showing deposits and withdrawals, and paycheck stubs showing salary, taxes, sick days and vacation days. Then we were finally allowed to inspect the place. Afterward, we were required to set up accounts for utilities at the new address, even though we had not signed a lease. For our new electric, water/sewer, trash removal and renter insurance we had to produce confirmation emails showing our new account number and address. Finally, we had to produce medical records for our dog with the contact information for his veterinarian, and his breed, weight, neuter certificate and rabies tag. Gathering all these documents and submitting them electronically took me six hours. Fortunately, I’m self-employed. As expected, we had to provide landlord references for the previous three years. When my Portland landlord from 2018-2020 did not respond to the property agent’s queries about me, the property agent asked to inspect our current home, which we agreed to. She came to our house and looked in every room to confirm that what we said about ourselves was true. Good for her. But you see how difficult it might be to deal with this for somebody who works far from home or is struggling with their life. Once all that paperwork was accepted, we were sent a link to the digital lease document, which included a detailed fixed-term 52-week lease, a smoke detector addendum, a mold addendum, a landscaping addendum, a pet addendum, a portable cooling device addendum, a relocation addendum, a move-in checklist addendum, a new tenant handout, a tenant education form, a satellite dish policy addendum, and a summary document, all to be digitally initialed before we gave them our electronic signatures and they gave us little brass keys. This was as complicated as getting a mortgage. Our new lease started Dec. 30, a week after we got the termination notice. Now we’re in, we’re settled, and things are good. Yet, the process of re-homing ourselves raises some important issues as we ponder the problem of affordable housing, homelessness and upward mobility. Housing is a digital competition. We played the game and won. Those without the skills and resources need not apply. We are the lucky ones. Billie Best is a writer living in Eugene. A longer version is atBillieBest.com."
minnpost_2024_40,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The marketing of gambling in new ways aimed at specific communities has become increasingly popular in the gambling industry. A recentNew York Timespiecesuggested that gambling ads should be regulated or banned. Specific marketing approaches were highlighted in a recent Associated Press article entitled, “Panel says the next generation of online gambling will be more social, engaged and targeted.” According to that piece, Chief executive Seth Schorr of Las Vegas-based Fifth Street Gaming planned to launch “a Latino-themed online social casino using his jefebet.com platform … , using the Spanish word for ‘boss.’”“Jefe”is a powerful and manly word. The use of Jefe suggests the gambling product is marketed toward men, evoking a sense of pride. The “American dream” is an essential financial goal of many community members. In parts of the Latinx community, there are deeply rooted values that men are bosses in the household, so the use of Jefeevokes gambling with power and pride. In considering sports betting, the community may want to think about “unidad con los ojos abiertos.” The phrase translates to unity, with eyes open.In the Latinx community, loneliness is less acceptable to discuss, and often goes unspoken. Social casino games may provide community members with a sense they are collectively working together to essentially beat the game, while each are individually winning, and that may align with community values around collective success. People from the community may value gambling with others, leading to a sense of pride for the community.Sports betting is culturally rooted; sometimes traditional forms of betting may involve chicken fights and horse races. It can be common to see competitive culture in the Latinx community. Community members strongly identify with sports teams, and team wins can represent a sense of personal and collective pride. Betting is often embedded into the Latinx cultural scene.While little research has been done to estimate rates of betting in the community locally, there is some evidence that betting may be common. For youth, betting can be seen as normalized. Sports betting is very popular with Latinx men. For some who work in blue collar jobs, there is the perception that one has additional disposable income to gamble. Betting can sometimes be seen as a way to make more money and create financial stability. While gambling may be popular, there is less general knowledge about how artificial intelligence is applied in the context of mobile betting apps.In Latinx communities, seeking mental health treatment is often seen as a sign of weakness. Religion is a safe space or an alternative to seeking mental health treatment. Language and adjustment stress from immigration represent barriers to treatment. It is particularly taboo for men to seek help or admit a problem, which may be an indicator of not being self-sufficient. Admitting you have a mental health problem or addiction may be viewed as a negative reflection on your masculinity. Community members may be less likely to seek treatment for problem gambling because gambling is so common and may not be widely viewed as a problem.While the word Jefe evokes masculinity and power, it may be that masculinity leads to a barrier to seeking help with one’s gambling.Wendy Garcia Rojas is a resident of Hennepin County and an aspiring future mental health professional.

suffolknewsherald_2024_81,"Published 4:30 pm Tuesday, February 6, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardThis Sunday, when the National Football League (NFL kicks off its championship game between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers in Las Vegas, most will be tuning in to cheer for one team or the other; some will be looking for the multi-million dollar commercials that have become synonymous with the game, some waiting to see Usher perform at halftime, and yes, some will be looking to catch a glimpse of mega-star Taylor Swift cheering the Chiefs and current boyfriend Travis Kelce.However, a smaller segment should be tuning in with pride, watching for the play of Chiefs number 48, Cole Christiansen. Christiansen is, after all, a homegrown Suffolk product. Christiansen, who graduated from Nansemond-Suffolk Academy, had a stellar college career at Army. Then, thanks to a change in legislation, he was able to pursue a career in the NFL before fulfilling his military obligation that went along with his attendance at the service academy. We spoke with Christiansen a couple of days after winning the AFC Championship game and punching their tickets to the championship game, and to say he is grateful and excited is an understatement.Making it onto an NFL active roster is no small feat. Only approximately 1,700 active players are in the league, and of those, only approximately 30 hail from the state of Virginia. In fact, of the seven Hampton Roads cities, only four are represented, and Suffolk is one of them, thanks to Christiansen.He is only one of two players from Virginia on either of the team’s active Super Bowl rosters. The other is Oren Burks from Lorton, who ironically also wears number 48 for the 49ers.On top of that, Christiansen has a chance to make history with his teammates and become the first repeat champions since Tom Brady and the New England Patriots last went back-to-back during the 2003-2004 season.Only seven teams have ever won back-to-back Super Bowls — a feat that has only happened eight times in NFL history. The teams are the Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers (twice , San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, and the New England Patriots.You may not be a fan of the Chiefs or even enjoy the sport, but we think everyone can enjoy the success of one of Suffolk’s own.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

They should be part of the conversation.Lastly, regarding the statement in the article, “We’ve found that restricting by lot size inadvertently discriminates against people who cannot afford a larger lot,” will this apply to owning pigs and goats, too?Chris Bothmer-StinsonKeaauAli‘i Parkway shouldbe highest priorityI was reading Mayor Mitch Roth’s campaign Q&A recently. He mentioned the Department of Public Works is restarting work on the Lako Street Extension and constructing a segment of the Ali‘i Parkway between Royal Poinciana and La‘aloa Avenue. I have a couple thoughts about these proposed plans.The Ali‘i Parkway should take precedence over expending time and money to redo the environmental assessment for the Lako Street Extension. The congestion in this area is a result of traffic heading north south and vice versa — not mauka to makai. It doesn’t make any sense to construct the only middle segment of Ali‘i Parkway and Lako Street Extension. This will only compound the issue.The Lako Street Extension traverses an area with significant historical features, and this should be another consideration.DPW completed the final environmental assessment for this 1,800-foot roadway in 2004. The previous landowner filed a lawsuit against the county contesting the final EA due to significant historical features. The lawsuit was later withdrawn when John Kobayashi, the previous landowner, passed away.The state isn’t in a position to help address this issue. They terminated work on widening Queen Ka‘ahumanu Highway Extension and Kuakini Highway due to cost considerations. Their current policy of focusing on system preservation and safety projects also played a role in this decision.I propose the county construct Ali‘i Parkway from Hualalai Road/Queen Ka‘ahumanu intersection to Keauhou Shopping Center in phases, pending funding availability.I know the segment between La‘aloa Avenue and Ali‘i Drive is rife with burials, but I believe the congestion in this area won’t be addressed unless a complete midlevel road is constructed.Aaron SteneKailua-KonaNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.Police are investigating a two-vehicle traffic collision Thursday afternoon in Pahoa that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with critical injuries."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_13,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Millions of American workers are surviving, or supplementing their income, in the gig economy. But this means forgoing the benefits attached to full-time employment.To address this reality, some states, including Pennsylvania, have been exploring the idea of portable benefits — specifically employer-funded savings accounts that follow workers, not their jobs. This is a valuable first step to explore alternative ways to protect workers.Pennsylvania’s first portable benefits model has been a six-month pilot program in association with the delivery company Doordash, which will come to an end next month. The company is matching 4% of participating delivery workers’ pre-tip earnings, putting the savings into a benefits account that can be used for retirement, paid time off, or health, dental or vision insurance. Drivers can also add money to the account themselves.The initial results of the program, which involved 4,400 drivers, look promising, at least according to the company — and its main cheerleader, Gov. Josh Shapiro. If successful, state legislation could ensure these benefits reach all gig workers — including freelancers, temp workers and domestic laborers.Doordash is aware that many of its drivers utilize the app as an occasional financial crutch, with the majority delivering for less than four hours a week and many holding other jobs. As a result, the bar to qualify for the program was earning $1,000 (pre-tip over several months.But the most important aspect of the savings account is its flexibility. Doordash drivers can still add to their savings while doing other gig work, like fulfilling Grubhub or Deliveroo orders, or while driving for Uber or pet-sitting for Rover. And they can take the account with them if they cut ties with Doordash entirely.It’s a small start: The 4% match only applies to base delivery earnings, not tips — ultimately making up a small fraction of what drivers actually bring home. Advocates have derided the effort as offering merely “pennies” to workers, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer.But that’s the nature of a pilot program: If it proves too small to be worthwhile, the company and the state can consider more generous plans, or abandon the idea altogether. Final reports on the pilot will likely be released in September.This shouldn’t distract politicians considering broader measures to protect gig workers. Just this month, Massachusetts implemented a wage floor of over $30 an hour for Uber and Lyft drivers. Pennsylvania should monitor closely consequences of this change — its impact on quality of life for drivers as well as the cost to consumers — and consider following suit if the evidence suggests it.In the meantime, the Pennsylvania savings account pilot program is an example of modest experimentation — the states are, after all, said to be the “laboratories of democracy” — that could ultimately make a big difference for gig workers here and everywhere.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_132,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Israel stands accused of genocide as it fights to destroy Hamas in response to its savage terrorist attack last October. Is the world’s only Jewish state being held to a different standard? Many Israelis believe this to be true, and they are, undeniably, right. It doesn’t, however, make all criticism of the war in Gaza either unfair or antisemitic.It’s surely true, to name one example, that the appalling death toll in Gaza — now estimated by the Hamas-led health authority at about 36,000 — cannot alone explain the scale and depth of the international outcry it has caused. Where were the campus protesters and genocide claims when at least 10 times that number of ethnic Tigrayans were killed or deliberately starved to death by the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments in a war that ended only last year?Equally indisputable is that prosecutors at the International Criminal Court have set a precedent by recommending arrest warrants on war crimes charges for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. If the court approves that request, it will be the first time since the ICC’s inception in 2002 that it has targeted the sitting leaders of a democracy, even though other democracies have, of course, done some very bad things. Invading Iraq on a lie, at the cost of hundreds of thousands dead, would be one candidate. The ICC warrants sought against Hamas are equally unprecedented; never before has the court indicted terrorists for war crimes. Many Israelis are furious at the idea that their elected leaders should be equated with terrorists in this way, no matter how much they may dislike Netanyahu. All of the above is accurate, but it also entirely misses the point. And that’s in no small part, I think, because those same Israelis are seeing a different war unfold on their TV screens and news pages than the daily horror show of broken Palestinian children that’s seen outside the country.On Monday, news organizations around the world (as well as Israel’s own leftist Haaretz led their news pages with an IDF strike on Rafah that set refugee tents on fire, killing 45 people, according to initial reports from the Hamas-controlled Gaza health authority. Yet neither Israel Today nor Yedioth Ahronoth (Latest News , which together account for about half of all Israeli news readership, had that story on their home pages for much of the day — even after the prime minister acknowledged the IDF had made a “tragic mistake.” Instead, they headlined on the long-term threat posed by Hamas, on newly released footage of the Oct. 7 massacres, a further twist in Netanyahu’s trials on corruption charges, or on rockets fired from Lebanon (an evacuated home was hit . This sanitized account of the IDF’s continuing effort to eliminate Hamas is either missing or glossing over undeniable facts. The first is that Gaza is being leveled. You can argue as to why and who is to blame, but it has happened. The 2,000- and 1,000-pound bombs that the US only recently stopped sending Israel cause fatalities within a radius of about 360 meters (1,181 feet , making high rates of collateral damage inevitable in a densely populated urban area such as Gaza. Israel has used these bombs liberally, which is a choice.Equally undeniable is that the unfolding IDF assault in Rafah has blocked the main aid crossing to Gaza, undoing recent improvements in the quantities of food and other aid that had been making it into the territory. People will go hungry as a result. Israeli officials say they’re doing their best and point to aid theft by Hamas. Yet the decision to resist opening more crossing points, and to not crack down on Jewish extremists who blocked or destroyed aid on its way into Gaza, suggest the government is, at a minimum, recklessly negligent in ensuring the provision of basic necessities to Gaza’s civilian population.None of this proves the legal charge of genocide, a crime that requires not a certain number of casualties or weapon types, but the intent to wipe a group of people out in the place where they live. When 8,000 unarmed men and boys were executed by Serb forces in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995, it was ruled a genocide because the intent to exterminate a whole class of people in that particular location was so clear.Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have provided South Africa with fodder for its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice — which hears state-on-state complaints — by calling to remove Palestinians from Gaza, at the same time IDF actions are making it uninhabitable. It isn’t enough to say these men aren’t in the war cabinet; Netanyahu depends on them to stay in power, and Israelis should be concerned they are being led by extremists toward a crime they would not condone. Of course, Israel is a special case. It will always be singled out, often unfairly and for malign reasons. No other conflict, after all, takes place on the Holy Land, a patch of desert claimed as a spiritual home by three major religions and fought over for centuries. No other nation was formed as a refuge from pogroms. Few others have such a controversial modern history, in which Arabs and Jews have fought multiple wars aimed at removing one or the other people from the land, a contest that remains unresolved after 70 years. Fewer still have resulted in a permanent, unstable refugee status, accompanied by de facto military occupation and aggressive settlement.But the arrest warrants, campus protests and genocide accusations were not inevitable. These were the direct results of the Netanyahu government’s policies, pushed into hyperdrive since he scraped back into power with the help of ultra-right parties in December 2022.Double standards should not be Israel’s big concern here. The question for Israelis should be how they want to be led, how they retrieve the remaining hostages in Gaza alive, and how they win the war. That victory won’t come the day Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar is killed in a Rafah tunnel, but when Israelis can live in security, which will depend on addressing the Palestinian despair Hamas feeds on. This is the goal by which Israelis should judge their own leaders, as well as the claims of outsiders."
minnpost_2024_17,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In a recent Community Voices commentary (“It’s just math: We need recycling and mining to achieve our clean energy goals,”April 10 , Todd Malan — the chief external affairs officer at Talon Metals and a previous vice president of corporate relations at global mining giant Rio Tinto — claims that sulfide ore mining is “just math” and that Minnesota needs to “mine today” so that “future generations” can “rely less on mining.” That is not the whole truth.First, it is equally “just math” that you could permit every risky and destructive sulfide ore mine proposed in Minnesota and the metals mined wouldn’t even put a dent in industry projections that nickel and copper need to increase by 40% to build out renewable energy.Second, for Minnesota local and downstream communities, sulfide ore mining is not “just math.” Sulfide ore mining threatens the clean water and natural resources future generations will rely on for health, culture and their very survival. It is time for Minnesota to require that mining companies Talon Metals and Rio Tinto tell the whole truth about the dangers and scale of their proposed Tamarack nickel-cobalt-copper mine here in Minnesota. That would require a new regional study.When sulfide ore mining was first proposed in northeast Minnesota’s Duluth Complex bedrock in the 1970s, our state required a comprehensive regional study of impacts of copper-nickel mine development in that region. Why was that study necessary?The Minnesota Environmental Quality Board explained in its final Regional Copper-Nickel Study that “conventional site-specific environmental impact statements (EISs and the corresponding regulatory process were inadequate to deal with the broader issues involving this unexploited resource.”New sulfide mining proposed by Talon and Rio Tinto in our Mississippi and St. Croix River headwaters creates the very same problem.Talon has proposed that all Minnesota needs to know would be provided in an EIS looking at the effects of mining 225 acres, even though Talon controls 31,000 acres of mineral leases and has drilled far to the north and south of its initial mining “project.” Talon’s corporate communications stress that the Tamarack Intrusive Complex is a “world-class high grade nickel, cobalt, copper district” and admit that the present deposit is only a tenth of 1% its total area.How could an EIS covering a tenth of 1% of the potential Tamarack mining region protect the environment, cultural resources or future generations in Minnesota? It couldn’t.Think about a surgeon about to cut into your abdomen who told you about the risks of only one tenth of 1% of your proposed operation. Wouldn’t you demand more information? How long would your whole operation take? How much would the incision be enlarged? What organs would be removed?Scientists involved with Minnesota’s Copper-Nickel Study of the Duluth Complex emphasize that this 1970s report did not study the cumulative environmental, social and economic impacts of mining the Tamarack Intrusive Complex mineral deposit. Baseline data in the Tamarack region is inadequate to identify, avoid or even minimize impacts to our air, water, public health and natural and cultural resources through the regulatory process.Sulfide ore mining in the Mississippi River and St. Croix watersheds also raises new issues. How would sulfate pollution affect mercury contamination of fish in recreational lakes, the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway and Minnesota’s largest population center downstream? What effects would massive dewatering from underground mining have on Minnesota’s shallow lakes, tamarack bogs and some of our state’s most abundant wild rice beds?A regional study of the Tamarack Intrusive Complex is also urgently needed because scientific knowledge has developed in the past 44 years. New science has established that sulfate pollution kills wild rice and that toxic mercury can magnify as much as one million times in the food chain. New evidence demonstrates the risks of lung disease from inhaling nickel and asbestos-like fibers and the threats of cancer from arsenic and of neurological damage from manganese in drinking water. The Eagle Mine, previously owned by Rio Tinto, is no proof of safety; it has polluted groundwater with both nitrates and arsenic.Before any mining company is allowed to cut into the earth in Minnesota’s Mississippi or St. Croix watersheds, Minnesota needs to obtain scientific data and cumulative analysis of potential harms of the entire Tamarack region operation. Then, armed with the whole truth on cumulative risks and benefits, Minnesotans can decide whether we want to go through with the major sulfide mining operation proposed by Talon Metals/Rio Tinto or whether to send them packing.Bruce Johnson is a retired scientist who worked on Minnesota’s Duluth Complex Copper-Nickel Regional Study.

minnpost_2024_60,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.This month marks Minnesota’s first anniversary of the historic passage of the 100% clean energy law. This bold action taken by our governor and Legislature sets forth ambitious clean energy goals and directs future investments and policy for our electricity sector — but to meet our economy-wide goals, we can’t slow down now. An essential step to get to scale is to address the significant emissions within our transportation sector and set a Clean Transportation Standard.The bulk of Minnesota’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the transportation and agriculture sectors, and this session the Legislature has the opportunity to address this problem head-on. They can do this by passing a Minnesota Clean Transportation Standard that will dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in both the transportation and agriculture sectors, increase rural economic opportunities, improve soil health and water quality, and result in a more efficient and just energy transition for these highest emitting sectors.The transportation sector is changing — and so too must our policies. That’s what makes a Clean Transportation Standard developed specifically for Minnesota so exciting. It’s a market-based solution customized to our state that will steer the transportation sector in the right direction while driving the adoption of new crops that improve soil health and water quality.The cars and trucks we drive are entering a period of profound transformation. A Minnesota Clean Transportation Standard would provide unprecedented support to accelerate a clean and equitable transition in our transportation sector.As more Minnesota consumers and businesses adopt electric vehicles, they will increasingly replace gasoline-powered cars and trucks on the road. As this happens, gasoline use will decline together with the ethanol that is blended into it.Fresh Energy, Conservation Minnesota, and Friends of the Mississippi River all engage in robust policy work in this field. We are appointees on the state’s Clean Transportation Standard Work Group, and we are committed to ensuring the economic, greenhouse gas reduction, and water quality benefits our state can seize through a Clean Transportation Standard.Under the proposed Minnesota Clean Transportation Standard, Minnesota could see up to an estimated $134 million to $268 million annually by 2030. Our state could use this new funding source to make critical investments in statewide charging infrastructure and incentives for electric vehicle buyers.Expert modeling done for the Clean Transportation Standard Working Group forecasts that ethanol use will decline in year one of the program and continue thereafter. We can also look to other states with long-lived clean transportation programs to further reinforce that this policy does not increase the production of corn ethanol.Rest assured, the Clean Transportation Standard will be tailored to the needs of our state, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles with dedicated support for communities overburdened by pollution and under-served communities throughout greater Minnesota. The Clean Transportation Standard could also boost the rural economy by creating market demand for the transition to lower-carbon farming by supporting cropping choices and practices that improve soil health and water quality while reducing on-farm emissions.At its core, the Minnesota Clean Transportation Standard is a commonsense strategy built for Minnesota. The data shows that it will drive down fuel use, accelerate the electrification of our vehicles, and provide a significant source of new funding dedicated to equitably advancing electric vehicle adoption in under-served and under-resourced communities most impacted by climate change.By passing this bill, the Legislature can drive historic economic development opportunities while taking our most significant step ever in reducing climate change emissions from two of our state’s most challenging sectors.Margaret Cherne-Hendrick, Ph.D., is Senior Lead, Innovation and Impact at Fresh Energy; Paul Austin is the Executive Director of Conservation Minnesota; and Ellen Anderson is a climate policy advocate at Friends of the Mississippi River."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_145,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°President Joe Biden doesn’t have the power to shut down the border. Except when he decides that he does.Earlier this year, Biden vowed to “shut down” the border if only Congress would give him the legislative high sign.“Just give me the power. I’ve asked from the very day I got into office,” he said in January. “Give me the Border Patrol, give me the people, the judges — give me the people who can stop this and make it work right.”Turns out he was “the people.”The president is planning executive action that would allow him to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border once the number of migrant crossings reaches 4,000 per day, a source close to the White House told The New York Post last week.It matches a provision in February’s failed Senate bipartisan border bill, which gave the president authority to expel migrants when border crossings reached that number.It’s an odd number to set as a basis for action, as the U.S. has surpassed that number for months. In March, southwestern border authorities stopped an average of more than 6,300 migrants per day — and that doesn’t include so-called “gotaways” who escaped detection and arrest.At the end of last year, Border Patrol processed nearly 50,000 migrants who entered the U.S. illegally in a five-day span, with daily apprehensions surpassing 10,000 three times, up from the 6,400 average in November, according to federal data obtained by CBS News.We’ve hit 4,000 a day, many times. So why that number now? Does this baseline mean that action will be immediate? And how effective will Biden’s actions be?As illegal immigrants make the headlines after committing crimes, sometimes violent, sometimes drug-related, some have turned out to be repeat offenders. The crossed the border, got caught and arrested, and deported. But then they re-enter illegally. Sometimes they’re caught and jailed, but the strained Border Patrol can only do so much.Using 4,000 crossings a day as the basis for “shutting down the border” is looking at the wrong number. What Biden should have been doing all along is looking at the costs to cities, towns and states tasked with housing and caring for migrants.Mayors and governors around the country have been scrambling for months to find the money to cover shelter for the migrant influx, with little to no help from the feds. That was the canary in the coal mine.Services are facing cuts as budgets burst at the seams to pay for migrant care. If Biden had taken action back in January, when he insisted he didn’t have the power to do what he’s reportedly going to do now, it would have made some difference.But since Biden has rediscovered his Executive Order powers, he shouldn’t let up. Open the fed coffers to help states like Massachusetts defray the cost of the migrant influx.Of course this election-year grandstanding. But as long as Massachusetts starts getting some big checks with a D.C. postmark, that’s fine with us.—Boston Herald Editorial Staff/TNSA 71-year-old Hilo man pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree negligent homicide for the Oct. 3, 2023, traffic collision death of a 79-year-old Hilo woman.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.7 p.m. update:."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_64,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/TNSDr. Anthony Fauci, former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic on June 3 at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C.Over his half-century career, Anthony Fauci learned what it was like to be both loved and loathed.Over his half-century career, Anthony Fauci learned what it was like to be both loved and loathed.As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, he was at the red hot center of the HIV/AIDS crisis, working exhaustively first to identify the agent that was killing so many young gay men and then to develop treatments to keep them alive.As the public face of the government’s response, he was vilified by activists such as the playwright Larry Kramer, the founder of the radical group ACT UP, and accused of having blood on his hands. They wanted him to allow people dying of AIDS to be treated with promising but still experimental drugs.Finally, and without warning other officials, Fauci publicly called for a change in policy to provide access to drugs while they were in trials. Then-President George H.W. Bush’s chief of staff, John Sununu, called Fauci to find out “what the hell is going on,” the 83-year-old physician recounts in his new memoir, “On Call.”Later, at a government hearing on the new policy, Kramer, who was famous for his outbursts, yelled from the back of the room, “Tony, I have called you a murderer in the past, but you are now my hero.”“Go figure,” Fauci writes.That muted reaction is vintage Fauci.As a middle-class Italian American kid growing up in New York City, Fauci was schooled by Jesuits and excelled at basketball. He sailed through college and medical school at the top of his class and loved every moment. He opted for a career at the highest levels of public health, where he could cure diseases and treat patients too.Fauci’s prose is less poetic and more Joe Friday, but his humanity shines through on every page.In 2014, for example, Fauci insisted on being photographed hugging Nina Pham, a Texas nurse he had treated for Ebola, to ease her fears about the stigma of the disease.In 2021, he knocked on doors in Washington’s Ward 8, a primarily Black neighborhood, with Mayor Muriel Bowser, encouraging people with deep mistrust of authorities to get vaccinated. “I am very well aware that historically the medical community has not treated you well, and we should be ashamed,” he said at Harlem’s Abyssinian Baptist Church. “But that is history. These vaccines are designed to save everybody — you and me.”Over the administrations of seven American presidents, Fauci helped steer the nation through HIV/AIDS, the post-9/11 anthrax panic, influenza pandemics, Ebola, Zika and SARS. By the time COVID-19 emerged as a once-in-a-lifetime public health threat, Fauci was as seasoned a political player as he was a scientist.And yet nothing, really, could have prepared him for the bizarre challenges of the Trump era.Unraveling the mysteries of the constantly mutating novel coronavirus was difficult enough. Doing so alongside the partisan clowns of the Trump administration, including the president himself, was almost farcical at times. But, Fauci writes, “I had to tell the truth to the American people.”He writes that it was painful to publicly contradict the president, who — thanks to prodding from the likes of Fox News’ Laura Ingraham and White House official Peter Navarro (neither of whom had any medical expertise — embraced the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID. Early in the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration gave the drug emergency approval to treat the disease, only to revoke it when it proved ineffective and was found to cause heart problems and even death.Although Fauci recounts many insulting and profanity-laced conversations with Trump, he is so measured and respectful in his assessment of the former president that it’s almost comical.“President Trump’s tendency to announce that he loved me and then scream at me on the phone,” he writes, “well, let’s just say I found this to be out of the ordinary.”He could have unleashed well-deserved fury on the former president and his lackluster response to a disease that ended up killing more than a million Americans. Instead, he writes, so many deaths “should never have happened and likely would not have happened had the right tone been set by the highest levels of government for the promotion of proper public health principles and practices right from the start of the outbreak.”In contrast, Trump’s vilification of Fauci has made him a predictable target of vitriol and worse. He recounts the vicious conspiracy theories that led to violent threats against him and necessitated round-the-clock security: He was a Hillary Clinton mole planted in the White House to destroy Trump.He was out to abolish the 2nd Amendment. His wife is the sister of Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. He tortured puppies for science. He was responsible for the very creation of SARS-CoV-2.He was also baselessly accused of “crimes against humanity” and sexual assault. Republican congressional candidates vowed to put him in prison. Pro-Russia conspiracy peddlers said Moscow’s airstrikes in Ukraine were aimed at bioweapons labs where Fauci was developing a COVID-19 sequel.“Welcome to my dystopian nightmare,” he writes.The absurdity continues to this day, of course. This month, Fauci testified before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, whose MAGA Republican representatives seized the opportunity to beclown themselves as usual.“You’re not a doctor,” spat Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.Fauci — who has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science and 62 honorary doctorates and has written, cowritten or edited more than 1,400 scientific publications — didn’t respond.He didn’t have to. He’s been saving lives longer than she’s been alive."

philinquirer_2024_8,"Many people who are incarcerated or have been in the past are eligible to vote but don t realize it. And in a swing state such as ours, every vote matters.In Pennsylvania,tens of thousands of eligible votersdon’t realize they’re allowed to vote simply because they’re currently incarcerated, or they were at some point in the past.According tostate law, people who are incarcerated for a misdemeanor, who are in pretrial detention, or who are on parole or probation are all eligible to vote.When I was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2020 and incarcerated from February to April, I knew I could still vote. I wanted to continue my stellar record of voting, especially in an important 2020 election year. But almost all the people I was incarcerated with didn’t realize they could vote in that election, too.Still, knowing you can vote is only half the battle.In order to vote in the 2020 primary, I asked the correctional officers at the Centre County Correctional Facility in Bellefonte, Pa., how I could cast my ballot, and they informed me there was no way for me to cast a ballot.In order to vote for the primary election in June of that year, I was told to talk to the counselor, who was of little help. He told me I had to wait and hope for a volunteer organization to come in before the deadline and help me apply for an absentee ballot.When I waited and went to ask again how to vote, I was told there was no way for me to cast a ballot at that time. I became frustrated and concerned that I actually wouldn’t be able to vote in the primary.» READ MORE:Can this group of former offenders swing the Philly DA race?Act 77, passed in 2019, helped create a more efficientsystem of distributing absentee ballots, which should make it even easier for incarcerated people to vote. However, Pennsylvania county jails do not have a universal process for voter registration, voting by mail, or voter education, which discourages thousands of incarcerated people in the commonwealth from exercising their constitutional right to vote.More than half of the jails in the commonwealth don’t have a written policy regarding voting procedures,according to a reportdone by my organization,All Voting is Local, in conjunction with theCommittee of SeventyandCommon Cause. In 2020, 25,000 people were held in county jails across the state. Of those people, our report found that only 52 requested mail-in ballots for the 2020 general election that year.The current system is essentially disenfranchising tens of thousands of Pennsylvania residents. And in a swing state — whichDonald Trump won by less than 45,000 votes in 2016— every vote matters.Every vote matters.This is about more than voting, and it is much bigger than one election.Our criminal justice system hinges on the principle of rehabilitation. Being able to reenter society with full citizenship and the right to vote is essential to that rehabilitation process. Participation in our democracy is key to ensuring all people whose rights have been restored can remain engaged in their communities and are less likely to reenter the criminal justice system.Pennsylvania needs to do a much better job of helping people who are incarcerated, and those who have criminal records, participate in our democracy.Jail administrators need to build detailed policies and procedures that ensure every eligible voter can register to vote, cast a ballot, and have that ballot counted.My organization is working alongside partners in the state to remove barriers to the ballot box for Pennsylvanians who are incarcerated. In addition to advocating for statewide policy changes to jail voting policies, we’re also centering organizations led by people of color to lead in organizing efforts to educate currently and formerly incarcerated people about their voting rights. We do this by working with jail administrations to do direct voter registration, provide education around how to apply for a mail-in ballot, and nonpartisan information about which offices are being voted on and how to cast your mail-in ballots once received.It’s also important to provide training materials for prison staff and the families impacted by the criminal justice system so both sides can encourage incarcerated people to vote when they’re legally able to do so. Local organizations should continue to educate families on how their incarcerated loved ones can register to vote, apply for a mail-in ballot, and cast their votes both while serving their sentences and after they’ve returned to the community. Organizations should also educate these voters on the candidates running for public office, so they can make an informed decision.I was lucky: I was released from county jail in April 2020, so I was able to vote in the June primary and the November general election. But the experience of struggling to vote while incarcerated stayed with me.After seeing firsthand how little information and resources exist for eligible voters in the same position I was in, I know there’s a long way to go. I also know that our democracy works best when everyone participates. Together, we can ensure voters can make their voices heard and not be unfairly left out of the process.Nicholas Pressley is the Pennsylvania state director of All Voting is Local."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_283,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°A couple of hours before a young man shot an AR-15 rifle at former President Donald Trump, killing one bystander and wounding others, I had been finishing a column about gun violence as a public health threat. It was an eerie coincidence but not an unlikely one: More than 100 people die from gunshots on an average day in the United States.In June, the surgeon general declared gun violence a public health crisis. Data show it’s now the leading cause of death for American kids 17 and under. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2022, there were 48,000 deaths from firearms, about 40% of which are homicides. Many more people were disabled or maimed. And yet many Americans believe owning a gun makes them safer. In fact, self-defense is the number one reason people give for owning a gun.Like other public health crises, gun violence has been studied, and scientists have data pointing to ways the carnage can be reduced. But Congress has been slow to pass any laws that would meaningfully restrict gun violence. Although there are more gun safety laws at the state level, the Supreme Court and lower courts have rolled some of them back, sometimes pointing to data allegedly showing guns make people safer. Those data are being grossly misinterpreted.In the precedent-reversing 2022 New York State Rifle &Pistol Association v. Bruen decision, which struck down longstanding restriction on who could carry a handgun in New York, justices cited an unpublished survey that seemed to show guns are used well over a million times a year in self-defense. That survey, by Georgetown University researcher William English, was paid for by the gun lobby, according to reporting by the New York Times, who also picked apart his research methods. English responded in a WSJ op-ed, arguing that he’d not hidden his funding sources — they were declared in all his published work.But research funding is only part of the story. English’s research raised a different question: Are his estimates credible? What do they tell us about the overall impact of guns on public health? How do they line up with what other researchers have found?Stanford University law professor John Donohue said in the 35 years he’s been doing gun research, he’s never seen any work by English that met “what I consider to be the relatively low standards it takes to get something published.”Part of the reason English found so many defensive uses of guns is that he allowed survey respondents to define “self-defense” for themselves. When I asked him about the 1.67 million number, he said in only 300,000 of those cases was a shot likely fired. He estimated that in 852,000 times the gun was only brandished, and in about 518,000 times neither happens — e.g. someone may have said they had a gun to intimidate the other party.But David Hemenway, a professor of public health at Harvard, says it can be a problem to define self-defense so broadly. Hemenway has also done surveys asking people about their defensive use of guns, and he says most are not defending themselves against a mugger or a rapist. They are more like the subject who told Hemenway he went and got his gun after arguing with a neighbor who threw a beer. Or the guy who said that the alarm at his business went off, so he went down to the site, saw people standing outside on the sidewalk, and shot the ground. Or two groups of young men who exchanged gunfire at a gas station at 3 a.m. Should any of these cases really be considered self-defense?To look more directly at how guns may be used by innocent people to defend themselves from criminals, he and other researchers have looked to a dataset from the National Crime Victimization Survey, put together each year by the Census Bureau and the Department of Justice. Recently that’s included more than 200,000 people. They’re asked whether they were victims of a crime or attempted crime and how they responded.The results, said Hemenway, show that in cases where a person was present during a crime attempt, only about 1% responded by using or brandishing a gun. Extrapolating to the population at large, the data suggest fewer than 100,000 incidents each year in which guns are used to defend against actual criminals.What’s often missed in surveys such as the one English conducted, said Stanford’s Donohue, are the cases where something went horribly wrong. He’s thinking of a man responding to a break-in and shooting his 16-year-old son by mistake, or a man who used a gun to pursue someone who robbed him at an ATM, in the process shooting a 9-year-old girl on her way to a Valentine’s Day party.Other researchers have tried to answer a different question — does having a gun with you make you safer? In 2017, 75% of gun owners told Pew Research they believed that it did.But Donohue said he was impressed by a 2022 study by colleague David Studdert, comparing gun-owning households and gun-free households in comparable neighborhoods and showing the gun-owning households were twice as likely to die by homicide. And in that 2017 Pew survey, gun owners were three times as likely to have ever been shot as non-gun owners.Back in 2009, Charles Branas, now a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, was at the University of Pennsylvania and gathered data on shootings in Philadelphia between 2003 and 2006. He compared the victims to a control group matched for age, sex and race who had not been shot. His results, published in the American Journal of Public Health, showed the shooting victims were four times as likely as non-victims to be carrying a gun at the time.I wrote about that study for the Philadelphia Inquirer, and quoted critics who pointed out that cause and effect are hard to tease out. The correlation might be explained by the gun carriers living in more dangerous situations than the unarmed group. Or it could be that gun owners felt braver, and avoided de-escalation because they felt protected by their firearm.Suicides by guns have spiked over the last decade, and make up the majority of gun-related deaths. Experts say many of these are impulsive acts by people who might have had a chance to recover from their suicidal thoughts if a gun wasn’t easily available.The cost of gun proliferation is clear in terms of homicides, suicides and accidents, but it’s harder to compute the other side of the balance — the benefits people derive from the ability to protect themselves. Gun researchers can’t conduct a randomized controlled trial, handing out guns to a subset of volunteers the way they would with a new medicine.Instead, the pro-gun side is assuming that in these allegedly defensive gun uses, someone would have been hurt or killed if not for their gun. It’s the kind of assumption that’s fooled patients and doctors into believing in unnecessary or unhelpful treatment or prevention strategies. In this case, the most careful, thoughtful studies show how those assumptions are wrongheaded.Neither Hemenway or Donohue have come across any studies that show more firearms make for a safer or healthier society — and no evidence that the proliferation of semiautomatic rifles like AR-15s make people safer.Yet gun enthusiasts keep buying them. Nancy Lanza believed she needed an assault rifle to protect herself in the upscale neighborhood of Sandy Hook, Connecticut. She was later gunned down by her own troubled son before he went to an elementary school and killed 26 people.This week, investigators are desperately searching for missed signs that would have identified the shooter in Butler, Pennsylvania, before his assassination attempt, but so far they’ve found nothing in the way of motives. Except of course that he appeared to be a loner, possibly troubled, and thanks to his parents’ gun collection, with easy access to a very dangerous weapon."
minnpost_2024_37,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.A lot of people have invested a lot of time trying to explain how Donald Trump, a man who has fomented an insurrection, been impeached twice, been convicted of and bragged about sexual assault and faces 91 felony charges, can be the frontrunner in the race for the presidency.His appeal is best explained by recognition of the main narratives he offers to the American people.Robert Reich has summarized four “essential American stories.” Two feature the value of hope; two appeal to fear. Trump and many who support him tell various versions of the two stories that appeal to fear.The first of these stories is called “Rot at the Top.” Its plot is that those in charge of the institution in question — in this case, the government — are corrupt and seek to serve their own interests at the expense of those over whom they have power.This is one of the earliest American stories. It has shaped our interpretations of historical events (most of the Declaration of Independence lists the evils of King George III, for example, and the McCarthyism of the 1950s was premised on the myth that communists had infiltrated the highest levels of government and provided the framework for popular works of fiction (Mr. Potter in “It’s a Wonderful Life” epitomizes the corrupt corporate leader, and John Dutton in “Yellowstone” is the criminal patriarch of a powerful, domineering family . Ronald Reagan rejuvenated the “rot at the top” narrative when he pronounced that “government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem,” and it continues to motivate conservative and liberal populist programs.Trump’sversionof this story is that our main enemies are domestic and that we must “root out the Communists, Marxists, fascists, and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country.” To make clear that Biden is the rot at the top of this infestation, Trumppronouncesthat he is “the most corrupt president in the history of our country,” that he leads a “band of … thugs, misfits and Marxists,” and that he is engaged in an effort “to destroy American democracy.” Biden has,saysTrump, “weaponized law enforcement to interfere in our elections.” And he is “incompetent” and “cognitively impaired.”The second story Trump and his supporters emphasize is “Mob at the Gates.” It features the United States as the place of industry and opportunity, a virtuous land blessed by God, but also, because of those characteristics, besieged by forces that envy it or want to conquer it. Its citizens, consequently, must be vigilant against those who want to enter their land and destroy the values and institutions that make it great.As with the first story, “Mob at the Gates” recurs throughout our history, kept alive by its ability to justify political policies and to animate fictitious tales. We have thus endured various “red scares” and “domino theories,” each of them premised on the belief that if we do not stop the mob now, they will soon assault our borders. The popularity of zombie films and television series like “The Walking Dead” is significant because they reproduce this story’s plot and prepare us to see it in current events.Almost any anti-immigration rhetoric relies on the mob at the gates theme, and that is evident in current far-right discourse. The degree to which the situation at our southern border constitutes a problem, not to mention a crisis, depends on the story we tell about it. We could frame this as a story about dispossessed people seeking a better life for their families. We could frame it as asylum-seekers in flight from warlords who might torture or kill them. We could frame it as an administrative problem marked by too few border agents and an underfunded asylum system. Or we could say, as many do, that it is aninvasion.To invoke this meaning Trump has invented a new category of crime, which he labels “migrant crime.” Despite the fact that immigrants, whether documented or undocumented, commit fewer crimes on average than people born in the United States (and it’s not close: immigrants are60% less likelythan non-immigrants to be imprisoned , Trump hasclaimedthat “there’s crime, there’s violent crime, there’s migrant crime … And it’s going to be worse than any other form of crime.” Immigrants are, hestates, “poisoning the blood of our country.” And he declares explicitly that this is aninvasion: “I will stop the killing, I will stop the bloodshed, I will end the agony of our people, the plunder of our cities, the sacking of our towns, the violation of our citizens and the conquest of our country. They’re conquering our country.”Humans see themselves primarily as rational beings. We view the world as a set of problems we must confront, and we presume that if we apply reason and logic to those problems, we will be able to make the best decisions about how to solve them.But when we think of ourselves this way, we downplay an important characteristic: we are storytellers, and we often do not follow the rules of deduction to determine what choices we should make. We rely instead on narratives that teach particular morals and encourage us to act in particular ways.Trump has linked two essential American stories in a way that his followers find comfortable and familiar. They identify with the stories because they explain their sense of frustration, alienation and hopelessness, and because they offer a simple solution: support Trump because he will fix the rot at the top and stop the mob at the gates.The stories are myths. They are simplifications of complex problems. They direct attention away from systemic injustices and moneyed interests, and toward the least powerful among us. They often do not fit the facts (the plunder of our cities? the sacking of our towns? , but they work to keep Trump popular. We should be wary of the stories he tells. Because while these popular narratives are powerful tools of persuasion, they are based in suspicion, fear and paranoia, and they entice us to see the worst in others.Jeffery L.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_33,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°When I saw the Michael Shear story in The New York Times on Thursday, recounting how President Joe Biden had stumbled talking to Black radio hosts days after his debate debacle, telling one he was proud to have been “the first Black woman to serve with a Black president,” I knew it spelled trouble.First of all, if any white man could claim to be “the first Black woman” in the Oval, it was Bill Clinton. Black fans called him “the first Black president,” and feminist fans called him “the first woman president.”Second of all, we were entering a new post-debate examination period with Biden, where his every word would be scrutinized. He was always a fast and voluminous talker, and as he has gotten older, the words and ideas sometimes tumble out in the wrong order. Also, he’s more slurry now, so words get smushed together, and words and thoughts collide; words get dropped, caesuras skipped, and sentences sometimes trail off into the ether.The Times’ chief White House correspondent, Peter Baker, told me he has started using translation headsets on overseas trips, even when he is 20 feet away from the president, because they offer a magnified volume when Biden starts to mumble.The White House press corps, stung by critiques that they did not pull back the curtain enough on the president’s diminished powers, are now on the alert, ready to tear down the Pollyanna scrim erected by Biden’s family and aides.The White House and the Biden campaign are so smotheringly protective that, as news outlets reported, Biden aides helped draft the questions that local radio hosts asked the president after his calamitous debate.In going through Biden’s verbal mistakes in his Times story, Shear used the phrase, “He appeared to mean …”And that is going to be a big issue moving forward. A panicky White House is going to be persnickety, acting as though journalists are unfairly picking on the president about every gaffe, berating them when they don’t properly interpret the president’s elisions and jumbles. Joe Scarborough, a supporter and confidant of the president, took to the social platform X to mock the “breathless NYT syntax blogs.”But how the president puts words together — or doesn’t — happens to be a life and death matter. We’re now dwelling in a murky area of what the presidentintendedto say, or what he said that was incomprehensible, and whether we should take the White House interpretation.Journalists are going to be appropriately resistant to making corrections based on what the White House asserts Biden said, or its version of what Bidenintendedto say. It’s not our job to play Mad Libs with the president.Ronald Reagan’s press aides would issue a lot of clarifications after news conferences, but those were not because it was hard to hear what he was saying. Even in his 70s, he spoke in a clear baritone. His clarifications were more to correct remarks he made, as when he said trees cause more pollution than automobiles do.Biden’s word salad and sudden drops in volume to pianissimo are relevant for reporters to cover because they’re a microcosm of the questions at the heart of the 2024 Democratic campaign: Is the president’s mental state strong enough to beat Donald Trump and can he serve for four more years? The desperate Biden team is ready to go to war over every syllable.In my Saturday column, I quoted Biden’s line to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, about how he would feel if Trump were sworn in as president because he refused to step aside: “I’ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the goodest job as I know I can do, that’s what this is about.”Now, “goodest” isn’t a word. But my researcher, Andrew Trunsky, and I listened to the video, our ears up against the computer, 10 times, and that’s what it sounded like. We also checked the ABC News transcript and that’s the word they used. Times news reporters and reporters for other news outlets took their cue from the ABC transcript.The confusion was so universal that on Axios on Saturday, there were two different versions: Mike Allen’s newsletter used “goodest” and another story used “I did as good a job as I know I can do.”After my column posted Saturday morning, T.J. Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesperson, emailed me to “flag” that ABC News had updated its transcript to read: “I’ll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do, that’s what this is about.”Ducklo asked if I could “tweak” the column and change the word “goodest” to make my piece “consistent with the corrected transcript,” even though the revised version was also gobbledygook.When I said we would tell our editor what he thought, Ducklo wrote back: “Yeah again, it’s not what I think. It’s what ABC News, who conducted the interview, thinks. I think it would be quite unusual if the Times asserted the president said something that the news organization who conducted the interview says he didn’t say …”Andrew and I both emailed Ducklo, asking whether ABC had changed the transcript on its own or if the Biden team had asked them to change it.“ABC News, like any news organization, makes their own independent editorial decisions,” Ducklo replied to us. “surely you are not suggesting otherwise.” He emailed again to add: “Had another convo on this. ABC News received the tape and confirmed the error to us. Then made the correction.”I was more confused than ever. What tape? From whom?? Why the runaround??? Given the White House’s egregious cover-up about Biden’s sag from aging, the spokesman’s coyness seemed de trop. By Saturday night, Shear and Michael Grynbaum had a Times story clearing up things. Indeed, the White House had asked ABC News to check whether the president said “goodest” or “good as,” after White House stenographers, who had recorded the president on ABC News, noticed the discrepancy between their recording and the network’s transcript.The Times attached notes on my column and all the news stories that had used “goodest,” explaining the befuddlement.Whatever the president meant, his answer to that question went over like a lead balloon. No one cares if he feels good about himself in a losing cause.It might seem like much ado about goodest. But it’s a harbinger of tense times between a White House in bunker mode and a press corps in ferret mode.Maybe the White House should think about closed captioning.© 2024 The New York Times Company"

One can even make a career of it, as have a number of former spies, authors and Ph.Ds. Believe it or not, there is even a Society for Intelligence History (www.historyintelligence.org ; I am a member.This may be nothing new to watchers of the popular Revolutionary War series “TURN!” (AMC, 2014 , about our nation’s first spooks and covert action operators, based on historian Alexander Rose’s book “Washington’s Spies” (2007 , or those who’ve seen Amazon ads for historian Rose Mary Sheldon’s work on espionage in the “Bible and the Roman Empire.”What about cloak-and-dagger lore in Hawaii, though? Frankly, from the WWII era alone, there’s enough to fill an Aston Martin DB5.For instance, you may be surprised to learn that in 1939, Hilo-born UH professor Shigeo Yoshida was an FBI contact as part of the counterespionage efforts of Robert Shivers, the first Honolulu Field Office special agent in charge. When you next visit Oahu, you can sip genmaicha at the teahouse in Alewa Heights where famous undercover Japanese naval intelligence officer Takeo Yoshikawa sat for hours observing Pearl Harbor prior to the Dec. 7, 1941, attack to fine tune Imperial Japan’s pilots’ bombing runs.You can stroll down Kama Lane and see the childhood home of spy-catcher and McKinley High School graduate Douglas Wada, the first Japanese American to serve in U.S. naval intelligence. Over on Nuuanu Avenue, you can peek into the Japanese consulate where Hirohito’s spies worked under diplomatic cover. (Did you know that Tokyo even relied on a North Shore home-owning Nazi spy to launder money and send signals, or that the Honolulu Police Department had an espionage bureau in those days? Crazy, right?The latest retelling of these stories, the New York Times Best Seller “Ghosts of Honolulu” (November 2023, Harper’s Select , was written by Mark Harmon, better known as “Gibbs” on the television show “NCIS,” and Leon Carroll, Jr., a real former NCIS special agent who consulted for the show. The foreign and domestic locations where the book’s story unfolds, and two of the federal entities featured in the work, played a role in my 23-year Pacific-focused intelligence career, so how’s about a quick review?“Ghosts” is a short, easy, entertaining read, a perfect way to pass the time while swinging in your backyard hammock, during a short getaway, or out on the beach. A good layman’s level introduction to WWII-era intelligence activity in the U.S, it would make a good gift for war, history, and spy buffs. Residents of Hawaii will appreciate the work’s frequent references to familiars — papio fishing, prominence of baseball and kendo, Diamond Head, Iolani Palace, Shinto shrines, etc.Spycraft permeates the story (elicitation, aliases, cover, signaling, covert finance , as does human visual surveillance of ship movements from fixed observation posts — a Japanese consular officer’s home overlooking Lahaina roads on Maui and an observant Pearl City shoreline shave ice vendor are two examples.The decryption of intercepted Japanese military and diplomatic traffic also plays a prominent role as we learn about Station HYPO at Pearl Harbor and the work of U.S. cryptanalysts and cryptographers. Included are accounts of Office of Naval Intelligence and FBI taps on the Japanese consulate’s phones and compromise of its diplomatic cable system. The consulate’s emergency document destruction procedures will resonate with readers who recall the news of smoke plumes over more recently shuttered spy-ridden consulates — Russia (2017, San Francisco and China (2020, Houston .The work frequently cites Military Intelligence Service Veterans Club of Hawaii interviews, but also draws from congressional hearings, biographies, and declassified FBI and military holdings, as well as decrypted Japanese communications.The narrative is divided into small, easy-to-digest blocks.

minnpost_2024_21,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Housing can be a hard topic. In most families, rent or mortgage payments are the single largest expense. It’s also deeply emotional because our homes are the center of our lives.Housing insecurity is a widespread problem affecting millions of people across the country. Rising housing costs, stagnant wages and a shortage of affordable homes have created a crisis impacting families and individuals from all walks of life. According to recent data compiled by Harvard University, nearly one-third of U.S. households are cost burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Overcrowding, eviction, and homelessness are stark realities for many.To address the housing crisis, we need to focus on several critical areas. First, there is an urgent need for more affordable housing options. This includes expanding low-income housing, subsidizing rent and creating pathways to homeownership for those with limited means. It also means building more homes of all kinds because housing supply still hasn’t caught up to demand since the 2008 housing crash. Second, housing alone is not enough. Support services such as mental health care, job training and substance abuse programs are essential for helping individuals and families achieve stable housing. Third, we need stronger legal protections for renters and homeowners to prevent unjust evictions and foreclosures, allowing people to stay in their homes during difficult times.We must embrace evidence-based best practices for each segment of the housing continuum. The gold standard for helping folks out of homelessness is the “Housing First” approach. It prioritizes permanent housing for previously homeless individuals without preconditions, like sobriety, ensuring they have a stable base from which to rebuild their lives. It also provides critical access to services when people need them most.Preventing housing insecurity in the first place is even better. This includes Minnesota state programs like Homework Starts with Home and other rental assistance programs. Inclusionary zoning is another good option that mandates a percentage of new housing developments be affordable for low- and moderate-income families. Finally, community land trusts are a great option for long-term sustainable development. Creating community owned land ensures long-term affordability and prevents displacement, which helps to preserve local character and agency.While I no longer live in St. Anthony Park, my life still largely revolves around the neighborhood. It’s where I work and where my parents, grandparents and many dear friends still live. As a community, we’ve had a challenging set of conversations related to housing. The latest round was sparked by Luther Seminary’s former plan to use the vacant Stub Hall as an emergency shelter. However, community interest and concerns about development on Luther’s campus and throughout the neighborhood are not new.Years ago, I wrote a paper on multigenerational family housing. I chose the topic in part because I grew up in close proximity to my grandparents, and I was curious if there were any concrete benefits, outside of those I had anecdotally experienced. I found there are many positives for both children and elders. The most popular multigenerational housing options in the United States are “in-law suites” and auxiliary dwelling units. Separated spaces help decrease conflict in multigenerational households. I’ve been thrilled to see the zoning laws in both Minneapolis and St. Paul opened up to ADUs over the last eight years. I believe this has been a major reason we were one of the first areas of the country to get inflation under control by mitigating some of the spike in housing costs.I now live in Hamline-Midway with my partner and our two cats. Our house is next to a housing first building. We quite literally have supportive housing next to our backyard. I won’t sugar coat it. Dealing with litter and other trash in and around our property is a regular issue. I have installed security cameras, built a fence and called the building’s security team on more than one occasion. It’s still all worth it. We’ve gotten to know our neighbors and we work to share information and support one another. We have a strong community here in Hamline-Midway and I look forward to seeing how it flourishes in the years to come.St. Anthony Park is not Hamline-Midway. SAP has different geography, culture and opportunities. But if we want St. Anthony Park to be vibrant in the future, we also need to evolve. “Gentle density” — the addition of units across a wide area — works well with the character of SAP. However, there are certainly areas where larger buildings could also fit, such as along major arteries like Highway 280 and Larpenteur Avenue. Putting four-story residential and “mixed-use” buildings on these corridors will boost the size of the tax base, provide better funding for SAP Elementary and Murray Middle School, and create space for more families of many kinds to live in “the Park.”We don’t need to fear density. More people is good for local businesses. There is scant evidence that more units will reduce home values. In fact, it generally seems to modestly increase home values in a desirable area near an urban core.It’s time to take real action to ensure everyone has access to a safe, stable and affordable place to live. Our homes are the foundation of our lives, and housing should be a right, not a privilege. I love St. Anthony Park. I want to see it thrive as a community in the decades and centuries to come. I believe the best way to make that happen is to invest in our neighborhood by building more homes, growing more food, and producing more energy while using less. People of all ages and incomes should be able to make St. Anthony Park home.Liam Magistad lives in St. Paul."

In some states more than half of them have quit.“I have a little PTSD, as do my coworkers,” said Nick Lima, who heads up elections in Cranston, R.I., and who — with some reservations — decided to keep the job he loves.“During election season, you know, you really feel the pressure, you feel your heartbeat increasing a bit.”Today everyone who works in the campaign infrastructure faces unending scrutiny. If you thought it was easier in a red state, you are mistaken.“Just the act of standing behind you watching you work just puts you on edge,” said McGrane.“Now you start second-guessing yourself, even if you know you’re doing it right.“The poll workers don’t know about cyber security on voting equipment, but your poll watcher is getting asked these questions. “Deep fakes are one level of concern, but Edward Perez, who had been director of civic integrity at Twitter and is now a board member at the OSET Institute (whose mission is to re-build public confidence in our voting system , worries about the misuse of AI to disrupt the backroom of every American precinct.“One of the most important things to understand about election administration is, it’s very, very process oriented. And there’s a tremendous number of layers,” he said. “Are we talking about voter registration? About the security of election administration? All of this technology is never deployed just in a vacuum.”The fact that the election system is a conglomeration of different rules and regulations from 50 different states with 50 different voting rules adds to the complexity.The challenge is serious as election officials scramble in this election-denying climate to staff 132,000 polling places with 775,000 volunteers.The clock is ticking to deploy the necessary defenses against threats that aren’t fully understood."

The city of Milwaukee will host the 2024 Republican Convention at Fiserv Forum which will run from July 15 through July 18. (Tannen Maury/AFP/Getty Images/TNS Republicans have adopted a platform, in advance of the party convention next week in Milwaukee, that might manage to be a significant disappointment to abortion supporters and opponents alike.The approved platform mentions the procedure only once. It tacitly refers to the landmark fall of the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized the procedure, stating, “after 51 years, because of us, due process power has been given to the States and to a vote of the People.” But it does not call for a federal ban on abortion or the passage of a Right to Life Amendment, as the party has stood for in years past.Instead, it comes down squarely on the side of federalism, much like the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe two years ago, launching battles over the issue state by state.The platform’s sole mention of abortion is used to affirm the party’s opposition to late term abortion — low-hanging fruit (for anyone who doesn’t live in Virginia or New York .While the departure from past platforms is striking, it’s not unexpected.And frankly, it’s probably the right call.Abortion became an easy attack line against vulnerable Republicans during the 2022 midterms, especially as many candidates found themselves unable to articulate a clear pro-life message in the wake of their party’s massive policy win.Donald Trump was quick to throw the pro-life community under the bus after his party’s substantial political losses, and has since moderated his position to make clear his support for access to birth control and in-vitro fertilization procedures as well.Worth noting: The party platform also affirms both.Republicans are probably a little savvier now and looking to downplay their national objectives on abortion in an effort to blunt Democratic assaults leading up to November.They are also taking direction from a party leader who helped bring the pro-life movement its biggest victory but would have no qualms about leaving them in the dust if it ensured his return to power.To the extent that the details of party platforms even matter — they don’t — minimizing the anti-abortion message is the politically shrewd thing to do this cycle. In state after state, Democrats have used the issue to boost voter turnout and even enact pro-choice policies by voter referendum.But it’s going to leave a lot of ardent pro-lifers dissatisfied and wondering if, with Trump at its helm, the GOP’s pro-life message will be permanently diluted.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."

I’m obsessed with these polls. Read them every morning, noon, and night. Get angry when these polls are bad for my favorite candidate(s . Get excited when they show more favorable results. I should know much better to take them seriously this early in the presidential campaign.For you see, political polls have been following me around since I was a graduate student in educational psychology and research. I have been analyzing them ever since. Analyzed them for my political blog. Analyzed them for political candidates. Have discussed them with national authorities on polling.I have learned what political polls are not. They are rarely accurate predictors of actual elections. Pollsters cannot predict with certainty who is or is not going to vote in an election. Polling corporations have developed sophisticated models of identifying likely voters for a particular election. These models can be problematic.Nearly all of the currently reported polls are based upon a pool of registered voters. A percentage of these voters will not vote in the presidential election. The non-voters are driving Trump’s lead in the polls. Don’t believe me, then believe Nate Cohn, eminent political guru for the NY Times. He recently noted in a NY Times column: (Trump’s lead in the polls is “built on gains among voters who aren’t paying close attention to politics, who don’t follow traditional news and who don’t regularly vote.” We thus don’t know if Trump is leading with likely voters.Furthermore, Professor Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia has noted: “For ourgeneral election outlook, we are not taking current polling much into account right now.Biden’s national polling right now is probably worse than what our ratings reflect.” Listen to the good and wise Professor.Pundits tell us that political polls are a picture in time of potential voter behavior. NOT TRUE. They are a fuzzy picture (full of possible errors . A measurement of error (MOE is inherent in any polling data. This sampling error is usually between 1.5 and 3 points for all sampled candidates. A poll might, for example, show Trump with 47% of the vote and Biden with 45%, and has an MOE of 2. This statistic must be interpreted (which rarely is done by pundits as Trump having between 49 and 45 percent of the vote and Biden having between 47 and 43 percent. Biden may then be in the lead or badly trailing Trump.Polls may also contain internal errors that are beyond the MOE. Simply put, a poll should be a stratified sample of the voting population. Some polls may have oversampled Democratic voters and others Republican voters. You don’t know.Don’t fret if your favorite candidate is not winning now. Don’t listen to the chit-chat on your favorite news outlet. Don’t become like me, obsessed with questionable poll data.*** ."

The last month of summer where Minnesotans are squeezing in final cabin stays while anxiously preparing for the school year to begin. It’s one last trip down the giant slide at the State Fair and wrapping up that summer reading list.It’s appropriate, then, that August is also the time we celebrate Clean Power Week and the role clean energy plays in ensuring a more sustainable, affordable future.Because, for Minnesota, clean energy is more than a wind turbine you see along the highway. In our state, renewable energy powers more than 8,300 jobs and invests more than $40.8 million into agriculture families through land lease payments. Today, renewable energy accounts for 28.9% of Minnesota’s electricity generation, and I’m grateful for the goals state leadership has set to achieve 100% carbon-free energy by 2040. Clean Grid Alliance is hard at work with utilities, colleague organizations, and others to implement the law.Why is this such a big deal? Why does it even matter? Investing in clean energy means investing in our own communities and producing home grown energy to supply the basic utilities we require to power our lives and businesses. Clean energy also means deeper investments in the agriculture community. Hosting wind, solar, or storage projects on farmland means income that isn’t vulnerable to commodity prices or ever-changing weather conditions.And it’s an economic boon. In 2022, clean power projects invested more than $37 million in local Minnesota communities through property, state and local taxes. This doesn’t include the community benefit packages developers offer communities offering upgrades for infrastructure, resources for first responders, and crucial school system investments.What’s more, new industries — especially technology — are looking for regions with high amounts of renewable energy generation to power developments like data centers and other economic opportunities. To attract new business and create a competitive business environment, Minnesota must continue developing renewable generation.This year, we made tremendous strides when the Minnesota Legislature led the passage of the Minnesota Infrastructure Permitting Act, a bill that will reduce permitting times for energy transmission projects by over a year. Clean Grid Alliance joined stakeholder groups like the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and LiUNA in identifying core reforms that led to meaningful and tangible action. The act of bringing together 32 diverse voices and walking out with a single agreement is a testament to the importance of clean energy to our state and the power of partnerships.There’s more work to be done. We must prioritize our transmission infrastructure to accommodate the new generation coming online. We cannot make our 2040 goal if the grid is not ready to accept new projects. I applaud the leadership of our utilities and public utilities commissioners for planning, supporting and constructing the needed transmission.I am proud to be a Minnesotan, and I’m proud of the way we’re helping lead the nation into a clean energy future. It’s American Clean Power Week, so join me in celebrating our state’s accomplishments in developing the infrastructure needed for and committing to the future of clean power and Minnesotan innovation.Beth Soholt is the executive director of Clean Grid Alliance and has worked in the electric industry for more than 20 years."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_72,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°We have a child care crisis in the United States. And as a child care education provider, I know how to fix it: Put families first.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that each month, tens of thousands of Americans miss work due to a lack of child care, resulting in $122 billion annually in lost productivity, earnings and revenue.Meanwhile, early childhood education and child care workers are among the lowest-paid workers in the country.I’m also a veteran of the U.S. Armed Services. I grew up with a military dad and a mom who was an early childhood educator on military bases. I knew I wanted to serve my country like my father and be an educator like my mother.After 9/11, I served for four years and was then honorably discharged to care for my newborn son. I later enrolled in college for early childhood education. But when I graduated in 2011, I found that the wages were unlivable: The best offer I got was $12.95 an hour to work in an underfunded state-federal program.That was far less than we needed, so I started my own home child care business for kids who lived on the base where my husband served. Entrepreneurial, patriotic, service-oriented and well-educated — I have all the elements to live the American dream. Yet child care remains an undervalued, low-wage industry wherever you go.Recently, we got a glimpse of what a better system could look like. As part of the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan during the pandemic, a “Child Care Stabilization Fund” allowed small, in-home, family child care facilities like mine to temporarily affiliate with the federal Head Start program and receive some of those funds. The Stabilization Fund was a game-changer.It provided stability and increased wages for over 225,000 child care providers while maintaining care for 10 million at-risk children.This not only kept child care centers open but also created more slots for children, enabling more parents to return to work.For me, it meant I could continue catering to the unique needs of military children and collaborating with school districts to provide one-on-one, smaller settings for children in need.The Republican House majority let that fund expire last fall. And other federal support will expire this September unless Congress renews it.Let’s be clear: Every family should have access to early childhood care and education. Without it, children, their parents and our entire economy suffer — especially women, low-income communities and communities of color.We need to value all children, families and early learning providers equally — not only as an issue of equality but also because this strengthens our families, communities, workforces and nation.The Center for Community Change, where I volunteer, offers a vision to address the child care crisis that I think we can all agree on. It’s rooted in the beliefs that every family deserves everything they need to provide the best care for their kids, that child care workers should be treated with dignity and earn a living wage and that families should have real choices.Just imagine how much stronger and more secure our families and workforce would be if we prioritized these values in our federal investments.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
minnpost_2024_99,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As Minnesota’s sustainable farming and environmental community grieves the passing of a giant in the movement, the critical need for public investment in an agricultural system that builds resilient farms, landscapes and communities is clearer than ever.When Don Wyse, Ph.D. and co-director/founder of the nationally-known Forever Green Initiative at the University of Minnesota, passed away earlier this month, we didn’t just lose an innovative plant breeder; we lost someone who was using science to serve farmers, natural resources, rural communities and the greater good. Wyse was the epitome of the land-grant mission in action: public science serving the public good.He left behind a 50-year legacy of research that is benefiting people and the land. For example, through Forever Green, Wyse drove the development of “continuous living cover” crops that build soil and habitat, protect our water, sequester carbon and generate economic activity 365 days a year. In all, 16 crops — from Kernza to camelina — are under development through the Forever Green Initiative.But Wyse understood there’s a reason our system is dominated by a duo-culture of corn and soybeans: our agronomic, marketing, transportation and processing systems, along with public policy, drive this narrow focus. Indeed, it was public investment via the land-grant system that helped make such crops so dominant. Now we need public investment to create the next generation of crops. Forever Green isn’t just a “crops incubator” — it’s also working to drive a new food system that delivers multiple benefits to society.Wyse’s greatest legacy is his ability to harness the resources of the U of M — our land-grant university — to address critical public needs for agriculture that are beyond the ongoing efforts to further entrench the dominant industrial model. As we increasingly understand the limits and liabilities of the industrial ag system, science that responds to and is accountable to farmers, local communities and the general public is critical.Wyse recognized that if we are to bring about significant, but practical, changes to Midwestern agriculture, farmers must be key players in research and outreach partnerships. Carmen Fernholz, a southwestern Minnesota farmer and a pioneering Kernza producer, is a living example of how fruitful such partnerships can be.“This relationship with Don showed me that the fields on a farm were really no different than plots on the St. Paul campus,” the farmer said recently when reflecting on working with the scientist. “Most of these Forever Green crops have the potential to not only provide a more robust food system but also benefit the land, our water and the human resource, namely farmers.”Such teamwork has set in motion the creation of a network of regenerative research and outreach that extends beyond one individual scientist’s lifespan. But this legacy won’t survive and thrive by accident; we need to be intentional and double down on the work to create regenerative continuous living cover systems that protect our environment and are profitable for farmers. This won’t be easy. There is incredible inertia pushing for a bigger reliance on the monocultural cropping systems that dominate. But Wyse has shown us it can be done.The timing is critical: farming is being rocked by the extreme weather accompanying climate change, and the negative repercussions of undermining our soil’s health are showing up in the form of water pollution across our state. Conventional agriculture’s focus on producing a handful of crops and removing animals from the land and crowding them into giant confined facilities creates vulnerabilities that we can’t ignore.That’s why it’s so important that Forever Green continue, be built out and directed in a way that is accountable and beneficial, especially to the emerging, small and medium-sized farmers who are the bedrock of our land and rural communities.Minnesota’s sustainable agriculture and environmental community calls on public institutions to step up and expand support for agroecological systems to fulfill Don Wyse’s vision of building resiliency — on the land, on our farms, and on Main Street.Sophia Murphy is with the Institute for Agriculture & Trade Policy; Scott Elkins is with the Land Stewardship Project and Steve Morse is with the Minnesota Environmental Partnership.Jan Joannides of Renewing the Countryside, Lucinda Winter of the Sustainable Farming Association and Theresa Keaveny of Climate Land Leaders also contributed to this article."

It’s quite nice.Last year, our CEO had a tough choice: close LEO or invest. He chose the latter, and we’ve survived another day because of that decision. If we continue to survive, it involves you, the local public.While we’d love to have the benefit of an endowment (taking all benefactor offers and nonprofit status, we don’t have either of those but what we do have is the chance for each of you to take a small step in keeping your hometown paper going. Visit ourSupport Local Journalism”tab. That will take you to a page allowing you to make a monthly donation to your LEO Weekly. Three options: $5, $10, or $25 a month each are available for you to support LEO.Where does your money go? Directly to the operations of the paper. That includes staff, who all work well under comparable salaries, supplies, printing, web fees, the future ability to hire new staff and grow the paper you love. Bottom line: the money keeps us alive and has the potential to help LEO thrive.What your money doesn’t buy is our independence or our voices. Those remain true to the LEO brand and mission. But if you’re reading LEO, most likely you are interested in our perspective, even if it doesn’t necessarily jibe with your own.The hard fact is, the newsroom of yesteryear is gone. We’ve managed to be nimble, and do more with less but there comes a breaking point, and we’ve teetered on the edge of it too many times.We don’t have large teams, copy editors, staff photographers, and a team of 40 or more writers. Your LEO is (aside from the freelancers making almost no money four editorial staff, 2 admin/sales staff and one intern strong. That’s it. That’s who makes LEO each week and we’ve only had that many staff since April 1. Before we were three editorial staff in February and March, and before that, one. LEO has been through it.The LEO I dream of has at least two more editorial staff members for a total of six. Not a big ask but one that requires about $100,000 to properly hire and equip. That would give us a photographer on staff and another staff writer to help cover the amazing events in this city… especially the music scene which constantly amazes me, and is an area we just cannot cover enough.Of course, a straight donation isn’t the only way to support LEO but it is the most direct. We have plenty of events, including the upcoming Margaritas in the ‘Ville which happens Thursday, Aug. 1.Whichever method you choose to support our work either by visiting our “Support Local Journalism” page or by attending one of the events, we are thankful for you allowing us to continue serving the local community in a way that only LEO can.Erica Rucker is LEO Weekly’s editor-in-chief.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_153,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°There is no artificial intelligence without the vast trove of human knowledge.Today’s generative AI applications were built on a foundation of such information, drawn from across the internet and from various databases totaling, according to at least one estimate, somewhere around 300 billion words.That’s a lot of intellectual property, much of it produced by generations of professional writers, honed and polished by editors and sent out into the world by publishers in newspapers, magazines, books and more.Hard to put an exact price on such a thing or even to measure the collective value of such an incredible library.It definitely should not be free.But that’s the assumption made by OpenAI when it claims that its use of all this data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require compensation to the original creators and owners of that knowledge and information.If you walked into a bookstore and stole not just some of the books, but all of the books, that would be a crime, right?That’s why newspapers, including this one, as well as authors and an array of digital publishers have filed lawsuits seeking to force OpenAI to pay for its exploitation of their work.Regular people aren’t allowed to make copies of a recent best-seller and resell it with a different cover, nor can a studio stream a competitor’s series just because it’s on the Internet and it’s possible to copy it.They might be able to license that material, if the owner allows it, and they can certainly buy copies, but even buying a copy doesn’t give the purchaser the right to reproduce and redistribute such works.There’s a fundamental issue of ownership in play here.For decades, newspapers have been independent entities. They have written the obituaries of local luminaries, chronicled crimes committed, and followed fights over public works. In most every U.S. city, they’ve accumulated a great storehouse of knowledge, day by day.The theft of that journalism to create new products clearly intended to supplant news publishers further undermines the economy for news at a time when fair and balanced reporting and a shared set of facts is more critical than ever before.Weakening news publishers also has a collateral effect on democracy as it not only siphons off publisher revenue, but it also damages publishers’ reputations by attributing bogus information to credible publications.AI “hallucinations” occur when an AI app provides false information in response to a user’s question.The rise of artificial intelligence may be inevitable but that does not mean that the originators of the content should not expect adequate compensation.OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, pay their engineers to write their code and certainly recognize the value of that code. In fact, a recent valuation for OpenAI was $90 billion.Surely all the knowledge and information required to train their apps — to develop the code, as it were — has value.That value must be recognized and these companies must be held accountable.—The Mercury News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_295,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°If you don’t think the interest on the federal debt is a problem, try this quick exercise. Grab your pay stub for June and see how much you paid in federal income tax, then realize that over 75% of that was effectively your contribution to interest on the debt last month. No roads, schools, military or hospitals — just interest. Houston, we have a problem.For the first time ever, the government spent $140 billion in a single month to service its gargantuan debt of nearly $35 trillion. By the end of this fiscal year, the Treasury will spend almost $1.2 trillion in interest alone. And the problem is getting worse.For June, not a single line item in the Treasury’s monthly statement was larger than the $140 billion interest expense. It was larger than either the Social Security Administration ($129 billion , Department of Health and Human Services ($90 billion , Department of Education ($87 billion or Department of Defense ($63 billion .Interest is now equal to more than three-quarters of all personal income taxes, and over 30% of all taxes and duties received by the Treasury in June. Not only is the nation drowning in debt, but now the interest payments are an anchor around its neck.Federal finance can seem a bit ephemeral, so let’s put this in terms of family finances. Imagine a family has racked up more credit-card debt than it earns in an entire year. Those cards had low introductory interest rates, so even as their debt ballooned, the monthly interest payments seemed manageable. But then, rates rose — and so did the finance charges.Because the family spends more than they earn each month (hence the massive credit card debt , any additional expenses only exacerbate their financial nightmare. Higher interest is just another expense that must be financed, which means their outstanding balances will now grow that much faster.Of course, higher balances mean higher finance charges, and the debt doom loop has begun. The family has no way out other than severe spending cuts in their budget or an ignominious bankruptcy.This is where our federal government is today. It has spent so much more than it has taken in that it has racked up a $35 trillion debt. It’s not only many times larger than annual federal tax revenue, but over 20% larger than the nation’s entire economy.One key difference, however, between the family budget and the federal budget is counterfeiting. For the family, this isn’t an option — unless they want to go to jail.Through the Federal Reserve, the government has been expanding the money supply and devaluing the dollar, including the nearly $35 trillion that make up the federal debt. This allows the government to repay that debt, and pay the interest, using depreciated currency. If you loaned the government $1 at the start of 2021 and got it back today, it’d only be worth about 80 cents.This is why the stratospheric rise in the interest on the debt should concern everyone. Not only is it displacing funding for things like roads and the military, but it will also mean much more inflation unless we take a chainsaw to federal spending, à la Argentinian President Javier Milei.That course correction had better come quick. The federal government is already running $2 trillion annual deficits, driving up interest on the debt exponentially. The time bomb of federal finance has already started ticking down.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_128,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The felony conviction of Donald Trump in a Manhattan courtroom Thursday was a momentous event, even if the charges — falsifying business records — are less weighty than others the former president is facing. The prospect of a convicted felon being elected president ought to give pause to voters who haven’t been persuaded to reject him despite his manifest unfitness.Trump was convicted of all 34 counts in the indictment accusing of him of falsifying business records related to payments to his former lawyer Michael Cohen. Prosecutors argued that the payments were reimbursements for money Cohen provided out of his own pocket to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter in 2006 with Trump that if made public could have affected the outcome of the 2016 election.Ordinarily, falsifying business records is a misdemeanor, but the prosecution contended that it rose to the level of a felony because it was done to conceal another crime such as a violation of federal campaign finance law. That layered argument provoked considerable criticism from actual lawyers and the armchair variety, but the jury seems to have grasped its complexity and concluded that Trump was guilty.The charges of which Trump has been convicted pale in comparison with the other charges he faces connected with his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and his retention of national defense documents after he left the White House. Lamentably, it seems unlikely that he will face trial on those allegations before the November election. To its discredit, the Supreme Court has contributed to the delay of a trial of Trump on federal charges connected to the 2020 election by dithering on Trump’s absurd claim of immunity for “official acts,” defined broadly to cover some of his election-related actions.Trump’s unfitness for another term as president does not depend on the outcome of any of these prosecutions. Even if he had been an exemplary chief executive — which he wasn’t — he should be disqualified for scheming to overturn the 2020 election, a disgraceful assault on democracy that culminated in the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Trump’s outrageous attempt to subvert the democratic process isn’t the only reason to oppose his return to the White House. He also should be rejected by voters because of his authoritarian tendencies, his propensity for falsehoods and his volatile temperament. The latter two character flaws were evident in his unhinged attacks on the judge in this case and his incredible claim that his prosecution by the state of New York was instigated by the Biden administration. (After the verdict was announced, Trump also asserted that the trial had been “rigged,” the same absurd accusation he has continued to make about the 2020 election he lost. It shouldn’t take a criminal conviction to convince conscientious voters of Trump’s epic unfitness. But those who support him must now reckon with the fact that their candidate of choice is a convicted felon.—Los Angeles Times Editorial Board/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
minnpost_2024_171,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.All Minnesotans deserve access to trusted, local and accessible health care. Minnesotans average visits to their local pharmacy 18 times a year, but may only see their doctor once a year. As pharmacists, our job is to consult and assist patients with various health concerns through medicinal practices, tests, screenings and advising on patient health. It’s why quality community pharmacy care is so critical.Supporting the health and wellness of our community members is the top priority, but without legislative action this session, many of the key services we provide could be lost, and patients and public health will pay the price of inaction.At the end of this year, the COVID-era Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP Act will expire, and with it will go numerous vaccination and testing services that Minnesotans have come to expect from their local pharmacy. Pharmacists played a significant role in not just vaccinating for COVID-19, but also stepped up with additional testing for influenza, strep, A1C and numerous other everyday ailments. The state needs to act to ensure pharmacists can continue to provide those important services to patients.In addition, the Legislature must act to secure stable Medicaid reimbursement for local pharmacies and ensure that patient services are covered by their health insurance. We will be unable to stop the tide of pharmacy closures that have plagued communities and underserved parts of our state.Since 2018, Minnesota has lost more than 34% of its independently-owned pharmacies, and almost 20% of franchise pharmacies — more than any other state in the country. These closures have left over two dozen Minnesota cities without a local pharmacy. Without increasing reimbursement rates for low-income Minnesotans utilizing our services, as well as ensuring pharmacies are paid at the same rate for services in comparison to other health care providers, more pharmacies will be forced to close their doors.What does this mean for Minnesotans? Next year, when your local pharmacy cannot continue to operate under exhaustive financial strain, you and your family may find it more difficult to find localized, accessible health care. Minnesotans are falling victim to “pharmacy deserts” — underserved areas in the state in which, due to pharmacy closings, patients are forced to travel more than 30 minutes away for basic healthcare needs. Pharmacy deserts exacerbate inequitable health outcomes for low-income, rural and BIPOC communities.In 2020, Minnesota pharmacies were at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, providing fast and effective testing and life-saving vaccinations to patients across the state. We played an essential role in stopping the spread and advocating for preventative measures, all while maintaining our patients’ health in our local community. At a time when office jobs, schools and stores were shut down, pharmacies worked tirelessly to provide our communities with top quality care. Now is the time to demand the Legislature act to protect accessible pharmacy patient care for Minnesotans. It will save lives.John Hoeschen is a pharmacist and the owner of St. Paul Corner Drug."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_201,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Since President Joe Biden ducked out of the presidential race last month, Vice President Kamala Harris has made steady gains against Donald Trump in most polls.If she wants that lead to endure past a honeymoon phase, she’ll need to articulate an agenda that appeals to persuadable but as-yet-undecided voters. The positions that will work most effectively just happen to be exactly those the country needs.No doubt, Harris has reason to hesitate before adopting any such approach. As ever, Trump is his own worst enemy. The vice president might be tempted to let his divisive rhetoric, reflexive dishonesty, personal grievance and flamboyant displays of ignorance do all the work. Setting out where she stands on policy will also mean clarifying — and often contradicting — things she’s said in the past.Despite the risks, Harris must offer a program. It’s partly a matter of principle: Voters are entitled to no less. But she also needs to convert those who might choose a known quantity over a silent one.Many of the policies advanced by the Biden administration have been admirable. On foreign policy, the president has been more responsible and coherent than Trump. His commitment to fighting climate change was correct on the merits. The main themes of Bidenomics — the push for good jobs, rising wages and broader prosperity — are well worth supporting.But Biden too often allied himself with his party’s less enlightened elements. Many of his regulations have made economic progress harder, and his rhetoric has been needlessly hostile to business. As Harris offers her first economic-policy speech in North Carolina today, she should avoid these errors by emphasizing practical results over party-line ideology.Some examples: The transition to clean energy will go much faster if new investments aren’t bogged down by union-labor and domestic-content requirements. The country is short of workers and needs more immigrants; it also needs a secure border and an orderly process for choosing the people it admits. As a former prosecutor, Harris might offer support for effective policing and insist that criminals are held accountable for their crimes while promising to confront the economic and social conditions that drive criminality. (“Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime,” as an election-winning politician once said. This Harris wouldn’t accuse firms of “price gouging.” She’d call for stronger competition without declaring war on America’s most successful companies. She’d say control of inflation and fiscal responsibility go together, that supporting the Federal Reserve means paying for additional public spending with taxes, not borrowing. She wouldn’t rule out entitlement reform. She’d oblige the better off to pay their fair share but say there’s a limit to what can be squeezed from corporations and the rich without wounding the economy. And she wouldn’t pander, which dispels trust. Promising to exempt tips from income tax, as she has, is a good example of what not to do. (Voters know this creates a gaping new loophole, surrenders revenue they’ll have to pay for and does little to help its intended beneficiaries. Some of these positions entail specific policies. Some are matters of signaling, which in a close race is nearly as important. Many voters are dismayed by the prospect of Trump’s second term and would require no more than a competent, intelligible, moderate alternative.It shouldn’t be beyond Harris to deliver.— Bloomberg OpinionA new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
suffolknewsherald_2024_74,"Published 5:45 pm Tuesday, February 20, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,For the past couple of years, it has been quite interesting to attend Suffolk School Board Meetings and listen to the banter of four members. It reminds me of Moms for Liberty antics: Create chaos by misleading parents with opinions-not facts; with the end goal to either terminate a superintendent’s contract or have the person resign. Thus, enabling a board to appoint a puppet leader.Within our city of Suffolk, I have been a middle school teacher, an elementary principal, a member of the school board, as well as its chairman. With over 55 years of educational experience and having served on both sides as a public school employee and its policy maker, I believe there are four consistent roles of an effective school board:When we review the facts, our Superintendent Dr. John B. Gordon III, administration officials, principals, and teachers are preparing our students to achieve high academic goals. In 2023, our 3 high schools graduated a record number of honor graduates and graduates received a record $34.3 million in scholarships. Our student graduation rate increased from 85% to 88%, eighteen of nineteen schools were accredited, and state reading, writing and math proficiency scores were on par with state averages. FACTS: Educational professionals are Making Positive Differences in Lives. To those four school board members in question, what are your metrics for success? It cannot be student achievement. Since some board members homeschool and have children in private schools, their intent may be to disrupt public student achievement, remove the superintendent, and other education professionals.Suffolkians, those same four school board members now deem it necessary to create chaos and confusion in the schools with mandatory quarterly board visits to schools. When administrators must constantly address Freedom of Information requests, insults plus visits from board members and minions, how will we be able to keep the best educators and role models to teach OUR students?We can agree that no organization is perfect. But one thing I do know is educational administrators make it possible for teachers to do what they do best: teach. When a school or school district is overseen by a motivated and caring administrator, teachers, staff, students, and parents all benefit. These, my fellow citizens, are the undebatable facts in the Suffolk Public School District. We must demand more of our board members because at least four of them don’t appear to understand their roles. They want to dictate policy AND be school administrators.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_190,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|78.872°If there’s one thing that wasn’t on my bingo card for 2024, it was this: that amid a national outbreak of bird flu among dairy cows, sales of raw milk would surge.But new data shows that’s exactly what’s happening. It’s a baffling trend that puts people at risk of getting seriously ill — especially kids.When reports of dairy cows infected with bird flu first surfaced, one of consumers’ first questions was about the safety of the milk supply — especially after fragments of the virus were found in cartons sitting on grocery store shelves. Researchers eventually showed that pasteurization appears to remove any threat of contracting the virus from consuming the milk.By contrast, the effects of the lingering virus in raw milk remain murky. One small study found that mice fed raw milk from infected cows became sick.Every single infectious disease expert I’ve spoken with about bird flu in recent months has raised the same point: The likelihood of becoming ill from drinking H5N1-laden raw milk might be low, but the potential of getting sick from other pathogens in raw milk is high — too high to make it worth the risk. Public health authorities have stressed that it is simply not safe to drink raw milk, particularly for people who are most vulnerable to the worst infections from the bad bugs it might carry, like pregnant women, children, the elderly and the immune-compromised.And yet data from market research firm NielsenIQ found that raw milk sales were 42% higher from mid-May to mid-June than they had been during the same period in 2023. The timing raises the question of whether people are just jumping onto an already-growing trend (pushed by wellness influencers and trad wives , or if drinking it has become a bizarre act of political defiance (to wit, the right-wing group Turning Point USA now sells a “got raw milk?” tee .Raw milk can expose people to a who’s who of nasty bugs, including campylobacter, cryptosporidium, E. coli, listeria, brucella and salmonella. Before pasteurization was the norm, it was associated with truly horrid-sounding diseases like “summer diarrhea.” The advent of pasteurization laws has been considered a key factor in cutting the infant death rate by more than half at the turn of the 20th century.In 2005, researchers connected raw milk to a 2001-2004 outbreak of bovine tuberculosis among humans. This past winter, some 165 people, 40% of them children and the majority in California, were sickened from raw milk from Fresno-based Raw Farm LLC that was contaminated with salmonella (with a few cases of campylobacter and E. coli sprinkled in . Twenty of those folks wound up in the hospital. Last month, health officials in Minnesota said five children had fallen ill from salmonella linked to unpasteurized milk, one of whom was hospitalized.Yet enthusiasts seem to have bought into persistent myths about raw milk as a superfood — and pasteurized milk as a problem. One of those myths is that raw milk can reduce lactose intolerance; studies have shown that to be unfounded. Another myth is that drinking pasteurized milk causes allergies or that raw milk can prevent them; again, untrue. Yet others claim that raw milk is nutritionally superior to the pasteurized product or that it boosts the immune system; both are unsupported by research.Another myth, one recently perpetuated in a video by third-party vice presidential candidate Nicole Shanahan, is that pathogens are an industrial farm problem — and that small, “clean” farms can avoid them (ironically, the video features Raw Farm, the same provider responsible for the California outbreak . Not so, said Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist Maria Bye in a recent statement: “Consuming any unpasteurized milk is risky, no matter how clean the operation from which it is purchased.”We should expect to see more people get sick if raw milk sales continue to increase. One analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that while only a sliver of the population consumes raw milk or cheese (3.2% and 1.6%, respectively , they accounted for 96% of illnesses due to pathogen-laced dairy products.Many of those sick people will be kids. Another study found that between 2013 and 2018, nearly half of the illnesses due to unpasteurized milk were in people under the age of 20.The risks of unpasteurized milk have long been clear. The bird flu outbreak among dairy cows should be convincing more people to stay away from it — not creating more demand."
suffolknewsherald_2024_23,"Published 1:41 pm Wednesday, August 14, 2024ByStaff ReportsDennis EdwardsI called my Suffolk High School Football Coach the other day. Left a message for Dr. Mike Debranski, who coached us in the falls of 1973 and 1974 and was my Gym Teacher. Just wanted the Former Suffolk School Board Chairman to know how every time I see the soon to be Democrat Vice Presidential Nominee and Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz, I think of him.Both have the same upbeat personalities as well as optimistic and go-get-em personae. Like coach Waltz, coach Debranski challenged, pushed and inspired us with an ever present enthusiasm that always had our best interests at heart.He produced some really good players like former Virginia Union University Quarterback Garfield Mizelle, VUU Linebacker Calvin Young and Suffolk’s Circuit Court Clerk Randy Carter.Perhaps my fondest memory of Coach Debranski was when we unexpectedly beat the Franklin High School football team one year. Coach was beside himself. On that occasion, or after another victory, coach was so excited he kind of stepped outside himself in candor, gratitude and joy. Said something like “I’m so proud of you guys I could take anyone of you home with me as my son”. He then followed the statement up with a hilarious reference to his attempts to have one. “I don’t know guys, I keep trying but I just keep coming up with girls!”I was laughing and listening pretty intensely that night. I stood there dumbfounded, actually wondering what it would look and be like to have coach Debranski as a dad. Then I thought “I wouldn’t have a problem with that”. It would have been quite the adventure.To be sure, the thought was simply a notion, a “flight of fancy” so to speak, emerging from a moment of extreme excitement. No reflection on my mom or stepdad. Just the idea coach thought that much of us made me feel great. A feeling I never forgot and will always remember.Of course, I told my mom about coaches statement. She just smiled in the way mothers do at the more odd ideas their children share with a look on her face that said, “wouldn’t be long before he brought you back!” He probably would have. But the thought was more than a humorous diversion. I considered it a very nice complement.So while watching Coach and Governor Walz on the campaign trail, seeing and hearing his kindness, optimism, my mind goes back to Coach Debranski. I remember the things he said and how I always liked the way he pronounced my name.Coach Debranski was and still is what the Latin describes as “sui generous”, one of a kind. In my mind’s eye, I can see him always doing the same thing Walz is doing. Leading with joy, determination as well as vision. Pointing the way to excellence and making all of us want to follow him home.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_256,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°When the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the Biden-Harris administration’s latest student loan bailout scheme, it potentially saved American taxpayers nearly half a trillion dollars.Now the Supreme Court has spoken. By unanimously rejecting the administration’s request to lift the lower court’s injunction, it effectively blocked this loan cancellation gambit while underlying litigation proceeds.The seven-state lawsuit challenged the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE plan, which the states argued was just another version of the bailout scheme that the Supreme Court struck down last summer. The Eighth Circuit apparently agreed, even scolding the administration for flouting previous rulings and directing it to put further attempts at “forgiveness” on ice.To be clear, so-called forgiveness is just a euphemism for foisting these student loans onto the backs of taxpayers. The administration’s SAVE plan aimed to do just that for millions of borrowers, who would have their loans “forgiven” after 10 years, without paying a single dime toward either principal or interest..But by the time this latest injunction was handed down, the Biden-Harris administration had already used the SAVE plan to conduct $5.5 billion in student loan bailouts. That price tag almost makes the administration’s previous plan — which could’ve cost over $1 trillion, but was struck down by the Supreme Court — look like a bargain.Young adults, including college graduates, have soured on the economic policies of this administration. Runaway government spending has created a veritable cost-of-living crisis with 40-year-high inflation, record low levels of homeownership affordability, and the highest grocery prices in history.The financial situation for young Americans is so untenable that they are moving back in with family members at the fastest rate since the 1940s. That kind of retrogression is why a generation of Americans believes they will have a lower standard of living than their parents enjoyed.The Biden-Harris administration should be performing a mea culpa, acknowledging how their disastrous overspending worsened the burden on young borrowers. Instead, they’re trying to paper over the problem with even more government spending and borrowing.The SAVE plan was allegedly based on the 1992 Amendments to the Higher Education Act, which provided congressional authorization for income-driven repayment (IDR plans. But as the Eighth Circuit pointed out, the Administration’s newest scheme was of “an order of magnitude broader than anything that has come before” and unsupported by the original statute.The education secretary was never given the authority to construct new repayment plans in such a way that borrowers could make no payments and then see their debt canceled. The judges rightly noted in their opinion that such a drastic change would require authorization by Congress.Unfortunately, the administration still intends to flout statutory law and remains committed to forcing millions of Americans who never went to college— or those who paid their college loans in full — into paying off the debts of more recent college grads.Instead of putting borrowers back onto normal repayment plans, the Biden-Harris administration has effectively frozen over 8 million accounts. They are now in interest-free forbearance.Foregone student loan revenue has already cost taxpayers over $400 billion. Now those losses will continue.Such forbearance is also unnecessary since borrowers still have access to IDR plans, even after this latest court injunction. Payments under such schedules are capped at 20 percent of discretionary income.While the courts have delivered a win for taxpayers, the war over student loan bailouts isn’t over. The Biden-Harris administration is still hellbent on sticking you with the bill for other people’s student loans and has indicated that it intends to fight the ruling. If so, the Supreme Court is its only available option for redress.Mercifully, since that Court has already struck down one of the administration’s cockamamie bailout schemes, American taxpayers may soon be breathing a sigh of (permanent relief.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
philinquirer_2024_61,"As a special education teacher, I m tired of watching my students get disciplined more than others, setting them up for a life in and out of prison. If this doesn t change, I can t continue.I love teaching, but at the end of this year, I will likely quit. Quit Strawberry Mansion High School, where I teach. Quit the school district. Quit teaching altogether.Kids love school, even the teenagers of Strawberry Mansion. I’ve lost count of the students who’vesaid they’ll never return, only to sheepishly creep in the next day. But a school has to love its children back, and I’m not sure the School District of Philadelphia loves all of its children.In the coming weeks, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker will make decisions onschool board appointments. These decisions will have a profound impact, as the policies of district leadership trickle down not only to the children and families of our city but also to teachers like me, who teach with our full hearts.I’m bracing myself for what will come, but after years of being disappointed, I’m tired. I’m tired of watching bad decisions hurt our most vulnerable kids, especially those with disabilities. I’m tired of watching the ever-churning machine of systemic oppression eat my students whole.» READ MORE:Unflinching hope in the Philly neighborhood that the most people have abandoned | OpinionThe Philadelphia school system is broken in many ways. A history ofinequitable fundinglingers inasbestos-filled walls and broken air-conditioners. With Lower Merion’s per-pupil spending and Advanced Placement classes just seven miles away, there is no hiding from the institutional injustices my students face. One hundred percent of students at Strawberry Mansion are considered “economically disadvantaged.”Nearly half qualify for an individualized education program, or IEP, a plan designed to support students with disabilities. At Carver High School of Engineering and Science, which students must apply to get into, that number is just5%.Many of the students at Mansion sit in the middle of the intersectionality of race, disability, and poverty; they are an especially vulnerable population that we, as educators, should be purposeful in our efforts to protect. Yet I watch as my students are pushed aside by the district intended to serve them — through suspensions that turn into dropouts, disciplinary placements that aren’t so temporary, and the ensnaring tentacles of the justice system.There is a substantial body ofresearchthat shows the inequitable use of discipline on students of color and those with disabilities.Among children with disabilities, one in four of those who are Black will be suspended at least once, but among white children, only one in 11receive the same punishment.Each time a student is kicked out of their school — either via a suspension, alternative placement, or “disciplinary” transfer — there can be enormous consequences. A short suspension may seem harmless, but each removal of a student from their educational environmentincreases the likelihood they will drop out or come in contact with the police.There is even a name for how we marginalize our students out of school and into cells: the school-to-prison pipeline. Students are funneled from their regular schools into disciplinary and juvenile placements and then pushed toward incarceration. The students we pick for this are those we find the most challenging, the most difficult to understand — the ones who don’t listen and test our patience. They may love their school, but it won’t love them back. The unrequited love of the school system burns them the worst.Not surprisingly, students with disabilities are overrepresented in our justice system. At the Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center,46% of students have an IEP. AtPennypack House, a school for teens facing adult charges,57% of students have an IEP.The best thing for kids at risk of falling into the justice system is to keep them in school, asresearchhas found that a student’s connection to school is a “protective” factor that reduces their risk of entering the school-to-prison pipeline. But instead of protecting our most vulnerable students from this future, we add to their risk. During the 2021-22 school year,26% of district studentsinvolved in disciplinary incidents had an IEP, despite comprisingless than 16% of the student population. For 2022-23,50% of district students identified as Black, but65%of student “offenders” were Black.As educators, we see the realities of these disparities in our hallways every day. To us, those statistics aren’t numbers; they are children. We say their names and smile at them each morning. How many students will get pushed aside before we start real conversations around how to serve them?I know my absence will be a loss for my students. But I don’t belong in public school anymore.I became a special education teacher because I acutely remember being 12 years old in math class, having the feeling of “This is not the place for me.” I tried to reel in my ADHD brain, like leashing a wild dog. I want my students to know that different isn’t less, needs aren’t weaknesses, and every brain is beautiful.I am a true believer. I believe in special education and individualization. I believe in doing my job the right way in compliance with state and federal laws written by people smarter than me. I believe that, with special education, we see students — especially our most challenging ones — flourish instead of flounder. Yet, here I am, standing in a classroom and thinking, “This is not the place for me.”As Mayor Parker begins her tenure, I am pleading for change. I need her and other leaders to overhaul our discipline system so students aren’t sent to alternative placements for nonviolent behaviors. I need her to instill in our schools the values of restorative justice, with a commitment beyond lip service to making it work. I need her to stress accountability so that every student with an IEP receives an appropriate education, even if that looks different or messy or takes more patience, labor, and time.The city teachers’ union has a role to play, too.Retiring union president Jerry Jordanacknowledged that the rate of Philly teachers leaving the classroom is largelydue to inadequate working conditions, yet he offered no action to address this exodus. In the post-pandemic transition back to buildings, there was no influx of counselors, social workers, or community partners, only students in the midst ofgriefandmental health crisesexhibiting challenging behaviors in underequipped schools. I hope the incoming union leadership is able to effectively advocate for working conditions that support both the best interests of teachers and students.As teachers, we need to see that student mental health needs are adequately addressedso we know our lessons can have an impact. Only then will we be able to stay in our jobs without watching the students we love struggle as we helplessly stand by.I need Parker to do all this so I can focus on my students while knowing their rights are protected, so I can teach them to read without worrying they’ll be suspended once they cross the threshold out of my room. I want to focus on imbuing in my students the power their education provides. But I need them here, in school, not at home, not at a disciplinary placement, not sitting in an overcrowded juvenile justice cell.I need her to make space for my students in our schools. I can teach them — just let them in and, please, let them stay.Colleen Gibbons-Brown is a special educator who has taught middle and high school students for the past seven years.

minnpost_2024_126,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Over the last year I have spent a considerable amount of time talking with college presidents and inquiring journalists. What each asked is essentially the same — What lies ahead for American higher education?For each, I have had the same answer. The funk that now engulfs us could be never-ending.Most of those who ask are, like me, steady consumers of higher education’s morning news reports, which feature failed presidencies, campus closures, campus disruptions and political intrusions. This funk is reflected in the continuing dysfunction introduced by the federal government’s failed FAFSA adventure.Then I discovered I was dead wrong. The real problem is that higher education, like society at large, is being engulfed by a deluge of righteous anger. My evidence? The nightly parade of commentators and hosts on cable news.With raised voices, waving hands and pronounced grimaces, they declaim against an abundance of villains, bad ideas and misplaced loyalties. Ultimately, I’ve come to understand that what I read about each morning is but an echo of what I watch each evening on TV.What is needed as an antidote to offset the righteous anger is something that unites rather than divides our campuses. It is a tough but necessary lesson that I finally understood when I joined a convening of 20 institutions developing three-year baccalaureate degrees, something more and more colleges are adding or experimenting with.At that meeting, as before, I was asked what lies ahead for our troubled industry. Only now, my answer was different. What lies ahead is not more funk, but rather a voluntary wading into the darker waters of this righteous anger.As is my custom, I ended my presentation with a call for questions. First up was a college president who, right on cue, snarled, “All right Bob, we get the message, but what are we supposed to do about it?”Without hesitation, I told him: “Just do something! Something purposeful solving a key higher education problem. Something of value, a truly good idea that can engage important elements of your campus.”The need for a uniting, positive force was the lesson the 20 institutions then developing three-year degrees talked about almost endlessly. They now knew what worked, what didn’t and how their effort had come to matter.It was the lessonChristopher Hopey, president of Merrimack College, learned when he challenged a small group of his faculty to design three-year baccalaureate curricula.Two months in he told me that his faculty were finding theCollege-in-3work liberating, that it had given them a burst of energy and optimism.Other schools had similar experiences; once they got going, success built on itself. What looked at first to be impossible had proven to be doable. There had been encouragement from their accreditors and a willingness on the part of their institutional friends to help.What makes these results possible is now pretty well understood by the members of College-in-3.First, nearly every participating institution thought small, offering just a couple of three-year options, not the entire undergraduate curriculum. And while the prospect of an undergraduate degree that costs students one-quarter less was an administrative talking point, the real excitement was generated by the opportunity to design something really new, beginning with what students did their first year.Old taboos were discarded. New ideas were readily tried and discarded if they didn’t work. The new watchword for effective design became, “Is it truly student centered?”It became easier to integrate traditional learning outcomes with vocational interests; there was a new willingness to make internships, summer work and learning experiences elements of the new curriculum. That made it easier to consider this question: “What do we expect our students to know and be able to do when they leave us?”Perhaps the most unexpected development was the feistiness of institutions that faced regulatory roadblocks. TheNew England Commission of Higher Education,for example, told the first of our institutions to submit proposals for a three-year degree to wait for a while.Not deterred, the institutions mounted a successful campaign that convinced the commission to issue guidelines for approving three-year options.In a different region, a public institution sought approval for a three-year degree, and seemingly did everything right, including securing the endorsement of its accreditor. But it ran into a political buzz saw when it sought the required approval of its state legislature: The faculty union declared the idea of a three-year baccalaureate degree dead on arrival. A 25% reduction in time to degree would mean fewer faculty jobs in general and fewer jobs in the liberal arts in particular.The faculty union won. Yet, the institution, refusing to give up, has remained active in College-in-3.Our push for a three-year alternative is not the only way to do something that matters, to create a uniting force. Still, it neatly illustrates the advantages of what I have in mind, involving both what and how students learn.College-in-3 does not call for protests or other means of acting out, but it can promise success for all students deemed worthy of admission, regardless of their backgrounds.Not lamentations on a theme. Not the righteous anger of those alienated by a world turned topsy-turvy. Instead, purposeful change designed from the bottom up. That’s the antidote higher education needs.Robert Zemsky was the founding director of theInstitute for Research on Higher Educationat the University of Pennsylvania.This commentary originally appeared in The Hechinger Report."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_48,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass the Chips and Science Act — but their persistent failure to unite behind common-sense, bipartisan reforms to bring more skilled immigrants to the U.S. puts this notable achievement in jeopardy.Congress passed the law in 2022 to revive domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce dependence on fabrication plants in East Asia. On paper, the initiative is already a success: Nearly $30 billion in subsidies and $25 billion in loans have been awarded, supporting investments of roughly $350 billion. One industry-sponsored study expects U.S. chipmaking capacity to triple by 2032, with output of advanced logic chips rising from zero in 2022 to 28% of global production.To build and run those fabs, however, companies need workers the U.S. doesn’t have. Shortages of skilled installers of hyper-precise chipmaking equipment have already delayed projects. The number of Americans studying in relevant graduate programs has been flat for 30 years. A third of current fab workers are 55 and older, and more than half say they’re eager to quit. The Semiconductor Industry Association says chipmakers will face a shortfall of 67,000 skilled workers by 2030.Congress needs to weigh the consequences. Companies that can’t scale up will demand additional subsidies or shift production to Taiwan and Japan. As domestic production struggles, the problem might get worse, as American STEM graduates seek work in other fields. The hoped-for benefits — U.S. technological leadership and enhanced national security — will come to nothing.The Chips Act anticipated this difficulty. It includes a $200 million training and education fund, and it requires companies to prioritize workforce development. Colleges have announced new degree and certificate programs aimed at the semiconductor industry. But these efforts will take time to yield results. They won’t meet the industry’s immediate needs and will likely fail in the long term too if recruiters can’t hire more immigrants. U.S. citizens are a minority among STEM graduates with advanced degrees relevant to chipmaking.The current immigration pipeline is no use. The much-maligned H-1B program is hugely oversubscribed every year. Caps on visas plus limits per country mean applicants from India, the likeliest source of new semiconductor workers, can wait decades for their status to be resolved.Comprehensive immigration reform would be best, but failing that, here’s a good idea: the “chipmaker’s visa,” suggested by the Economic Innovation Group. It would auction a certain number of visas (say, 10,000 per year for 10 years for high-skilled workers, subject to a salary minimum. Recipients could change jobs within the industry and would be offered an expedited path to permanent residency after working for five years. Proceeds from the auctions would help fund scholarships and workforce development programs for American students and workers.That’s the minimum Congress should do. The shortage of STEM workers extends far beyond semiconductors. The U.S. should increase the overall number of visas for high-skilled immigrants, prioritizing applicants with in-demand STEM skills and exempting foreign graduates of U.S. schools with advanced STEM degrees from green-card caps. That last group, by itself, could provide enough workers to meet most of the need for semiconductor engineers.—Bloomberg Opinion/TNS"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_169,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The latest news on inflation has been pretty good. It has also been extremely weird. And that weirdness is, in a way, the message.With underlying inflation fairly low but probably still above the Fed’s 2% target, and people still worried that it might go back up, quirky measurement issues can lead to big mood swings that are quickly reversed when the next numbers come in — or sometimes even a few hours after the initial announcement, once knowledgeable people have had some time to dig into the details.There were two big official inflation reports in the past couple of days: the producer price index (what we used to call wholesale prices on Tuesday and the consumer price index on Wednesday morning. There was also a private survey from the National Federation of Independent Business that may add some clarity.So what do I mean by “weirdness”? On Tuesday, I was busy most of the day with plumbers and dentists, so I was able to check in on events and commentary only once in a while. But this enforced limitation on the information flow might actually have given me more perspective. The first thing I saw was a hot PPI, with inflation coming in well above expectations. There was much wailing and rending of garments. Then, as the analysts I follow had time to parse the details, they started to declare that this was actually a good report.Financial markets seemed to agree. One quick and dirty way to judge how markets view inflation data is to look at the yield on two-year U.S. Treasurys, which largely reflects what people think the Fed is going to do. If inflation looks hot, they expect the Fed to keep rates high and maybe even increase them; if it looks cool, they expect the opposite.And if you look at two-year yields over the past few days, you see the market reaction matching my sense of the commentary. Yields spiked when the PPI report was released, then fell back once there was time to dig into the numbers, ending the day lower than they started.On the other hand, markets from the get-go liked the CPI, which seemed to show inflation resuming its downward trend, with yields falling sharply. But analysts were still digging into the details. Will they be less optimistic by Wednesday evening? Probably not: Early commentary seems, if anything, to be saying that the numbers were even better than they first appeared. But after Tuesday, I’m going to wait and see.I also mentioned the survey from the NFIB, which represents small and medium businesses. One question it asks is whether businesses are planning to raise or lower prices over the next three months; the percentage difference from current numbers is often a useful indicator of inflation trends. And that spread is currently close to what it was before the pandemic, although slightly higher.So my best guess? The acceleration in measured inflation over the past few months was probably a statistical illusion; inflation wasn’t as low as it seemed in late 2023 but probably hasn’t risen much, if at all. Underlying annual inflation is probably around 2.5%, maybe even less. So my guess is that we’ve already won this war — that we have basically achieved a soft landing, with low unemployment and acceptably low inflation.But I could be wrong, and even if I’m right, it’s going to take at least a few more months of good inflation news before this happy reality sinks in.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_186,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°What if the traditional wisdom on how to fix Social Security no longer holds?The trustees who oversee the program issued their annual financial forecast on Monday, predicting that the combined retirement and disability trust fund reserves will be depleted in 2035 – one year later than forecast last year. The improvement is due to the recent strong economy and wage growth, which has accelerated payroll tax payments that fund the program. Still, in 2035, the program would be insolvent.That may sound like Social Security will have no money at all to pay benefits in 2035. But what the report really means is that the enormous Social Security trust fund reserves – currently $2.78 trillion – would be depleted, and the program would be bringing in enough cash at that point to pay only 83% of the benefits promised to current and future beneficiaries. That would be the equivalent of a 17% cut in benefits.A benefit cut of that magnitude is extremely unlikely. It would pose an immediate and severe hardship for retirees and disabled people, and it is difficult to imagine any member of Congress willing to explain such an outcome to constituents.Traditional wisdom holds that there are just a few ways to solve the problem: We can raise the payroll taxes that fund the program, cut benefits, or do some combination of two.But the closer we get to insolvency, benefit reductions cannot be implemented in a way that solves the immediate problem. And a revenue solution gets more challenging – at least, if the goal is to meet Social Security’s legal requirement to forecast solvency over a 75-year period. The payroll tax hikes required at the point of insolvency to meet that goal would be so large that they likely would not be politically feasible.Polling has long indicated that the public supports higher taxes as a way to keep Social Security solvent and maintain benefit levels.Democrats – including President Joe Biden – support raising taxes on the wealthy to restore solvency. They also propose raising benefits modestly. Republicans in Congress oppose higher taxes, and have supported benefit cuts via higher retirement ages and means-testing. Donald Trump usually says he would not touch Social Security, although he has mentioned possible cuts to benefits and his advisers are considering cuts to payroll taxes. Leaving the program untouched is not a policy solution, since it points to the aforementioned 17% cut in benefits.If Democrats sweep the U.S. elections in November, a revenue solution is possible, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a progressive advocacy group pushing for expansion. “If Democrats run this fall on expanding Social Security and win on that issue, they can push for it and force votes.”Martin O’Malley, the recently confirmed commissioner of Social Security, is optimistic that a solution will be reached. “I’ve met with a lot of members of Congress, and my sense is that no one is particularly eager to play chicken with a program that’s this important to so many seniors and people with disabilities,” he told me in an interview on Monday.But if gridlock persists on this issue, Congress might well turn to a different solution to avert insolvency and benefit cuts: an emergency injection of general government revenue.“If you had asked me 20 years ago, I would have predicted a solvency solution that leaves the current system intact, but I no longer think that will happen,” said Charles Blahous, who served as one of the two public trustees for Social Security and Medicare from 2010 to 2015. A conservative, he now researches retirement security issues at George Mason University. “But barring a political miracle and a lot of leadership, I now think we’re headed toward a general revenue bailout.”That would be a profound turning point for Social Security, which has always been self-financed. The program is funded primarily by the payroll tax, currently 12.4%, which is split evenly by employees and employers. It is also funded by smaller amounts of revenue from interest earned on trust fund bonds and taxation of benefits.•••HOW THE MATH WORKSThe logic backing the general revenue solution is straightforward. Even if consensus emerged for some amount of benefit reduction close to the insolvency date, the math simply does not work due to the magnitude and timing of the cuts required.“You couldn’t implement a 25% cut overnight, because it would have a terrible effect on the income of current beneficiaries,” said Paul N. Van de Water, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think tank. “And phasing in smaller cuts over a longer period of time doesn’t solve the short-term problem.”Adding general revenue would mean that Social Security – for the first time – would be adding to the nation’s debt burden, since the money would be borrowed. The shift also could put Social Security in the same boat as other federal programs subject to annual congressional appropriations for things like food and housing.But Van de Water is more sanguine about the implications of using general revenue to fund the program. “Social Security has become sufficiently popular and ingrained over the years that it’s not clear having some non-earmarked financing would diminish the strength and support for the program all that much.”Unfortunately, this likely game of brinkmanship will only the worries expressed by so many Americans about the future of Social Security. If you are among those worriers, Van de Water has some words of reassurance.“Despite the uncertainty, it’s very unlikely that Congress would allow full benefits not to be paid for Social Security,” he said. “There may be a lot of angst before a solution is reached, just as we’ve had angst on other budget issues, but it will be solved.”A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."
eugeneweekly_2024_29,"We ve got issues. A critical foundation to our democracy is an independent justice system which impartially dispenses justice to and for the people without regard to status, pedigree, political persuasion, wealth or lack thereof, or other consideration which tilts the scales one way or the other. I have served in this system for 51 years as a prosecutor and judge and have a perspective that may be of value in these days when, frankly, the entire justice system is under siege and in peril from a concerted movement by powerful interests to topple and control it to serve their own purpose regardless of fairness, equities or truth. The media has reported an avalanche of threats and violence against those within our justice system, including prosecutors, victims of crimes, witnesses, jurors, judges and their staff. These have escalated and become increasingly commonplace when court proceedings involve certain powerful political figures who either instigate or fail to condemn the threatening conduct of their followers. For example, they use media to inflame the actions, calling out witnesses, describing them as liars, denigrating judges and defying their orders designed to maintain order in the courtroom (such as when loudly muttered disparaging comments might be heard by those seated in the jury box who will decide the case . The cumulative impact of such strategies is to erode the solemnity of the law itself, turning the process of trials into mud fights and intimidating those integral to the goal of the process — arriving at the truth and rendering a just result — in the hope of causing them to fail to perform that sworn duty. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Make no mistake, this is also a grave threat to the integrity of our nation’s duty to all the people to serve them in accordance with all the due process that our Founders entrusted us with in our Constitution. Such aggression towards our justice system will likely deprive the people of their rights to a neutral forum to resolve conflicts and will almost inevitably lead to violence as an alternative. In addition to the threats of violence already directed at the participants in our justice system, there is evidence that efforts exist to corrupt the system by bestowing gratuities and gifts on key decision makers in that system as well. Clearly, that would impact the public confidence in the integrity of decisions emanating from institutions which permit such practices. Failing to meaningfully act to prevent such practices could accurately be described as self-inflicted wounds. Yet the Supreme Court refuses to enact ethical rules that are binding on its members, even after those reports of some members’ receiving gifts from wealthy donors with interests in cases before the court. This can only lower confidence in the court’s impartiality and the rule of law itself. The judiciary itself must elevate its standards to avoid even the appearance of partiality in its rulings. (I wish to emphasize that lower courts have such binding ethical rules, begging the question of why the Supreme Court does not. The judicial branch is a key foundation in our constitutional democracy. Each foundation must be healthy for our government to survive, and we must strive to keep them healthy. And each political party, like each branch of government, must have within them personnel who serve and are loyal to the Constitution that is the supreme document that has guided this nation for over two centuries. When a candidate for the highest office in the nation expresses contempt for that document and cites dictators who condemn our democracy, when one of our political parties fails to contradict him, when our justice system itself is threatened and in peril, it is urgent for all of us to recognize the danger to our freedoms and rights and be active in protecting them. If we fail to do so, we become spectators to the conflict being waged over the form of government we will live under after the elections in November 2024. We have never faced such an existential threat to our republic since the Civil War. That conflict was waged over slavery, and today we are faced with the prospect of the political enslavement of our entire population under the tyranny of dictatorship. For those who think some of my remarks are exaggerated, my response is that they are based in large part on evidence from the mouth of the would-be dictator himself in his speeches and the refusal of his party to contradict his goals or distance themselves even one iota from them. In the Civil War we fought for freedom from enslavement. Will we do the same today, when we don’t have to go to war, but simply to the polls to keep us free? Here are a few more pieces of evidence from the horse’s mouth: 1 In March 2023, the former president referred to himself as “Retribution.” 2 In December 2023, when he was asked, “Under no circumstances — you are promising America tonight — you would never abuse power as retribution against anybody?” the former president replied, “Except for Day One” and “After that, I’m not a dictator.” 3 He has endorsed The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 to replace all critical federal employees with hand-picked servants swearing allegiance to himself rather than our Constitution. That’s in itself a recipe for another Fuhrer model dictatorship. (So much for a one-day reign. His intention to fill the Department of Justice with those subject to following his orders will extinguish any semblance of fairness or requirements of evidence to trigger criminal proceedings against his perceived enemies. Finally, we have been forewarned. If we do not vote for democracy this coming November, that will be taken as affirmation of all the plans to cancel the current form of our government and replace it with the government he has promised to deliver in its stead, and we ourselves will be responsible for failing our duty and depriving our posterity of the freedoms we inherited from all those who passed it down to us, including those who died to do so. I hope we do our duty."

But let’s take a more contemporary look, starting, say, with Robert Putnam’s 2000 book,Bowling Alone: Collapse and Revival of American Community.He said we used to bowl in leagues, now we do it alone. The larger part, of course, is the great decline in all kinds of social groups: fraternal orders, clubs, associations, etc. The biggest factor driving this social dis-integration is the rise of online “life.” Namely, the enormous arrival of e-consumption, including the smartphone as of 1994 and the explosion of “social” media around 2000. The most prominent and disturbing result of the high-tech onslaught has been the public health crisis of the young: anxiety, loneliness, depression, rising suicide rates.

philinquirer_2024_77,"State Sen. Anthony H. Williams, the only Philadelphia Democrat to support a bill that would codify the scholarships, deserves praise. His party mates should follow suit.It takes guts to do what State Sen. Anthony H. Williams did.During a recent state Senate Education Committee meeting, Williams delivered a fiery sermon about the sad state of affairs in his district’s public schools, sharing the frustrated pleas of parents seeking better opportunities for their kids.Williams’ testimony was in support ofSenate Bill 795. This bill, sponsored by school choice champion State Sen. Judy Ward, will codifyLifeline Scholarships, referred to as the Pennsylvania Award for Student Success, or PASS, Scholarship Program, into law. If approved, SB 795 will provide scholarship accounts to thousands of students in Pennsylvania’s lowest-performing schools. Parents can use these restricted-use accounts to afford a better education for their children.Williams, a Philadelphia Democrat, was the only member of his party to vote for SB 795.“If I look like I’m voting different from my party, so be it,” said Williams.Rather than caving to his party’s interests, Williams is doing what a public servant should do: represent his constituents.Williams said he stood “with the people who are struggling in this country,” adding that many people in this community “do not have a public school that is providing a quality education.” The senator challenged his colleagues to visit the schools in his district and listen to his constituents’ demands for expanding educational opportunities.Williams and his constituents aren’t alone.Nearlyeight out of 10 Pennsylvanianssupport Lifeline Scholarships. Moreover, the backing is bipartisan. Pollingshows78% of Democrats, 68% of independents, and 61% of Republicans support Lifeline Scholarships.Yet, last year, despite this overwhelming bipartisan voter support, lawmakers still couldn’t make Lifeline Scholarships a reality during the 2023-2024 budget negotiations. Pennsylvania House Democrats dug in their oppositional heels, leading to asix-month impasse.Nearly eight out of 10 Pennsylvanians support Lifeline Scholarships.Lacking the courage to stand up to his party, Gov. Josh Shapiro couldn’t (or wouldn’t get the Democratic-controlled House to hold a vote on Lifeline Scholarships. Ultimately, Shapiro vetoed the budget item, negating months of good-faith negotiations.Ironically, what started the budget impasse — educational choice — also ended it. In December, lawmakers passeda $150 million increasefor the Educational Improvement Tax Credit and Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit programs, which support private donations to K-12 scholarships via tax credits. Once implemented, this unprecedented bump will provide scholarships to an additional 35,000 children, especially those in low-income households.Indeed, educational freedom doesn’t need to be another prolonged political fight. Instead, Shapiro and the Democrats can finally deliver what so many Pennsylvanians demand, but only if they don’t allow partisanship to get in the way.Expanded school choice is inevitable in Pennsylvania. The proverbial genie is out of the bottle, poking its head out when Shapiro supported Lifeline Scholarships on the campaign trail and in office.Despite the claims of some lawmakers thata deal involving Lifeline Scholarships isn’t possible, the Shapiro administration signaled otherwise. Pennsylvania Education Secretary Khalid Mumin, in April,said, “The door’s not closed on it.” To Shapiro, Lifeline Scholarships remain “unfinished business.”While lawmakers prepare to debate the 2024-2025 budget, countless families demand better educational opportunities. If money weren’t an issue, most Pennsylvanians would choose a private school for their kids. In fact,only one in five parentswould send their children to their local district school.Some might ask, “But what about those left behind?” Sadly, this question is more of an admission, suggesting that some public schools are sinking ships. If so, let’s use everything at our disposal to give a “lifeline” to as many of our underserved kids as possible.“Students need a different path, a different opportunity, just like it was presented to me,” said Williams during his closing comments. “And that path will lead to success stories across this country.”Lifeline Scholarships are that different path. All it takes is more courageous lawmakers to carve that path for the commonwealth’s most vulnerable kids.David Hardy is president of Girard College and a distinguished senior fellow at the Commonwealth Foundation."

This encourages me to eat clean.You know, I’m guilty of having eaten junk and processed foods. Admittedly, it’s difficult to avoid processed foods altogether.“You are what you eat.” What does that mean? Literally? Biblically?It’s important to eat good food to be healthy and fit. The foods you consume or put into your body are what make up your body. The nutrients, toxins, and substances from the food you eat are absorbed in the small intestine and stored or used by the body.The biblical interpretation of the expression, “You are what you eat,” is from Proverbs 23:7, which states, “For as he thinks in his heart, so is he,” meaning what you and I read and view have a determining effect on us. Applying to our children, what our children are taking into their minds will determine what they become. That can be true. If our kids are exposed to violence on TV, we may assume they, too, become violent.Food of different kinds, varieties, preparations, and methods of cooking and eating is everywhere: fresh-produced, home-grown, boiled, broiled, cooked, dried, fried, grilled, toast salad, steamed, boxed, canned, pickled, packed, processed.You may want to trade in those processed foods for whole foods and start eating clean, suggests Dr. Jonathan V. Wright, MD, a Harvard and University of Michigan graduate and a pioneer in natural medicine, who wrote the book, “Eating Clean for Dummies” (2011 with Linda Johnson Larsen, a home economist, journalist and author of several cookbooks.“Think of eating clean as cleaning up your life,” wrote Wright. “Just as you’d like to live in a house free of clutter, you need to remove clutter from your diet. That means throwing out the junk foods, refined sugars, additives, preservatives, trans fats, white flour, artificial flavors, and toxins that can be so prevalent in processed foods.”Here are just suggestions to help you eat clean and healthy:“Eating clean is not a diet. It’s a lifestyle,” Wright said. ” It does not include a complicated regimen that restricts entire categories of food.

Health insurance, food on the table, roof over our heads — as kids we took these for granted, but history tells us they were not easily earned, and work stoppages are perennial reminders that they are also hard to keep. As children we were unaware of the constant tension between labor and capital. All we knew was sometimes we ate at Red Lobster on Sundays, and sometimes we were lucky if we ate at all.That is what greeted Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Tim Walz when they landed at the Detroit airport on Wednesday for a rally with the United Auto Workers: the hopes and struggles of the Midwest’s working class. The campaign believes there are an estimated 2.7 million union members in the battleground states.Harris and Walz will be here often.“Michigan just flipped back to middle-class workers,” said Jonathan Smith, a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, at the event. “We’re not going back.”In 2013, the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, made Michigan a “right to work” state, allowing people to work in union-represented roles without paying into the union. He promised this would bring more jobs, but the move faced huge protests — and over the next decade, we learned who was right.Michigan workers saw a decline in their way of life, but not the rise in jobs that was promised. In 2023, the Democrat governor, Gretchen Whitmer, corrected her predecessor’s error. She, like many of the speakers who took the stage at the Detroit rally, made sure to thank union leaders for organizing the huge crowd. Led by members of the United Auto Workers, who wore red, the thousands corralled in and around an airport hangar included a number of brightly colored union T-shirts.With fewer than 90 days to go before the election, what better way for Harris to kick off the first full day with her new running mate than with voters she knows are used to fighting? And she isn’t new to this bloc or their causes.In 2018, as a senator, Harris showed her support for the striking University of California employees by withdrawing as Berkeley’s commencement speaker. In 2019 she joined a UAW picket line in Nevada. The Biden administration transition team included Teresa Romero from the United Farm Workers and Lonnie Stephenson from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Harris is not just comfortable in this setting. The faces in the crowd shape her policy proposals and inform her messaging. Her selection of Walz reiterates her commitment to labor and the working class.As for her opponent, former President Donald Trump purports to be pro-labor, but his businesses have left a trail of aggrieved and unpaid workers over the decades, including union members. We’re talking carpenters, electricians, plumbers. In fact, his enterprises racked up more than 20 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act for not paying overtime or minimum wage. As president, he flooded the National Labor Relations Board with known union-busters. In 2004, he crossed a picket line to appear on “The Apprentice.” His current campaign chose not to hire union stagehands … and ended up with a poorly hung sign that appeared to be endorsing Harris for president.Last fall Trump held a rally in Michigan at a nonunion plant while the UAW was fighting for a living wage. At that event Trump bashed the Biden administration for pushing automakers toward electric cars, claiming the shift would decimate the Detroit economy. Then Elon Musk endorsed him. Now Trump says he has no choice but to like electric cars because of it. So much for EVs destroying the city, right?When union families in the Great Lakes region were fighting to put food on the table, they got support from Biden and Harris. Trump just came looking for votes.“I was satisfied with Biden at the top of the ticket, but with Kamala Harris there is a real excitement,” Detroit native Shana Norfolk told me on Wednesday. “She understands what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck because she’s been there with us. I believe she is going to fight for civil rights, women’s rights, worker rights, equity and inclusion … because she gets it.”That’s how Harris has been able to build so much momentum organically. She is relatable to many different kinds of Americans because she speaks to values needed for the coalition. And it starts with compassion.At one point, Walmart workers who relied on public assistance cost taxpayers more than $6 billion a year. At the same time, the company and its shareholders enjoyed nearly $8 billion in tax breaks and subsidies. Now even though Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said after the Jan. 6 attack that Trump’s big lie was to blame for the division in the country, Walmart continues to donate to Republicans who were election deniers. Presumably for the tax breaks.Earlier this year the NLRB accused Walmart of illegal tactics to prevent employees from unionizing in Eureka, Calif. Clearly the tax breaks are not enough. Project 2025, the playbook conservatives want to employ on Day 1 in a possible second Trump term, includes initiatives to erode organized labor.Health insurance, a roof over their children’s heads, food on the table — under Trump, all the staples of the middle class would be left to the whims of the 1%. No wonder there was such a passionate crowd filling the hangar at the Detroit airport for Harris and Walz: The 99% hope that this new Democratic presidential ticket can stop that from happening.LZ Granderson is an Op-Ed columnist for the Los Angeles Times.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_9,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°J.D. Vance once called Donald Trump “America’s Hitler,” likening him to “cultural heroin.” On Monday, the Ohio senator was named the former president’s running mate.It’s a shrewd and calculated pick — a nod to Trump’s base. More than any of the other contenders, Vance’s selection shows that Trump wants to lock down the MAGA faithful and ensure they turn out — even if that means losing more moderate and independent voters. Vance’s rhetoric is at times harsher and hotter than Trump’s and his positions more extreme.At 39, Vance is decades younger than the 78-year-old Trump, making the acid-tongued senator a young and vigorous inheritor of the MAGA movement — whenever that time should come. His selection also sends a clear message to the country that Trump is building a movement that will reshape the nation, not just for one term, but for the future.That’s a chilling thought. Vance has boundless ambition. Political experience? Not so much. He’s a junior senator in his first elective office. He is opportunistic enough that should he win, Trump will need to watch his back for the next four years.There has been no time — and little inclination — for Vance to project a more thoughtful, senatorial image. On Saturday, after the assassination attempt on Trump’s life, Vance was the only veep candidate on the former president’s shortlist to rush to the harshest conclusion possible, accusing President Joe Biden’s campaign of rhetoric that he claimed “led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”There isn’t a shred of evidence to support that claim and, in fact, the shooter identified by authorities was a 20-year-old registered Republican.Trump, who briefly spoke of unity after a bullet grazed his ear at the rally, appears to have already veered from that path, choosing a running mate who seldom reaches out to the other side unless it’s to deliver a throat punch. His rise has been nothing short of meteoric, thanks in large measure to Trump.Vance first gained notoriety with the 2016 publication of his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, which traced his Appalachian roots and the country’s growing class divide. It was, in short, all about the “forgotten men and women” Trump references when politically necessary. But Vance saw Trump differently back then. A self-described Never-Trumper, Vance turned his scorching rhetoric on Trump, calling him “noxious” and “reprehensible.” He gained further acclaim — and a berth as a political commentator — for his extreme views on the newly elected president.That all stopped around 2018, with one of the most abrupt and unlikely conversions in recent political memory. Soon, Vance had joined the MAGA chorus, transforming from attack dog to Trump acolyte. The reason soon became clear. Vance needed Trump’s endorsement to run for US Senate — badly. Trump, who sees ritual humiliation as a rite of passage to his circle, put Vance to the test. At a 2022 rally, Trump taunted the young upstart. “J.D. is kissing my ass, he wants my support so bad,” Trump said. Vance got the endorsement, Trump got the satisfaction of making Vance eat his words.A new relationship was born.Vance has remained a devoted ally ever since. Like Trump he is pro-Israel and anti-Ukraine. He has embraced Trump’s protectionist position on tariffs.On cultural issues Vance has indicated his willingness to consider a federal 15-week abortion ban, but ever-conscious of Trump’s shifting positions on the issue, has downplayed it. Well aware of how abortion rights have played to Democrats’ advantage, Trump has sought to distance himself from promises of federal action and insisted on stripping the promise of a federal ban out of the party’s platform — a bedrock position for decades.Vance has shown he is nothing if not flexible, and doubtless will remain closely attuned to Trump’s shifting whims as he searches for what’s most politically expedient.His appeal to MAGA loyalists is evident. Shortly after word of his selection was announced via Trump’s Truth Social, Kevin Roberts of the Heritage Foundation — authors of the Project 2025 blueprint for a second Trump term — was delighted. “We were really rooting for him,” Roberts said to fellow Bloomberg columnist Mary Ellen Klas. “We couldn’t be happier.”____Patricia Lopez is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering politics and policy.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_217,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°If you are homeless and have nowhere to go — neither a temporary shelter bed nor a permanent home — can you be fined or, worse, jailed for sleeping on a sidewalk? Or is that cruel and unusual punishment?That’s the question that the Supreme Court wrestled with Monday when it heard oral arguments in the case of Grants Pass v. Johnson regarding the Oregon city’s ordinance allowing police to fine or jail homeless people for sleeping outside. A federal district court ruled that the law violated the 8th Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and blocked it from being enforced. The 9th Circuit upheld the ruling. The city petitioned the Supreme Court to weigh in and it agreed.Most of the justices seemed troubled by the idea of fining and jailing homeless people as a way to deal with homelessness. How could they not be disturbed by that? Grants Pass even criminalizes using a blanket while sleeping outdoors. Liberal or conservative, under what value system does jailing people for trying to stay warm constitute a crime?“And for a homeless person who has no place to go, sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public,” said Justice Elena Kagan.Theane Evangelis, an L.A. attorney who is representing Grants Pass, argued that the inability to enforce the law has “tied cities’ hands” and “fueled the spread of encampments.”Under the Grants Pass’ ordinance, fines for sleeping outside started at $295 and increased from there for people caught being homeless again, eventually leading to arrest and jail for 30 days. According to the 2019 homeless count, there were about 600 homeless people and one shelter in the city; the Gospel Rescue Mission has about 130 beds and requires attendance at a Christian chapel service twice daily and working, if physically able, for the mission for no pay.This is not Los Angeles, where the city and county offer services and a variety of temporary housing options with the goal of helping people move into permanent housing. The goal in Grants Pass, as discussed in a public city council meeting in 2013, was to figure out how to make life uncomfortable enough for homeless people that they would leave. The ordinance was never about solving homelessness. (Officials of Josephine County, where Grants Pass is located, turned down an invitation to apply for a grant from a $200-million pool of state funding for housing, shelter and services. “Where do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks compassion … and passes a law identical to this? “ asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor.“Where are they supposed to sleep? Are they supposed to kill themselves, not sleeping?”“You end up in jail for 30 days, then you get out, I mean, you’re not going to be any better off than you were before in finding a bed if there aren’t … beds available in the jurisdiction, unless you’re removed from the jurisdiction or you decide to leave somehow,” said Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.Evangelis insisted there are services available for homeless people in Grants Pass.“So you’re saying there are services available, there’s treatment available, so people would ultimately move off the street? “ asked Justice Amy Coney Barrett. “Are you saying that if your law is enforced, there is a way for everyone to be cared for?”“No,” said Evangelis. “I’m saying that’s a policy question that is quite difficult, but these laws are an important part of the puzzle. They’re not the only solution.”In fact, they are no part of the solution, not for Grants Pass nor any city. And if the court allows Grants Pass to enforce the ordinance, it will allow any city tired of doing the heavy lifting of providing housing and services to resume fining or jailing homeless people in an effort — whether they say it out loud like Grants Pass officials did — to, once again, shoo homeless people from one block to another, one neighborhood to another, one city to another.Kelsi Corkran, the attorney for the homeless individuals in the Grants Pass lawsuit, argued that the 9th Circuit decision left plenty of room for municipalities to manage street homelessness. They can restrict when and where homeless people can sleep or camp. They can ban tents, clear encampments, and “enforce a sleeping ban against homeless people who decline shelter, “ said Corkran. We don’t think homeless people reluctant to go into a shelter should be fined. Those fees just accumulate and leave them with a debt they can’t pay.— Los Angeles Times/TNS"
suffolknewsherald_2024_62,"Published 6:46 pm Tuesday, March 12, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIn this, another annual observance of Sunshine Week, we’re reminded of the words of Bill Moyers — that “secrecy is the freedom tyrants dream of.”Vladimir Putin regularly lives that dream in Russia, where journalists and, for that matter, anyone who questions the dictator’s authority are routinely snuffed out. Here at home, a country built on citizens’ right to know the affairs of their governments, secrecy is protected not by violence but by consistent, mostly subtle efforts to weaken open records and open meetings laws, or by simple disregard for the laws as written, knowing the consequences are minimal.Sunshine Week is a national initiative begun in 2005 by the former American Society of News Editors, now the News Leaders Association, intentionally during the birth week of the philosophical Founding Father of sunshine laws, James Madison, who famously declared: “A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance. And a people who mean to be their own Governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.”It’s important to note that sunshine laws are not merely a tool for journalists. They are available to any citizen who wishes to know more about local, state and federal governments. Public servants responsible for fielding and responding to those requests sometimes grouse about the voluminous requests from gadflies, but the inconvenience, and even the expense, which can be reasonably recouped by the responding entity, are worth it to ensure transparent government.At their core, sunshine laws exist for the public’s benefit, the right of the citizenry to be informed transcends any public agency embarrassment or loss of “efficiency.”As one state legislature put it, “The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for them to know; the people insist on remaining informed so they may retain control over the instruments they have created.”Sunshine laws secure the public trust and therefore must remain robust. When the public trust is broken, these laws are the best hope for holding public servants accountable.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2024_20,"Tenants, organized together, are a powerful force.The COVID-19 pandemic ravaged Philadelphia, killing thousands of our neighbors and infecting many of us. It shut down our schools and brought businesses to a standstill. But COVID also brought some of the strongest tenant protections Philadelphia has ever known.There were the temporary initiatives: theeviction moratoriumand the waivers for late fees or interest on back rent. Both were critical to keeping Philadelphians housed as we struggled with infection, job loss, and emergency care responsibilities. There was also the well-timed launch ofPhiladelphia’s Eviction Diversion Program, which offers mediation — rather than eviction — for tenants who owe less than $3,000 in back rent.These tenant protections were a boon to tenants in the poorest big city in America, but a headache toPhiladelphia’s corporate landlords, who saw their profits shrink ever-so-slightly. Now, with many pandemic-era tenant protections expired, those landlords are champing at the bit to take advantage of lapsed tenant protections and recoup their pandemic losses.Already, we have seen a wave of violent post-pandemic evictions — which paused last year aftera series of shootings by “landlord-tenant officers”— and resumed just a few months ago. The evictions, which disproportionately harm the most marginalized among us, allow landlords to raise rents — driving up housing costs for all of us and exacerbatingPhiladelphia’s housing crisis.Still, that hasn’t been enough for Philadelphia’s corporate landlords. Driven by blind greed, they are pursuing alternate, unethical, and illegal avenues to exploit poor and working-class tenants to maximize their profits.They are ignoring the one pandemic-era tenant protection initiative still standing — the Eviction Diversion Program — andforgoing mediationfor tenants who owe less than $3,000 in back rent. In effect, this forces mostly poor tenants to navigate the complex housing legal system or, more likely, face eviction. Once a tenant is gone, landlords are able to increase rent on the unit.Another landlord profit maximization tactic is systematic negligence. Landlords who employ this tactic, including some who receive government-subsidizedhousing choice vouchers, simply neglect their landlord responsibilities — performing little-to-no services, upkeep, and repairs — in violation of housing codes and joint lease agreements. They are banking on their tenants lacking the time, knowledge, or resources to enforce the terms of their lease in housing court.Tenants’ silence works to the landlords’ advantage.As a longtime Philadelphia resident, I’ve experienced landlord greed firsthand. Despite numerous attempts to work with a recent landlord, my home was plagued by plumbing and electrical issues. We faced massive ceiling leaks leading to mold and electrical shocks when we tried to shower, a number of major electrical issues, and no working smoke alarms or carbon monoxide detectors to protect us in case of an emergency.Once, my sink was so clogged that I had to pour my dishwater out the window from a bucket under my sink. And in order to flush my toilet, I had to pour a bucket of water into it. In the winter, we faced extended periods with no working heat.Through it all, my landlord made no attempts to fix the issues, even when our safety was at risk. My landlord’s nonresponse made what should be my safe and comfortable space a living nightmare.What’s most insidious, landlords are organizing to earn even higher profits on all of our backs.But there is hope. Tenants, organized together, are a powerful force. Already, our community is rising up against landlord greed, organizing throughRenters United PhiladelphiaandOnePAto educate our community about their rights, demand housing policy that puts renters first, and stand up to bad landlords.Philadelphia is in a housing crisis. So is our country. Recognizing that this crisis is national, we’ve joined a national coalition with theCenter for Popular Democracy, demanding that President Joe Biden end the housing crisis by investing in permanently affordable, tenant-controlled housing and stoppingcuts to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.We are fighting to preserve a future where we can continue to live and raise our families without having to endure unsafe living conditions and skyrocketing rent increases. That future is possible, but it will take all of us.Regina Ruffin is a mother of four wonderful children and a member ofRenters United Philadelphia, a renter power project of OnePA. She is currently staying with her sister in Frankford after her landlord pushed her and her children out of their home."
minnpost_2024_167,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The selection ofTim Walz as Kamala Harris’ running matehas sparked a wave of commentary suggesting that simply by elevating a former small-town football coach to the candidacy for vice president, Democrats will naturallysecure the allegiance of rural voters nationwide.At first glance, such analysis — tinged with wishful thinking — seems self-evident.Walz, the governor of Minnesota,was raised in a small, rural town in Nebraskaand runs a Midwestern state with a strong rural identity. And it is hard to deny that manyrural advocates and writers genuinely feel seen and representedwith the choice of Walz — a feeling not felt in quite some time. Indeed, you can now sport aHarris-Walz camo hatthis hunting season.But a closer examination reveals that such expectations may be overly simplistic and optimistic.While Walz’s selection may offer symbolic value, it demands a lot of a single candidate to overcome a seismic restructuring of American political geography. Over the past 40 years, aspolitical scientist Dan Sheaand Ishow in our book “The Rural Voter,” Republican partisans have come to dominate rural politics.In one respect,Walz has built his careertrying to reverse that tide, advocating for communities like the one he came from. His positions are, of course, open to interpretation, but Walz has had to grapple with what we call the “nationalization” of the rural voting bloc — the fact that rural voters in all parts of the country view themselves as politically powerless, victims of bad government policy and culturally maligned.While images ofcorn dog-eating, dad-joking, “Midwestern Nice”folksiness have become routine in covering Walz, they do little to explain the real issues that have made rural voters a sizable force in recent American elections.Over the past 40 years, this politicized identity has come to distinguish rural voters from urban ones, and even from other groups that are predisposed to vote for Republican or conservative candidates. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of 7,500 rural voters from February 2024, I joined 15 other scholars in digging into these views.“Midwestern Nice” does little to capture the grievance and anxiety felt by many rural residents living across the country. As multiple indicators suggest, majorities of rural residents think their communities get less government spending than they deserve, that local kids will not do as well as their parents later in life, and that much of this is the fault of urbanites. On this front, the Midwest is no different than the rest of the country.Given the fact that rural voters in the Midwest are much like the rest of the country, Walz’s performance within his home state of Minnesota is a relevant bellwether for his national appeal among rural voters. Though Walz has deep rural roots, rural voters have not always supported him as much as his backstory might quickly suggest.In six elections over the past eight years, populist candidates for major offices in upper Midwestern states have seen differing levels of success in rural parts of their districts or states. Using the vote share that each candidate received from majority-rural counties — counties where the rural population is more than 50% of the total — as a proxy for rural support both district- and statewide, Walz’s performance has decreased among rural voters since he last ran for reelection to Congress in 2016. It does not exceed the support other candidates in the Midwest received from similar rural-majority counties.I calculated the percent of the population living in acensus-defined rural blocfor Walz’s former congressional district and the state of Minnesota. I then calculated the percent of Walz’s vote share that came from rural-majority counties in each of his past three elections, one for Congress and the other two for governor.Like other Democrats in districts across the nation, Walz struggled to win rural voters in his congressional district — Minnesota’s First District — and statewide. Neither of those are majority-rural constituencies, but even when just looking at the most rural areas, Walz never won a majority. In fact, his largest losses running for reelection as governor in 2022 were in rural communities. That year, Walz captured just 38% of the vote in rural-majority counties across Minnesota.Some might see this as evidence that no Democrat could do well in rural America. If not the folksy Walz, then who, they might ask?Just look next door.In Walz’s own Midwest region, other Democrats have performed strongly among rural constituencies. U.S. Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota performed nearly as strongly as their Republican opponents within the most rural parts of their electorate. Even Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer outperformed Walz’s rural numbers.That’s right, if Democrats wanted a candidate from the Midwest on the national ticket who did better with rural voters, Harris-Whitmer would have a better track record of rural support. And worth noting: Whitmer, Baldwin and Klobuchar each grew up in cities.None of this is to say that Democrats have made a mistake by playing into the rural or small-town trope that many have enthusiastically conjured over Walz’s candidacy. Walz is a clear counterbalanceto the image constructed by another Midwestern,self-proclaimed spokesperson for rural Americaon the ballot: JD Vance.A recentWashington Post poll on the two vice presidential nominees’ popularityshows that Walz has secured a marginal geographic advantage among voters across the U.S. In urban areas, about 20% of voters dislike Vance more than like him. Among rural respondents, just 14% of voters dislike Walz more than like him. Walz, however, is still less popular than popular among rural voters, while Vance is viewed favorably, on average.But it is worth remembering that the most popular candidate to ever win rural America neither hails from a rural America nor pretends to. Donald Trump’s appeal lies not in his personal connection to rural life but in hisability to tap into the sentiments of rural discontentand align them with his broader political message. Trump has shown that the politics of rural identity do not easily translate to simple identity politics.It should not be hard to find a candidate who won’t disdain rural voters as a basket of deplorables, asHillary Clinton famously didin the 2016 presidential campaign. Nor should it be hard to find a candidate who believes thatshowing up in rural areas is not just good strategybut good for democracy.But Walz’s challenge is not merely to present a rural-friendly image.It’s addressing the deeper issues that motivate rural voters, such as economic insecurity, perceived cultural marginalization and distrust in government. Symbolic gestures — and camo hats — alone are not sufficient to sway their support.Nicholas Jacobsis an assistant professor of government at Colby College.The article is republished from The Conversation."
suffolknewsherald_2024_63,"Published 6:45 pm Tuesday, March 12, 2024ByStaff ReportsThis is Sunshine Week, a little-known observance of our right to know what government is doing.It’s been described (by Wikipedia as “a national nonpartisan collaboration among groups in the journalism, civic, government and private sectors that shines a light on the importance of public records and open government.”More accurately, I think, it’s a reminder for those who value transparency in government that we still have far to travel to get it, and a reminder for those in government who favor secrecy that all they have to do is keep saying “no” and they’ll too often win.A cynical view, admittedly. But it comes from one who spent the better part of four decades trying to strengthen Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act with, what in retrospect, were limited successes.Not that we didn’t have successes, mind you, and the Virginia FOIA is stronger today than it was in the late 1970s when I — and like-minded people across Virginia of my generation — began lobbying legislators, badgering supervisors and council members and making a general nuisance of ourselves when information was withheld.The successful changes to the law are worth noting. A 1989 legislative study committee, to which I had been appointed, toyed briefly with the idea of having closed sessions taped against possible later lawsuits in which a judge would have been able to hear directly what our illustrious honorables were discussing in private, and thus make a reasoned ruling on its legitimacy. My motion, at first successful, lasted exactly one day before Del. Bill Axselle, a veteran legislator, FOIA supporter and chairman of the study group, called to tell me that the idea would never fly, but that it opened the door to a compromise he had been contemplating — the certification of closed sessions.The certification that only legitimate items were discussed in closed session became law and remains the rule today. It’s abused regularly, but it is, nevertheless, an improvement over nothing.A little-known clause was added at the same time that requires — mandates, mind you — that a public official who thinks FOIA was violated in closed session is obligated to say so in public. It doesn’t make a damn what his or her fellow officials or their attorney tell him. He or she is legally and morally bound to spill the beans. Unfortunately, that rarely happens, but it’s there whenever a public official has sufficient intestinal fortitude to be honest about a closed session discussion.The same study resulted in a tightening of the privilege previously enjoyed by public officials who could go in closed session for what was loosely termed “legal advice” from their attorneys pretty much at will. Now, there has to be an expectation of pending legal action to warrant those talks. Of course, you can drive a Mack truck through that language as well, but again, it was better than no change at all.And, finally, the right to take government to court over suppression of records was broadened to allow cases to be brought in General District Court, where an individual can represent him or herself.A second study a decade later was chaired by the talented Del. Chip Woodrum, D-Roanoke, and co-chaired by Bill Bolling, R-Hanover, a man who became lieutenant governor and should have become governor not many years later but had the opportunity denied by the party’s hard right wing just as all that stuff was beginning.It was an honor to work on that study with both men, who joined forces to secure broad bipartisan support — something still possible back in those days — for creation of the Virginia Freedom of Information Council, which has ever since been a voice of reason in the tug of war over public information.The FOIA Council was shaped and for years led by Maria Everett, an attorney who worked for the Division of Legislative Services, where the council resides. Among other efforts, she traveled the state conducting training sessions for public employees, offering straight talk about what is required by the law.Today, the FOIA Council is headed by another talented and knowledgeable attorney, Alan Gernhardt, and continues to offer FOIA advice to state and local government employees, Virginia citizens and members of the press. Contrary to popular opinion, it is private citizens, rather than reporters, who most frequently contact the council for advice.So, yes, FOIA has been strengthened, but each year it is also assailed by those who would weaken it. Two major events have contributed to its troubles since the turn of the century. The first was 9/11, which resulted in a massive effort to protect sensitive information that might be helpful to terrorists. It was, and is, a noble effort, but like all such efforts, has been subject to abuse, and the exemptions to FOIA that have questionable national security value grows.The second negative event was COVID-19. The need for government officials to have flexibility in carrying on their legal mandates was real and critical, and virtually everyone — certainly responsible journalists included — recognized it. Once you ease the rules, though, there are always those who don’t want to reinstate them, and that’s probably FOIA’s biggest current threat.Thus, the battle continues, and it’s good once a year to reflect on its importance.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_216,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments about whether a small Oregon city can cite and prosecute homeless people for sleeping in public places when they have nowhere else to lay their heads.If the case reveals nothing else about the state of our country, it reveals this: We continue to fail the homeless people who live among us, and no single court ruling in the world is going to solve the underlying issues — the lack of affordable housing, widespread income equality, substance abuse and a shamefully insufficient social safety net.Grants Pass is a city of about 39,000 with a homeless population of about 600 and only enough shelter beds for 100; just one of the many American cities — especially in the West — that has been grappling with the issue of homelessness for years.San Francisco, Los Angeles and other municipalities filed friend-of-the court briefs supporting the law. Advocates for the homeless say cities want more power to sweep away encampments. Cities say they desperately want some clarification and guidance from the courts.In 2019, in a case known as Martin vs. Boise, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said cities cannot punish homeless people for sleeping on public property in the absence of an alternative. At the time, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.But it did agree to take up the Grants Pass case after the 9th Circuit ruled in 2022 that citing and arresting homeless people who have nowhere else to go is a violation of the 8th Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. If a city cannot offer shelter, the court said again, it should not be able to enforce criminal restrictions on public camping.Listen, I don’t think homeless encampments should be allowed to displace children from parks, as happened during the pandemic, nor that tents should be allowed to proliferate on beaches and city sidewalks, blocking rights of way and spilling detritus into the streets. That’s not safe or healthy for anyone. Cities obviously must have the right to regulate the use of public spaces. But to harass homeless people with endless ticketing and fines? It might not be unusual but it’s definitely cruel.For all the failings of Los Angeles, when COVID-era homeless encampments were cleared from Oceanfront Walk in Venice and along stretches of Venice Boulevard, intense efforts went into offering people spots in shelters, or hotel rooms, and a host of social services. Under the circumstances, that seemed as humane and balanced an approach as possible.But Grants Pass, which does not operate a single homeless shelter and relies instead on a Christian rescue mission that requires daily church attendance, passed a law allowing police to cite, fine and then arrest and even incarcerate repeat “offenders” for simply sleeping on public land, no matter that alternatives weren’t available.This is the very definition of criminalizing homelessness.Attorney Theane Evangelis, representing Grants Pass, disagreed: “These laws are about conduct for everyone,” she told the justices. “There is nothing in this law that criminalizes homelessness.”But, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out, the law really does only apply to homeless people. She noted that, according to testimony from the police chief and officers in Grants Pass, “If a stargazer wants to take a blanket or a sleeping bag out at night to watch the stars and falls asleep, you don’t arrest them. You don’t arrest babies who have blankets over them. You don’t arrest people who are sleeping on the beach, as I tend to do if I’ve been there a while. You only arrest people who don’t have another home.”It’s not as if human beings can control the need to sleep, just as they cannot control the need to breathe or to eat.“Sleeping is a biological necessity,” said Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court’s three liberals, who seemed hostile to the law. “Sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public.”“It seems both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts that constitute basic human needs,” said Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. then wondered: “So if someone is hungry and no one is giving him food, can you prosecute him if he breaks into a store to get something to eat?”Of course you can, said the attorney for the Biden administration, which didn’t side with either party but made a third-way argument about reasonable powers to ban homeless people from sleeping outdoors.What really leaves a sour taste about the Grants Pass ordinance is that we know it was not enacted to solve the very complex problem of homelessness. In 2013, during a community roundtable discussion about “current vagrancy problems,” Grants Pass City Council President Lily Morgan gave away the game: “The point,” she said, according to Oregon Public Radio, “is to make it uncomfortable enough for them in our city so they will want to move on down the road.” (Most of that city’s homeless people, according to court testimony, are from Grants Pass. This is unconscionable. But from the arguments, it’s not clear the court will say Grants Pass went too far and violated the “vagrants’” constitutional rights.“One point that was raised by Justices Kagan and Sotomayor in different ways is where people who have nowhere to go can be expected to go when cities ban them and simultaneously provide no resources for them,” Charley Willison, who teaches public health at Cornell and studies homelessness, told me in an email. “This gets at the crux of the issues many cities in the U.S. face.”One of the original plaintiffs in the case, Debra Blake, slept in parks in Grants Pass for years. She had been told repeatedly by local police to “move along,” according to court documents, but there was nowhere in the city she could legally sit or rest. She had been repeatedly awakened by police and told to move. She was ticketed, fined, charged with criminal trespass and at least once jailed overnight.At the time of her death in May 2021, at age 62, she owed $5,000 in unpaid fines.For the crime of sleeping while homeless.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

philinquirer_2024_21,"Moderating your online media diet may be a good addition to any health-related resolutions you’ve made this year.Winter is a time to indulge in comforts, including holiday dinners, cookies, and treats. The familiar recipes bring us comfort. Many of us are careful not to overindulge, or at least to correct for this delightful dalliance with a New Year’s resolution to cut back or moderate our diets.Most of us could benefit from taking the same approach to our social media diets by breaking free from our “For You” feeds.The “For You” feed, as it is known on TikTok, X, and YouTube Shorts, is an algorithm-derived, AI-curated feed of content. Platforms decide what content you see based on your past clicks, likes, scrolls, and other behaviors — regardless of whether you have chosen to follow the accounts creating the content.Much has been writtenabout thealgorithms’ abilityto suss out users’ interests and use them to curate increasingly narrow content streams — kittens, babies, Taylor Swift, etc. The algorithmswork well.“For You” is a boon for social media platforms, presenting users with an unending buffet of “comfort food” content. Platforms are motivated to keep users online, given that their revenue streams are driven by clicks on ads embedded into users’ feeds.In astudyI conducted alongside colleagues at Lehigh University, the University of Hong Kong, and Wuhan University, we studied users’ responses to advertisements in their social media feeds. We found that the “For You” feed showed a marked increase in click-through rates on ads — in other words, people are more likely to click on an ad they see in “For You” than when scanning their “Following” feed, made up of posts from accounts they have chosen to follow.Not only are users being lulled into remaining in the feed but they are also producing significantly more revenue for platforms by clicking on ads. Our study tied this change in user behavior to the users’ level of cognitive engagement.Users imbue the accounts in their “Following” feed with a higher degree of credibility and give them a higher degree of cognitive engagement when interacting with them.In this highly engaged state, we tend to be less amenable to ads. We find them distracting and try to avoid them.By contrast, in the “For You” feed, we consume large amounts of content from accounts with whom we may have no relationship, but that nonetheless align with our “comfort food” preferences.In this space, watching videos of babies cuddling puppies, we are less cognitively engaged, expend less effort, and settle for a hands-free driving experience through our feeds.Given some time in this cognitive space, ads begin to feel less intrusive, and we’re more likely to give them a click — 20% more likely, we found.One silver lining for those of us resolving to spend less money shopping: While we click far more ads in the “For You” feed, we’re far less likely to follow through and complete a purchase than if we click on an ad in our “Following” feed. This makes sense, as making a purchase requires a level of cognitive engagement that’s out of line with the “For You” vibe.That’s why advertisers are likely to approach the “For You” feed with caution. For companies aiming to become more recognizable to users, the click-through bonanza is beneficial. But companies trying to make money on social media must optimize their ad spending to ensure users are completing purchases.For users, the “For You” feed is akin to a holiday feast. It’s great to take a tour around the table and indulge in the favorites that hit you right in the sweet spot — coworker pranks, dancing kittens, and recipes for soothing winter soups. But proceed with caution.The long-term, isolating social effects of rabbit holes — where algorithms push people toward more extreme content, and filter bubbles, where we see only news that confirms our existing beliefs — arewell-documented.Additionally, individual users suffer from spending too much time in the low-cognition state induced by the “For You” feed. In this state, critical thinking skills diminish, and users are at risk of suffering long-term decreases in creativity and the ability to learn deeply.So in the first weeks of the new year, resolve to spend more time in your “Following” feed and less time scrolling “For You.” Moderating your online media diet may be a good addition to any health-related resolutions you’ve made this year.Beibei Dong is an associate professor of marketing in the Lehigh University College of Business.

minnpost_2024_166,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As we round out the final days of the 2024 legislative session, I encourage elected officials to reflect on how their actions will impact consumers, workers, and small businesses before hitting the green or red button or sign the final bill. This biennium, we’ve seen decades of policy passed and more bills introduced than ever.The Legislature has moved the needle on some significant issues but has also created substantial hurdles for small business owners. A common refrain we hear from the hospitality community across the state is that there is simply too much on their plate.Looking at the business outlook for the next few years, it is evident this legislative session will certainly impact how the hospitality industry operates. For example, the “junk fees” bill leaves more questions than answers on how employers in the hospitality industry can fill the gaps to pay for benefits or rightsize staff pay.While well-intentioned to protect consumers and customers, some of these new ideas will burden our members and our industry’s ability to continue to lift the economy locally and statewide. Minnesota’s hospitality industry supports more than 270,000 jobs and is responsible for over $18 billion in gross sales in the state.As an industry, we support price transparency — and while the industry can make improvements, the one-size-fits-all style of regulations does not work for our industry. Eliminating service charges entirely from hospitality will widen the gap the state has created between the front-of-house and the back-of-house pay. In many cases, service fees are a lifeline to help businesses keep essential kitchen staff who would otherwise seek opportunities elsewhere that pay more.Another example of policies that would impact the hospitality industry is the longstanding debate on rideshare. If lawmakers cannot strike an agreement that works for all parties, rideshare companies and drivers included, we risk losing our major rideshare providers. This will have serious consequences for our communities and economy.Many of our hospitality workers rely on rideshare to get to and from work at all hours of the day. It is crucial they have access to safe, reliable and affordable transportation that can operate in the same capacity as they have access to today. Additionally, our customers and visitors rely heavily on rideshare to move them about safely. As we prepare for thousands to come for notable events like the U.S. Gymnastics Trials at Target Center or the U.S. Amateur at Hazeltine, guests and businesses will depend on rideshares to and from their place of business.Thankfully, Minnesota lawmakers have the opportunity to provide the hospitality industry with some relief. This winter proved to be the warmest on record. Drought conditions paired with a lack of snow and ice yielded devastating results for many businesses across Minnesota who saw reduction of sales upwards to 30-40%.We’ve also recently seen the smokey haze and poor air quality from Canada creep back to Minnesota, something that could impact tourism and lead to another financially challenging year for our resorts and outdoor businesses. We encourage elected officials to support state-based relief funding for businesses impacted by the lack of snow and ice, especially as business owners wonder what their air quality and opportunities will look like this summer.In the coming days, when elected officials vote yes or no on final bills or sign bills into law, please remember that small businesses already have a lot of challenges on their plate. The business community is striving to provide the best experience for the customer and the worker, but if the weight of new policies and regulations collapses on us we will not be able to provide the experience for the customer or opportunity for the worker.We are hopeful that lawmakers support the thoughtful policies that promote transparency and fairness while allowing Minnesota’s hospitality sector to continue to thrive.Angie Whitcomb is the president and CEO of Hospitality Minnesota."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_8,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The Biden saga has roiled Democrats and gripped the Beltway, but Congress marches on doing what it does best: wasting other people’s money. Consider the ongoing stalemate involving the $1.5 trillion farm bill.House Republicans have passed an update to the 2018 farm bill that scales back food assistance programs while expanding subsidies to agricultural producers. Democrats control the Senate and prefer a version that does the opposite. The two sides are not close to a compromise, so they may put off action until after the election, The Washington Post reports. The current bill — already extended a year — is set to expire Sept. 30.Unfortunately, there’s precious little debate among either Democrats or Republicans about crafting an omnibus agriculture package with an eye toward eliminating waste, reining in handouts and promoting self-sufficiency. In fact, the farm bill is a microcosm of the congressional profligacy that has led to soaring deficits and a $34 trillion national debt that threatens the nation’s financial solvency.According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, the 2018 farm bill will run a half a trillion dollars over budget. Yet Congress appears poised to simply roll it over again rather than dig into the details on behalf of the American taxpayer.“Group after group of farm lobbyists instead has its handout,” the watchdog group reports, “asking Congress for a laundry list of ways to increase federal spending and government involvement in certain commodity crop markets.”In addition, Democrats insist on retaining looser — and costly — pandemic-era eligibility requirements for food assistance programs.A fiscally prudent approach would encourage both farmers and able-bodied welfare recipients to wean themselves off the taxpayer handouts.“Last year, U.S. net farm income set a new record,” Taxpayers for Common Sense notes. “Meanwhile, government payments to agriculture reached their highest level in 2020, making up nearly half of farm income. While some agricultural producers rely heavily on government subsidies each year, other farmers successfully grow their businesses with little to no subsidies at all.”Indeed, why do producers of corn, soybeans, wheat, rice or peanuts merit a government check when prices fall, while farmers dealing in fruits, most vegetables or livestock receive no such largess?Farm subsidies date to the 1930s, when collectivism and central planning dominated congressional and presidential policymaking. Republicans have, with varying degrees of success, made efforts in the past to curtail handouts to various farm interests. If they truly want to distinguish themselves from the free-spending Democrats, they should revive that approach as the current farm bill debate progresses.—Las Vegas Review-Journal"
minnpost_2024_131,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In 2023, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., made headlines by confronting Ticketmaster over its anti-consumer practices. Following her example, the U.S. Justice Department announced last month that it was initiating antitrust action against the live entertainment giant.While Klobuchar has successfully advocated for live music fans, it’s time for her and the other members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation to focus their attention on another middleman that’s negatively impacting consumers: pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs .PBMs operate as the Ticketmaster for prescription drugs. They neither produce medicines like drug manufacturers nor sell them as pharmacies do. Instead, they hold a middle spot in the prescription drug market. PBMs work alongside health insurance companies to exploit their position and are often profiting at the expense of patients and pharmacies.PBMs have been around for decades, but recent market consolidation and vertical integration have significantly expanded their influence. Currently, three main players dominate the PBM space, processing 80% of all commercial prescriptions. To make matters worse, each of these PBMs is part of a larger healthcare conglomerate, which includes a health insurer. For instance, both the PBM OptumRx and the health insurer UnitedHealthCare are under the same corporate parent company.Although PBMs will make claims that they save money by reducing the costs for prescription drugs, it isn’t surprising that these savings will mainly benefit the corporate parent, not the patient.In exchange for making a drug available on an insurer’s plan, PBMs will require drug manufacturers to offer discounts or rebates on every prescription filled. This means that insurance companies will rarely pay the list price for drugs while patients are billed through their co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses based on a drug’s full price. PBMs will also charge administrative or other fees to drug manufacturers based on the price of the drug.As a result, insurers have extra financial incentives to ensure their customers can only access higher-priced prescription drugs and the PBMs have the power to limit this access on insurance company plans. A2022 report from Xcendafound that two out of the three largest PBMs in the nation excluded generic insulins, which had prices listed at half the amount equivalent to brand product.Through my firsthand experience in helping those living with pain, I have witnessed unnecessary suffering that has been created through consolidated corporate power in our healthcare system. Profit driven motivation should not prevent patients from accessing prescribed affordable medications. It is time for Congress to step in to prevent PBMs from padding their profits at the expense of patients.The good news is that some members of Congress have begun targeting the PBM fees. Additionally, there is proposed federal legislation that would require PBMs and insurance companies to base patient expenses on the lower price that is negotiated with manufacturers. But for a change to occur considering the influence of corporate healthcare conglomerates, especially in an election year, it will require the vocal support from Minnesota’s elected leaders, beginning with Klobuchar and her Democratic colleague, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith.Without congressional action, issues with PBMs are likely to get worse. One drug manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, recently told the U.S. Senate that it only receives 25% of the list price of their drugs and data shows that between 2018 and 2022,PBM fees doubled to $7.6 billion. Today, more than half of every dollar spent on prescriptions goes to insurers, PBMs and other actors who have no role in innovation or finding cures.Last year, Klobuchar and others acted when the failures of the middleman in the entertainment business prevented Taylor Swift fans from buying concert tickets. A similar action is needed in the prescription drug market to ensure patients have access to affordable medication.Kelli Carlson, of Minneapolis, is a patient advocate and works as a finance consultant for Apparatus GBC."
philinquirer_2024_76,"Lawmakers in Harrisburg and Washington must resist an industry-driven push to undo a plan to toughen air quality standards.At the heart of the Clean Air Act lies a promise: Everyone in the United States, no matter where they live, deserves to breathe clean, healthy air. But while air pollution levels have dropped nationwide, the full measure of this promise has been denied to Black communities, including those in Philadelphia.Indeed,like other metropolitan areas, Black neighborhoods in Philadelphia are more likely to breathe toxic air pollutants, with particulate matter — commonly known as soot — being one of the deadliest. This insidious pollutant causes heart attacks, strokes, asthma, low birth weight, and infant mortality.Soot comes from tailpipes, smokestacks, and power plants. The placement of many ofthesepollution sources in Black neighborhoods is no accident. They are the product of decades of bad policy choiceslike redlining and so-called urban renewal, which devaluedBlack communities and surrounded them with major pollution sources.Unsurprisingly, Black Americans are 300% more likely to die from particulate matter pollution than their white counterparts. Equally unsurprisingly, North and West Philadelphia and the Lower Northeast — the city’s Black neighborhoods — are where childhood asthma rates remain the highest, according to the mostrecent “Health of the City” report.Finding solutions to Black and Hispanic communities’disproportionate exposureto particulate matter pollution has been elusive for the country, especially in Philadelphia, for years. But in an admirable move, the Biden administration made tackling air pollution inequality one of its top goals. And in February, after relentless advocacy from groups across the country, the Environmental Protection Agency strengthened the annual air quality standard for particulate matter.This new standard will force states to reduce particulate matter pollution from industrial and mobile sources, like cars and trucks — and in doing so, it will prevent some 800,000 asthma attacks and save more than 4,500 lives annually by the time the standard is fully implemented in 2032,according to the EPA.This reduction in mortality from particulate matter pollution isn’t simply an abstract number on a spreadsheet. Anyone who has lost a loved one to heart disease or respiratory illness can understand the grief and trauma of loving and losing someone to chronic illness.But despite the major lifesaving benefits of this new standard for particulate matter, polluting corporations and some conservative members of Congressdecry it as a “job killer.”In Pennsylvania, groups like the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry have argued that the new rules will, among other things, “diminish the prospects” for expanding industries in areas of the state that fail to meet the new standards. And in March of this year, national industry groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers filed a lawsuit to stop this new rule, arguing that “it would make the U.S. less competitive globally.”If it weren’t for the fact that some policymakers take these claims seriously, this familiar refrain would be easy to dismiss as a cliche. But some members of Congress are listening, and they are nowseeking to overturn the strengthened standard via the Congressional Review Act, a GOP invention of the Newt Gingrich-era that allows lawmakers to kill federal agency rules after they have been promulgated. With many of Pennsylvania’s own elected lawmakers likely to facesignificant lobbying by industrial polluters, they have failed to indicate how they will vote on this issue.Members of Congress from Pennsylvania, however, should be skeptical of trade groups and corporations’ slick language. The facts simply do not support the talking points that have been repeated ad nauseam since the EPA began regulating air pollution in the 1970s.Particulate matter standards have saved 230,000 lives and prevented more than 17 million lost workdays.For one, pollution limits aren’t “job killers.”On the contrary,studies have shownthat as emissions of major pollutants decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2018, the nation’s gross domestic product increased by 275%. Meanwhile, over the past five decades, particulate matter standards havesaved 230,000 lives and prevented more than 17 million lost workdaysfrom health-related air pollution effects.Given the stellar results of clean air safeguards, it is worrisome that many elected officials still want to listen to polluters’ mistaken rhetoric and subject their communities, and Black communities in particular, to the well-known harms air pollution poses. Especially because we are living at a time when the climate crisis — which is driven by emissions from tailpipes, smokestacks, and industrial power plants — fuels unprecedented wildfires that cause increasing pollution not just in the West, but in the Midwest and East now, too.Just last June, Philadelphiaexperienced its worst air quality daysince theEPA began collecting particulate matter pollution data, as wildfire smoke from Canada blanketed the Northeast of the continental U.S. And while the strengthened particulate matter standard doesn’t directly address wildfires, it improves overall air quality, offering relief on days marred by smoke-filled skies.A stronger standard means cleaner air, healthier communities, healthier kids, and healthier ecosystems. These are things we should expect our lawmakers in Harrisburg and Washington to uphold and defend. The health of our communities, and particularly Black communities, must not be sacrificed so that corporations can continue to pollute with impunity in the pursuit of profit.Marvin C.

If common sense doesn’t convince you of that, a new study should.In July, a National Bureau of Economic Research paper looked at the effects of a guaranteed income program run by two nonprofits. The initiative gave $1,000 a month for three years to 1,000 low-income individuals. As a control group, 2,000 individuals received $50 a month. It was “the largest unconditional cash transfer program evaluated by a randomized controlled trial” in the United States, according to researchersThe stakes of this experiment are significant. Those behind these guaranteed income programs are often looking to pave the way for a universal basic income. As the name implies, that scheme would give every person — or every low-income person — “free” money from the government. The theoretical justification is that a guaranteed income source would eliminate or alleviate poverty.Without pressing financial stress, this theory goes, people would be able to find better jobs or take risks, such as starting a business.It could, proponents argue, allow them to pursue their education, leading to better long-term career prospects.Or handing out free money might cause more people to work less.Unsurprisingly, option No. 2 carried the day.“We find total individual income excluding the transfers fell by about $1,500 per year relative to the control group, with these effects growing over the course of the study,” the researchers found.Further, “the program caused a 2.0 percentage point reduction in the extensive margin of labor supply and a 1.3-1.4 hours/week reduction in labor hours for participants. The estimates of the effects of cash on income and labor hours represent an approximately 4-5 percent decline relative to the control group mean.”It gets worse.The handout also caused partners and other adults in the home “to change their labor supply comparably to participants.” As a result, “for every one dollar received, total household income excluding the transfers fell by at least 21 cents.”But perhaps these individuals spent their extra time taking college classes or starting businesses. Nope.Recipients of the money used “the time gained through working less to increase leisure.” The researchers rejected “even small changes” in other categories such as child care, exercising, looking for work or self-improvement.These findings are a disaster for proponents of these plans. They also have ramifications for welfare and other safety net programs that too often trap people in perpetual poverty.A guaranteed universal basic income, no matter how alluring, is an awful idea.— Las Vegas Review-JournalRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.A 22-year-old Hilo man accused of a series of violent assaults on his 23-year-old girlfriend has been released from custody by a judge without posting cash bail.BOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

suffolknewsherald_2024_34,"Published 1:40 pm Wednesday, August 14, 2024ByStaff ReportsPropaganda is information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view. It’s communication primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented.Simply put, propaganda is spreading ideas, information, or rumors to help or harm an institution, a cause, or a person. It’s information, ideas, opinions, or images that give one part of an argument and are broadcast, published, like in a poster, etc., to influence people’s opinions. Its main goal is to shape people’s opinions so they think a particular way or convince them to support a specific cause or political candidate.The earliest known use or example of propaganda was the Behistun Inscription (c. 515 , which detailed King Darius the Great’s rise to the Persian throne.Scientists and academicians, philosophers and politicians, teachers and military officers have played a role, knowingly or unknowingly, in using propaganda for whatever reason, such as indoctrination, to advance causes or competitions among themselves and countries that aim to foster dominance or supremacy over the other.Every nation or country wants to be the first, on top of every category, the so-called “pioneer” in every field of endeavor, including sports or athletics. Thus, rivalry arises, and secrecy, indifference, suspicion, and surveillance come with that. There’s increased tension among nations and people as they continue their quest for recognition to be the top and the best in everything possible.Propaganda is still used today, with classic tactics such as name-calling or bandwagoning used to sway the audience towards or against a particular belief or idea. It plays a big part in world power, dominance, or domination, and supremacy, especially regarding prestige, popularity, economics, profitability, and superiority.Now, let’s talk about regulations. If no regulations are imposed on us, what will become of us, our community, society, our league of countries, and our world? Will there be peace and order, civility and decency of living? Or will there be chaos, turmoil, disorder, disunity, and destruction of the human race?Would we prefer not to have strict regulations because we view them as obstacles to our freedom and independence as a people, as a nation, independent and sovereign and not a subject or a vassal to any powerful country or so-called “superpower?”Do we see regulations as a threat to our freedom? Or do we see them as reminders that, as human beings, we’re not perfect? We have limitations, strengths and weaknesses, uniqueness and peculiarities, commonalities and differences.What do you think?

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_49,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Though Joe Biden’s debate performance last week was among the most painful things I’ve ever witnessed, it at least seemed to offer clarity. Suddenly, even many people who love this president realized that his campaign has become untenable.For years, loyal Democrats have been suppressing their private anxiety about Biden’s decline. In the debate’s miserable aftermath, there was finally space to acknowledge the obvious: Biden is too old for this. “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced,” James Baldwin wrote. The Democratic Party’s predicament is an awful one, but there was a cold, flinty relief in being forced to reckon with it.Since then, however, the Biden campaign has quickly moved to squash that reckoning, framing the divide in the Democratic Party as one between naive, hysterical outsiders and savvy, resolute insiders. Biden surrogates fanned out to discount the debate as a single “bad night.” A campaign email slammed those calling on the president to step aside as the “bed-wetting brigade,” and offered tips for responding to “your panicked aunt, your MAGA uncle, or some self-important podcasters,” an apparent reference to the former Obama officials who host “Pod Save America.” On Monday, I listened to a recording of a Zoom meeting with Biden’s national finance committee in which his deputy campaign manager, Quentin Fulks, accused the media of blowing the debate “out of proportion,” and his campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, compared it to Barack Obama’s lackluster performance against Mitt Romney in 2012.Some allies of the president have even suggested that Democrats learn from Donald Trump’s unswerving followers. “If Republicans are standing lock step” with the 78-year-old disgraced criminal Trump, said MSNBC host Jonathan Capehart, “then Democrats damn well should be standing lock step with their ethical and morally decent 81-year-old president.”I don’t blame people in the Biden camp for doing everything they can to tamp down an intraparty revolt. That’s their job, and I take some comfort that they’re doing it as well as is possible, since if Biden is the nominee, it’s imperative that he defeats Trump. But as long as there’s time to replace Biden, Democrats should not allow themselves to be bullied into fatalism and complacency.More than a setback, Biden’s showing at the debate was a revelation, confirming the worst fears of his doubters. Since then, several news reports have made it clear that the Biden we all saw onstage is familiar to those who see him behind the scenes. Axios reported that, according to presidential aides, Biden is alert and engaged from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but not necessarily outside those hours. The Wall Street Journal reported that European officials were worried about Biden’s “focus and stamina” even before the debate, “with some senior diplomats saying they had tracked a noticeable deterioration in the president’s faculties in meetings since last summer.” This is not a fixable problem.Since Thursday, there’s been talk among Democrats of a comeback. “When you get knocked down, you get back up,” Biden said at a boisterous rally Friday in North Carolina, words that are now part of a new campaign ad. The progressive Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, a Biden surrogate, likened the president to the fictional boxer Rocky Balboa. But as should be evident, aging cannot be overcome with grit.I’ve heard hopeful Democrats enthuse about how much better Biden was in North Carolina than he’d been the day before at the debate, but that’s silly: We all know Biden is usually fine reading from a teleprompter. The question is whether he can think and speak extemporaneously, a low bar for a president, and one that Biden can no longer be relied on to clear. After all, if Thursday were just a bad night, he could reassure doubters by doing a bunch of interviews and unscripted town halls. If he’s not doing that, it’s probably because his campaign doesn’t think he can pull it off.It should go without saying that Biden in any condition is preferable to Trump, especially after the sinister Supreme Court ruling Monday granting presidents immunity for their official acts, an act of civic desecration all but ensuring that a second-term Trump would rule as a vengeful dictator. The stakes of this election are existential; it’s a referendum on whether America will continue to be a liberal democracy. Everyone in the anti-Trump coalition is scared, which is why the argument over what to do about Biden is so heated.But asking Democrats to show MAGA-style devotion to their leader is a dubious strategy both ethically and practically. There is nothing to admire in the way Republicans have fallen in line behind Trump; it’s been a moral catastrophe and has left their party a hollow shell that keeps losing winnable races. To pretend that Trump is fit for public office, Republicans have had to give themselves over to corrosive denial. If Democrats spend the next four months — and then, in a best-case scenario, the next four years — telling people not to believe their own eyes about Biden, it will come at great cost to their credibility.Now, it would be worth it for the party to set its credibility on fire to keep Trump out of the White House. But even before Thursday, Biden was losing, and though it’s too early for much reliable post-debate polling, there are already ominous signs.In data guru Nate Silver’s polling averages, Trump leads by 2.4 percentage points, and Silver wrote that he’s seeing “the beginnings of a tangible effect from the debate on our forecast.” After the debate, the Democratic polling firm Data for Progress asked voters if they were more concerned about Biden’s age and health, or Trump’s criminal charges and threats to democracy. By 11 points, they said they were more worried about Biden. Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg surveyed a group of Democratic-leaning voters both before and after the debate, and found that Biden’s vote lead fell by 8 points. On the national finance committee call, campaign pollster Molly Murphy acknowledged that fallout from the debate is also showing up in internal polls.Some who believe that Democrats should stick with Biden argue that Vice President Kamala Harris would be even weaker, and that the idea of finding a new nominee at an open convention is an airy fantasy out of Aaron Sorkin’s “The West Wing.” But there’s nothing sober or serious about resigning ourselves to our current disastrous trajectory when viable alternatives still exist.The Data for Progress poll shows Harris performing exactly as well — or as poorly — against Trump as Biden does, losing to him by 3 points, and unlike Biden, she could campaign vigorously to change people’s minds. Asked who is “fit to run the country,” voters give Trump a 14-point lead over Biden, but only a 3-point lead over Harris. The poll also tests seven lesser-known Democrats against Trump, and shows each of them within 2 or 3 points of the ex-president, though with more voters undecided, suggesting these Democrats could have room to grow.Finding a Biden alternative would be risky and messy, and there’s no guarantee that it would work better than trying to put on a brave face and drag the current president across the finish line. But the Democratic Party’s leaders — the people, let’s remember, who got us into this mess — have no right to condescend to those trying to find a way out.James Clyburn, the influential Democratic representative from South Carolina, said Friday that Biden should “stay the course.” Given the course we’re on, that is ridiculous advice. If you’re in a car careening toward a cliff and can open a door, you should jump out.© 2024 The New York Times Company"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_168,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|78.872°Last month, for the first time since March 2021, the consumer price index— the indicator of inflation — fell below 3% annual increase, hitting 2.9% for July. Among other things, this makes it likelier that interest rates will be cut when the Federal Reserve’s governing board meets in September. We hope that the policymakers, in their joint wisdom, take this step to further stimulate the American economy.Inflation has overhung what is an on-paper sunny economy for the last year; even as unemployment has hit record lows and wages have risen, the sense of these gains being offset by higher prices has had a lot of the public in a gloom that only now seems to be lifting slowly.The more abstract notion of national unemployment numbers runs up against the far more visceral experience of seeing that the price of eggs is well above what you remember from a couple years ago. Yet the treatment for runaway inflation is an invasive one, a steady dosage of painful interest rate increases that have seen the rate climb more than 5% since March 2022.We feared as the rates ramped up that the shock therapy would prove overwhelming and plunge the economy into recession, and indeed a good number of economists all but talked about it as a given.Yet it didn’t happen, due in part to the easing of external factors like supply chain holdups and the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on global energy prices, and in part thanks to the Fed’s careful efforts, who knew just how much to pump rates up to avoid catastrophe in either direction.Now, though, is the time to ease off the pedal.Overheated inflation is worse but high rates have their own consequences. At a time when housing prices have already soared to the point that a home purchase is out of reach for working class families, few people are keen to lock themselves into a high-interest mortgage on an already-extravagant price tag.Would-be business owners are given pause by the idea of taking on loans that might leave them underwater, and not just the hyper-speculative tech sector that was the first to suffer as rates rose.With inflation seeming on a firmly downward trend, Fed Chair Jay Powell and the rest of the board should deeply consider the possibility of winding down some of the recent hikes. We’ve not reached the Fed’s 2% target rate and might not for a while, but Powell has already signaled an openness to rate cuts prior to that point.The odds that inflation would suddenly reverse off of gradual easing seem low, and the rewards numerous.The economy chugs along when people can access credit, which enables them to take more risks and make more significant purchases that they simply can’t do on cash alone. That Donald Trump has already warned Powell and the Fed against lowering rates ahead of the election shows even he knows that doing so would be a boon to the American public that would hurt his electoral chances.But maintaining a strong economy should transcend petty politics.

But it definitely should not be free.But that’s the assumption made by OpenAI when it claims that its use of all this data, much of which it acknowledges was subject to various copyrights, is fair use and did not require compensation to the original creators and owners of that knowledge and information.If you walked into a bookstore and stole not just some of the books, but all of the books, that would be a crime, right?That’s why many newspapers, including the Tribune, as well as authors and an array of digital publishers have filed lawsuits seeking to force OpenAI to pay for its exploitation of their work.Regular people aren’t allowed to make copies of a recent best-seller and resell it with a different cover, nor can a studio stream a competitor’s series just because it’s on the internet and it’s technically possible to copy it. They might be able to license that material, if the owner allows it, and they can certainly buy copies, but even buying a copy doesn’t give the purchaser the right to reproduce and redistribute such works.There’s a fundamental issue of ownership in play here.For decades, newspapers like this one have been independent entities. They have written the obituaries of local luminaries, chronicled crimes committed and followed fights over public works. In most every U.S. city, they’ve accumulated a great storehouse of knowledge, day by day.The theft of that journalism to create new products clearly intended to supplant news publishers further undermines the economy for news at a time when fair and balanced reporting and a shared set of facts is more critical than ever before.Weakening news publishers also has a collateral effect on democracy as it not only siphons off publisher revenue, but it also damages publishers’ reputations by attributing bogus information to credible publications.AI “hallucinations” occur when an AI app provides false information in response to a user’s question.The rise of artificial intelligence may be inevitable but that does not mean that the originators of the content should not expect adequate compensation.OpenAI and its primary backer, Microsoft, pay their engineers to write their code and certainly recognize the value of that code. In fact, a recent valuation for OpenAI was $90 billion.Surely all the knowledge and information required to train their apps — to develop the code, as it were — has value.That value must be recognized and these companies must be held accountable.—Chicago Tribune/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

Lawmakers are right now in the process of undermining the revolutionary Measure 110 that Oregon passed in 2020, which decriminalized possession of small amounts of drugs and allocated funding for recovery. In this act the majority of Oregonians stated their intent to help those addicted to hard drugs and the acknowledgement that something in the long-standing “war on drugs” was failing at a basic level. This was a courageous act of compassion we now stand to lose without even a public vote. Chief complaints driving re-criminalization are these: that Measure 110 has increased the rate of overdose in Oregon, and that criminal penalties are necessary to prevent public drug use. To the first charge: There is simply no meaningful evidence that Measure 110 has increased the rate of overdoses in Oregon. Not when one considers the recent arrival of fentanyl to Oregon, the crippling effects of the pandemic, or the fact that overdoses have been on the rise since long before 2020. If Oregon wants to prevent overdoses, we need to put more funding into treatment programs, and allow those programs more time to take effect. Addiction is complex, tied in with social and economic oppression as much as with brain chemistry; recovery is the work of a lifetime. Why would we expect an entire state to turn this crisis around barely a year after Measure 110 funding has become available? To the second charge, consider: Most of the people using drugs in public spaces are those with no better alternatives. No one chooses to openly show their addiction in order to hurt or offend fellow Oregonians. Criminalizing drug use is another in a long series of laws meant to criminalize poverty and homelessness. If Oregon doesn’t want to witness addiction and overdose in public spaces, then we first need to address poverty and homelessness. A misdemeanor charge will not cure addiction any more than a badge and gun will reverse an overdose. What we need is to support people in recovery with shelters and low-barrier housing. And a jail cell doesn’t count. The “war on drugs” has failed, because it was never a war on drugs; it has always been a war on people. We are the first state in the nation to fully recognize this and attempt a new approach on the level of Measure 110. If we really care about recovery, our tools will be housing and medicine. The vote is out of our hands but not beyond the reach of our voices: please, by any means possible, urge your lawmakers to protect decriminalization."
eugeneweekly_2024_4,"We ve got issues. To those who read this commentary, allow me to briefly describe my background and the purpose of my offering. It is designed to inform those interested in the fate of our democratic system of government to have a better grasp of the impacts that the Heritage Project 2025 Plan will have if it is successfully implemented should Donald Trump be voted into a second term as president. The 2025 plan is essentially a blueprint for a complete makeover of our system of government, from top to bottom, to fulfill an ultra right wish list that mirrors autocratic governance models, not the constitutional model that has served the people for over 200 years. I am addressing that portion of the Project 2025 Plan, which seeks to overhaul the United States Department of Justice (DOJ . My background for this task includes a career of 51 years in our nation’s justice system — 21 years as an assistant U.S. attorney. In part, I served as the chief of the Criminal Division in the Southern District of California and 10 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in the District of Oregon. From that role, I was appointed to the bench as a judge where I served for approximately 30 years before retiring. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. This is the experience I bring to the analysis of the 2025 plan to dissolve and reconstruct the DOJ in which I proudly served during my career. Before I dive into that plan, there is a symbol I wish to bring to the attention of the readers — Lady Justice. She is blindfolded to symbolize that justice is unbiased and is not influenced by appearance or status. She holds scales to represent the impartiality of court decisions, and a sword to symbolize the power of justice. That symbol should be kept in mind as we travel through the 2025 Project’s vision under a Trump administration. This section of Project 2025 is authored by an attorney who is employed a conservative action group founded by former president Trump and who served in the DOJ during the first term of Trump’s presidency. What is important to know about the author is that he played key roles in the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” family separation, which ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA . Pursuant to that family separation policy, children were separated from their parents and many were not reunited with their families as there were no adequate plans to keep track of them or to ever return them to their parents. Many were deported. Hundreds are still unaccounted for. The United Nations defines this policy as a form of genocide. The separation policy, also described as cultural genocide, raises red flags on the resume of someone engaged in improving the role of the DOJ in upholding and strengthening its mission to serve the rule of law which is paramount to our constitutional democracy and the rights of people under our legal system. For those who may question the status of those families entering our side of the border illegally, if they are arrested and detained by our border patrol or immigration officers, they still have certain basic rights which must not be violated under our legal system. For example, when I was a prosecutor in the border area I tried a case where a federal protective officer stationed at the border raped and murdered a woman who was apprehended after she illegally crossed into our side of the border. Notwithstanding her illegal status, she had the right to life itself and the right not to be assaulted. Similarly, parents and their children have the rights to not have their family separated and the children dispersed to fend for themselves or transported and even deported to unknown destinations. One of the recommendations found in the 2025 Project is that upon the very day of his inauguration, Trump should terminate all of the attorneys in the DOJ and decide who, if any, he should reappoint. Such would seemingly hinge on pledging loyalty to Trump, rather than the usual oath to defend the Constitution. Coupled with that is the requirement that DOJ attorneys make prosecution and other legal decisions consistent with the agenda of the new Trump administration. In essence, this would eviscerate the rule of law, substituting the rule of autocracy, where the will of the president would control the administration of justice. Such a policy is frightening in the hands of someone who has already claimed he would have immunity even for murdering his political opponents as president. Recall the symbol of Lady Justice. She will be shattered. We will no longer live under that system. The blinders will be gone, the scales weighted. Status, wealth, power, race and influence will all be in play. The sword will not be in the hand of justice, but in the hand of the individual who now wields it as he pleases. Can you even imagine the separation policy befalling your family? Or having your political beliefs being considered by prosecutors whose very jobs are dependent on pleasing the agenda of the newly christened administrator of justice who orders your arrest and trial? Perhaps you criticize the administration — are you aware that Viktor Orban, the dictator of Hungary, has made it a crime to criticize his administration? Are you also aware that Trump has approvingly cited Orban, as well as the dictator Vldadimir Putin, for condemning American democracy.? This is the context of the 2025 Project’s recommendations for its reconstruction of the DOJ. As remarkable and troubling are these proposals, the plan goes even more extreme by recommending legal action against local state officials such as district attorneys who do not adequately prosecute criminal offenses (in the view of the administration in their jurisdictions. This is also coupled with a recommended policy of enforcing the death penalty. Although it’s not clear where the sweep of the administration’s policies over state and local prosecutions and punishment begins or ends, what the legal actions would be, or the basis of federal jurisdiction over state and local prosecution decisions within their statutory framework and policies, such are among the goals of the Project. These proposals amount to a shattering of our national system of justice. Where it would end is anyone’s guess. I do not wish to belabor the DOJ criticisms voiced by the Heritage Foundation in its Project. The reality is that the department is staffed and overseen by dedicated attorneys committed to ethical and professional standards binding on their conduct, as are their superiors. Similarly, investigators within the department’s purview are trained and sworn to exercise their authority in the same manner pursuant to the guidance of our Constitution. I have spent 51 years of my career in our country’s justice system and can vouch for the integrity and manner in which that solemn duty has been exercised. We are a nation of law, and we adhere to the rule of law.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_257,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°If you watched as much of the Republican National Convention as I did, you must have been impressed by the energy, unity and commitment of the speakers and delegates. One could sense the momentum building.And if the convention’s enthusiasm for former President Donald Trump is a reliable reflection of the wishes of millions of American voters, it suggests the very credible possibility that Trump could be reelected to the presidency in November.Things changed when President Joe Biden dropped out, but I suspect that the substitution of Kamala Harris did little to dampen the commitment of millions of Americans to see Donald Trump back in the White House.A Trump win is a disconcerting prospect for millions of Americans, for various reasons.For example, many are worried about the rise of autocracy around the world and are concerned that the reelection of Trump will encourage autocrats. In fact, Trump gave Viktor Orban, the anti-democratic prime minister of Hungary, a favorable mention during his nomination acceptance speech at the RNC, calling him a “tough guy.”Domestically, other issues that Americans care about will fare poorly under a second Trump presidency: Abortion. Climate change mitigation. Sensible gun laws. If Trump is reelected, the future of these issues and many others will veer in ways that most Americans don’t want.But here’s the thing about a Trump victory: Even though many Americans may not like the resulting policies and administrative actions, a win by Trump is still in the realm of normal American politics as it reflects the choices voters make at the ballot box.But what if Trump loses? What happens to all of the energy and commitment we witnessed at the Republican convention? And should we be worried about it?Any consideration of these questions has to begin with this stipulation: Under no circumstances will Donald Trump concede that he lost the election, whether the margin is a little or a landslide.Even before voting began in 2016, Trump contended that the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged. When he lost in 2020, he claimed that the election was stolen from him. He hasn’t conceded the last election; there’s no reason to think that he’ll concede this one.Of course, in 2020 Trump was president and he had certain powers at his disposal that he no longer has. Still, it’s dangerous to downplay the passion and commitment on display at the Republican convention by thousands of Trump supporters, who are representative of millions more nationwide. Just as Trump will not accept a loss, neither will they.What does it mean, in a republic, if millions refuse to accept the results of an election, especially if a significant number of them are well-armed and have a passionate, cult-like commitment to a powerful personality? How do we prepare for their reaction to a Trump loss?Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860 was the catalyst that caused southern states to begin to secede from the union. Armed rebellion was imminent and threats to Lincoln’s life were credible. Security was in the hands of the Commanding General of the United States Army, Winfield Scott, a grizzled veteran of the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War and the Indian wars.But Scott was born in Virginia, and Lincoln felt compelled to confirm his loyalty and commitment to the transfer of power after a disputed election. Scott replied: “If necessary I shall plant cannon at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and if any of the Maryland or Virginia gentlemen who have become so threatening and troublesome show their heads or even venture to raise a finger, I shall blow them to hell.”Is this a fanciful, alarmist overreaction in our current situation? Maybe. But remember how shocked we were by Jan. 6, which was a systematically orchestrated attempt to nullify an election by force. We must be as prepared to protect the republic as General Scott was in 1860. To be any less prepared for the worst possibilities would be dangerously naïve.(John M.

philinquirer_2024_60,"Despite everything stacked against them, Philly teachers show up for the kids, again and again, with a smile and a sense of humor.Abbott Elementary, the hilarious show that highlights the day-to-daystrugglesand triumphs ofteaching in Philadelphia, kicks off Season Three on Wednesday. Like thousands of other fans, I am eagerlyawaiting its return.Although Willard R. Abbott Elementary is a fictional school, there is a lot of truth in its portrayal.From 2010 to 2015, I was employed as an instructional coach for a literacy nonprofit, traveling to elementary schools across Philadelphia. Many neighborhoods were riddled with drugs, crime, and poverty, likeKensington, where dealers hid their goods in the wheel wells of parked cars.“This is exactly what it looks like,” I told my teenage children as we watched the pilot together. The set was virtually identical to what I remembered: the blue and khaki uniforms, the large metal entrance doors, the murals painted outside. Even the characters reminded me of educators I had known. Ms. K, the bubbly rookie, was like Janine, played by Quinta Brunson (who recently won an Emmy for best comedy actress, thesecond Black actress ever to receive the award, and the first in 43 years . Ms. C, the streetwise, South Philly native I met who liked Babar books, drew parallels to Melissa Schemmenti.My role was to support the teachers with literacy instruction, modeling and planning lessons, observing, and providing feedback. Nervous, I wondered if they’d welcome me into their classrooms. Would my coaching really make a difference?My first assignment was with Ms. J, a veteran third-grade teacher, who kept her students in a perfect “single file” line, likeBarbara Howard. As I sat in a conference room waiting for her to arrive, I silently rehearsed my coaching lingo: “I am here to support, not evaluate.” “Let’s partner together to help the students succeed …”Ms. J was petite, well-dressed, and at least 10 years older than me. This only added to my insecurity, as she clearly had more years of experience. But as soon as we started talking, we clicked instantly.“I was so nervous before that my palms were sweating,” she confessed later. “But I didn’t need to be,” she added, smiling. “I’m excited to learn something new.”Over five years, I worked in dozens of buildings across Philly, with multiple teachers. And the majority of them did welcome me. Like Ms. J, they hoped to “learn something new,” or at least refine their instruction. They were even willing to relinquish their precious planning time to meet with me, all in the interest of helping their students.In many schools, the staffscrambled to get what they needed. In one classroom, we rifled through dusty, falling-apart textbooks, many with ancient copyright dates. In another, we sorted through decades of outdated materials, filling the rolling gray trash cans to the brim.Just like onAbbott, these teachers faced less-than-desirable conditions: old carpets (or none at all , peeling paint, dingy bathrooms, flickering lightbulbs. Maybe that’s why I loved the episode where Melissa found a creative (albeit illegal method to procure classroom rugs: “I’ve got a guy for that.”In reality, Philly teachers deal with similar situations all the time. Themajority of the buildings were built prior to 1978, and at least five schoolsclosed due to asbestos in 2023. The district reimburses teachers $200 per year to stock their classrooms, yet educatorsstill lack supplies. I have heard of teachers forking over upwards of $500 to cover their needs.Perhaps what’s most similar between the Philly teachers and the ones on the show is that they all care deeply about their students. Despite everything stacked against them, they show up for the kids, again and again, with a smile and a sense of humor.As Barbara states inSeason 2, Episode 20: “But if you come back here tomorrow, ready to do your job, having not given up on yourself or that student … well, that is not a failure. Sometimes, that’s what success looks like.”Lucky for us, Janine and the rest of the cast will be back.Lisa Mazinas is an elementary reading specialist who writes from Ardmore. Her work has also appeared in Shondaland, HuffPost, Education Week, the Miami Herald, and elsewhere."
minnpost_2024_127,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Imagine casting a line out into the Mississippi River, only to reel in a thrashing silver carp — a large invasive fish that can leap 10 feet out of the water when startled. This undesirable catch is no longer a hypothetical situation for some Minnesotans. Invasive species of carp (including common, silver, bighead, black, and grass carp are rapidly making their way up the Mississippi River, with the largest single capture of invasive carp to date (403 fish were caught by the Minnesota DNR last fall.Invasive carp were first introduced to the U.S. in the 1970s to manage plant growth in aquaculture and canals. However, with no natural predators, they outcompete other fish for food and habitat, as well as decrease ecosystem diversity, water quality, and recreational opportunities of infested waters. For example, wild rice (Manoominin Ojibwe , which is a vital part of Minnesota’s Native American culture and culinary heritage, is particularly vulnerable to the carp’s destructive feeding habits.Because of their resilient nature, invasive carp are able to infest new bodies of water with ease by jumping over barriers and overtaking new water bodies when they become temporarily connected during spring floods. Additionally, the Mississippi River is vital for hydropower generation, providing energy for many people across the country. However, carp migration can be facilitated by the operation of dams for boat passage, many of which are carrying millions of tons of grain (corn, soy, and wheat annually. This creates a precarious situation: balancing energy and agricultural needs with the risk of further carp intrusion. Humans also play a role in the spread of carp populations if young carp are released as live bait to uninfested waters.Not only do they spread easily from one body of water to another, but invasive carp lay anywhere between 1-10 million eggs per year, making them a fierce competitor to native fish species and ecosystem services. According to an article by theNational Park Service, experts are concerned that if these fish reach the Great Lakes, they may harm the $7 billion/year fishing industry, as well as the resort and sport fishing industries by reducing native fish populations. It is well known among scientists in the field that eradicating an established population of invasive carp is an extremely difficult task (if not impossible and can be quite expensive.We can’t completely stop the river from flooding, nor can we stop barges and their hauls from transporting millions of tons of freight via the Mississippi’s lock and dams each year. So what can be done to keep carp from spreading further up the Mississippi?Past funding to study and manage the upstream migration of invasive carp on the Mississippi River in Minnesota began only 12 years ago and has been carried out by key actors, such as the Minnesota DNR, Wisconsin DNR, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, University of Minnesota and commercial fishers.Most recently, the Minnesota DNR received a much-needed boost in 2023 with a $1.7 million allocation for invasive carp prevention and management. This funding will be used to study dam operations to create barriers, design deterrents for key locations like Lock and Dam 5, and expand efforts to tag and remove carp through targeted commercial fishing.These are steps in the right direction, but putting those funds to work is key. Effective carp deterrent programs will require continued public support for funding research, driving decisive action, and public education.This is where you come in. Show your support by contacting your representatives and senators and urge them to prioritize funding for invasive carp prevention and management. For example, advocating for tighter regulations on aquatic invasive species (AIS , while the inconvenience may be unpopular among some boaters and anglers, outweighs long-term economic and ecological costs of inaction. Do your part to prevent the spread of AIS by following cleaning protocols for your boat and fishing gear, as this is a powerful preventative measure we can take to help slow the spread of invasive carp.Stay engaged by educating yourself and others about the threats that invasive carp pose to water ecosystems and water quality, and the economic threats carp pose to commercial fishing, recreation, and tourism. Last, learn to identify invasive species of carp and report any sightings to the DNR atinvasivecarp.dnr@state.mn.us .Invasive carp traveling up the Mississippi are part of many complex environmental, economic, and energy related systems. They have shown that they have the capacity to wreak havoc on not just the environment, but on our economy, culture, and recreation. By working together, we can ensure that Minnesota’s waters remain free of new carp invasions and an enjoyable resource for all.Shauna Capron is in the graduate program in Water Resources Science at the University of Minnesota."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_191,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Homeless detentionplan perfectly legalHomeless detentionplan perfectly legalSo, earlier this year, the Tribune Herald printed my letter to the editor called an “Answer for the downtown homeless.”The answer is called the Homeless Intervention Detention Program.Eventually, since there is no other course of action, the homeless population will commit enough misdemeanors that they will be sent to jail.The National Institute of Mental Health (2020 determined that one-third of all male inmates and two-thirds of all female inmates are severely mentally ill. So, if the homeless are statistically predisposed to incarceration, an intervention detention program might just make a both economic and social sense.I will disclose that I’ve been a member of the ACLU for over the past 30 years, but I consider them to be counterproductive by placing rights over results.One of my best friends is an attorney graduated from a prestigious law school. The Homeless Intervention Detention Program is absolutely legal. It’s covered specifically under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, and if that isn’t enough, you can check a ruling that a local school board can make 40 hours of community service mandatory for graduation, and even that is not illegal (Immediato vs. Rye Neck School District .The biggest problem is public health. The homeless are disease vectors. Sorry if that is difficult to accept, but it is true. It is also an effective strategy. It is a way to frame the problem which will allow programs like this to succeed.Little villages of tiny homes don’t work because you can’t find anyone to manage them. This is because mental health issues between the clients (in very close quarters turn the entire village into a zoo.If you haven’t noticed, the first wave of tiny homes on Hawaii Island were immediately distributed to government agencies rather than reestablished. It’s not even clear if a full-time (24-hour police officer would solve that problem. We can do much better.So, I got a lot of pushback with a thousand reasons why nothing can be done. That included several self-righteous editorials, one of which attacked me personally. I can accept that. We can do much better.That friend of mine, who is an attorney, said just take a look at the 13th Amendment. Everything in Homeless Intervention Detention Program can be done. By law.I make no apologies for requiring the homeless for at least for 90 days to have personal hygiene, a clean place to sleep, nutritious food, mental health counseling, medication and a chance to return to their families.Maybe that 90-day intervention can change their lives, or send them on a path where social services can accomplish good things. Repeat if necessary.The boot camp center could be the “safe space” proposed by our governor.The public health and safety of all our families justifies a compassionate course of action. We can do much better.So, take a look, and read the letter twice. And then consider what you can do in your current position to make a Hawaii Island a better place — for both the homeless and your family.Michael MamczarzKurtistownPTA open housewas a ‘great event’Mahalo to the men and women of the U.S. military who hosted the public for the Pohakuloa Training Area open house (on April 25 .Their professionalism and knowledge of their specific areas of expertise was outstanding.

minnpost_2024_170,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Last year, the Minnesota Legislature took a bold step toward reducing the state’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG from transportation by passing agroundbreaking law. The statute requires major highway capacity expansion projects to be assessed for their impact on GHG emissions and vehicle miles traveled (VMT . Projects failing to conform to reduction targets would need to implement mitigation measures or be stopped.To guide the implementation of this complex legislation, the law established theGreenhouse Gas Emissions Impact Mitigation Working Group. Over seven months, this diverse group of transportation professionals and stakeholders delved into the challenges and opportunities of assessing and mitigating transportation emissions. Their efforts culminated in a comprehensive report to the Legislature, published in February, that offers insights and recommendations that could serve as a roadmap for other states pursuing similar goals.Key takeaways from the working group include:The group brought together representatives from state and local agencies, metropolitan planning organizations, and advocacy groups (such as MoveMinnesota . This diverse expertise was needed for understanding the implications of the law across different contexts and crafting recommendations that balanced various needs and constraints.To effectively reduce emissions, the group recognized the need for consistent modeling tools, planning procedures and mitigation strategies across the state. They proposed a phased “maturity model” for implementation, allowing regions to start with existing capabilities while building toward a more integrated, multimodal approach over time.Assessing emissions impacts and implementing mitigations will require significant capacity building at all levels of government. The group recommended dedicated funding for modeling improvements, mitigation efforts, and incentives for regional plans that align with state emissions goals.While emphasizing consistency, the group also acknowledged the need for flexibility to account for local contexts and emerging strategies. They suggested allowing additional mitigation categories to be approved by a technical oversight committee, ensuring a balance of adaptability and accountability.The group envisioned a long-term shift toward comprehensive, multimodal transportation planning that fully integrates emissions reduction, VMT reduction, and land use considerations. They recognized this would require changes not only in technical processes but also in institutional relationships and funding structures.Despite the group’s progress, significant difficulties lie ahead. Balancing emissions reduction with other priorities like safety, securing buy-in from local governments, and managing technical complexities will require ongoing collaboration and refinement. A few contentious points that came up during the greenhouse gas mitigation working group meetings:Minnesota’s experience offers valuable lessons for other states grappling with transportation emissions. By bringing diverse stakeholders to the table, establishing a clear vision and committing to building long-term capacity, states can develop frameworks for assessing and mitigating the climate impacts of highway projects.Mauricio Leon Mendez, the carbon reduction manager at Hennepin County, is pursuing a Ph.D. at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. His research explores the interplay between urban planning, transportation and climate policy."
philinquirer_2024_37,"In the past year, I ve learned that Philadelphia is better behind handlebars. I’ve started to fall in love with this city in an entirely new way.I loved my car.It was a silver 2004 Subaru Forester, and it was once my home for three months when I traveled across the country. Through a bug-splattered windshield, I saw some of the most beautiful sights our nation has to offer, from the Smoky Mountains to Yosemite and back.It was great until it wasn’t. I eventually grew sick of relying so much on a heavy-duty machine that drained my wallet, especially for short city trips. So last year, I made a drastic change:I sold it.Now, I get around Philadelphia on my trusty Trek bicycle, and I’ve started to fall in love with this city in an entirely new way.For one, I’ve been able to observe and interact with the people of Philly in a way I never could in my car. From behind my handlebars, I’ve witnessed countless instances of Philadelphians trusting, helping, forgiving, and loving their fellow neighbors and nearby strangers. The comfy confines of a car cannot compare to the warmth of these subtle interactions, like when an old man and a fussy baby make eye contact and share a smile, or when a complete stranger compliments your mustache as you ride by. There’s a genuine human connection that occurs when a road dispute is settled with a verbal apology instead of a facelessbeeeepfrom behind the wheel.When we move about our city on bike or foot, we’re forced to humanize the people we’d otherwise avoid behind the protective armor of a vehicle.Author andPennsylvania native Jane Jacobstouched on this in her 1961 book,The Death and Life of Great American Cities: “The trust of a city street is formed over time from many, many little public sidewalk contacts,” she wrote, even citing the “ballet” of Rittenhouse Square as a hot spot for these little contacts. “Most of it is ostensibly utterly trivialbut the sum is not trivial at all. The sum of such casual, public contact at a local level … is a feeling for the public identity of people, a web of public respect and trust, and a resource in time of personal or neighborhood need.”Rolling around Philly on my bike, I notice the “little public sidewalk contacts” Jacobs references are on full display. The sum of these contacts is unquantifiable, as she suggests, but it’s the purest distillation of the true love that courses through this city daily.Unfortunately, this inherent beauty that exists in Philadelphia isinvisible to most of its residents, simply because our default mode of movement is a personal car.» READ MORE:For my low-income family, biking is not recreation. ‘It’s survival.’In a city peppered with parking lots, auto body shops, and towing companies, it’s no surprisecar culture is deeply woven into the fabric of Philadelphia’s communal identity. As a result, local drivers have long displayed a sense of entitlement to the public right-of-way, so much so thatA&E’s hit showParking Warswas launched in 2008 to document spats between drivers and the Philadelphia Parking Authority.While these televised disputes became somewhat of a “claim to fame” for Philly, they underscored a deeper issue around car dependency and unsavory driver behaviors that have continued to worsen over the years. Philly’s biggest roadway challenges today includereckless driving, heavy congestion, androad rage, all of which are rooted in a sense of entitlement that inherently creates a divide between drivers and pedestrians or cyclists.Simply put, our cars are preventing us from experiencing the organic interpersonal interactions that allow us to feel included, connected, and safe in our city.To reclaim our reputation as a community of brotherhood and love, we need to break out of our isolating, gas-guzzling vehicles and invest in the people-friendly infrastructure that was originally intended for Philadelphia’s streets.Take our famed Art Museum, for example. The popular attraction sits at the top of Benjamin Franklin Parkway, whichwas designed in 1907to connect Philadelphia’s denser urban neighborhoods with the nature of Fairmount Park,drawing inspiration from Paris’ famously pedestrian-friendly Champs-Élysées. However, the last century has seen the Parkway overrun with car traffic that pours into Eakins Oval and circles the foot of the museum like a moat, forcing hundreds of daily museum visitors toplayFroggerwith local drivers.These stressful interactions between drivers and pedestrians illustrate the negative impact car culture has on how we connect with our communities. And while several efforts to improve city roadways have been introduced in recent years, real change won’t happen until our daily habits change — when we swap our car keys for sneakers and become active participants in our community instead of passive observers.Maybe if we turned the volume down on cars and up on human interactions, our lived environment and lifestyles would reflect our heightened regard for humanity.Thankfully, organizations like theBicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphiaand projects likeReimagine the Benjamin Franklin Parkwayare already working hard to make our city more human-centric. And while it may take some time to dismantle the deep car culture we’ve established, significant change starts with us as individuals, today.So the next time you head out the door, strap on your bike helmet or grab a SEPTA Key card instead of your car keys.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_200,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Opill was recently recognized as the first FDA-approved over-the-counter daily birth control pill. While this is a step forward for contraceptive access, how can we make sure that young people — who are often navigating their sexual health for the first time and may not be well-informed on safe sex practices — know about the pill and how to obtain it?Birth control pills aren’t exclusively used to prevent pregnancy. They can be prescribed for a variety of reasons, including excessively heavy or painful periods, polycystic ovary syndrome and hormonal acne.Even still, the stigma around birth control and its association with being sexually active often makes it an uncomfortable topic for adolescents to bring up to their parents or doctor. As a result, many teenagers engage in sexual activity without adequate protection, leading to unintended consequences such as pregnancy. Teen pregnancy has been linked to significant mental health issues and suicides, struggles with continuing education or securing employment, and premature mortality.Research has shown that young people face many barriers to accessing birth control, such as trouble accessing a clinic, renewing pill prescriptions or getting an appointment. Opill has the potential to eliminate some of these barriers, as it does not require a physician’s prescription. Currently, Opill can be purchased online or in local pharmacies across the country.Opill’s availability, however, does not guarantee its usage. One solution to make sure that young people are aware of over-the-counter birth control is to bring it up in sex education in schools.Currently, 39 states and the District of Columbia mandate some form of sex and/or HIV education in schools. Opill and over-the-counter birth control access could easily be incorporated into the conversations about safe sex. Students who undergo comprehensive sex education are significantly less likely to become pregnant than those who receive abstinence-only or no formal sex education.How can we make sure that teenagers are making the right decision to take birth control if they are not seeing a doctor for it? Sex education can help with this, too. Health educators could introduce Opill as an option and equip students with the knowledge of its proper usage and potential side effects. The aim here is to empower students to make choices that best contribute toward their overall health and well-being.There are some fundamental differences between Opill and prescription birth control that educators should explain to students. Opill is a progestin-only pill, and birth control pills of this category are slightly less effective than pills that contain both progestin and estrogen. And while most insurance plans cover birth control via prescription, Opill may or may not be covered by an individual’s insurance plan.Leslie Kantor, a professor at Rutgers Global Health Institute, explains that one of the challenges of teaching about Opill is that “there are different laws around the country about what sex education is supposed to cover, and only 13 states currently require expansive coverage of contraceptives.”In right-leaning states, conservative censorship has omitted many vital aspects of sex education that should be included in comprehensive sex education. Republican opposition to birth control would make it difficult to even talk about Opill in many schools in certain states.—Progressive PerspectivesA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_129,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The former Western allies will shortly begin commemorating the 80th anniversary of their greatest World War II achievement, the June 6 landings in Normandy, forever famed as D-Day.The pomp and circumstance of the grand events to be attended by President Joe Biden and other national leaders are entirely justified by the magnitude of that endeavor. More than 40 years ago, while writing a book about the campaign, I had the privilege of meeting many veterans — American, British, Canadian, Polish, French, German.I remember in particular an exuberant New Yorker, a former shipping clerk named Lindley Higgins, who sought to strip the story of an excess of romance: “We were a singularly callous and unfeeling group of young men.” Aged 19, in the weeks beforehand, he found it hard to grasp the reality of what was coming: “Me, Lindley Higgins, from Riverdale in the Bronx, was about to invade France. It was a problem that my mind, in its then state of maturity, couldn’t possibly cope with.”And so it was for a vast number of the 130,000 men who landed from the wind-whipped sea, plus 20,000 who dropped from the air, on that cloudy day. On the evening of June 5th, the colonel of a parachute battalion about to emplane told his men: “We are history.” But few of those whom he addressed could think beyond that night, and the chances of their own survival. British infantryman Wilf Todd wrote to his wife of the pre-dawn hours of June 6: “I prayed that night as I have never prayed in my life…My heart was beating like a triphammer.”When I look back as a historian, like most of my peers, I can see that the odds on D-Day overwhelmingly favored allied success: The Americans and British deployed an awesome superiority of planes, tanks, warships and men. Many of the “Germans” manning the coastal defenses were, in reality, Poles, Russians and Ukrainians dressed in Wehrmacht uniform. Steven Spielberg’s terrific D-Day movie “Saving Private Ryan” depicts Hitler’s forces deploying their biggest Panzers against American troops, yet during the first battles ashore, the only German tanks then on the western flank were recycled French and Czech models. So successful were allied deception operations — much more influential than the air attacks on French railways — that into July Hitler kept some of his best formations in the Pas de Calais, about 200 miles north, awaiting a second invasion.But all this wasn’t known back then to allied warlords and their soldiers, so fearful of the huge prospective consequences of failure. “Why are we trying to do this?”, cried Winston Churchill in a February 1944 spasm of alarm about the planned invasion, which caused him momentarily to propose an alternative landing in Portugal. I have always believed that, had it not been for the ironclad determination of the US chiefs of staff, there would have been no D-Day until 1945. As it was, minutes after midnight on June 6th, one British and two American airborne divisions began to jump into Normandy, and almost immediately to fight. Paratrooper James Byrom spoke French and was thus tasked by comrades to knock on the front door of the first house they reached: “At the sight of the motherly, middle-aged peasant, the gulf of the years disappeared and I might have been back in 1939, an English tourist on a walking tour dropping in to ask for a glass of cider and some camembert: ‘Excusez-nous, Madame. Nous sommes les parachustistes anglais faisant partie de Débarquement Allié’.’” ‘There was a moment of scrutiny, then the woman folded me in her arms. The tears streamed down her face, and in between kisses, she was shouting for her husband, for lamps, for wine…We found ourselves — an evil-looking group of camouflaged cutthroats — surrounded and overwhelmed by the pent-up emotion of four years.”Two hours after dawn the infantry stormed ashore, on five beaches across a 50-mile front. The American “Bloody Omaha,” where the invaders encountered the toughest resistance from Germans entrenched on bluffs above, still commands much of the popular attention, influenced by the aforesaid Spielberg portrayal. But we should never forget that overall allied casualties on the day — including those on Omaha — proved to be only a fraction of what the planners had feared. Though one National Guard unit, A Company of the 116th Infantry, lost 100 men, American dead in the first 24 hours totaled 1,465, including losses to the 82nd and 101st Airborne. The overall allied figure was around 3,000 killed, about the same number of fatalities as allied bombs and shells inflicted upon French civilians on June 6th.The generals were naïve about the inevitable grogginess of most of the tens of thousands who waded ashore, weakened by seasickness. Commando Finlay Campbell recalled that his legs continued to feel “wobbly” for two days. Twenty-four year-old French commando Robert Piage, whose mother lived in the coastal town of Ouistreham, hurled himself into water that proved chest high, in his eagerness to lead. He had advanced only 10 yards up the beach when a mortar bomb exploded, killing his closest mate and riddling Piage with fragments which he carried to his grave: “I began to cry. Not out of sorrow for myself, nor because of my wounds, but at the great joy that I felt at being back on French soil.” Not for long: He slept that night in an English hospital. One of the romantic legends of D-Day was created by a local French teenage girl, who moved around Sword beach attempting to succor the wounded, accompanied by wolf-whistles from the invaders around her. She had bicycled from her home to fetch a swimsuit that she had carelessly left by the sea on the previous day. Her name was Jacqueline Noel, and she married a British soldier whom she met a few days later. Her D-Day experience was shadowed by family tragedy, because her sister was killed by RAF bombs falling on nearby Caen. She cherished a kaleidoscope of memories: “The sea with all the boats was something that you just can’t imagine if you have not seen it. It was boats, boats, boats and more boats, boats everywhere. If I had been a German, I would have looked at this, put my weapon down and said ‘That’s it. Finished.’”One of Hitler’s defenders who surrendered, indeed, said later: “At first I was rather depressed. I, an old soldier, was a prisoner after a few hours of invasion. But when I saw the materiel behind the enemy front, I could only say, ‘Old man, how lucky you have been!’”Despite the carnage that seemed so terrible to those in its midst, the invasion had succeeded: A secure beachhead was established, and in the days and weeks that followed, far more men died than the 3,000 who perished in the landings. Our parents’ and grandparents’ generations viewed D-Day as the supreme event of World War II, and the struggle for northwest Europe as the decisive campaign. My father, an eyewitness, sincerely believed that Britain won the war, with the Americans supplying the chewing-gum, the Russians somewhere in Eastern remoteness doing heaven-knew-what.Modern historians, no longer nationalist fantasists, recognize that the Red Army did most of the dying and killing necessary to smash Hitler’s Wehrmacht. They were sustained by American rations and equipment: The Russians marched to Berlin wearing US-made boots. Yet D-Day was assuredly the decisive military event of war in the West. Moreover, for the British people it represented the moment of redemption after suffering so much and enduring so many defeats and humiliations on the long road since the war began on Sept. 3, 1939.The Normandy landings constituted a supreme feat of organization, planning, skills and courage. We are right this week to commemorate the towering achievement, while the last handful of its survivors remain alive to share the memories.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

minnpost_2024_77,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In today’s hyper-connected economy, access to high-speed internet can transform a community. Lack of access can smother its future.So the stakes are high as Minnesota is poised to invest more than $650 million in federal funding for broadband, thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure bill championed by President Joe Biden.But the stakes are also high when inexperienced, underpaid workers install fiber optics cables, often digging within inches of dangerous gas utilities or powerlines. One careless error could be fatal to workers and catastrophic to a community.You’d think an industry working in proximity to such vital, yet hazardous, infrastructure would be tightly regulated, with specific safety and training requirements enforced.Unfortunately, you’d be wrong.Unlike the utility sector, there are minimal regulations and safety standards in the broadband industry, and what few exist aren’t properly enforced, judging from conversations with contractors and workers.That’s why I’ve been watching with alarm as more and more work in the broadband industry goes to fly-by-night contractors that bring in out-of-state workers who don’t have the proper training to do this work safely.Here’s an example: Gas companies routinely bring in hydro excavation trucks to safely expose existing pipelines before digging nearby. If you can see the pipes, you’re much less likely to strike one. But irresponsible broadband installers often skip this step — they just bring in a backhoe with an inexperienced operator and hope they don’t nick a gas line.Workers using heavy equipment to install broadband near utilities should have the same qualifications as those doing gas pipeline and other utility maintenance work.Another problem is fair wages. Despite broadband projects receiving significant state subsidies, non-union workers haven’t been receiving the pay and benefits they deserve. That leads to high turnover and even less jobsite experience, creating greater risk.As leader of the largest construction union in the state, I know Minnesota has well-trained operators who can perform this work safely.They work for more than a dozen contractors that provide family-sustaining jobs in your communities. They benefit from our gold-standard apprenticeship program and a top-tier national training center. And they learn how to operate heavy equipment safely in utility corridors and other situations.These responsible companies that employ skilled local workers at union wages and benefits must compete with cutthroat, out-of-state contractors that undercut our local standards at the expense of workers and the safety of communities.With significant new federal resources to support broadband deployment, now is the time for the state to ensure public money goes to responsible contractors that pay workers fairly and prioritize safety.It’s also time to establish basic safety and training requirements — similar to those found in other industries — to protect workers and communities. Commonsense measures, like drug and alcohol testing and minimum training standards, will benefit everyone.We’ll be working with legislators this session on ways to improve the situation, because this issue touches every corner of our state. We share the goal of ensuring all Minnesotans have access to reliable broadband service. And that can only be accomplished safely by using well-trained, fairly paid workers.Jason George is the business manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49, which represents nearly 15,000 heavy equipment operators, mechanics and stationary engineers across Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota."
eugeneweekly_2024_12,"We ve got issues. A local activist wrote, “The city is crushing the homeless faster than we can save them.” Another tells me the city’s homeless camp sweeps are escalating and making it impossible for the unsheltered homeless to live. The city’s goons give people in the non-legal camps 15 minutes to gather all their stuff and move. If they don’t move fast enough the possessions they need to survive are taken from them and dumped, and they are given tickets they can’t pay. The volunteers who are trying to help them are also ticketed and hauled into court. Some are jailed. A small group of these helpers, pushed beyond endurance by the constant homeless camps sweeps, briefly disrupted a recent Eugene City Council meeting, carrying signs and chanting “stop the sweeps.” For their pains, some of these gentle idealistic young people are being charged with crimes. Because nothing kills like overkill, right? The head witch, Eugene Mayor Lucy Vinis, will not tolerate any opposition and wants any objectors punished. The previous mayor, Kitty Piercy, said, “We cannot jail ourselves out of homelessness.” Vinis apparently didn’t get the memo. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The present shelter system, run by nonprofits and largely funded by the city, works for only about a third of the homeless. The city claims it doesn’t have the money to expand it, while funding pet projects like rental housing working-class people cannot afford to live in, the ballpark the voters fortunately shot down, subsidizing downtown so the business people can make money, building on the old EWEB property, etc. The shelter system has failed for the majority of the homeless. Expanding it is not going to happen — it costs too much — and it’s not the answer. We have told the City Council that the only solution is to designate places where the unsheltered homeless can set up self-managed camps, with the city providing porta potties and trash service, which would be cheap, and otherwise leaving them alone. The city won’t designate such places because, as one activist said, “then they would go there.” The council answers only to comfortable privileged middle-class homeowners and business people who want the homeless out of their sight, and will not listen to us. The only way we can stop the city from ignoring us is to force them. Eugene needs a homeless resistance movement. Right now most of the homeless and their helpers are frozen in fear, so it will take new leadership. We have had such leaders before — SLEEPS and Eric Jackson — but nothing since 2018. The SLEEPS leaders left Eugene, while Eric Jackson died homeless. Both were successful in pushing the city into providing new shelter. Resistance does not imply property destruction or violence. The main tool of all these movements has been disruption, such as the homeless protest camps of SLEEPS and Jackson. It has been used forever to fight abusive authority — unions, the civil rights movement, anti war campaigns, etc. Disruption works best when it’s targeted. You study your enemy, in this case the city, and figure out what are its vulnerabilities, its weak points. I suggest targeting downtown, which the council has some kind of sentimental attachment to, even though most of it no longer serves a purpose. One city councilor said it’s the “beating heart of the city.” The city has no heart, beating or otherwise. Downtown merchants have tried for years to chase out the homeless. In 2018 they blocked a downtown shelter. The Eugene Chamber of Commerce actually told the council it doesn’t want any more affordable housing downtown, just market rate apartments with renters who have money to spend. If we disrupt downtown we push the business people to put pressure on the city to do something. There are many ways to do this, most of which are legal. I could suggest many tactics to anyone interested in doing it, but with a little imagination you can easily figure them out yourself. Or just study previous efforts. What we can’t do is do nothing and let the city continue to destroy people.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_73,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°In a long-awaited announcement Tuesday, President Joe iden unveiled an executive action that would grant the undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens who’ve lived in the country for 10 or more years, as well as their children under 21, a designation known as parole-in-place. This in turn will clear the path for applications for permanent residence and, eventually, citizenship.This order is about one simple thing: should people who have long lived in the United States, who have built lives here with American citizen spouses and very often children, pursuing their own version of the American dream, be allowed to access the process that they are legally entitled to anyway?Because, let’s not forget, parole-in-place is not creating a new pathway to citizenship, as it’s being largely and erroneously described. It is allowing undocumented people to avail themselves of the existing system for families of U.S. citizens, which has been part of the country’s immigration framework for more than seven decades.The reason that people couldn’t do this is because we’ve created a contradictory system that opens up pathways and punishes people for using them. Under current law, even though residency is available for people married to citizens and their children, the application must be done either entirely from outside the country, or after a person has reentered the country legally.That seems easy enough, except for the fact that leaving the United States after having been present unlawfully for a year or more triggers a 10-year ban on reentry. The process to grant exemptions is cumbersome, slow and simply unnecessary.There’ll be those who call this an executive overreach, just as they do for the DACA program that, despite years of attacks and hyperbole form political opponents, remains popular with most Americans on both sides of the aisle.We imagine that many of those who are screaming about White House tyranny from a political perspective were quite happy with the other recent executive action Biden has taken on immigration, which aims to all but shut down the border to humanitarian immigration — a drastic step that would have been a Stephen Miller pipe dream just a few years ago.We’re not convinced by that effort, having long preferred a federal program to help actually resettle and set up asylum seekers with language and housing supports as well as quicker work authorization, but it should certainly neutralize the idea that the president is pursuing some open borders agenda. What Biden is displaying here is both compassion and common sense, a mixture that is sadly all too lacking among some of his political opponents.As with many pro-immigration moves, this will deliver benefits that are economic as well as social. These are people who in many cases are itching to pursue additional education, start businesses and generally grow the economic pie for everyone, who’ve been hampered by outdated and nonsensical policy. Giving them a shot at not just spiritually but formally entering the polity of their now adopted country will serve us all well.Ultimately, there’s hardly a greater patriot than the one who must strive to make this country their own.— New York Daily NewsWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."

She was a mother of three, living in northwest Minnesota, and a survivor of domestic abuse. She was in the process of getting out of a terrible situation and called Legal Services of Northwest Minnesota to help her with her divorce. Through the process, she let her attorney know that she was being sued for more than $10,000 for unpaid medical bills for a procedure she had done in 2021.It was the last thing Belinda needed at this vulnerable point in her life. Her attorney contacted her health insurance company to determine why the bill wasn’t paid. It turns out that the insurance company had her address saved incorrectly in their system so her medical bills weren’t being processed.Once they were able to correct the issue, her bills were processed and Belinda only owed $460 of the $10,000 bill. Her attorney filed a motion to have the case dismissed.Even though Minnesotans have a lower ratio of debt than most states, they aremore likely to be sued, with one in eight debts in collectioneventually being filed as civil court cases. The overwhelming majority of cases in the state end in a default judgment — meaning the person being sued loses because they did not show up in court.Minnesota has a unique year-long “pocket filing” period, which makes the legal process even more confusing and unfair. It allows collectors to send a debt-collection notice long before there’s even an official case number or deadline. Yet, if the defendant thinks it’s a scam and fails to respond for any reason, a default judgment can be entered.Legal Service Corporation (LSC , which supports civil legal aid organizations nationwide, including throughout Minnesota, marked its 50thanniversary last week at an event in Minneapolis. There, a panel discussed Minnesotans’ debt burden, which arises from nearly all parts of people’s lives, from housing to medical care. Let’s use this as an opportunity to explore ways we can better protect residents from aggressive consumer debt collection, the third largest and fastest-growing category of cases closed by our grantees last year.Across the country, consumer debt cases are becoming a growing share of the civil docket, rising from about one in nine cases in 1993 to one in four in 2013. In states with more recent data, consumer debt cases made up 42% of civil dockets in 2021, up from just 29% eight years earlier.And consumers almost always lose when they don’t have legal representation. The structure of Minnesota’s court system makes it harder for residents to resolve their cases. Plaintiffs, usually large corporations with legal teams specializing in debt collection, can choose where and when to file cases, which are most often against individuals with fewer resources and no experience navigating the court system.Some states have tried to level the playing field for consumers. For instance, aTennessee court set up an online debt resolution platformthat provides a mediator to help negotiate medical debt before it ends up in court. TheMinnesota Legislature this year passed a lawto protect people with medical debt by keeping it off credit reports and removing liability for a spouse’s medical debt, among other provisions.Minnesota courts have simplified the formused in debt-collection cases to make it easier for non-lawyers to understand. But that form is rarely used.These steps are not enough to help the growing number of Minnesotans who go up against savvy and sometimes unscrupulous debt collectors on their own. The state has five legal services organizations supported by LSC — including Justice North, Central Minnesota Legal Services, Legal Services of Northwest Minnesota, Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, and Anishinabe Legal Services — to help low-income residents resolve civil legal issues such as consumer debt.Even with statewide coverage and close collaboration with other partners, legal aid resources are not sufficient to help everyone who needs it. LSC grantees must turn away half of those who are eligible for representation. And people whose income is too high to get legal aid but too low to afford a lawyer also fall between the cracks.As LSC reaches the milestone of a half century of supporting a comprehensive network of organizations that provide access to justice, we must remember that true justice must be impartial, equal and fair. Justice for only those who can afford it is not justice at all.Minnesota lawmakers, courts and volunteers must continue working to level the playing field for people who are increasingly blindsided by debt collectors, and to provide broader support to the legal aid organizations that help people who can’t afford to pay for a lawyer.Anne Hoefgen is the executive director of Legal Services of Northwest Minnesota.

leoweekly_2024_14,"Tin soldiers and Nixon comingIt is rarely a good idea to deploy soldiers to college campuses. This is so even (or perhaps especially if those soldiers are wearing state police uniforms instead of combat fatigues. We should know this from the infamous example of theKent State massacre, in which four students were killed in 1970 for protesting the slaughter in Vietnam. Their names and legacies have become dimmer with the passage of time, but here they are:Alison Krause, age 19Jeffrey Glenn Miller, age 20Sandra Lee Scheuer, age 20William Knox Schroeder, age 19We’re finally on our ownIt seems authoritarians are incapable of learning from history. So once again, troops are being deployed to college campuses all over the country to address the growing menace of anti-war protests. Here in corn country,at least 33 studentsand three faculty members at Indiana University have been arrested as of this writing. Many of them have been banned from campus for “trespassing” at their own public institution. GOP ghouls aredesperateto send the National Guard. It’s like 1970 all over again.This summer I hear the drummingFour dead in OhioAndtwo moreat Jackson State College in Mississippi, just ten days after Kent State:Lafayette Gibbs, age 21James Earl Green, age 17Forty years later, one of the Jackson protestersexplainedwhy they were there:Young Black males were being sent to Southeast Asia in disproportionate numbers, and we were concerned about that, in addition to the historic racism there in Jackson, Mississippi. So there were several nights of protests. And I was thinking that there would just be some taunts and jeers at the law enforcement officials present and thinking nothing would happen, but shortly after midnight, on that third night, early in the morning, May 15, actually, those students were fired upon at Jackson State.This story is even more lost to history than Kent State, for reasons that should be all too obvious.Gotta get down to itStill less known is themassacre of studentsby police in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1968. Space prohibits listing all 31 victims shot by state police and the National Guard after a week of protests over continued segregation, but three young Black men were killed. Their names are:Henry Smith, age 18Samuel Hammond, age 18Delano Middleton, age 18Soldiers are cutting us downThis isn’t hyperbole; these aresoldierscutting down college kids. It was the National Guard in Ohio a half century ago. If it’s not the Guard today, it s quasi-military organizations within local and state law enforcement units, made heavy beyond reason withsurplus gear from the Pentagon. Most of these state cops have no formal military training, but all the gusto of a GI dropped into a war zone and trained on an indigenous enemy. 40 officers firedhundreds of roundsin Jackson. There were tanks on the ground at Orangeburg. Now they’ve gotbatons in the chestsof twentysomethings andsnipers on the rooftopsat theCrossroads of America.Should have been done long agoSo far as I can tell, there have been no killings of protesters on an American college campus since Jackson. One might be led to believe that police have gotten better about responding to peaceful protests. It may be more accurate to say that campuses, with the help of courts, legislatures, and other power structures, have gotten better at suppressing them. It may also be accurate to say that the latter half of the twentieth century taught students, and the working class in general, to stay in their places. If you think there s a better-than-average chance you ll get shot at school for protesting a foreign war, you might stay home. Your mom might beg you not to go. Even your professors might encourage you to forcrissakeshutup.On second thought, maybe authoritariansdolearn from history.What if you knew herAnd found her dead on the groundAs we see more protests, we will see more state violence. Soldiers are still willing to build pressure cookers around protesters and shoot them when the boiling starts. At least two people were killed by brute squads during Breonna Taylor Summer. Their names were:David McAtee, age 53Sean Monterrosa, age 22The fact that death hasn’t happened recently on a university campus is a happy accident, but it is inevitable if militarized response to protests continues. That’s what the soldiers are there for.How can you run when you know?*** ."

But as I read through the story, I had to go back to see if I missed the part about how at least some of this $916 million went to help the victims and their families.All I could find was that the funds went not to the Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans that were mentioned as those often overlooked, but into the state’s general fund.One more thing I found missing was any mention of the accountability of the pharmacists and especially the medical professionals who were prescribing Plavix to their trusting patients. Maybe they didn’t know about how it didn’t work for a large part of Hawaii’s population? Well, that’s certainly possible, but not excusable.At least holding the pharma companies accountable was a win.Skip ThomsenFlorence, OregonStudents stand onright side of historyOver the past few weeks, students protesting on college campuses have shown great courage and personal bravery. They’ve put everything on the line. Amidst threats of expulsion, suspension and even arrests, they continue to speak up for justice.With this in mind, it’s essential to remember this cohort made it through the COVID-19 pandemic and online classes with their GPAs intact. Today’s campus protesters had no ”normal” life for almost two years. Despite this hardship, they excelled.Acceptance to top schools means many, many years of sacrifice and dedication. As both a parent and high school teacher, I’ve witnessed firsthand the endless test preps, extracurriculars and college visitations, on top of earning a 4.0-plus GPA.As the saying goes, “You practically have to cure cancer to get into an Ivy League school these days.”Yet, these Ivy Leaguers would rather risk getting kicked out of their prestigious schools than support an institution profiting from war and occupation.Forty years ago, the global movement to boycott and divest from South Africa finally brought down that apartheid government. Similar nonviolent tactics can and should be used today to bring about justice for Palestine. In this regard, students are practicing what they preach.Prior to the arrival of counter-protesters, the student encampments were peaceful. In fact, Jewish and non-Jewish students together celebrated Passover Seder, a traditional Jewish holiday.Furthermore, at Columbia’s student encampment, Jewish students were disproportionately represented by JVP (Jewish Voice for Peace and Jews for Ceasefire, two student groups that showed up in large numbers. With this in mind, claims that the protests are anti-Semitic and threaten the safety of Jewish students are deeply offensive and shown to be completely untrue.Once again, students stand on the right side of history, and they deserve our unconditional support.Liz LaliberteHiloA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of Hawaii."

leoweekly_2024_7,"For so many folks in our city and state, it only takes a few bad circumstances to become homeless. For me, it took a divorce and being diagnosed with cancer for a third time to drain whatever savings and stability I had. Despite all that, I do my best to wake up with a smile on my face and put my energy towards something positive.Right now, I am determined to make sure my city and my local representatives understand that the current proposed metro budget leaves too many of us behind. After going line by line through the proposed metro budget – even reading it twice from start to finish – I believe our local lawmakers are more focused on cutting corners than providing the care people need to thrive.I love my hometown of Louisville, and I will always fight for what I love. I was born and raised here, and when I hit one of my lowest times of sleeping on couches and living in my car, I was offered shelter at Hope Village in October 2023. It’s services like these that are at risk of being cut or downsized under the proposed budget when they already struggle to make up for where our government has failed.I’m so grateful for the opportunity to live at Hope Village, but it’s by no means a perfect or long-term solution. I don’t have access to keys to my own space and there are repairs that go unfixed for months at a time. At one point, showers were unavailable for weeks because of frozen pipes. These problems point to a larger crisis: Hope Village exists as a stop gap because our city refuses to invest in affordable housing and services.Instead of funding affordable housing, Louisville’s proposed budget will cut funding for eviction prevention and ending homelessness. Rather than employing a caring and compassionate response to people experiencing a crisis, the city wants to increase the law enforcement budget. We need funding for solutions that meet people where they’re at, yet the city council and mayor are doubling down on tactics that have never worked!This past state legislative session, I visited the Capitol at least 10 times to fight for my community. Unfortunately, state lawmakers passed H.B. 5 — a bill that includes provisions to ban camping to target folks who are homeless, involuntarily commit people experiencing mental health crises, and create a drug-induced homicide law. Essentially, the bill will criminalize poverty without creating a caring infrastructure to actually help individuals in the long term.As a city, Louisville can combat these dangerous policies by investing in the care and services that can support people in the first place. The crises our city is experiencing are the result of policy failures – exactly what the Louisville Metro Council could course-correct with the right investments.As a leader with VOCAL-KY, I’ve been able to fight for my community like never before. I’ve traveled West Virginia and Washington D.C. to fight against the criminalization of homelessness and organize with other directly-impacted people. This month, I plan to testify at local budget hearings to ensure our metro council knows that what’s currently proposed just won’t cut it.What Louisville needs is straight-forward: Public investments into affordable housing, eviction prevention, public health tools, and mental health services. We can’t police our way out of poverty, and our metro budget should reflect that. Instead of building more jails, it’s time to build out care and services that help people thrive.The safest communities are the ones with the most funding. With a budget that meets people where we’re at, we have a chance to make Louisville a happier and healthier community. It’s time the Metro Council pass a budget that puts people first, not profit.Maurice Noe is a resident of Hope Village in Louisville and leader with VOCAL-KY.*** ."
minnpost_2024_20,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The fissure disrupting and possibly terminating the sale of the Minnesota Timberwolves recalls the business and legal maneuvers that saved the team from relocating 30 years ago this spring, as well as some machinations concerning ownership transactions involving three of the state’s other major professional sports franchises.The current contretemps revolves around the prospective sale of the controlling interest in the 35-year-old basketball team to a partnership composed of former baseball star Alex Rodriguez and businessman Marc Lore, who acquired a minority interest in the club in 2022 from owner Glen Taylor, who also owns the Star Tribune. That interim relationship was part of a $1.5 billion deal that was to climax last week with transfer of an additional portion, giving them 80% ownership.But, as the club experiences nearly unprecedented success on the hard court, contending for the lead in its Western Division, the ownership arrangement seems headed to the courtroom, a forum that the organization has familiarity with from a prior legal ownership dust-up three decades ago.The current controversy, like most others of its ilk, involves money; the Rodriguez-Lore group apparently does not have or is unwilling to ante up enough of it to make the final payment to seal the deal, according to Taylor, whom the aspiring purchasers claim has “seller’s remorse.”The buyers’ financial inability to complete the transaction has a semblance of reality. Shortly before the scheduled closing of the transaction right before Easter, they brought in a new unrelated investment group as a participant in the ownership team — a sign that their finances may be faltering — prior to Taylor declaring that the transaction shot clock has expired and the deal was dead due to the buyers’ failure to meet the payment deadline shortly before April 1.Nothing to see here, assured the putative buyers, just a matter of completing some routine paperwork required by the National Basketball Association, which has been reticent on the matter.But Lore has not. While he and Rodriguez wait in the on-deck circle, to mix a baseball metaphor, he has threatened a lawsuit to compel Taylor to consummate the transaction.But litigation does not seem in the offing now as it seems the dispute is headed to arbitration, pursuant to a clause in the purchase agreement calling for that forum to resolve disputes.The tumult recalls how the Timberwolves, then in their infancy, almost moved out of the state in 1994 in another ownership squabble.The team’s original owners, local business buddies Marvin Wolfson and Harvey Ratner, sought to bail out in response to an overture by a group headed by boxing promoter Bob Arum based in New Orleans that had recently lost its NBA franchise, the Jazz, to Utah.But a funny thing happened on the way to the Big Easy: the prospective transfer was halted by an injunction issued by Judge James Rosenbaum in a federal court lawsuit in Minneapolis, later upheld by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals amidst dueling cases in U.S. District Court here and a competing one in Louisiana state court seeking to proceed with the transaction down there.With the legal stand-off at a logger’s head, Taylor, a former Republican state senator and extremely wealthy Mankato business mogul, stepped up to the plate, to mix yet another metaphor. He purchased the team from Marv & Harv, in order to keep it here, by paying $94 million for the club, now valued at some $2.5 billion, remarkably the second lowest in the league. That’s nearly a 30-times increase.A trio of the area’s other major professional athletic clubs have gone through their own versions of onerous ownership angst over the years.The Timberwolves’ NBA predecessors, the five-time post-World War II NBA championship dynasty Minneapolis Lakers, left town in 1960 for greener and greater greenbacks in Los Angeles after new ownership here tried unsuccessfully to overcome box office struggles due to inadequate facilities.Another winter-centric Minnesota team, the hockey North Stars, was relocated in 1993 by its disgruntled Canadian owner, Norm Green, to that hockey paradise of Dallas and later captured a National Hockey League Stanley Cup championship trophy six years later that for some 26 years had eluded its northern predecessor. The North Stars were replaced in 2000 by the expansion Wild and continue struggling for a NHL title.The football Vikings have also experienced their share of ownership fracases, including the failed effort by thriller author Tom Clancy in 1998 to buy the club from a local consortium for $600 million, which fell apart when it was revealed, after Clancy announced the prospective purchase, that he was missing one essential feature: a signed contract.In stepped Texas car dealer Red McCombs to buy the club and operate it for seven years, constantly agitating for a new facility, which finally got built, the U.S. Bank Stadium, after he sold out to another non-Minnesota group, the current owners, the New Jersey-based Wilf brothers, for $246 million, a four-fold increase.Then there’s the baseball Twins, whose season is just getting started under the Pohlad family, which bought the team in the midst of a threatened departure in the mid-1980s due to declining attendance when owned by the Griffith family.The team’s two World Series titles in 1987 and 1991 preceded a bungled effort to sell the club and move it to North Carolina in the new Millenium. That suspect maneuver was followed by the prospective demise of the team as part of Major League Baseball’s planned “contraction” to eliminate it and one other club for financial reasons, a prospect squelched by another court injunction issued in 2022 by the late Hennepin County District Court judge Harry Crump, leading to construction of Target Field in 2010. It was an illustration of the time honored tenet, like the Timberwolves-New Orleans courtroom clash, of “home field” (or court advantage, in which the litigant closest to the courthouse almost invariably wins.So, the Taylor v. Rodriguez-Lore brouhaha at Target Center, while unsettling, fits into the Minnesota professional sports ownership legal lore.How the Timberwolves tussle over ownership will play out remains to be seen. If it succeeds in its drive for its first NBA title, the championship hardware, known as the Larry O’Brien trophy for the former league commissioner and John F. Kennedy New Frontier politico, may have to be divided in half between the two contending ownership groups.That would be a real form of Solomonic justice.Marshall H.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_105,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°After three-and-a-half years and 7.8 million illegal crossings, President Joe Biden is finally tackling the crisis at the southern border and is doing so by borrowing from one of former president Donald Trump’s more reviled policies.Biden issued an executive order that will allow him to shut the border when the number of migrants seeking to cross into this country tops 2,500 a day.He is claiming the authority under Section 212 (f of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the same clause that Trump invoked to justify his so-called Muslim ban.Recall that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked Trump’s total ban on immigrants from seven Middle Eastern countries. It was later upheld by the Supreme Court, but then scrapped by Biden.This time, the American Civil Liberties Union is already threatening a legal challenge to Biden’s executive order.Our issue with Biden’s order is not whether he has the constitutional authority to act to protect the nation from a national security threat, but rather the back-door approach he is taking.Biden has laid out a complex formula for triggering the border closure. It will shut when illegal crossings average more than 2,500 for seven consecutive days and will remain closed until 14 days after there have been seven days in a row of less than 1,500 illegal encounters.It’s been since July 2020 that crossings have averaged below 1,500, so this should effectively close the border immediately. Enforcement will be beefed up, the president promises. Those who cross unauthorized will face a greater likelihood of being sent back, a significant change from the Biden administration’s previous practice of allowing asylum seekers to disappear into the country.The change in policy is driven entirely by politics. Immigration ranks as a top concern of voters heading into the fall presidential election, and one on which Biden fares poorly. The Real Clear Politics average finds roughly 63% of voters disapprove of the president’s handling of immigration.The executive order Biden signed is similar to a bill defeated in the Senate in February for lack of Republican support.The chief GOP objection to that bill was that it still provided an opening for people crossing illegally to slip in under the shut-down threshold. That measure set the daily average at 4,000, 1,500 higher than allowed in Biden’s executive order. The president did not take the tougher measure he crafted back to Congress. He should have.It is problematic when a president effectively puts a law in place by executive order that has already been rejected by the legislative branch.This also falls short of being a long-term solution. Illegal crossings have soared under Biden because his administration has tolerated what amounts to an open border for its entire tenure.Asylum seekers who come in through ports of entry or use the Customs and Border Protection app to make appointments will still be waved into the country.What Biden is doing in this executive order is better than what he has been doing to secure the border, which is nothing.But it falls short of what’s needed. To be secure, America must be in full control of its borders. And that requires knowing exactly who is entering the country and why.—The Detroit News/TNS"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_24,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Something incredible happened four years ago. People suddenly realized that my grocery store co-workers and I are essential. It had a lasting effect on me, but some people clearly need a reminder — especially the leaders of the conglomerates that dominate the industry. These bosses have rewarded our essential frontline service during the pandemic by trying to replace us with machines.California’s grocery workers are on the front line once again as we face the challenge of automation. This time we’re pushing back by supporting State Bill 1446, which, among other things, limits the number of self-checkout stations grocery and retail drugstore workers have to oversee at any given time.The corporate strategy behind self-checkout is clear and heavy-handed: lower labor costs by forcing customers to do the work themselves and pass the increased profit on to Wall Street. Most of my customers at the Food 4 Less in Boyle Heights refuse to make the change.Instead of learning to navigate the bank of self-checkout machines our store recently installed, they line up deep into the aisles to be helped by a human being. Every day I see customers give up and walk out the door without buying anything because the line is too long and they are frustrated by the problems they’ve encountered when trying self-checkout.But our bosses have prioritized profits that benefit the shareholders of Kroger, the parent company of Food 4 Less, far above customer satisfaction. Workers’ well-being is even further down on their agenda. The addition of self-checkout at the store where I work has us managing increased workloads and dealing with disgruntled customers. Our physical safety has also been jeopardized by the shift.That’s because self-checkout machines provide more opportunity for shoplifting. The company accounts for this and apparently considers the increased losses worth the savings they get from reduced staffing expenses. But at my store, a single worker is expected to watch all six self-checkout registers, and when we see or suspect a theft it can be scary, especially during night shifts when there are fewer people around.Workers aren’t the only ones unhappy with the self-checkout machines. Many shoppers find them difficult to operate and are frustrated by issues such as hidden barcodes or items not scanning. For people with only a few items, especially younger customers more familiar with touchscreen interfaces, they might work well enough. But grocery store work requires speed, skill and experience. And a lot of people just prefer interacting with a person.I’ve worked at Foods 4 Less for five years, and I love serving my community. I have long-standing customers who seek out my register and with whom I share moments of personal connection week after week. But with longer lines at the fewer human-staffed registers, there’s less time to say “hi,” another way automation is shredding the social fabric.The Boyle Heights Food 4 Less story is happening in industries across California and the nation. What choice do any of us have? Everyone needs a grocery store — they’re essential, remember? But if the Legislature passes SB 1446, those lines at the staffed checkout stations will be shorter and the workers helping you when the self-checkout computer has a glitch will be less stressed. Maybe everyone will even have a chance to say hi.7 p.m. update:. season."
minnpost_2024_36,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As the person who started the group to oppose the Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan, I take issue with Cityscape columnist Bill Lindeke’s piece,“Former Minneapolis 2040 leader: Cynical use of environmental laws and communication plagued the plan.”In it, he interviews Heather Worthington, who was head of long-range planning at the city at the time. She refers to “NIMBY” groups, saying efforts to stop the 2040 Plan — including a lawsuit claiming it violates the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act (MERA — are a cynical use of environmental laws. Nothing could be further from the truth.But let’s start at the beginning. Every 10 years, the Metropolitan Council does a regional plan so it can figure out how regional systems like sewer treatment, transportation, parks, drinking water, solid waste and surface water management should evolve. The core of this plan is forecasting what parts of the region will grow and by how much. Cities and counties are then required to create long-range plans in conformance with the regional plan. Things that shape how cities grow must be aligned with the council’s plan, including the city’s zoning code, development rules, capital investments and other things that shape city development.For its 2040 Plan, the Metropolitan Council said Minneapolis was supposed to plan for 15% growth. Minneapolis planned for 75% growth, according to one study that showed the city’s zoning and development changes could result in the construction of 150,000 new housing units.The core idea was density. Density would address two thorny urban problems. First, if people lived more densely, it would be better for the environment. Multifamily housing would replace single family homes. People in urban cores drive less than suburban or exurban people. Building in the core would preserve virgin land as opposed to building on the edges of the region.Density would solve a second urban problem. Studies, mostly in California and New York, have shown that regulation is a barrier to housing construction. To get density, the city would radically reduce regulations on new development, removing this barrier. Advocates printed signs saying that by approving the 2040 Plan, housing would become abundant and cheap.Getting density required radical changes. It eliminated zoning protections for single family homes, allowing them to be replaced by triplexes at minimum and much more if a developer could get adjoining parcels or if a property was on a bus line, or if the property was in the middle half of the city. It allowed new buildings to be bigger and taller and to completely cover a parcel. Small area plans that shaped development were eliminated to accommodate the planned dramatic growth. It adopted a transportation plan that assumes a60% reduction in auto travel by 2030, as the new density would mean people would naturally walk, bike or take transit. It eliminated parking minimums because cars would not be needed. Pictures showed Minneapolis becoming Manhattan, with bungalow streets replaced by walkups, and urban centers like Uptown filled with gleaming skyscrapers.The Minnesota Environmental Rights Act requires that if you are going to make radical changes that impact the environment, you have to mitigate those harms. And clearly, growing 75% would substantially negatively impact the environment in Minneapolis. Minneapolis did nothing to mitigate the environmental harms of this planned massive growth. It just assumed that the health and environment of Minneapolis residents would be sacrificed for the benefits of density. This is what triggered the MERA lawsuit.But there is an even bigger problem with Minneapolis’ plan. It takes 2.1 babies per woman to keep a population stable. The current birth rate in the United States is 1.64 babies per woman and it has been declining since the 1950s. Without immigration, the U.S. would be removing housing. Minnesota is a cold, high-tax northern state and in the Twin Cities people can get less expensive housing with better schools and less crime in the suburbs. When the 2040 Plan was created, Minneapolis was forecast to grow only 15% from 2020 to 2040.It is now forecast to grow 11%. Minneapolis will never have radically more density, yet it is developing as if it will. Buildings are bigger and taller and often cover every square inch of a lot. Developers go wherever they can hustle a parcel, often in a sea of single-family houses. Greenspace is being reduced, solar access lost and polluted runoff increased. And it is all unnecessary.Minneapolis is rebuilding its streets for the massive shift to walking, biking and transit that would occur with this fantasy density. Parking is being removed, streets narrowed, and auto lanes are being converted to bike lanes. This has substantially increased auto congestion and, commensurately, carbon emissions and pollution. It may seem counterintuitive, but bike lanes in Minneapolis are often awful for the environment.Ownership housing is the best way for low- and middle-income residents to build wealth. Ninety-five percent of new housing built in Minneapolis since 2009 has been rental, according to an analysis by the city assessor’s office that I requested. By taking away zoning protections from single family homes, it has incentivized the corporatization and destruction of its only reservoir of wealth-building housing. Unsurprisingly, home ownership rates have declined, and billions of dollars flow from residents’ hands into corporate coffers. Given Minneapolis has the largest population of persons of color in the state, it is hard not to see the racism in incentivizing the destruction of wealth-building opportunities.The idea that putting housing in the urban core is better for the environment also turns out not to be true. Minneapolis hasonly 15% of the jobs in the region, a percentage that has been declining for decades. Around 50% of jobs are within about a mile of 494/694. If the region wants to reduce travel, it makes more sense to redevelop office complexes and strip malls near suburban jobs than to put more housing in the urban core, just to expect people to commute out to suburban jobs.At its center, the call for more density misdiagnoses the country’s housing issues. Zoning may be driving housing costs up in California and New York City, but Minneapolis is not them. Minneapolis actually grew faster than the Twin Cities overall population between 2010 and 2020, something that could not happen if its zoning was holding back development. The reason for increasing housing costs here and for most of the rest of the country is thecost of construction. The cost to build housing has almost doubled, when adjusted for inflation.Density is an attractive solution that doesn’t live up to its promises. People want agency to fight climate change and to help the poor by producing more affordable housing. The density fantasy gives them that agency they crave. But what happens if we planned for reality? That over the next 20 years, Minneapolis, at best, will have a tiny amount of growth that could easily have been accommodated in commercial corridors and existing walkable neighborhoods, while preserving ownership opportunities. And it would have been much easier to mitigate the environmental impacts of a small amount of growth. But that is not what Minneapolis did and that is what led to the lawsuit.The absurdity of the density fantasy becomes even more stark when we admit that if trends hold over the next 20 years, Minneapolis will probably have a declining population. There was no need to sacrifice ownership housing to corporations. There was no need to sacrifice the city’s urban environment to out-of-scale development. There was no need to rebuild the roads for a fantasy shift away from automobiles. It was all unnecessary. It becomes even worse giventhe population of the city actually declined the last two years.Right now, people claiming to be environmentalists are working at the Legislature to end MERA. To end the requirement that large-scale projects that harm the environment find ways to mitigate that harm. In this day of climate change, worsening health outcomes, loss of habitat and degradation, that is the worst thing Minnesota could do. Instead, the Legislature should recommit itself to creating a healthy environment for all residents by affirming MERA.Also, people claiming to be housing advocates are working to remove zoning protections for wealth-building housing by eliminating zoning protections for single family homes. The Legislature should see that this will only reduce ownership housing. Minnesota has more than enough developable land to accommodate its modest growth without impoverishing future generations.Carol Becker, of Minneapolis, is a college teacher."

In this 90-minute national TV appearance watched by 51 million Americans, Trump said it would be a democratic achievement to turn laws on abortion over to states responding to citizen majorities.In his reply, Biden precisely said, “Look, there’s so many young women who have been, including a young woman who just murdered and he went to the funeral. And the idea that she was murdered by a by by an immigrant coming in, too. They talk about that. But here’s the deal. There’s a lot of young women being raped by their by their in-laws, by their by by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by just it’s just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines.”It’s possible here to see a hint of a real argument, but do you want a president sufficiently confused to talk like this on live TV to have special power in national policies? And, if your answer is oh, so what, consider Biden’s lifelong history of lies, or of making it seem that Iran and its proxie Hamas should get away with anything. Biden did nothing to stop a Taliban assault as we deserted Afghanistan, allowing befuddled and hateful Afghan leadership to do little that was effective as starvation pursued a million children that winter and since then.Biden’s southern border laxity hasn’t just killed Americans by the hundreds of thousands through fatal fentanyl poisoning but caused the deaths of illegal immigrants themselves on their desert treks. He addressed the issue in a proposed bill with all kinds of dangerous stuff part of the whole. He abused some 130,000 young migrants under 18 by allowing them into the country without their parents and then illegally put to work with educational costs. Some of the girls were forced into prostitution. New York Times revelations have led to more governmental attention to the issue but this has been worse than Biden’s talk of Trump separating immigrant children from criminal parents. Meanwhile, some of our schools and hospitals have been crowded to the point of reduced functionality.The great fear of Democrats right now is Biden’s unnecessary spending causing runaway inflation that has slowed down a little, his freedom-reducing, regulatory enthusiasms, his national divisiveness, his tall tales and foreign policy failures that may inadvertently promote World War III on top of Cold War II already under way.Many want a replacement, but who? Surely not his vice president whose inabilities were highlighted by her role as a border czar ignoring the border situation as it got worse and worse. The staffers in her office keep quitting because of abuse. Well, what about Gavin Newsom, the governor of California who is charming, good looking, articulate and incompetent?For those paying close attention, as in watching Fox News video revelations or catching up on daily details, it has become forever clearer that Trump outshines Biden, and for those who are not tuned in to that degree we had the debate revelation, largely the work of CNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Proudly progressive Democratic enthusiasts and Donald Trump bashers, these biased journalists nevertheless let both him and their apparently preferred presidential candidate, Biden, do all the bitter yapping as they asked fair, balanced and meaningful questions without voicing judgments themselves.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Emmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_113,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Vice President Kamala Harris began to set out her economic agenda last week and will doubtless say more about it when she speaks at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday. Unsurprisingly, her program is shaping up to be Bidenomics 2.0 — which is mostly a good thing. An emphasis on the energy transition and wider economic opportunity is quite right. The question is whether her administration will aim to strengthen the first version or double down on its weaknesses.The spending plans Harris has started to outline are a more expansive version of President Joe Biden’s latest budget. Notably, they include substantially bigger increases in the Child Tax Credit (with a credit of $6,000 for newborns . Desirable as this and other new outlays might be, they aren’t free, and there’s little sign yet of how they’ll be paid for.Without Harris’s enhancements, the administration’s budget envisaged deficits of close to 5% of gross domestic product over the coming decade, with net public debt remaining well over 100% of GDP. This assumes higher taxes on corporations, robust economic growth and no new downturns. It also assumes that most of Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of next year. Yet Harris affirms Biden’s promise that taxes won’t go up for the vast majority of Americans (those making less than $400,000 . How will the additional costs be covered? No answer. Harris says she’s committed to fiscal responsibility and plans to make the richest Americans and the biggest corporations pay their “fair share.” In truth, without higher taxes on many middle-class households, the government’s debts will continue to mount unsustainably. She can reject broadly based tax increases or be a fiscally responsible president — but, with these new spending ambitions, she can’t honestly promise both.Along with fiscal excess, the other main defect in Bidenomics has been failing to see how market forces can enhance or cripple well-intentioned interventions. Harris rightly promises to increase the supply of housing, recognizing that the gap between supply and demand is why home prices have surged. Yet she also promises first-time buyers a subsidy of $25,000 — again, a more generous version of a proposal in Biden’s budget. Aside from the budgetary cost, the problem is obvious: With demand outpacing supply, this new credit will mostly push prices higher and be collected by sellers.Another such error is her promised “first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries.” Food prices soared during the pandemic because of supply disruptions and heavy demand fueled by public support, not because of “bad actors” in a highly competitive industry with slender margins. Price controls have been tried in country after country, time and again.They invariably fail.It bears emphasizing that Harris’s economic agenda, flawed as it might be, would still be preferable to Trump’s – whether his proposals are taken either literally or seriously. Harris has rightly attacked the former president’s idea of a comprehensive new tariff, for instance. (“We are going to have 10% to 20% tariffs on foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years,” as he put it. That’s a recipe for higher consumer prices, reduced growth and deteriorating global relations.Harris could underline the threat Trump poses to American prosperity more effectively by standing up for fiscal responsibility, restraining her appetite for micro-management and recognizing the market economy as her ally in serving the public.— Bloomberg OpinionRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."

But it’s not Biden. | OpinionRecently, a dozen or so residents of myRoxboroughretirement community piled into a handicap-accessible van, bound for a matinee ofLadysitting, now at the Arden Theatre. Lorene Cary, Philadelphia’sfavorite novelist-playwright-librettist-arts-impresario-Penn professor, had turned her acclaimed memoir of the same name into a play about one very old person: her centenarian grandmother. The play is about Nana at the end of her life, when she moved in with Cary — and her family. It wasn’t pretty. So Cary wrote about it.In another recent world-premiere play,My Mama and the Full-Scale Invasion(recently at the Wilma Theater , the playwright’s mother, Olga, is insisting on toughing out the current war in Kyiv, Ukraine, bombs be damned.The two plays couldn’t be less alike; their protagonists’ nationality, class, history, and current situations are wildly different. Yet, I couldn’t help noticing similarities between the two old women at the center. Olga and Nana are at the ends of their tethers, but not too far gone to be stubborn — to whine, sulk, insult, and guilt-trip.“My whole address book is dead,” moans Olga in Kyiv.“You want me dead,” blurts Nana to her granddaughter, as the younger woman loses patience with her patient.After seeing both, one thought came to mind:So that’s how they see us. Hmph.On a purely personal level, those of us over the age of 75 are described by turns as pains in the butt and pitiable. On a deeper level, there is a begrudging respect for our sheer tenacity and courage in the face of pain, loss, and terror. And history.When I see younger people talking about my cronies, they seem to give us credit for surviving war, scarcity, injustice, and pestilence. But what was our alternative?To be sure, we had our share of misfortune — we grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression and World War II. We lived through the twilight of Jim Crow. These were not auspicious beginnings. (Anyone who thinks the world needs to be Made Great Again wasn’t born Black, LGBTQ, Jewish, Asian, disabled, or female in the 1930s. But too many people forget about all the lucky breaks we got. Many of us have, in the end, benefited from relative plenty, liberating innovation, progress in medicine and science (I was 17 years old when the polio vaccine appeared , the arc of history’s bent toward justice, and, just in time, Wikipedia — what we have instead of brains.I was 17 years old when the polio vaccine appeared.From childhood on, we’ve been the most scrutinized, criticized, idealized, spied-upon, attention-grabbing group in history.As teenagers, we scared the pants off our elders, includingJ.

Next thing you know, along with having sex without getting pregnant, we were reading Betty Friedan’sFeminist Mystique(1963 , reinventing pop music, heeding the calls of the Rev.

Are you kidding?(Of course, baby boomers — the generation after mine — were there for some of that, too. But this isn’t about them; they get enough attention. It’s the job of each generation to challenge those who came before, but none of our uppity behavior sat well with our parents. I recall family dinner table conversations among veterans who’d landed on Normandy’s beaches and peaceniks protesting the Vietnam War. We called our elders sexist, racist, homophobic Neanderthals. They called us degenerate, unpatriotic, clueless jerks. In the end, we tolerated — and loved — each other, because, again, what was the alternative?It is, in the end, the job of young people to misread their elders, and the job of elders to endure it and laugh. Now we’re the elders, and it’s our turn to be misread, and to endure it.(For the sake of argument, I’d define my cohort as hardworking, skeptical, cautiously rebellious, and resilient.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_282,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It may come as no surprise that the first modern Olympics were a men-only affair. The second, in Paris in 1900, included 22 women, and from then on, every Olympic Games has wrestled with whether, and how, to treat men and women differently. The concepts of equality and fairness are murky at the point where sports meets gender, and Olympic history is full of stories that show how hard it can be to muddle through.Sex segregation is as much a part of the Olympic movement as medals, anthems and bribery scandals. There is no Olympic sport that is indifferent to gender in the sense of allowing everyone to join without regard to sex. As a result, every Olympic sport tries to regulate the boundary between men and women — and keeping up the distinction is a tremendous amount of work.As soon as a sport differentiates athletes on the basis of sex, it needs a method to distinguish who goes in which category. And for every method, there will be ambiguities and miscategorizations, as well as contestation, inequality and injustice in the outcome. These are inescapable. One measure of an organization is how well it handles the complications that its own methods generate.Since 1966, women’s participation has been subject to various tests of sex verification. The means have changed over time and have included visual physical exams (which was exactly as crude as it sounds , chromosome and genetic testing, and hormone testing. Today, many sports are adopting a blood standard — for instance, a maximum of 5 nanomoles of testosterone per liter of blood — as the measure of a woman. Testing methods have changed over time due to concerns about intersex individuals and those with hormone- or chromosome-related health conditions.Historically, men have not had to submit to gender testing. The purpose of testing has always been to police against men sneaking into women’s competition.Gender testing is controlled separately for each sport. Every Olympic sport has an international federation responsible for setting its rules, including the rules around male and female categories. This decentralized system means that rugby players and swimmers might face different standards for gender.In addition, the national Olympic committee of each country could have different rules for its teams. The tangle of jurisdictions virtually guarantees that, for instance, a South African distance runner will be treated differently than a Canadian trying for the soccer team, even if they have identical bodily characteristics. The Olympic ecosystem consists of hundreds of independent organizations across different sports and nations. The International Olympic Committee seems content to delegate the dilemmas of sex segregation to them.The categories are being shaken anew today by the visibility of transgender athletes. Trans participation has put new pressure on old categories. It has always been true that the male-female binary was only a rough approximation of biological reality, but the complexity is multiplied with more gender categories and by circumstances of individuals moving across categories over their lives. Many Olympic sports today seek to avoid dealing with the issue by trusting the gender listed on a person’s birth certificate or passport. While this resolves the problem of unreliable tests, it outsources the hard part to the government that issued that document.All this effort is intended to deter the problem of “sex fraud” in competition. The most famous case in the Olympics was a high jumper in 1936 who, today, would probably be classed as intersex. Dora Ratjen was raised as a girl, participated as a female competitor at the Berlin Games, and set records around Europe before being accused of being a man by competitors, police and a peculiarly nosy train conductor. Ratjen was acquitted of fraud and then lived as a man named Heinrich (and later Heinz .What test would have revealed the gender truth about Nora/Heinrich/Heinz? It seems likely that the various tests used in the Olympics over the years might return a range of contradictory answers in this case. For most people, the diverse indicators of gender line up neatly and align also with how people feel about themselves. But in some cases, they don’t, and in those moments, the gap between reality and bureaucratic classification becomes contentious.One way forward is to insist that the categories represent truth. This leads to gender binary fundamentalism, which often comes at the cost of human reality and individual dignity. The other route involves accepting that people don’t always fit the categories. This means giving up the illusion of scientific categories, which frees us from some artificial constraints but also makes it difficult to answer practical questions, such as who should be on the women’s pole vault team.To point this out is not to criticize. It is instead to shine a light on how the Olympics navigate the fact that gender is biologically complicated with its immense and largely unaccountable decision-making power. Gender rules at the Olympics force female athletes to conform to an outsider’s theory of what constitutes a woman and also to accept the unchecked authority of global sports organizations.To be sure, the problem is not exclusive to the Olympics — indeed, it may not be a “problem” at all. Many public policy decisions treat men and women differently. The problem is more conceptual, and more social, than just the Olympics: Every protocol to differentiate male from female will result in ambiguous cases, controversy and some instances of injustice. Rather than search for the perfect scientific measure of gender, what matters more is whether the organization can acknowledge ambiguity, admit to its role in creating occasional injustice and deal with the controversial cases with a measure of sensitivity and empathy for the people it harms.The private power of the Olympic organizations is both enormous and unaccountable, which is a dangerous combination.Ian Hurd is a professor of international politics at Northwestern University.

minnpost_2024_61,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Imagine going back in time to the 1950s and ‘60s when cash-strapped families were unable to obtain bank credit and were at the mercy of the likes of pawnbrokers and loan sharks as well as personal-relationship-based local store credit to make ends meet.It sounds absurd, but that is the position into which some Minnesota lawmakers are thinking about thrusting our state’s most economically vulnerable families today.In the late 1970s, the American economy was transformed; unprecedented competition among banks put the convenience of credit cards and other credit products into the hands of millions of people who previously were ineligible for them and had to rely on more expensive and risky credit options.Why? Thanks to a unanimous 1978 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Marquette Nat’l Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Serv. Corp.,authored by liberal icon Justice William Brennan, banks holding a “national charter” were to be governed by the interest rate caps of the states in which they were based instead of the state in which the consumers lived. Therefore, the nationally chartered banks started offering very attractive terms across state lines.Moreover, in response to the Supreme Court’s decision, the U.S. Congress passed a bill, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, called the Depository Institutions and Monetary Control Act of 1980 (known as DIDMCA or DIDA , which allowed banks chartered under state law to have the same right to “export” their home-state interest rates as the national banks did. This enabled state-chartered banks to compete on an equal playing field with massive, nationally chartered banks like Wells Fargo, Citibank, and Capital One.The result of DIDMCA’s passage was vibrant competition among all banks — nationally and state-chartered — to provide more and more attractive terms on credit and to provide more credit options, as well as to provide credit to more and more people. This especially benefited millions of previously credit-deprived and underbanked customers who were brought out of the margins and into the mainstream credit community. This helped fuel the economic expansion of the 1980s and beyond.Unfortunately, in passing DIDMCA, Congress included a provision that would allow state legislatures to opt out of the law. At first, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Puerto Rico and Wisconsin all opted out. Over time, however, all but Iowa and Puerto Rico rescinded their opt-out laws after seeing the benefits to consumers in states like Minnesota.Yet this year, State Reps. Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn of Eden Prairie, Zack Stephenson of Coon Rapids and Leon Lillie of North St. Paul have filed a bill (House File 3680 , which, if passed into law, would force Minnesota to opt out of DIDMCA and become an anomaly like Iowa. The idea is baffling.Iowa operates in a pre-1980s market, which puts Iowa consumers at a disadvantage. It also puts Iowa state banks at a disadvantage compared to the massive, impersonal, national-chartered banks. It’s these, the largest banks in the nation, that are charging the highest fees, and they’d be exempt from Minnesota H.F. 3680 because they would continue to be governed by the Supreme Court’s 1978 ruling.Similarly, in addition to the threat that a DIDMCA opt-out would pose for Minnesota consumers, it also would put Minnesota state-chartered banks at a disadvantage compared with nationally chartered banks, which include, ironically, the Minnesota-based behemoth U.S. Bank.Of course, the impact of an opt-out would be negligible to Minnesota’s more financially well-off consumers. Where the impact would be felt most acutely would be among Minnesota’s marginalized citizens — people who are not highly regarded or well served by much of the financial services industry.It’s important to understand:These are the consumers who would be harmed by H.F. 3680 — Minnesotans who can’t get a loan from a bank and who struggle to access the credit they need.Less well-to-do Minnesotans should have a myriad of credit options just like well-off Americans do to help them weather financial storms and build a better future for their families.Why would any lawmaker want to abandon vulnerable Minnesotans in a veritable credit desert like Iowa? Everyone who cares about the economic well-being of low-income, minority, young and other marginalized Minnesotans should oppose a DIDMCA opt-out.Kent Kaiser, Ph.D., is the secretary/treasurer of the Domestic Policy Caucus, which can be found atwww.domesticpolicycaucus.com."

Lorraine Inouye and Joy San Buenaventura, received robust backing from the community, including the Hawaii Provider Shortage Crisis Task Force, Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Mitch Roth, Hawaii County Council, Community First Hawaii and the Hawaii State Rural Health Association.Hawaii has long faced the most severe shortages of primary care providers in the nation, with over half a million residents living in federally designated Health Professions Shortage Areas. The Big Island reports a staggering 41% deficit in doctors, a reality that exacerbates health outcomes across various conditions including trauma, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Local hospitals have been expanding services and increasing access to specialty care, yet the lack of community health care providers continues to leave many medical conditions neglected, increasing the difficulty and cost of treatment later on.This bill’s passage is expected to alleviate some of the financial pressures on our health care professionals, making it more feasible for them to sustain their practices and focus on delivering care. While this legislative action is commendable and a cause for optimism, it is only the beginning of what needs to be a broader reform effort.Continued advocacy and further legislative measures are essential to fully address the ongoing challenges faced by our health care providers. By further reducing the economic and bureaucratic hurdles, we can enable our doctors and dentists to concentrate more on what they do best — helping us lead healthier lives — without the constant worry of whether they can keep their doors open.Gov. Josh Green’s anticipated signing of SB 1035 into law promises improved access to primary health care providers, specialists and dentists, which in turn will help reduce excess mortality and improve health outcomes across the Big Island.Our heartfelt thanks go to all the lawmakers, community leaders and residents who supported this vital bill. Yet, as we celebrate this progress, we must also acknowledge the work ahead and continue to push for comprehensive solutions that ensure our healthcare system can meet the needs of every Hawaii resident.Prior authorization policies are a significant barrier to care and markedly decrease the productivity of health care professionals and results in poorer health and outcomes for the community members across the Big Island. This is a critical next step to increase access to health care services close to home.Let’s keep working together Big Island to lead the way to better health for our island and our state.Dr. Scott Grosskreutz is a member of the Hawaii Provider Shortage Crisis Task Force.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_65,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Two years ago, when the Supreme Court decided New York State Rifle and Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen, it created a jurisprudential mess that scrambled American gun laws. On Friday not only did the cleanup begin, but the Supreme Court also cleared the way for one of the most promising legal innovations for preventing gun violence: red flag laws.The Bruen ruling did two things. First, it rendered a sensible and, in my view, correct decision that the “right of the people to keep and bear arms,” as articulated in the Second Amendment, includes a right to bear arms outside the home for self-defense. But the right isn’t unlimited. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his concurrence in Bruen, the court did not “prohibit states from imposing licensing requirements for carrying a handgun for self-defense” and that “properly interpreted, the Second Amendment allows a ‘variety’ of gun regulations.”At the same time, the court articulated a “text, history and tradition” test for evaluating gun restrictions in future federal cases. Under this test, gun control measures were constitutional only if the government could demonstrate those restrictions were “consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” That was the most significant element of the Bruen case. Before Bruen, lower courts had struggled to establish a uniform legal test for evaluating gun restrictions, and the Supreme Court hadn’t provided any clarity.Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a 6-3 decision split along ideological lines. He applied the text, history and tradition test by walking through the very complex, often contradictory, history of American gun laws to determine whether New York’s restrictions had analogies with the colonial period or the periods after ratification of the Second Amendment and the 14th Amendment, which applied the Second Amendment to the states. Under a fair reading of Thomas’ opinion, lower courts would be hard pressed to uphold any gun restriction unless they could point to an obvious historical match.Not only was the history messy, but judicial reliance on founding-era legislation suffers from an additional conceptual flaw: State legislatures are hardly stuffed with constitutional scholars. Then and now, our state legislatures are prone to enact wildly unconstitutional legislation.Our courts exist in part to check legislatures when they go astray. The courts do not rely on legislatures to establish constitutional doctrine. In our divided system of government, legislators are not tasked with interpreting constitutional law. Yes, they should take the Constitution into account when they draft laws, but the laws they draft aren’t precedent. They do not and should not bind the courts.United States v. Rahimi, the case the Supreme Court decided on Friday, is a product of Bruen’s confusion. And the outcome is fascinating. Five of the six justices who voted in the majority in Bruen backed away from the clear implications of the decision. Thomas, by contrast, doubled down.The case involves a man from Texas named Zackey Rahimi who was convicted of violating a federal law that prohibits individuals subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. He had threatened his girlfriend and another woman with a gun, and he was a suspect in a spate of additional shootings. After he threatened his girlfriend, he entered into an agreed domestic violence restraining order prohibiting him from threatening his girlfriend or from contacting her unless they were discussing their child. He promptly violated that order by approaching her home and contacting her on social media.As Chief Justice John Roberts recounts in his majority opinion, when the police obtained a search warrant of Rahimi’s home to investigate the additional shootings, “they discovered a pistol, a rifle, ammunition — and a copy of the restraining order.”Rahimi was indicted on one count of possessing a firearm while subject to a domestic violence restraining order. He challenged the indictment, arguing that Section 922(g (8 , the law he was charged under, violated the Second Amendment. The trial court and the court of appeals initially rejected the argument, but while the 5th Circuit was considering his petition for a rehearing with the entire court, the Supreme Court decided Bruen.The appeals court then took a fresh look at his case, applying the Thomas test. It searched for clear historical matches and — unable to find any — held that the government failed “to demonstrate that § 922(g (8 ’s restriction of the Second Amendment right fits within our nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” If this ruling held, every person subject to a domestic violence restraining order could have immediate access to firearms, assuming no other legal restrictions applied.Even worse, if the 5th Circuit’s ruling had stood, lawmakers seeking to justify virtually any gun regulation would have to be prepared to find colonial or early-American analogies for their proposed restriction or watch it fail in court. This would have meant that lawmakers facing modern gun violence problems involving modern weapons would have been constrained into essentially colonial and founding-era legal solutions.In essence, that is the exact reverse of an argument that some gun control proponents make, that the Second Amendment protects only possession of colonial-era weapons. Under the Thomas test, the Second Amendment would permit only colonial-era restrictions.On Friday, eight justices of the Supreme Court not only ruled against Rahimi. They clarified their approach to text, history and tradition in a way that freed lower courts from the straitjacket of finding precise historical analogies. Roberts declared that “some courts have misunderstood the methodology of our recent Second Amendment cases.” The court’s precedents “were not meant to suggest a law trapped in amber.” Or, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote in her concurrence, “Historical regulations reveal a principle, not a mold.”As a practical matter, this means, as Roberts wrote, that “when a challenged regulation does not precisely match its historical precursors, ‘it still may be analogous enough to pass constitutional muster.’” Applying this more flexible framework, the court reached a holding that will echo beyond Rahimi’s case: “An individual found by a court to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another may be temporarily disarmed consistent with the Second Amendment.”Thomas was the lone dissenter in Rahimi. Five justices wrote their own concurrences, many of them arguing that the 5th Circuit misunderstood and misapplied Bruen. But Thomas argued that the 5th Circuit got the analysis right because the founding generation “addressed the same societal problem as §922(g (8 through the ‘materially different means’ of surety laws.”Surety laws required a person who was suspected of threatening “future misbehavior” to post a bond, a sum of money that he’d forfeit if he broke the law. If he didn’t post a bond, he’d be jailed. But such reliance on a specific, narrow past legislative approach isn’t required by originalism. It is, itself, a policy choice.Barrett put her objections well. “Imposing a test that demands overly specific analogues has serious problems,” she wrote. “It forces 21st-century regulations to follow late-18th-century policy choices, giving us ‘a law trapped in amber.’ And it assumes that founding-era legislatures maximally exercised their power to regulate, thereby adopting a ‘use it or lose it’ view of legislative authority.”“Such assumptions are flawed,” Barrett said, “and originalism does not require them.”© 2024 The New York Times CompanyWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_12,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Arecent Supreme Court decision striking down the Trump administration’s ban on bump stocks was a setback for public safety, but only a temporary one — provided Congress still has the courage to do the right thing.Bump stocks are attachments that allow a semiautomatic rifle to simulate an automatic one.There is no purpose to owning one other than to release a hail of bullets.In 2017, when a man set out to massacre as many people as possible at a concert in Las Vegas, he attached bump stocks to 14 rifles, fired more than 1,000 rounds, killed 60 people and wounded hundreds more.After the horror of that day, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives issued a rule prohibiting bump stocks under a long-standing law that bans machine guns and related devices.Now the court has concluded that the agency erred in doing so, and that guns equipped with bump stocks — whatever their effects — don’t constitute machine guns under the law.Writing for the court’s three dissenting members, Justice Sonia Sotomayor took a more practical approach: “When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.”Yet perhaps the most important words issued by the court belonged to Justice Samuel Alito. Noting that the Las Vegas shooting “demonstrated that a semiautomatic rifle with a bump stock can have the same lethal effect as a machinegun,” he made clear where responsibility lies.“There is a simple remedy for the disparate treatment of bump stocks and machineguns,” he wrote. “Congress can amend the law — and perhaps would have done so already if ATF had stuck with its earlier interpretation. Now that the situation is clear, Congress can act.”And indeed it must. Democrats have vowed to pass a bill explicitly outlawing bump stocks, and some Republicans have signaled their openness to negotiating.That’s only right, since few spoke out in opposition when the ATF banned bump stocks with President Donald Trump’s support.Unfortunately, time has a way of weakening resolve, and even the Trump campaign is now attempting to distance itself from the measure.The candidate who once mocked Republicans for fearing the gun lobby now seems to be ducking for cover.Further delay only increases the risk that future mass shooters — whether at concerts, churches, schools, supermarkets or anywhere else — will use these devices to terrible effect.Congress passed bipartisan gun legislation in 2022, and it should now do so again.To forestall further legal wrangling, it should make clear that all other rapid-fire devices, such as cranks and hellfire triggers, are illegal, too.Another court ruling, which upheld a ban on firearm possession by those under domestic-violence restraining orders, showed that common sense can still prevail on this issue.The families of the 60 people murdered in Las Vegas deserve no less.— Bloomberg Opinion"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_133,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°During closing arguments in Donald Trump’s felony trial Tuesday morning, his lawyer Todd Blanche said, “There’s a reason why, in life, usually the simplest answer is the right one.”I found this an odd approach, because to believe his theory of the case requires accepting several improbable things. First, although it’s not legally germane, Blanche reiterated, perhaps at the insistence of his client, that Trump “has unequivocally and repeatedly denied” any encounter with Stormy Daniels. And rather than simply arguing that Trump didn’t know about the scheme to reimburse Michael Cohen for the payoff to Daniels, he appears to be arguing that no such scheme existed.Cohen, said Blanche, had a verbal retainer agreement in 2017 to serve as Trump’s personal attorney, and that’s why he was paid $420,000. If that’s the case, it’s hard to imagine why Cohen pleaded guilty and served prison time in connection with the hush-money payment.Blanche’s argument has been internally inconsistent. First, he insisted that Trump, being busy as president, didn’t always look at the checks he signed. Then, trying to discredit the idea that Trump would reimburse Cohen $420,000 for a $130,000 payment — which Cohen has claimed was grossed up to include taxes and a bonus — Blanche pointed to “all the evidence you heard about how closely President Trump watches his finances.”During a long digression about the National Enquirer’s practice of “catching and killing” stories, he insisted that there had never been a “catch and kill” plot involving Playboy model Karen McDougal, implying, I think, that her deal with the publication was on the level. “She wanted to be on the cover of magazines; she wanted to write articles,” said Blanche, and that’s what she did.Obviously, I have no idea what the jury is thinking. But given the implausibility of the narrative that Trump’s defense is spinning, it just seems weird that Blanche is invoking Occam’s razor.In his closing argument Tuesday, Donald Trump’s lead defense attorney, Todd Blanche, repeatedly tried to sell a revisionist history of the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, in which Trump was recorded boasting of his penchant for sexual assault. In the felony case against Trump, the “Access Hollywood” tape is important because, in the story the prosecution is telling, it’s the reason Trump was desperate to quash Stormy Daniels’ story.“The government wants you to believe that the release of that tape from 2005 was so catastrophic to that campaign that it provided a motive for President Trump to do something criminal,” he said.Attempting to undercut that narrative, Blanche insisted that it really wasn’t that big of a deal. It caused, he said, a “couple days of frustration and consternation, but that happens all the time during campaigns.” He added: “The Access Hollywood tape is being set up in this trial to be something that it is not.”This is insultingly and obviously untrue. As longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks testified about that moment in the 2016 campaign, “I think there was consensus among us all that the tape was damaging, and this was a crisis.”We now know that a critical mass of voters doesn’t care about Trump’s misogyny and predation, but we didn’t know that then. One job of the prosecution will be to take the jury back to when people still imagined there were Republicans with a capacity for shame.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Emmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home.

minnpost_2024_16,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.I’m a professional commercial painter. I deal with toxic chemicals daily. In one of my first painting jobs, I worked 10-hour shifts overnight in a non-union company wiping down windows with an acetone-soaked rag, with no access to gloves, a respirator or other personal protective equipment.No one told me or the other workers on the site of the life-changing dangers associated with the unprotected use ofacetone, a dangerous solvent, and I continue to be impacted by skin injuries from my exposure to this day, over 10 years later.This isn’t a case of a single bad actor company — it’s emblematic of the pervasive failure of our state to keep Minnesota workers and consumers safe from deadly substances that require higher regulation.When private consumers use or are around hazardous solvent-based paints, they’re being put at risk for disfiguring chemical burns, permanent neurological damage, irreversible blindness, infertility, and so much more. In the worst-case scenario, you can die if you inhale a Category 1 solvent, likexylene, a paint thinner. It smells innocuous and sweet, but it’s deadly.Today, I’m a professional commercial painter and a member of IUPAT DC 82. Learning about the extreme levels of risk I took on working with solvents in non-union environments was eye-opening, and that is why I’m speaking out to warn Minnesotans about those dangers. Nothing this hazardous should be so readily available without increased worker and consumer protection.Solvent-based paint is what we use in infrastructure coatings projects, like on steel bridges and water towers. They’re very heavy-duty and can withstand large temperature and humidity fluctuations over time. For professional painters to use these paints safely, we train for years, and when they’re used, we wear hazmat-like suits, eye protection and respirators and contain the painting area with hundreds of yards of tarping to protect our neighbors from inhaling or coming into contact with these paints.The average homeowner does not need to take these extreme precautions if they’re painting their home, interior or exterior, because they do not have to use solvent-based paints to get the job done.Every day, home and business owners use solvent-based paint in their homes and offices with no protection to understand the risks. We have to do better.Even in the most well-trained job sites staffed by workers with years of specialized training and experience, the risk of solvent injury is still present. You’d be hard-pressed to find a professional commercial or industrial painter who hasn’t at least gotten minor chemical burns on the job or felt light-headed after work, even while using the best protective equipment money can buy. The public simply doesn’t have to take that kind of risk.The best way to protect workers and consumers is to ensure that only trained and licensed workers use these professional-grade products. Workers and the public should be educated about the hazards presented by these products if misused. Average homeowners should still be able to purchase paint and safe quantities of solvent-based products to complete home improvement projects. Irresponsible contractors that expose untrained workers to unlimited quantities of these products should be held accountable.Now is the time for the Minnesota Legislature to establish common-sense guidelines for the use of professional-grade paint products.Zach Thoemke, of New Brighton, is a commercial painter and organizer with IUPAT District Council 82 in the Twin Cities."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_164,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Whoever wins November’s election, inflation will present them with an immediate challenge. More than two years after the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to alleviate a pandemic-era price spike, the so-called core consumer price index remains well above the central bank’s target. It’s a bit puzzling, then, that former President Donald Trump’s economic agenda seems to be dedicated to raising prices.What policies would a second Trump administration pursue? The former president hasn’t been a model of clarity on the campaign trail, but some general themes have emerged.Tariffs, one of Trump’s only consistent enthusiasms, are a sure thing. Starting in 2018, his administration imposed several rounds of duties, prompting predictable retaliation. Combined, these measures eliminated jobs, slashed incomes and cost consumers about $51 billion annually. Now Trump wants to impose tariffs of 60% on Chinese-made products and 10% on other imports. Bloomberg Economics estimates that this would raise consumer prices by 2.5% over two years and reduce growth by 0.5%. Trump has also promised a 100% duty on imported cars. Details TBD — one analyst describes the likely effect as “catastrophic” — but the point is that trade wars of this kind are always prone to raising prices.Trump’s plans for monetary policy pose a similar risk. According to media reports, his advisers are laying the groundwork for the president to weigh in directly on interest-rate decisions. (His campaign has vaguely disputed these reports. The rationale for central-bank independence — among the most successful policy innovations of the post-war era — is that politicized monetary policy will tend to have a pro-inflationary bias. In this case, a self-fulfilling prophecy is likely: Consumers and businesses, expecting the Fed to tolerate higher inflation under Trump, will behave in ways that (once again boost prices. More directly, the former president is toying with devaluing the dollar. Although the hope is to revive domestic manufacturing, exactly how he’d carry out this plan isn’t clear. (Like many products of Trump World, it seems to be premised on a lot of needless belligerence. On balance, such manipulation is likely to invite retaliation, erode faith in the dollar and do little to actually boost exports. By raising the cost of imported goods and inputs for domestic producers, it would also (perhaps you’ve sensed a pattern increase prices.Trump’s tax plans, finally, would tend in the same direction. He says he’ll extend the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and has at times mused about a further reduction in the corporate rate, to 15% from 21%. Recall that the drafters of the law tied themselves in knots to avoid acknowledging its true costs (hence the expirations . Extending it in full would cost about $3.8 trillion by 2033. A 15% corporate rate would cost perhaps a half-trillion more. Trump’s plans for further tax cuts — “I’ll give you a Trump middle class, upper class, lower class, business class big tax cut,” he said at a rally on Saturday — remain rather nebulous, but fiscal discipline does not sound like the governing priority. It’s safe to say (at risk of repetition that these policies, too, will contribute to higher prices.Some caveats are in order. Trump doesn’t always mean what he says. Many of these policies may never come into effect, or may be partly neutralized by the Fed if they do.

leoweekly_2024_22,"At the end of January I took over as Executive Director for the Louisville Metro Housing Authority (LMHA , an agency that provides housing for over 30,000 people in our city. Our staff of 290 operates 36 developments throughout Jefferson County and provides over 11,000 Section 8 vouchers to help people afford rent in other properties. LMHA is a large organization with an even larger mandate – to provide safe, stable housing for Louisvillians who can’t find a home affordable to them in the private market.Like many housing authorities throughout the country, LMHA faces headwinds in fulfilling our mission. We have fallen short in many areas and must get back to the basics – being a good partner to the people we work with and a good landlord for the people we serve. To know how to get there, it’s helpful to know how we got where we are now.Ninety percent of LMHA’s funding is federal, which means Congress decides how much money we get to operate annually. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD then allocates resources and writes regulations for housing authorities. Over the years, the costs of keeping public housing in good repair have continually outpaced funding.Those are the parameters LMHA must budget and plan with each year for our public housing and mixed-income communities, our voucher program, and the special programs we offer residents for financial empowerment and more. This process is guided by me – the Executive Director – in collaboration with our Board of Commissioners.Despite the funding situation, I have hope that we can make positive things happen. To do that I will work closely with our residents, our Board, and our partners to lead LMHA in a new direction – one where all our residents feel pride in their homes, our staff is excited to come to work, and where the entire city of Louisville cheers us all on.This is going to take time, energy, and a multitude of resources, but there are immediate steps we can take to deliver short-term solutions, while building strategies for long-term success.Our first focus is on resident engagement and services. We have to rebuild a regular communication process so that our residents feel heard, have confidence that we’re being responsive to their needs and are aware of the work LMHA is doing.Second, LMHA must bolster safety and security at our properties. We are taking a holistic approach to community safety and resident service needs by partnering across city agencies. We’ve also improved our relationship with the police department and are investing in critical upgrades to secure entrancesand restore order. Our goal is to instill a sense of safety and security rather than chaos, which every person deserves in the place they call home.Third, we must stabilize the physical conditions of our properties. This is LMHA’s most basic responsibility as a landlord, and it is unacceptable that conditions have deteriorated at Dosker Manor, Avenue Plaza and Parkway Place. We will do better by fully staffing maintenance, property management and security. We will also address deficiencies more quickly and work to clean up and invest in properties to restore a sense of pride in the community.And, finally, we are planning now for the future. In the long-term we will do what we have done many times before at Park Duvalle, Beecher Terrace, Liberty Green, and Sheppard Square. We will reimagine what public housing can look like and bring our properties into the present day by delivering modern living accommodations that are clean, safe and a great place to live.We’ve got ambitious goals and we are determined to deliver meaningful results. To succeed, LMHA needs a bigger team with key leadership positions to bring new ideas and energy. We’re also going to fill staff vacancies for teams that directly interact with the Louisvillians we serve and our properties, particularly in the Section 8 department and on our maintenance team.To successfully fund this plan, we are going to need more resources and more partners. We will draw on the expertise of our partners and work with the best and brightest here and across the country to innovate how we operate.I won’t sugarcoat it – this is a big challenge. But let me end this note by sharing why I am so optimistic and energized by what I’ve seen during my short time in this role.Everyone wants LMHA to succeed. From our dedicated team members to residents, the Mayor, our board, HUD, city leaders and community partners, the message has been loud and clear: the city of Louisville needs LMHA. By working together, we’ll make sure LMHA’s future is bright. ( ."

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images/TNS The U.S. surgeon general is charged with monitoring the public health of the nation. In an advisory issued last week, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy identified a threat we’ve long discussed on these pages: gun violence. Murthy pointed out that guns have for a few years been the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the United States, outpacing even motor vehicles. Tens of thousands of people are killed every year.The surgeon general also honed in on an impact often ignored in conversations around guns, which is the heavy toll extending beyond violence itself. You don’t need to have directly experienced U.S. gun violence for this violence to have colored your life, as you sit in a movie theater and eyeball the exits or consider picking shoes you can run in as you head to a concert or a parade.In the grand scale of U.S. K-12 and post-secondary education, school shootings are rare, yet there’s hardly a student of any age who hasn’t wondered if it’ll be their turn next, or spent the days after an active-shooter drill unable to focus on their schoolwork.This is all a choice that we’ve made, not all at once but over time, as gun manufacturers moved from selling weapons as tools to representations of independence and masculinity, with guns once reserved for military use modified slightly to be sold hand-over-fist to civilian consumers.It’s a choice made by right-wing politicians who have decided that no amount of carnage will dislodge their desire to use gun fanaticism as a political pressure point and pressure groups like the NRA, which has at this point abandoned support for even the mildest gun restrictions.And it’s a choice made by judges, including those on the Supreme Court, who have conjured up an individual right to firearms that was not really set forth in the Constitution and chipped away at democratically-enacted limitations.The advisory by itself cannot change public perceptions or policy, but it does bring the weight of the nation’s top health official down solidly on one side, which cannot as easily be dismissed as pure politics. These types of advisories have moved the needle on all sorts of other issues that were once considered matters of significant public controversy and have since been all but settled, from the danger of cigarettes to the benefits of seat belts.Still, for maximum effect, we need significant political will followed by concrete action. This action shouldn’t just be reactive to the next big headline-grabbing public tragedy, as sadly likely as the next one is to come soon.It must come from a place of making an affirmative case that it is in the best interests of all — including responsible gun owners and law enforcement — for much more concrete regulation of firearms.Despite its various missteps on this issue, the Supreme Court at least left the door open for lawmakers to keep guns out of the hands of clearly dangerous people with its recent ruling upholding a federal law blocking sales to people convicted of domestic violence.Let’s have more of that, more bans on guns in certain sensitive areas, more red flag processes, more time limits and background checks, fewer guns in fewer hands. It’s a matter of public health, after all.— New York Daily NewsIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."

eugeneweekly_2024_24,"We ve got issues. Recently, I attended a showing of the documentaryInto the Canyon.It is the story of two men hiking the length of the Grand Canyon to raise awareness of ongoing threats to the canyon despite its protected status. Following the movie, I had the privilege, as a panel member, to help answer questions about the continuing conservation efforts to preserve and protect Oregon’s Grand Canyon — the Owyhee Canyonlands. Currently, efforts to create an Owyhee Canyonlands National Monument are heating up, and the threats to the Owyhee region are the same as depicted in the documentary movie: uncontrolled development, mining, recreation and aircraft flyovers. Many good questions came from the audience. One that stood out for me was this: “Why haven’t we heard more about this effort to create a National Monument?” The loss of an editorial page in our daily newspaper is one reason. However, it was pointed out to me that we still had theEugene Weekly. And one person suggested, “What about radio programming?” All good points, and I thank those who attended for your suggestions. This guest viewpoint is my way to help remedy the lack of recent information on this topic. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The Owyhee is a region where the three states of Idaho, Oregon and Nevada conjoin. It’s a huge area with over 9 million acres of wilderness-quality public lands. Most of it remains free of paved roads, creating one of the largest, and increasingly rare, intact sagebrush environments in the lower 48 states. You simply will not find yourself there on the way to anywhere else. Despite growing up in Oregon and spending time in her deserts, I did not know that our sagebrush steppes were unique to the North American continent. Take a moment to think about that. Nowhere else on our planet will you find sagebrush steppes like the ones we enjoy. So it should come as no surprise that there are nearly 30 plant species found nowhere else on Earth but in this landscape. There are over 200 species of wildlife that live in the Owyhee: pronghorn antelope, pygmy rabbits, the imperiled greater sage-grouse, many raptors, California bighorn sheep, cougar, bobcat, mule deer and elk to name a few. The Owyhee basin provides some of the last, best habitat for redband trout, a unique “desert-type” trout, according to the nonprofit Trout Unlimited. In addition, there are hundreds of known archaeological sites in the Owyhee. And it is the ancestral home to the Shoshone, Paiute and Bannock tribes with many locations in the region sacred to their communities. When we are in the Owyhee region, the solitude, the night skies and the quiet are unsurpassed. Within its canyon walls, the river has carved out a corridor lined with hoodoos and spires leaving us with some of the best examples of rhyolite formations in the world. And yet only 5 percent of the Owyhee Canyonlands are permanently protected. Thirty years ago, isolation still protected the Owyhee. But that is no longer true. As neighboring Idahoans (fast-approaching a million people in the Treasure Valley , Oregonians and others have discovered the beauty of the Owyhee, they have also discovered that access to Oregon’s portion of the region is the most accessible. With uncontrolled recreation, invasive plant species, mining claims, uncontrolled development and a request by the U.S. Air Force to use the Owyhee for supersonic fighter jet training threatening the area, we stand to lose it all. The latest broadly supported proposal to protect that portion of the Owyhee in southeast Oregon was developed by Sen. Ron Wyden (S.1890 and cosponsored by Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley. However, congressional action appears unlikely. So ONDA, the Oregon Natural Desert Association, is asking President Joe Biden to establish a National Monument in Oregon that mirrors the senate bill — protecting 1.25 million acres of public land in Oregon’s Malheur County. An Owyhee Canyonlands National Monument would safeguard these lands and waters that have cultural, historic, ecological and scientific importance for you and future generations to enjoy. To learn more about protecting the Owyhee and creating a National Monument, and to answer any remaining questions you have, go to ONDA’s website atProtecttheowyhee.organd read the monument proposal, check out their frequently asked questions, and then join me in signing the petition now."
minnpost_2024_41,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.There have been massive gains in productivity over the past century.So why are people still working so hard for so long?Output per workerincreased by almost 300% between 1950 and 2018in the U.S. The standard American workweek, meanwhile, has remained unchanged, at about 40 hours.This paradox is especially notable in the U.S., where theaverage work year is 1,767 hours compared with 1,354 in Germany, a difference largely due to Americans’lack of vacation time.Some might argue that Americans are just more hardworking. But shouldn’t more productive work be rewarded with more time free from work?This is the central theme of my new book, “Free Time: The History of an Elusive Ideal.”Many economistssee the status quo mostly as a choice: People would simply rather have more money. So they prioritize work over free time.However, in the past, many economists assumed that people’s need for more stuff would eventually be met. At that point, they would choose more free time.In fact, one of the most famous economists of the 20th century, John Maynard Keynes,confidently predicted in 1930that within a century, the normal workweek would decrease to 15 hours. Yet Americans in their prime working age are still on the job 41.7 hours per week.Why was Keynes wrong?Obviously, people’s needs or wants were not fully met. In the first half of the 20th century,advertising shiftedin ways that emphasized emotions over utility, making consumers feel like they needed to buy more stuff;planned obsolescenceshortened how long products remained functional or fashionable, spurring more frequent purchases; and new, exciting – but costly – goods and services kept consumerism churning.So workers continued to labor for long hours to earn enough money to spend.Furthermore, as wages rose, the opportunity cost of time spent away from work also grew. This made more free time less economically appealing. In a consumption-saturated society, time spent neither producing nor consuming goods increasingly appeared as wasted time.Interest in slower, cheaper activities — reading a book, meeting a friend to catch up over coffee — started to seem less important than buying a pickup truck or spending an hour at the casino, pursuits that demand disposable income.It’s still important to consider whether there’s even any choice to be made.Almost everyone who works 40 hours a week or more does so because they have to. There are bills to pay, health insurance coverage to maintain and retirement to squirrel away money for. Some jobs are more precarious than others, and many workers even foregoearned vacation time for fear of losing promotions.This hardly makes for a free choice.But the 40-hour week isn’t the result of a personal calculation of costs and benefits. Rather, it’s the result of a hard-fought political battle that culminated in theFair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the standard 40-hour workweek, along with a minimum wage.Pressed by a labor movementthat was far more powerful than today’s, the government implemented a range of progressive economic policies during the 1930s to help the nation emerge from the Great Depression.Many government officials viewed setting a standard workweek as a way to curtail exploitation and unfair competition among employers, who would otherwise be motivated to push their employees to work for as long as possible. It was an emergency measure, not a choice of more time over more personal income. Nor was it a step toward the progressive reduction of hours worked, as Keynes had envisioned.In fact, it was hardly a radical measure.Labor leaders had initially proposed a 30-hour week, which government officials resoundingly rejected. Even New Deal liberals saw a shortening of working hours as apotential threat to economic growth.So the 40-hour week ended up as the compromise, and the standard hasn’t been updated since.For most Americans, this was an acceptable trade-off. They might be working long hours, but they could afford television sets, cars and homes in the suburbs. Many families could live on the wages of the full-time work of the father, making the 40-hour week seem reasonable, since the mother had time to care for the family and home.But this consensus has long since been undermined. Since the 1970s, inflation-adjustedwages haven’t risen with economic growth. In many households that include married or partnered couples, a single wage earner has been replaced by two earners, both of whom find themselves working at least 40 hours per week.It’s almost as if the 40-hour week has been replaced by an 80-hour week — at least interms of hours worked per household.Who has time to raise kids? Who can afford them? It’s no wonderthe birth rate has declined.For decades, the amount of work we do has been talked about as “just the way things are” — an inevitability, almost. It doesn’t seem possible for society to take a different tack and, like flipping a switch, work less.To me, this resignation points to a need to reconsider the social contracts of the past. Most Americans will not abandon their work ethic and their insistence that most people work. Fair enough.Many people prefer working over having vast stores of free time, and that’s OK. And there’s still immense value in work that doesn’t produce a paycheck — caregiving and volunteering, for example.But reducing the standard workweek, perhaps by transitioning to a four-day week, could ease stress for overworked families.These changes require political action, not just individuals making the personal choice to arrive at a better work-life balance. And yet a national reduction in the standard work week seems almost impossible. Congress can’t evenpass legislation for paid family leaveor guaranteed vacation time.It doesn’t help that elected leaders continue to insist that well-being be measured mostly by economic growth, and when the U.S. media breathlessly reports quarterly economic growth data, with increases deemed “good” and decreases deemed “bad.”Why shouldn’t free time and its benefits be included in the equation? Why aren’t figures on the social costs of unlimited growth publicized? Does it even matter thatthe Dow Jones Industrial Averagehas doubled in less than a decade when economic security is so fragile andso many people are overstressed?The idea that stratospheric increases in productivity can allow for more time for life is not simply a romantic or sentimental idea. Keynes viewed it as entirely reasonable.Opportunities like the one that led to the 40-hour workweek in the 1930s rarely appear. But some sort of paradigm shift is urgently needed.Something has to give.Gary Crossis the Distinguished Professor of Modern History at Penn State.This article is republished from The Conversation."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_53,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°President Joe Biden, who insists his presumptive GOP opponent is a dire “threat to democracy” and a potential “dictator,” openly brags about ignoring the U.S. Supreme Court when it comes to student loans. Judges are finally taking notice.On Tuesday, federal courts in Kansas and Missouri blocked parts of yet another White House effort to buy votes by unilaterally rewriting the law on student loan payments.The Supreme Court last year struck down the administration’s plan to forgive up to $10,000 in balances for most borrowers, ruling that only Congress may implement such a policy.But Biden has cynically continued to “work around” the decision, canceling about 10 percent of the $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loan obligations.The rulings this week came after 11 states filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a program the Department of Education recently created to provide debt relief to those holding student loans.Borrowers who enrolled in the SAVE initiative — about 8 million people — were supposed to see their monthly payments significantly reduced and eventually eliminated if they had been current on their accounts for a decade.But SAVE is on hold after two federal judges agreed with the states, who argued that the White House had again exceeded its authority.It’s worth remembering that student loan forgiveness plans don’t really erase debt. They simply shift the burden from the borrowers to the American taxpayer.Note that the Congressional Budget Office recently cited student loan amnesty as one of the drivers of the exploding federal deficits under this president.In addition, forgiveness plans not only further erode the vital concepts of personal and fiscal responsibility, they are a slap in the face to those who met their obligations, avoided student loan debt or never attended college.The federal student loan program — nationalized under the Obama administration under the guise that it would generate a profit — is an expensive mess in drastic need of reform. But Biden and his fellow Democrats offer little of substance other than backdoor attempts to make college “free” for anyone who can breathe.Meanwhile, the government continues to hand out billions to young adults with little credit history in hopes they can eventually pay it back.Of greater importance, the president’s repeated and willful insistence on ignoring the Supreme Court makes a mockery of his supposed fealty to “democracy” and highlights how Biden has elevated his own political survival over fiscal sanity and the separation of powers.That the federal courts are now throwing up roadblocks is a victory for the rule of law.— Las Vegas Review-JournalA 71-year-old Hilo man pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree negligent homicide for the Oct. 3, 2023, traffic collision death of a 79-year-old Hilo woman."
leoweekly_2024_34,"The score is45-3, your team is the 3. It’s the middle of the fourth quarter, it’s sleeting, and you’re still there. You love your team. But no one loves them more than the cheerleaders. There they stand on the sidelines, smiling through the cold rain and certain defeat like it’s Spring Break and the team is minutes away from a championship, shouting unhelpfully but optimistically “Go Team!” and “You Can Do It!” God bless their hearts.There’s a time and place for cheerleaders. That time, though, is not now, and the place is not the existential trough the Democratic Party has dug for itself and from which President Biden presented himself to voters last week. In fact, it’s cheerleading that got us here and cheerleading that will lose us not a game but a Republic. It’s long past time for smiling numbly through this political sleet storm and time for tough decisions including the most important one: Joe Biden must go. Not because he’s old. Because he’s going to lose.The stakes of this election were already clear before the Supreme Court decision on July 1. But that corrupt, partisan court’s decision to grant effective absolute immunity to Donald Trump and his Project 2025 put the question of who should be his opponent in the most stark relief possible. Understand this: Trump v. United States is the worst and most dangerous decision in the history of the Supreme Court, a Court that decided in 1857 to send a slave back to his so-called owners. A nation of laws has at least a chance to some day rectify the shame of slavery. The Trump decision means we are no longer that nation.In the hours since the Wreck At Georgia Tech, self-identifying Democratic Faithful have (a pretended everything is OK like teeth-clenched cheerleaders on the wrong side of an embarrassing trouncing (b exhorted likely Democratic voters to try harder (give more money and (c accused Progressives daring to tell the truth about the President of betrayal. This isn’t a surprise, and it’s not going to work.Politics is about creating the world we wish for, but campaigns are conducted in the world in which we exist. In that world it’s political malpractice to ignore *everyone’s* immediate and visceral reaction to the President’s debate appearance and performance. Evidence of this is the current focus upon what the President did, how he looked and how he sounded. Lost in this is the previously obvious (now obscured point that he was on stage for 90 minutes with a convicted felon spouting demonstrable and juvenile lies who has described out loud his plans to dismantle our democratic republic and was unable to effectively challenge him. We need someone who can and will. Desperately.This is not a criticism of Joe Biden or a condemnation of the elderly. Frankly, we don’t have time for that now. He’s fit and nimble enough, physically and mentally, for his age. More fit and nimble than many Americans half his age. This also isn’t about your father or someone who’s capable of doing a job at an advanced age and, unfortunately, it isn’t even about whether Biden himself can do the job at his advanced age. The very real immediate and practical problem is that he does not appear to be able to. These appearances matter. Most people listening on the radio to the Nixon-Kennedy debate believed Nixon won. Those watching on TV, having watched a sweaty and shadowy Nixon, believed Kennedy did. Nixon’s performance was Jordan-esque compared to President Biden’s.In ordinary times, this would be a different discussion. But the position the President occupies has regrettably become our last best chance, and it’s become obvious that it’s only wishful thinking that this burden should now be on his 81-year-old shoulders. This is about candor in the service of denying the presidency to a Fascist in the world that exists now. None of the following is a good enough reason to continue to support a candidate it must be assumed will not beat Donald Trump: Affection. Loyalty. Nostalgia. Logistics. All of that is just cheerleading. This isn’t a basketball game or a high school dance, and if we are compelled to “dance with the one who brung us” we’ll end up goose-stepping our way out of the gym.Also, while this administration has reasons to brag, no doubt, this President was already a damaged candidate. His unwavering support of Israel and its genocidal strategy and tactics in Gaza has cost him substantial support among voters he would otherwise count on. A new candidate could be the Cease-Fire candidate rather than the Arm-Netanyahu candidate. A new candidate also avoids the real challenges faced by incumbent candidates now across the Western democratic political world.It’s a feature of American politics that people proudly “vote for the man not the party.” This is not the time for that, either. To the extent Biden’s cheerleaders are wearing sweaters with his initials or logo on them, they need to exchange them for ones bearing the Constitution. It may be their last chance to wear them.*** ."

Kennedy Jr. just got McCained.The New York Times reported Wednesday that the independent candidate for president had some health issues in recent years, including an abnormality caused by a worm that entered his brain and eventually died.Kennedy revealed this info as part of a 2012 deposition during his divorce from second wife Mary Richardson Kennedy.The Times didn’t stop there: It reported that Kennedy suffered from mercury poisoning at about the same time, which can lead to memory loss. Kennedy told the paper he has recovered from the memory loss and brain fogginess and that the parasite did not require treatment.If this sounds familiar, it should. In the 2000 election, Sen. John McCain was coming up fast on George W. Bush. He was a respected member of Congress and a war hero to boot. And he was stealing Bush’s thunder.Enter Karl Rove, the man who would become Bush’s deputy chief of staff.As The Nation reported in 2014, Rove was working for Bush, and his campaign “featured a widely disseminated rumor that John McCain, tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, had betrayed his country under interrogation and been rendered mentally unfit for office.”The smear, that being tortured in a POW camp had affected his mental health, dogged McCain on the campaign trail.That’s how the swamp deals with spoilers.The Times goes on to report on RFK Jr.’s experience with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat. He told the Times it has been more than a decade since he experienced the condition and said he believes he no longer suffers from it.“The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health. Questioning Mr. Kennedy’s health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,” Stefanie Spear, a spokesperson for Kennedy’s campaign said in a statement to CNN.There you have it: the competition. President Joe Biden is 81 and keeps racking up instances of flubbing words and stumbling on stairs and stages. Former President Donald Trump, 77, has been roundly mocked for appearing to fall asleep during parts of his hush money trial in New York.At 70, Kennedy’s shirtless workout videos have gone viral. What better way to undermine his image than plant the seed of worm-induced mental issues that could affect his performance in the White House?Kennedy has dug in his heels as a third-party challenger to Biden and Trump. As The Hill reported, he has been averaging close to 10% in polling from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, making him the highest polling third-party candidate in a presidential race since businessman Ross Perot in 1992. It’s not close to Biden or Trump, but it’s enough to put the fear of losing voters in their respective campaigns.Polls are divided over who Kennedy could hurt more, which makes him a threat to both candidates. The Rovian reveal of Kennedy’s past medical issues may hurt him, or not.Theoretically, our nation embodies freedom of choice, and our leaders hail this ideal.

I encourage Minnesotans to set a new, modern trajectory for statewide water resource management by adopting and funding statewide plans to accomplish the following goals:In conclusion, by appointing a water leader and taking a few key, bold steps, Minnesota can change the downward trajectory of state water quality, and improve our state’s overall public health and economic vitality.Jeremy Lenz, a water consultant, lives in Northfield."
eugeneweekly_2024_32,"We ve got issues. In the final weeks of 2023, two far-reaching policy processes were unveiled by the U.S. Forest Service that will affect public forest lands across Oregon. Public comment periods are open on both until Feb. 2. The Forest Service proposes to amend the Northwest Forest Plan, which covers more than 24 million acres of national forestlands in Oregon, Washington and northern California. The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP , a compromise enacted in 1994, aimed to protect and restore old-growth forests and healthy stream habitat for threatened species while still facilitating logging on public lands. The proposed amendment process focuses on addressing changed conditions around wildfire risk, climate change, old-growth forests, tribal engagement and rural communities and workforce. At the same time, the Biden administration has announced a new plan to protect old-growth forests by amending forest plans nationwide. This proposal comes in response to Biden’s 2022 Executive Order on conserving mature and old-growth forests as a climate solution and last year’s proposed rulemaking that garnered 500,000 public comments in support of such protections. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Forest plans, required under federal law for National Forests managed by the U.S. Forest Service, may not be foremost on the mind of most people out enjoying hiking, camping or rafting on public lands; however, these plans define and affect the uses — from recreation to logging — allowed in different areas of National Forests as well as the wildlife habitat, water quality and ecosystems found there. In Oregon, most forest plans were completed in 1989-90. Plans were intended to be revised every 15 years or when conditions significantly change. While an official plan revision has not been done for any of Oregon’s national forests to date, a major amendment occurred with the Northwest Forest Plan in the early 1990s. Decades of logging in national forests led to old-growth forest- and stream-dependent species being listed under the Endangered Species Act (the well-known northern spotted owl, as well as marbled murrelets and Pacific salmon species . The NWFP was developed as an attempt to strike a balance between logging and protecting habitat these species needed to survive. The plan defined areas for protecting and restoring old-growth habitat, set aside streamside areas to protect water quality and salmon habitat, set strong standards for restoring forests and watersheds that were previously logged and set targets for ongoing timber harvest. Conservationists largely tout the success of the NWFP in restoring some of the damage done by decades of logging, protecting drinking water, keeping other wildlife off the endangered species list, restoring salmon runs, stabilizing the climate, and improving quality of life, which is the foundation of the growing regional economy. But the compromise nature of the plan also meant that logging of mature and old-growth forests is still allowed in some areas, including ecologically critical watersheds and habitats. The timber industry has argued the Northwest Forest Plan has restricted its access to extraction on public lands and that commercial logging should be ramped back up toward previous levels, while conceding that protecting some “exceptionally old” trees may be warranted. Efforts to weaken the conservation measures of the NWFP were initiated before the ink was even dry on the compromise. Eventually, opponents of the plan succeeded, and in 2016, the Bureau of Land Management removed 2 million acres from the conservation framework of the NWFP, shrinking streamside reserves to just half their previous size and allowing more intense logging even in areas reserved for habitat. In 2015, the Forest Service began considering if and how to revise the NWFP. The USFS held public listening sessions and completed an assessment of the plan and a science synthesis to inform the revision, but the effort was then paused during the Trump administration. In 2023, a federal advisory committee was convened to inform potential amendments to forest plans in western Oregon, western Washington and northwest California, and in December, the USFS released official notice with an amendment proposal. Further analysis and another comment period will follow later this year. In the meantime, the federal advisory committee continues to meet periodically — including over three days in Eugene coming up from Jan. 30 through Feb. 1. Citing “changed ecological and social conditions” and “substantial new information relevant” regarding recovery plans and critical habitat for spotted owls and executive orders around forests and climate change,the proposal focuses on change needed in five topic areas, but without a clear description of what the changes might entail: One notable change is the inclusion of additional national forests in the Klamath and eastern Cascade regions that tend to have dryer and more fire-dependent forest ecosystems than those in the original NWFP. Conservation groups analyzing the proposal are concerned that the vague language of the proposed amendment leaves room for logging of mature and old-growth forests under the guise of fuel reduction, and the inclusion of more fire-dependent forests in the amendment validates those suspicions. They are also concerned that the proposal doesn’t do enough to prioritize carbon storage and sequestration to address climate change. Other concerns not addressed in the proposed amendment include the ramifications of the BLM’s exit from the NWFP in 2016 and the accelerated timeline of the proposed amendment process that could undermine the incorporation of Indigenous Knowledge and tribal involvement. Also in December, the Biden administration announced aproposed nationwide forest plan amendmentto advance protections for the remaining old-growth trees in all of the country’s National Forests. The proposal, and amendment when adopted, would add new restrictions on old-growth logging and is a step toward fulfilling President Biden’s Earth Day 2022 Executive Order 14072, which directed the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to develop policies to protect mature and old growth forests on federal lands as a natural carbon and climate solution. There has never before been a proposal to end commercial logging of old-growth on all national forests. In a statement released last month, members of theClimate Forests Campaign, a coalition of more than 120 organizations working to protect mature and old-growth trees and forests on federal land, welcomed the announcement as an important step forward while urging the Forest Service to pursue steps to protect mature trees. Both old-growth and mature forests are essential to removing climate-warming carbon pollution from the air and storing it, safeguarding wildlife and providing clean drinking water for our communities. In theinventory and definitionsof these types of forests released in April 2023 by the Forest Service, mature forests were defined as “the stage of forest development immediately before old growth.” Scientists warn that protecting these mature forests is essential for providing future old growth, which is currently severely depleted nation-wide. In addition to the critique of excluding mature forests from the amendment, conservationists also noted the loopholes for continued old-growth logging in the proposal. This national amendment could impact the proposed Northwest Forest Plan change as well, taking precedence over any guidance that might allow ongoing old-growth logging. The amendment would not, however, apply to lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, where several Oregon timber sale projects in mature and old-growth forests are in progress. The BLM is due out with a draft Conservation Rule this spring, which may also address the issue of these forests. This scoping periods open now are an opportunity for the public to weigh in on the proposed amendments. Comments on both are due on or before February 2, 2024.

minnpost_2024_1,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Ifthe Yippies– a group of young activists known for political dissent – had their way, Americans would have elected a 145-pound pig named Pigasus as president in 1968.The Yippies were famous for their unconventional tactics andwere at the heart of the 1960s counterculture movementin the U.S. They demanded that Pigasus be treated as a legitimate candidate with Secret Service protection and foreign policy briefings.Police arrested several Yippies for disorderly conduct after they paraded Pigasus outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Pigasus wastaken into “protective custody”by police and eventually wound up at a farm.Since thefirst Democratic National Convention in 1832, the event has had a long and storied history with headline-grabbing moments – some of which have left a mark in politics.The Democratic Party has converged at its convention in Chicago, where Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will officially accept their party’s nomination as the Democratic candidates for president and vice president.Asa scholar of the presidency, I think it is useful to remember that national political conventions often function like pep rallies, leading up to the big game of the general presidential election. These conventions can be places where new faces are launched, or they can be so dull that the country is functionally put to sleep. Here are a few of the more memorable moments to emerge from a Democratic National Convention.In 1940, Eleanor Roosevelt became the first first lady to ever address the Democratic National Convention.Democrats at the convention were divided over both the U.S.’s participation in World War II and the prospect of nominating Franklin Delano Roosevelt, or FDR, as he was known, to a third term. No president had served more than two terms at this point. It was about a decade before the22nd Amendment was ratified and became part ofthe Constitution, restricting presidents to two terms in office.FDR was trying to break a two-term presidency tradition thatstarted with George Washington.Eleanor Roosevelt got up in front of the contentious and squabbling convention and said, “This is no ordinary time. No time for weighing anything except what we can do best for the country as a whole, and that responsibility rests on each and every one of us as individuals.”Eleanor Roosevelt’s influential speech helped reframe the first lady as a powerful advocate for the president,without being simply a mouthpiecefor him. Her depiction of 1940 as “no ordinary time” helped people accept that the country was facing an extraordinary moment in history that needed consistent leadership.Roosevelt won another two terms and went on to serve as president untilhis death in 1945 during his fourth term.Years later, when John F. Kennedy accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in 1960, he said that voters needed to choose “between national greatness and national decline.” Kennedy’s speech, known as the “New Frontier,” helped show voters that a Kennedy presidency could overcome problems with a forward-looking vision.“Today our concern must be with that future. For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will not do,” Kennedy said.Kennedy also called for a new Americathat was not weighed down by nostalgia.Texas politician Ann Richards also supercharged her career with a Democratic National Convention keynote address in 1988. Her speech, funny and sharp, was also a commentary on the growing role of women in politics – and what an achievement it represented.In her opening words, Richards talked about Fred Astaire, one of the most famous Hollywood movie stars in the 1930s, as well as Ginger Rogers, his co-star and dance partner.“Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels,”Richards said.Richards skewered the perception that Astaire was the bigger star by pointing out Rogers was every bit as capable and talented – and even did it in uncomfortable shoes.At the time, Richards was the treasurer of Texas. But her witty speech propelled her into the national spotlight and helped herbecome governor of Texas in 1991.In 2004, Barack Obama, then a 43-year-old Illinois state senator, launched himself on the national scene with his speech at theDemocratic National Convention.Obamagave a passionate speechpaying tribute to his background, stating, “I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible.”And he offered a self-deprecating observation, saying the country embodied “the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too.The audacity of hope!” These ideas of hope and unity later became key hallmarks of Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.Obama’s speech outshone the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, and helped position him as the party’s rising star. News commentatorChris Matthews noted after Obama’s speech, “We’ve just seen the first black president.”Some speeches are so memorable, they are even recycled.Michelle Obama, the wife of then-Sen. Barack Obama, memorably stressed the importance of dignity and hard work in her speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention – the convention at which her husband was formally nominated for president.Obama said thatshe and Barack wereraised with the same values:“That you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you’re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you don’t know them, and even if you don’t agree with them.”Melania Trumpheavily paraphrased this speechin her2016 Republican National Committee speech. She, too, said that her parents raised her with values – “that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise, that you treat people with respect.”Trump’s speechwriter, Meredith McIver, took responsibility for the blunder, since she thought the draft speech shared with her contained Melania’s words. But in reality, Trump had given her Obama’s speech asan idea for what she wanted incorporatedin her own speech.I believe that national party conventions matter only for moments of mistake or magic. While these events are supposed to motivate voters and help reach out to the undecided, modern conventions more often are uninspired echo chambers of blather.They do little to sway swing voters and only offer confirmation to voters already committed to their choice. Everyone in the audience is there to cheer and be energized by their home team.Moments of greatness are far and few between at national conventions. But when lightning strikes, it can turn a phrase into an iconic moment that encapsulates an entire era.Shannon Bow O’Brienis associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at Austin.This article is republished from The Conversation."
philinquirer_2024_83,"Philadelphia needs a cultural shift among SEPTA riders to restore the social contract that has eroded.TheSEPTA Bus Revolutionaims to modernizePhiladelphia’s aging bus system, which has stagnated for decades. Its goals include increasing ridership, enhancing reliability, improving speed, and expanding service hours. Despite three years of community engagement and planning — including dozens of public hearings, transit talks, open houses, community conversations, and pop-up events — the initiative is now being delayed after amember of City Council requested additional public hearings. While this move incurred costs, there’s hope it will lead to positive changes, rather than mere political posturing.During the delay, SEPTA is focusing on other system improvements, such as station branding,enhancing wayfinding, and installingnew fare gatesto combat fare evasion. Yet, these efforts alone cannot fully address Philadelphia’s transit challenges. Fixing SEPTA is not just SEPTA’s responsibility.What’s needed is a cultural shift among SEPTA riders — a “BusRiderRevolution” — to restore the social contract that has eroded.The social contract, asphilosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau defines it, essentially represents collective will aimed at the common good. In that sense, the SEPTA rider social contract is clearly lacking.Fare evasion alone costs SEPTA up to $40 million annually, according to recent reports. Whilefederal grantsprovide much-needed funding, smoking, drug use, littering, and disruptive behaviors persist.SEPTA has ramped up enforcement and support systems likeSCOPE— which stands for safety, cleaning, ownership, partnership, and engagement — a system-wide approach to connect vulnerable individuals with social services and provide a safe, clean transit system for riders and employees.But without a shared commitment from riders to the social contract, these efforts are limited. Many passengers fear confronting rule-breakers or being seen as interfering, perpetuating a cycle of individualism and dissatisfaction.To initiate a Bus Rider Revolution, riders must reclaim ownership of the transit system. Recognizing that SEPTA serves diverse needs — from commuting to leisure — we must collectively ensure its safety, cleanliness, and inclusivity. Relying solely on gates and officers isn’t enough; every rider must prioritize the collective experience.I encourage people to speak up about an incident or disruptive passenger. While it can be daunting to do so, we all have a responsibility to ensure safety and well-being on SEPTA. Options for reporting incidents, such ascontacting SEPTA Transit Police, using the “text-a-tip” line (215-234-1911 , or utilizing theSEPTA Transit Watch App, are available.Efforts are in progress to integrate these features into SEPTA’s main app for enhanced convenience. If you don’t have time to report an incident in the moment, make a note or send a message to yourself so that when you do have time, you can share.Maintaining cleanliness is also essential for fostering a pleasant transit environment. This involves both actively picking up trash and promptly reporting any issues. Riders should responsibly dispose of their personal trash when they leave the bus or train.Inclusivity is another key aspect, which includes respecting designated seating arrangements, such as Americans with Disabilities Act-designated spots, and willingly yielding to fellow passengers who need them when necessary. Being mindful of actions, like refraining from playing loud music without headphones, contributes to creating a welcoming atmosphere for all commuters.By fostering a culture where everyone respects the social contract and prioritizes the enjoyment of all passengers, SEPTA’s progress can accelerate.In the 1990s,SEPTA’s slogan was “We’re Getting There.”Though SEPTA has since distanced itself from that iconic slogan, maybe it should be revisited and refined to embody a journey toward a more cohesive, respectful transit community.This journey requires active participation from every rider. Because it is not just SEPTA that needs to “get there.” We all need SEPTA. It’s how students get to school so they can grow and learn. It’s how parents and guardians get to work. It’s how visitors experience the Greater Philadelphia area. It’s how communities thrive.SEPTA is more than just a transportation system; it plays a pivotal role in shaping our daily lives.While infrastructure upgrades are vital, true transformation hinges on the collective actions of all riders. If we adhere to the social contract and a shared commitment to fostering a positive transit environment, Philadelphia can embark on a new era of public transportation.Tariem Burroughs is a sociologist who has spent much of his career working at the intersection of public health and community advocacy. He is currently the chair of the SEPTA Citizen Advisory Committee and is a lifelong Philadelphian and SEPTA rider."

Let me explain.Theater experience, including as an operetta’s lead, accustomed me to playing roles and using costumes, wigs, prosthetics, makeup and props. Overcoming stage fright, memorizing lines, following scripts, hitting marks, responding to cues, rehearsing and stepping out of one’s comfort zone were routine. Occasionally, I “broke the fourth wall” (addressed the audience, drew them in, incorporated them into the show .Spycraft shares these elements, most under different names — cover, roleplaying, disguise, props, sangfroid, jitters, chunking, signals, ops meeting planning sessions, recruiting the agent.Indeed, entering operational scenarios is akin to stepping onto a stage, butterflies included, with more improv.Like an actor, an officer operating under another persona draws from personal experience to get into character. Example? Headquarters once tasked me to assess for recruitment as a clandestine agent a biological weapons target. I established a bond by exploiting a mutual interest and experience in beekeeping.(Closer to home, consider Japanese Noh performers. Ops officers, too, wear masks — figuratively, as they assume identities, and for real (check out former CIA technical officer Antonio Mendez’s classic book “The Master of Disguise” .As a senior ops manager — including talent scouting for our employee recruitment center — I developed an appreciation for applicants and newbies who could summon the Muses, irrespective of college alma mater, military service, business chops, foreign languages. On the street, I more often needed a subordinate with thespian skills matching the range and intensity of Gary Oldman than someone who could handle a weapon or spout poli-sci theory.Consider the versatility of the person who can seamlessly and believably step out of the door as a nondescript U.S. official, a businessman in fully backstopped alias, or a formidable CIA agent handler in disguise, as needed. Relatedly, some famous actors — Cary Grant included — have dabbled as spies, and the longstanding CIA-Hollywood relationship is well-documented (check out Ben Affleck’s film “Argo .Starkly different between the theater and cloak-and-dagger world (aside from the stakes is recognition. No standing ovation for the spy. No media coverage (unless something goes off script . Lack of recognitionisrecognition (that one has performed a clandestine act and gotten away . Awards are sometimes granted in small, private ceremonies including only the performer, director and producer (immediate chain of command .A final example. During an operation against a strategic adversary nation’s assets located in a developing Asian country, I oversaw a small team of technical officers — the wizards of Langley, gadget builders — packed in a van that was outfitted with electronic signal intercept gear. The automobile’s interior looked like the Space Shuttle’s cockpit (hard to explain, if caught driving through the countryside .While pulled onto the road’s shoulder to fine tune the equipment, two official looking vehicles with roof-mounted lights pulled in behind us. As the uniformed, armed personnel stepped out of their cruisers and cautiously approached — body language reflecting tension — I knew I could not allow them to get close enough to the vehicle to inspect the drape-covered windows, open doors, or ask passengers to step out. Showtime.Closed eyes and a deep belly breath helped center my thoughts, calm my nerves, as I channeled the persona of a distraught, lost holiday-goer. I grabbed a prop (a messily opened tourist map , emerged from the driver’s seat, and briskly walked to head off the approaching officers while conveying agitation, confusion and a sense of relief at my “saviors’” arrival.Seeing a flustered Westerner in tourist garb, the officers immediately relaxed and transformed from investigators to aid-providers. After a few minutes of discussing directions, they bid me adieu, reentered their vehicles and disappeared. My one-act, one-man show’s close saw no applause, no bow, and — thank God — no encore.Don’t get me wrong. Successful ops officers must posses skills beyond acting, and they see more desk work than theatrics (topics for another day . For now, I will simply exit, stage right.Curtains!J.P.

suffolknewsherald_2024_96,"Published 6:42 pm Tuesday, January 9, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIn times of division and uncertainty, we often yearn for the kind of transformative leadership that was taken nearly 55 years ago when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in Memphis.We need someone like him at the moment. Sadly, we seem more estranged as a people than we ever have.There are some glimpses of the world King envisioned and the message he carried with him in his tireless fight for racial equality. The S. Delois Mayes Scholarship Foundation’s annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day event on Monday morning at the Hilton Garden Inn Suffolk Riverfront will surely radiate the love for humanity the former minister preached and practiced.He’d be proud of the Mayes Foundation’s commitment to college scholarships to help young people achieve their dreams.Yet still, King’s legacy of — to name a small sampling — bravery, principle, sacrifice, grace and peaceful activism is sorely lacking in so many of our influential public figures today.As his birthday approaches, it becomes particularly striking that we have been bereft of King’s massive presence for such a long time. Generations of Americans know him only from the choppy, black-and-white reels of his awe-inspiring oratory.King’s birthday is a unique national holiday in that it is devoted primarily to a person and the ideals he represented. It is a day off that, at the very least, forces us to recognize the significance of the man.We would be better off as a country if we also took the opportunity to not only recognize King’s accomplishments but also honor his legacy by considering how we can improve our country and world by making it a more unified place.As we do every year, many of us gather to pay tribute, but hopefully, to also take stock of what we can to forge solidarity and advance the causes of equality. In the days and years ahead, we should consider King’s lessons and strive toward the kind of country he died pursuing.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_90,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Remember the crinkle of the wrapper when opening a brand-new CD? What about the comforting smell of a bookstore and the satisfying weight of a new paperback in your hands?These are the moments of non-screen joy that many of us hold dear as sacred childhood memories. It’s no wonder that Gen Z is breathing life back into the vinyl, CD, Polaroid and print book industries: We crave a connection to the physical world. As we celebrate National Wellness Month in August, let’s take a step away from our screens and embrace the joy of unplugged activities. And let’s use this digital detox to connect with — and protect — the planet and all its inhabitants.Experts found that excessive smartphone use can alter the brain, according to WebMD. Each scroll or swipe releases dopamine, affecting the same brain areas that respond to addictive drugs like cocaine. This can lead to increased stress, anxiety and even depression. Logging off can do us good. So, instead of scrolling social media, let’s stroll with our animal companions or visit a nature preserve to appreciate animals in their natural homes.When it’s time to eat, forget the meal-delivery apps. Instead, visit your local farmer’s market or grocery store for healthy vegan foods, including legumes such as lentils and chickpeas, nuts like almonds and walnuts, whole grains like quinoa and oats and fruits like berries and avocados. Basing our meals around foods like these can support mental health and overall well-being. A study in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience even suggests that going vegan might help reduce anxiety and stress. So why not feed your senses with a hearty lentil chili, creamy avocado pasta or a savory quinoa salad?Choosing healthy, sustainable and compassionate foods also supports our mental wellness because it empowers us to help curb the climate catastrophe and cruelty to animals. Every bite counts: The University of Oxford published a study that found that meatless sausages and burgers are up to 10 times more planet-friendly than their fleshy counterparts.Compassion is more than clicking a “like” button. Going vegan actively spares animals from confinement in cramped, filthy conditions, agonizing procedures like castration without painkillers and terrifying deaths. When we go vegan, we can breathe a sigh of relief knowing we are not funding this cycle of misery.In addition to enjoying delicious vegan meals, we can opt for animal-friendly, screen-free entertainment by visiting an animal sanctuary, or by purchasing tickets to an animal-free circus.Giving back to the community beats hours of scrolling through TikTok. Studies reveal that volunteering boosts happiness and life satisfaction. And participating in volunteer activities can build social connections and foster a deeper sense of purpose.Many animal shelters rely on volunteers to do laundry, clean kennels and walk homeless animals. Or you could offer to walk a lonely dog whose guardian is away all day. These animals deserve attention, exercise and friendship, too.When we unplug from our devices, we discover real connections — and countless ways to make the world a better place.Rebecca Libauskas is a climate research specialist for the PETA Foundation, 501 Front St., Norfolk, VA 23510; www.PETA.org.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
leoweekly_2024_18,"“And the eyes of the world are watching now. Watching now”Peter Gabriel, BikoIn September, 1977, Stephen Biko was killed by South African police while in custody. Nelson Mandela was already in prison. The United States, which had blocked UN sanctions against South African apartheid for decades, didn’t impose its own sanctions until 1986, over Ronald Reagan’s opposition. Biko had been dead for nine years. Support for apartheid regimes is in the DNA of the USA — a nation built on the backs of and by African slaves and their descendants. The unbalanced and intentional population of our prisons and jails from Abolition through today, and the criminal justice system that supplies it, is only one example of the side America will always take.Until it can’t. Until the outrage here threatens business profits and election campaigns. Until regular people in crowds so large they can’t be dismissed demand change. And, until people feel free to speak their minds and their hearts. To say, simply, as human beings, that apartheid and its works are unacceptable.Israel is an apartheid state. That statement — so obvious that with regard to any other nation on the planet it would be unnecessary — shouldn’t be controversial or subject to responsible argument. But it will be. Because any criticism of (a Israel, (b its government, or (c its war on Palestinians is subject to a special scrutiny, one that often intentionally, and in bad faith conflates criticism of the nation of Israel with criticism of Jews. The zeal with which Israel’s critics are slandered with the “Antisemite” label is far more effective than the Iron Dome itself in protecting Israel’s monstrous and nearly uniformly-condemned war crimes from the outrage they deserve, and the condemnation that should result in not only the withdrawal of the United States’ support for its apartheid regime, but, sanctions, like those that helped move South Africa away from it.There are two ominous clouds drifting across America. In their shadows the landscape darkens and good people understandably seek shelter. Sometimes though, that shelter can be a dangerous surrender to the dark forces behind those clouds. Antisemitism is on the rise. At the same time, recklessaccusationsof antisemitism not only restricts and bullies good faith discussion but also tragically undermines the identification of real antisemitism. The Boy Who Cried Wolf was devoured by the wolf because, ultimately, he was not believed. That wolf lives in these shadows.The pain of antisemitism, I can assume, is unimaginable to those who haven’t been its victims. Antisemitism must be condemned without hesitation, in every instance. Basic human decency demands nothing less. But reckless and unfounded accusations of antisemitism must not be used as weapons to silence those who would also —shouldalso — condemn conduct by any nation that also violates the same standards of human decency. Even if that nation is Israel.“You can blow out a candle,But you can’t blow out a fireOnce the flames begin to catchThe wind will blow it higher”P. Gabriel, BikoThis is where the old people say The Rubber Meets The Road: Criticism of the political policies of the state of Israel is not necessarily criticism of the Jewish faith. In this information-rich time we should be intellectually supple enough to understand that a non-Jew can hate antisemitism to their core and at the same time hate the devastation visited upon innocent Palestinians by Israel.Hate thrives in silence. Wars do, too. We survive as a people only if we can have these conversations. Such political fluency is particularly important when another storm brews here in the United States. Autocratic and hateful leaders divide us. Leaders who embrace Nazis and “good people on both sides.” We have to avoid unnecessary divisions among the very people who would otherwise be natural allies against this evil. Open-minded and thoughtful people who would be the first to stand against antisemitism shouldn’t be condemned because they also complain about the treatment of innocents in Palestine. We can do both. We must do both.Right now, the flames of outrage against apartheid — and murder — by Israel can’t “begin to catch” because candles lit in the US by those daring to object are blown out by slanderous accusations of antisemitism before they can. There’s no doubt that decent people, people who want only to say that hospitals shouldn’t be bombed, food convoys shouldn’t be attacked, and children shouldn’t be murdered in the name of “defense,” have been bullied to remain silent out of fear of being labeled - often by people whom they respect — an antisemite. This is an advantage the Afrikaner didn’t have. Neither should Israel. ( ."
minnpost_2024_94,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.﻿One of the many weird but understandably overlooked remarks made by former President Donald Trump last week at the National Association of Black Journalists convention was his observation that it “makes no difference” whom a presidential candidate selects as a running mate because the vice president designee has “virtually no impact.”It was the ex-president’s questioning of the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris that has rightfully received the most attention at the conclave. But his observations about the Vice presidency warrant attention, too.Apart from minimizing the big build-up he gave his selection of Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and then throwing him under the bus, the ex-president once again shows his ignorance of history, including Minnesota’s and his own. His running mate echoed his views a few days later, stating that the vice presidential pick “doesn’t really matter.”These observations are even more noteworthy in light of the selection Tuesday of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as the Democratic candidate for that position.Consequential candidatesWhile polling suggests that vice presidents do not cause a large number of voters to cast a ballot for someone they would not otherwise have supported, their selection is not inconsequential.There have been many occasions in which the identity of the VP helped a ticket prevail dating back to “Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too,” the first significant presidential election slogan in which the presence of Southerner John Tyler from Virginia helped carry a few key states in that region for William Henry Harrison from Indiana in ousting the incumbent, New Yorker Martin Van Buren, in 1840. Tyler then took over as president when Harrison died a month after his inauguration.Abraham Lincoln’s dropping of Maine’s Republican Hannibal Hamlin, his first term VP, for a Tennessee Democrat, Andrew Jackson, helped Honest Abe solidify his reelection in 1864 by appealing to pro-Union Democrats in the North, so much so that they ran in a newly-named Union Party ticket.Fast forward a century and it was John F. Kennedy’s placement of Texan Lyndon B. Johnson on the “Boston-Austin” ticket that secured the Lone Star State crucial to his victory in 1960.Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, chose Joe Biden in 2008 largely because of his foreign policy stature, adding to their joint credibility to defeat the rival GOP tandem that included vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. She undoubtedly was a drag on the ticket as the most sizable hot-potato VP choice since Dan Quayle 20 years earlier, although he managed not to submerge the ticket headed by then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. That dubious selection prompted his son a dozen years later to be more circumspect in adding more gravitas to the GOP team with Dick Cheney as his victorious vice president.Much MattersThe experiences of the two previous Minnesota vice presidents, whom Walz hopes to join, also belie the Trump-Vance view.While LBJ was headed to an easy victory in 1964, his selection of Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, former head of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action, as vice president appealed to the left wing of his party and helped boost him to a landslide.A dozen years later, by picking Walter Mondale, Humphrey’s successor in the U.S. Senate, Jimmy Carter added some helpful inside-the-Beltway stature to his outsider’s posture.And then there’s the former president himself, who ought to recall that his selection of Mike Pence as his vice president helped attract Christian Evangelicals to their side before he decided he didn’t want him hanging around any longer during the January 6 attempted insurrection.By the way, that episode — Pence’s refusal to give in to the entreaties to deny certification of the election — refutes Vance’s “doesn’t really matter” declaration since Vance himself has said he would not have validated the vote, throwing the election — and the country — into chaos, and he presumably is prone to do likewise if another opportunity arises in, say, 2029.That would seem to “matter” much.Administration appointmentsIn addition to disregarding historical reality, the ex-president’s choice of Vance provides a window into the cast of characters who would populate a second Trump administration. Not surprisingly, they would be Vance-types: inexperienced, bombastic, right-wing extremists taking their cues from Project 2025 with unabashed and unquestioned loyalty to the president.The first Trump administration was replete with grifters, ideologues, knaves and overmatched personnel. But there were a few who comprised the guardrails that prevented going over the cliff that was perpetually looming. Officials like Chief of Staff General John Kelly and another military man, General H.R. McMasters, who headed the National Security Council, were among the handful of level headed guardians.But the selection of Vance and everything that he stands for — and against — vivifies what to expect from Trump II appointees. The guard rails will be gone.It cannot be known specifically who would populate a Trump-Vance administration.

This year’s campaign continues its focus on raising awareness about the dangers of high blood pressure and encouraging stronger relationships with primary health care providers.High blood pressure and hypertension put individuals at risk for heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the United States. Affecting about one-third of the adult population, high blood pressure is often called the “silent killer” due to its lack of obvious symptoms. Alarmingly, half of those with high blood pressure are unaware of their condition.Dr. Mililani Trask-Batti, family medicine practitioner, commends the initiative: “Big Island Healthcare applauds Community First’s ‘Know Your Numbers Campaign’ to end high blood pressure on Hawaii Island. We were happy to support this program by recording radio PSAs and volunteering to take blood pressures and answer questions at community events. Such community outreach and education contributes to our efforts to improve the health and well-being of our Kaiaulu.”The campaign’s impact has been substantial, with Community First Hawaii conducting islandwide community outreach and worksite events. These efforts have resulted in the distribution of 4,000 brochures, 100 posters to various establishments, and over 350 blood pressure screenings through community outreach efforts to date. In addition, educational messaging through social media, local newspapers and radio have added to the reach and impact of this campaign.Each screening session provides participants with immediate results and educational resources from the American Heart Association to share with their health care providers. This ongoing effort underscores the organization’s commitment to long-term community health improvement.The campaign’s success has been bolstered by partnerships with numerous local organizations. Sponsors include Hilo Benioff Medical Center, HMSA, HPM Building Supply, KTA Super Stores, National Benefits Administrators, Suisan Company and UHA Health Insurance.Support has also come from a wide array of partners, including health care providers, health care centers, clinics, government agencies and community organizations. These partnerships have been critical in extending the campaign’s reach across diverse communities on Hawaii Island.Looking ahead, Community First Hawaii remains committed to continuing these blood pressure screening events as part of its ongoing effort to combat high blood pressure on the island. The organization recognizes that sustained engagement and education are key to creating lasting change in community health outcomes.As the campaign progresses, Community First Hawaii invites all residents of Hawaii Island to participate in upcoming screening events and take an active role in their health management. By knowing their numbers and understanding the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring, individuals can take significant steps toward better health and well-being.For more information about upcoming events or to get involved with the “Know Your Numbers” campaign, please visit Community First Hawaii’s website www.communityfirsthawaii.org.Randy Kurohara is executive director of Community First Hawaii, a nonprofit serving as a convener and catalyst for solutions to improve health and access to health care.

philinquirer_2024_40,"Like so many others in Philadelphia’s arts community, I ache over the challenges local art institutions face — and I can t help but reflect on their role in my own artistic growth.Becoming an artist isn’t a straight line.For me, it wasn’t even a single art school. It was a single city.Until this spring, Philadelphia offered, and I have, over the years, attended, thePennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia College of Art (as the University of the Artswas known for much of its life ,Moore College of Art, and theFleisher Art Memorial.Now, one of them — PAFA — finds itself onprecarious financial footing, and another — UArts, the former PCA — announced last weekthat it would be closing Friday.Like so many others in Philadelphia’s arts community, I ache over the challenges these institutions face. But, mostly, I feel for the students who will not have the benefit of the life-changing programs now on the chopping block, and for their teachers whose dedication animated those programs. I can’t help but reflect on the vital role so many of their predecessors played in my own artistic growth.My extensive sampling of Philadelphia’s art schools began in my suburban high school, when our “art” project was to cut out flowers in magazines, tape them down in an “arrangement,” and then trace them onto a surface we could then paint. Voilà!Art.Not amused, my mother enrolled me at Moore College of Art Saturday classes for high schoolers. We used real art materials on real easels. No clipping and tracing. My eyes were opened to a new world of real art (and being able to hit Sansom Street on the way back to the train . Recently, I’ve hired three terrific Moore grads to help organize an archive of my drawings and cartoons.Returning from my art-desert college, I got back into art at Philadelphia College of Art evening classes. I still have an egg tempera painting from a magical class taught by John Grauer. Now, decades later, a PCA grad and great designer helps me untangle my fraught relations with Photoshop when preparing cartoons for print.After PCA, I enrolled part-time at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where teachers followed in the footsteps of artists likeThomas EakinsandCecilia Beaux.Instructors, themselves practicing artists, helped me learn to really look at what I wanted to draw and paint.Robert Beverly Hale, the late artist and art curator, who was nearly 80 at the time, would train down from New York City to teach anatomy by quoting Leadbelly and drawing with a long stick topped with charcoal to impress on us that being able to render a hand — that supple, always in motion appendage at the end of our arms — can express as much as a face.My interest in graphic art bloomed in PAFA’s lithography and etching classes, then located in a building on Chestnut Street. PAFA did not, thankfully, have a cartooning department, but the basics PAFA taught are applicable to all sorts of art and design. My etchings began to express my political opinions, one winning a nod at the annual student show.In the last few years, I’ve been taking classes at the Fleisher Art Memorial, which is not a degree-granting institution but offers classes in everything from oil painting to ceramics to jewelry and photography. Classes are taught by working artists including PAFA, PCA, and UArts grads.Their children’s programs have produced artists likeAllan Edmunds, who went on to found South Broad Street’s Brandywine Workshop, andTariq “Black Thought” Trotter, who cofounded the hip-hop group The Roots. Their remarks at Fleisher’s fundraising dinner last fall were brimming with love and gratitude for how Fleisher opened their eyes to the wider world of art.Fleisher continues to be a community treasure where many PCA, PAFA, and UArts alumni teach. Drexel’s Westphal College of Media Arts and Design and Temple’s Tyler School of Art and Architecture offer really good art programs. And Moore is thriving — according to the college’s president, Cathy Young, this is the school’s 23rd year running an operating budget surplus, their applications rose 12% over last year, and 97% of their students find employment within a year of graduation.Perhaps it’s time to send the leadership of PAFA and UArts to one of Philadelphia’s really good business schools.Signe Wilkinson, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize, spent 35 years as an editorial cartoonist at The Inquirer and the Daily News. She will speak on June 11 at 6 p.m. at the opening of the Pennsylvania Historical Society’s exhibit “Cartoons as Political Speech in Colonial America,” which includes some of her cartoons."
minnpost_2024_107,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe shares more boundary with the federally managed National Forest System than any other tribe in the United States, with 75% of the reservation border adjoining the Chippewa National Forest in northern Minnesota. Being in the north woods, timber harvesting and forest management are important to the tribe’s economy. Yet, the value of the forest extends well beyond timber production. Forests provide the Leech Lake Band a deep cultural foundation, sustaining life for humans, plants, and animals, all while cleaning the air and water.However, forest health has declined rapidly over the past two centuries. Clear-cut logging by European settlers combined with a management legacy of fire suppression and the impacts of climate change are increasingly exposing our forests to risks from severe wildfire, insects and disease, and drought. Many modern forests now lack a diversity of tree ages, especially older trees that are a vital component of a healthy and resilient forest. Old-growth forest conditions are now present on just 13% of lands within federal national forests, and here in the state of Minnesota it’s less than half that amount.The absence of older forests means a loss of vital habitat for important plants and animals. For example, old-growth forests are essential habitat for eagles, a doodem (clan animal of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe. Eagles need very tall trees to nest and hunt, heights that can only be provided from old-growth forests. By protecting old-growth forests, we protect the vital habitat of the great American Bald Eagle.While fire — including natural ignitions and cultural burning — contributes to the health of many forest ecosystems, the average acreage burned in the United States has more than doubled in the past half century. The Federal Government now spends $7 billion to manage the escalating wildfire crisis. However, this $7 billion is only sufficient to conduct fuel treatments on 60 million of the 800 million forested acres nationwide.Additionally, forests damaged by insects sequester 69% less carbon than healthy forests — the equivalent of adding 50 million tons of CO2, or the emissions of 10 million cars, into our atmosphere each year!In light of these challenges, the U.S. Forest Service is exploring ways to restore old-growth forests as part of a strategy to increase the resilience and health of national forests, both for the benefit of people and of nature. Specifically, these agencies are looking for ways to strengthen forest resilience by incorporating Indigenous knowledge into forest management planning and practices.Contrary to myths of “virgin” or “untouched” forests when Europeans first arrived on this continent, the evidence is clear that forests were actively taken care of by Indigenous people for thousands of generations. And it is still that way today. Modern studies have shown that Native American land use increased the abundance of fire-tolerant, shade-intolerant, and nut-producing trees up to 31 miles from Indigenous settlements. Utilizing Indigenous knowledge can help slow and even reverse the troubling trends in forest health.The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe knows how important a healthy and resilient forest system is for the livelihood of those living throughout northern Minnesota. They are excited to partner with the U.S. Forest Service to share their knowledge of practices that will reduce the dangers of uncontrolled wildfires, increase long-term timber yields using sustainable forestry practices, and provide diverse habitats for numerous species, along with many other resources and values provided by healthy forests.The reality is, the federal government does not have the capacity to adequately manage the nation’s 193 million acres of national forests alone and forest health issues do not respect political boundaries. Fortunately, there are 574 federally recognized tribes across the United States with a deep connection to the land and unique understanding of forest and environmental relationships learned and passed down over many generations. Let’s expand engagement with tribes — the original stewards of these lands — and work together to address the health of our nation’s forests so everyone can receive the benefits from healthy and resilient forests.Keith Karnes began working for the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in 2006 and now serves as forestry director."

Sheldon Whitehouse and Ron Wyden are standing by their duty to protect the legitimacy of the federal government and the balance between the branches.As much as Thomas and his fellow out-of-control justices try to reinterpret the Constitution, one thing they can’t reason away is that the document constrains all branches and attempts to make them somewhat coequal. It does not give the judiciary the ability to sit above the others, untouchable.The prospect of a criminal investigation is very serious, but so is the conduct alleged. It seems like every week there are revelations that Thomas took another gift from his wealthy benefactors, in particular the hyper-conservative and very politically active donor Harlan Crow.The senators’ detailed 16-page letter included yet more hidden gifts, including a yacht trip to Russia and a ride on a private helicopter. The justice can hardly continue to claim ignorance of the rules or expectations when he’s been pushed over and over to fully disclose what he’s received and when, yet new information just keeps coming out.Thomas can rule the way see fit on cases (including his horrible view that guns can never be regulated which is at odds with his eight colleagues but he must follow the laws and rules related to accepting free stuff. Justice Abe Fortas, who was nominated to be chief justice in 1968, instead resigned when gifts he received were disclosed. Fortas had in fact returned the gifts three years before and their value was far less than what Crow has bestowed on Thomas.It’s worth remembering that we’re not talking about a meal here or there. Thomas is now known to have accepted at least some $2.4 million in gifts, almost all completely undisclosed until reporters started digging around. In addition to the yacht trip and helicopter ride, the senators’ letter details nearly three dozen other likely undisclosed gifts provided by Crow and other donors.A special counsel could examine and act on the totality of the evidence; the appointment of one does not in itself mean that an investigation target will be prosecuted, of course. Garland appointed one special counsel who investigated, prosecuted and convicted First Son Hunter Biden. Another Garland special counsel examined President Biden and found no basis to move forward with a prosecution. If Thomas truly has committed no wrongdoing, then he can expect the same.If the justice has committed criminal violations, that’s something the American public deserves to know. And, though filed a bit prematurely by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it would give some teeth to the articles of impeachment against Thomas (and, a little more tenuously, Sam Alito . Judges are the federal officials historically most likely to be impeached, and this conduct plus failure to recuse — including in cases involving the Jan. 6 insurrection, in which Thomas’ wife Ginny had a hand — are definitely worth considering that option. But let an impartial investigation establish all the facts first.— New York Daily News"

(Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images/TNS Joe Biden is toast, and with the media now sharply focused on his medical condition, the best scenario for Democrats is that the president resigns and turns the Oval Office keys over to Kamala Harris.The debate over Biden’s future has changed its tone and turned more urgent amid new reports that a neurologist specializing in Parkinson’s visited the White House eight times over an eight month period. Reporters also testily sparred with White House officials on Monday over complaints that they’re not being candid with the media about the president’s health.The discussions have shifted from concerns over Biden’s cognitive abilities to a possible medical emergency. It’s not just an elderly guy in decline any more.Democrats need an exit strategy to get Biden out of the way and avoid a costly defeat to Donald Trump.It’s so bad that Biden has lost Michael Moore, Stephen King and Rob Reiner. When you’ve lost them, you know it’s over.Democratic prognosticator Nate Silver even said that the Democratic president can’t continue, after watching his stammering interview with ABC’s left wing George Stephanopolous.Biden though has reportedly closed his inner circle of advisers to just a few aides and family and is angrily refusing to step aside. So he needs cover to get out.Is the party and nation going to be held hostage by Hunter and Jill Biden? Surely party elders will not let that happen.The reports about the neurologist visits – which the White House press office refused to confirm even though it came from the visitor logs – give Biden an opportunity to bow out of the race or resign with dignity citing a serious medical condition.That scenario also gives a chance for Democrats to avoid a protracted and divisive debate over whether Biden should hang on or quit, and abandon these crazy plans for a “blitz primary” to determine a nominee. With the president out, he can turn over his delegates and millions in campaign cash to his vice president.Biden can continue to say he’s a fighter and wants to beat Trump all he wants, but for the good of the nation and party he must resign. He wants to go out swinging to seem like he’s not a quitter. Fine. That way he doesn’t have to seem to have been pushed out.But right now that’s exactly what it looks like. The stubborn White House and panicked Democratic leaders are on a high stakes collision course and the ending is not going to be pretty.The fight over Biden’s health will cripple the party and make it much more likely that Trump will cruise to victory. Democrats will be left with a feeble and weak nominee who three quarters of the country say is too old and mentally deficient to govern.And what about those profiles in courage, Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey and Michelle Wu who have been AWOL for the last week and a half? They’ll be stuck with a President Trump, their worst nightmare.The simplest way to avoid that is a clean cut with Biden announcing he will resign – similar to the way Richard Nixon was forced out by party elders in 1973. Kamala Harris would run as the de facto incumbent president, with a far better chance of beating Trump than Biden. It’s the Democrats’ only play.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of Hawaii."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_109,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°The record-smashing global heat of the past year has been driven partly by an El Niño weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean. The good news is that El Niño is rapidly giving way to his cooler sister, La Niña. The bad news is that she won’t necessarily be any kinder to humanity.El Niño and La Niña are two phases of a local climate phenomenon, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO , which influences conditions around the world. A strong El Niño in 2015-16 produced record high global temperatures, deadly droughts and floods, a spate of Pacific cyclones and the worst coral-reef bleaching event in history, to name just a few outcomes.Though the now-dying El Niño of 2023-24 was one of the strongest on record, it was still notably weaker than that of 2015-16. But its global effects were even more alarming: 12 consecutive months and counting of global heat records, ocean water temperatures going to places where there are no charts, even more severe coral bleaching and more deadly droughts and floods. Why was this El Niño period so much more devastating, despite having less oomph? You get one guess, and the answer rhymes with “shlimate shange.” Most simplistically, El Niño tends to make the world hotter, while La Niña tends to cool it. But the background temperature of the planet is now 1.3 degrees Celsius warmer than in preindustrial times, thanks to our enthusiasm for burning fossil fuels. That gives any El Niño a higher platform from which to wreak havoc. Persistent global heating also makes it less likely that La Niña’s imminent arrival will bring much relief, if any. There is still a strong chance that 2024 will be the hottest year on record, even if half of it is spent under cooler La Niña conditions. “The end of El Niño does not mean a pause in long-term climate change as our planet will continue to warm due to heat-trapping greenhouse gases,” World Meteorological Organization Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett said in a release on Monday. The WMO noted the past nine years have been the world’s hottest despite several of them having been spent under La Niña conditions. In fact, the Pacific Ocean’s ENSO pattern has been in a neutral or La Niña phase for more than 17 of the past 30 years, which has done little more than temporarily slow the inexorable rise in global temperatures.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently predicted there could be up to 25 named storms and up to 7 “major” hurricanes this season, which began on June 1 and continues until Nov. 30. Unfortunately, forecasters in recent years have tended to underestimate the number of storms that actually happen. And the hotter ocean water and higher sea levels produced by climate change tend to make hurricanes more intense and destructive.It was bad enough during the centuries when El Niño and La Niña simply batted the global climate back and forth like a badminton birdie. Once humans got involved in manipulating the climate, they proved to be even more powerful and destructive, just on a longer time scale. The upside is that humans also have the power to change their impact, by transitioning away from the fossil fuels that are making the planet hotter. In the meantime, we must keep adapting to weather that keeps growing more chaotic no matter which side of the net the birdie is on.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

minnpost_2024_150,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Among the passions among Americans is driving, including our penchant for dragging recreational artifacts hitched to our automobiles around in the summer. Another one is eating out.Various surveys have been conducted across the United States on our eating habits. Eating out is a very impactful pastime with a significant boost to the economy. This accounts for the fact that there are about as many surveys on it as there are people interested in the subject.One of them shows that the average American eats out five to six times a week. Another survey by SWNS Media Group reports that the average American spends over $2,500 a year eating out. Overall, Americans spend about $70.1 billion eating out every month. Our passion for eating out, like our passion for driving, is so irresistible that if I didn’t know better, I would think the reason many households in the United States have a kitchen is because it came with the house, being that people rarely cook at home.Families have different ways of availing themselves of ready-to-eat food they did not cook. They go to restaurants, pick up cooked food from nearby delis — ordering online or over the phone for pickup or delivery — and place orders for takeout or eat in restaurants. Given this strong affinity, inquiring minds no doubt are curious to know the reasons for this fascination with fast food or food not cooked at home.I thought about it, asking myself why I eat out whenever I do.An obvious reason is the strategy restaurants employ to fill the surrounding air with the mouth-watering aroma of onions frying in hot oil. If you are anything like me, when I am hungry I want to eat, not cook. People eat out for convenience due to the constraint of time needed for grocery shopping, food preparation and cleaning and tidying up afterwards. Who has time to do the dishes and clean up the kitchen after cooking and eating at home?This time constraint is mostly the consequence of working long hours in America relative to most countries worldwide. Working long hours — especially in two income house-holds — means significant disposable income, which means families can afford to eat out.Having a dual-income family also means that no adult is at home to make home-cooked meals during the day. Unless the adults in these families are superhuman, they are justifiably exhausted and the last thing they want to do is cook when they have the option to go where the food is ready to eat. Not only where the food is ready to eat, but also where there is an opportunity to socialize with family and friends. There is also the opportunity for networking.Another factor drawing people to eat out is the multitude and variety of eateries in our country — for variety, they say, is the spice of life. Not to be left out is the effectiveness of the hospitality industry’s remarkable investment in the marketing and advertising industry to entice people to eat out; it works, attracting people in droves as a result. Finally, some eat out because they simply have no idea how to cook.This is definitely not an exhaustive list of why we eat out, but it is sufficiently enlightening to suffice. Lest it be misconstrued, this article is neither about condemning eating out nor an advocacy for cooking and eating at home.Anthony Akubue is a resident of St. Cloud."
philinquirer_2024_17,"Republican lawmakers are up to their “tricks of the trade” again, finding ways to maintain the racial school funding status quo.Recently, the 2023 Basic Education Funding Commission published its report and made recommendations for changing Pennsylvania’s school finance system. As someone who follows issues of Pennsylvania school funding, the obstructionist and delay tactics of Republican lawmakers are giving me an ominous sense of déjà vu.As a professor at Swarthmore College, I often tell my students that we study the history of education policies and the actions of policymakers so we’re not doomed to repeat the same inequitable decisions of the past. Understanding this history helps us respond in the current moment.Racial disparities in Pennsylvania school funding first came to light during the2014 Basic Education Funding Commission hearings. David Mosenkis, a data scientist and member ofPOWER Interfaith, a racial justice organizing group, testified to his finding that whiter school districts received more state funding than majority-minority districts, when controlling for poverty and other factors. The finding that Pennsylvania distributes school funding in ways that privilege whiter school districts has been confirmed byother studies.After Mosenkis’ testimony, Republican State Sen. Pat Browne, cochair of the first Basic Education Funding Commission in 2014, responded the way a politician in a public setting would be expected to: surprise and a promise to do better. Browne stated that he didn’t want funding formulas “to have any unintended consequences, because at a minimum level, it sends a bad public policy message.” He added that “there’s no reason in regards to what we do in the future that should continue to allow that.”And yet, shortly after the first commission issued its report, Pennsylvania’s Republican-led General Assembly enacted a law that preserved racial inequities in school funding. Although the2016 law, based on the commission’s recommendations, adopted a “fair” funding formula, the fine print dictated that the formula would only be applied to new money (i.e., increases to the state education budget . In 2017–2018, this meant that only 8% of the total education budget wasdistributed “fairly”— that is, in a racially equitable manner.Tactics to evade the implementation of racially equitable school funding policies are part of Harrisburg culture and are common enough outside of Pennsylvania that education scholars refer to these as the “tricks of the trade” of state legislators.Another “trick of the trade” included the use of not-nearly-enough “earmarked funding” to specific underfunded districts. The practice, according to state legislators, has been around for decades but onlydrew scrutiny in 2013. Earmarked funding was a poorly constructed stopgap effort that diverted attention away from the systemic problem of educational underfunding. It pacified constituents by giving the appearance that legislators were fighting for school funding when, in reality, it was a sloppily adhered Band-Aid. Browne was able to secure multiple years of earmarked funding for his underfunded school district in Allentown. So much state legislative activity produced so little change.To be sure, therecent Basic Education Funding Commission reporthas more to recommend than its previous counterpart. For one, it acknowledges that there is a significant gap between what Pennsylvania currently provides and what is needed for an adequate education. And it attached a figure — $5.4 billion — to plug the adequacy gap, though this is still less than the$6.2 billioncalculated by Matthew Kelly, a Pennsylvania State University professor.But today’s Republican lawmakers are up to their “tricks of the trade” again, finding ways to maintain the racial school funding status quo, despite the Commonwealth Court’s 2023 ruling that Pennsylvania’s school funding system isunconstitutional and in need of reform.In a move to delay and undermine racial equity in Pennsylvania school funding, Republican commission members voted against the final report, issuing their ownbootleg version. The Republican report rehashes the same tired narrative of the “potential consequences of a formula that does not allocate to each district at least the same level of proportion of state basic education funding as the district received in the prior school year.”In other words, Republican commission members are calling to preserve the policy of “hold harmless” that maintains the school funding privileges of predominantly white districts.Racial inequity in school funding is not, primarily, a problem rooted in poor policymaking; it is a problem rooted in the differential valuing of children’s lives.Those who reject the premise that certain children are worthy of greater educational investment because of the color of their skin should also reject the delay tactics of Republican lawmakers. We should communicate our urgency to Gov. Josh Shapiro and our state legislators as they decide whether to continue to delay justice or to act now to transform Pennsylvania’s racially inequitable school funding system.Roseann Liu is the author of “Designed to Fail: Why Racial Equity in School Funding Is So Hard to Achieve.” She is a visiting assistant professor of Asian American studies and educational studies at Swarthmore College and an assistant professor of education studies at Wesleyan University."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_220,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Google recently made headlines globally because its chatbot Gemini generated images of people of color instead of white people in historical settings that featured white people. Adobe Firefly’s image creation tool saw similar issues. This led some commentators to complain that AI had gone “woke.” Others suggested these issues resulted from faulty efforts to fight AI bias and better serve a global audience.The discussions over AI’s political leanings and efforts to fight bias are important. Still, the conversation on AI ignores another crucial issue: What is the AI industry’s approach to free speech, and does it embrace international free speech standards?We are policy researchers who study free speech, as well as executive director and a research fellow at The Future of Free Speech, an independent, nonpartisan think tank based at Vanderbilt University. In a recent report, we found that generative AI has important shortcomings regarding freedom of expression and access to information.Generative AI is a type of AI that creates content, like text or images, based on the data it has been trained with. In particular, we found that the use policies of major chatbots do not meet United Nations standards. In practice, this means that AI chatbots often censor output when dealing with issues the companies deem controversial. Without a solid culture of free speech, the companies producing generative AI tools are likely to continue to face backlash in these increasingly polarized times.•••VAGUE AND BROAD USE POLICIESOur report analyzed the use policies of six major AI chatbots, including Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Companies issue policies to set the rules for how people can use their models. With international human rights law as a benchmark, we found that companies’ misinformation and hate speech policies are too vague and expansive. It is worth noting that international human rights law is less protective of free speech than the U.S. First Amendment.Our analysis found that companies’ hate speech policies contain extremely broad prohibitions. For example, Google bans the generation of “content that promotes or encourages hatred.” Though hate speech is detestable and can cause harm, policies that are as broadly and vaguely defined as Google’s can backfire.To show how vague and broad use policies can affect users, we tested a range of prompts on controversial topics. We asked chatbots questions like whether transgender women should or should not be allowed to participate in women’s sports tournaments or about the role of European colonialism in the current climate and inequality crises. We did not ask the chatbots to produce hate speech denigrating any side or group. Similar to what some usershave reported, the chatbots refused to generate content for 40% of the 140 prompts we used. For example, all chatbots refused to generate posts opposing the participation of transgender women in women’s tournaments. However, most of them did produce posts supporting their participation.Vaguely phrased policies rely heavily on moderators’ subjective opinions about what hate speech is. Users can also perceive that the rules are unjustly applied and interpret them as too strict or too lenient.For example, the chatbot Pi bans “content that may spread misinformation.” However, international human rights standards on freedom of expression generally protect misinformation unless a strong justification exists for limits, such as foreign interference in elections. Otherwise, human rights standards guarantee the “freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers … through any … media of … choice,” according to a key United Nations convention.Defining what constitutes accurate information also has political implications. Governments of several countries used rules adopted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to repress criticism of the government. More recently, India confronted Google after Gemini noted that some experts consider the policies of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to be fascist.•••FREE SPEECH CULTUREThere are reasons AI providers may want to adopt restrictive use policies.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_236,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It’s time to talk about how President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential campaign is related to our broken political system. This failing system got us to the point where we had the two major party candidates rejected by 70 percent of the electorate, according to most polls.Biden and former President Donald Trump are not the problem — they are a symptom of a much deeper problem that has led to a deeply dysfunctional political system full of destructive polarization and hyper-partisanship.You can be a Biden supporter and believe he should have stuck with what many thought was his promise to be a one-term president. He should never have considered running for a second term, but there was a whole political industry of elitist insiders surrounding him – from political appointees and lobbyists to consultants and major funders — who had too much to lose if he stepped down.Let’s review what happened during the primary season controlled by the so-called elites, the political parties and Biden’s campaign team (as well as Trump’s : nothing. And let’s be clear, the Republican Party is just as broken as the Democrat Party.There were no meaningful primaries and debates. Many primaries were canceled by the parties. Neither Biden nor Trump agreed to debate other credible candidates, so we had no idea how fit either one was to carry on a rational, thoughtful policy conversation. And most Americans came away from the Biden-Trump debate with the impression that neither candidate was well qualified to lead our country for the next four years.What if the political parties did not control primary elections in the United States? What if both Biden and Trump actually had to run a primary campaign, debate opponents and face the voters early? Primaries are public elections and should not be subject to cancellation by a private club (which is what political parties are .This party-controlled primary issue is especially problematic because, as Gallup showed in June, for the first time a majority of voters do not identify with either party. When you hear a talking head or a politician say America is divided in half between Republicans and Democrats, a more accurate picture is that half are independent, a quarter are Republicans and a quarter are Democrats. Yet, there are next to zero independent elected officials nationally.Why do we have more choices of cereal and ice cream than presidential candidates? Why do private clubs control who can vote in the first round of public elections or even if such elections are held? That is not democracy.This is no way to run a country and the little people are watching, not just the elites. It is time to fundamentally change the way we elect, district and finance candidates running for everything from county commission to the presidency. This is yet another reminder that it is time for the nation to adopt open, nonpartisan primaries and ranked-choice voting, so that all voters have their voices heard all the time.Perls is founder and president of NM Open Elections and a former state representative in New Mexico."

minnpost_2024_146,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.If you felt like a deer in headlights as you watched what ensued the last couple of weeks of the Minnesota legislative session, chances are you were tracking or participating in the end of the session.The Legislature had been meeting for four months to tackle the issues important to us. The usual divided government Minnesota’s legislative branch is under was not a challenge this biennium; Democrats have had full reign for the past two years. Legislative leaders had plenty of time to build consensus, inform the public and hold floor sessions in a manner that was transparent and worked to build the public’s trust in the integrity of the process.Instead of putting us ahead of self and partisan interests, legislative leaders turned to partisan gamesmanship to act on all kinds of important legislation. In the last 20 minutes of the session, a mega-ginormous omnibus bill over 1,400 pages long, front and back, was voted off the House and Senate floors in a manner that leaves the public wondering about the integrity of the process and the legislative institution. It begs the question: how are Minnesotans represented within the chaos?Behaving this way dampens the good policy that many hardworking legislators managed to pass this session. In the voting and election space, the Legislature passed three major policies, and took a few baby steps in the right direction on others.Ending prison gerrymandering, the practice of counting those serving prison time where they are incarcerated, was a major victory for fair districts and democracy. For purposes of the census and redistricting, these Minnesotans will now be counted at their last home address, a community they are likely to return to after serving their time.Passing a Minnesota Voting Rights Act restores protections for voters who have been discriminated against or intimidated while voting since the federal Voting Rights Act has been eroded. However, the work is only partly done. We must return next session and follow the federal law’s direction on pre-clearance and setting up a statewide database as a central public repository for election and demographic data with the goal of fostering transparent, evidence-based practices in election administration.Enacting rules to combat the rise of AI deepfakes in our elections is also important as this new technology threatens to spread misinformation.As for the baby steps: allowing one-day polling places at some colleges and universities is good but leaves most students of color and Indigenous students out; allowing voters to describe a physical location when registering to vote removes barriers for voters on Tribal lands and those who are unhoused; and expanding access to translated voting materials bring us closer to greater parity among voters in Minnesota.No matter who is in charge in 2025, the first step taken should be making sure trust is restored in the legislative process by centering chamber rules on maximizing transparency, limiting opportunity for exploitation of rules to favor partisan interests and disruptions to the integrity of the process, while also centering the work on constituency’s best interests. Partisan gamesmanship invites erosion of trust and good faith among legislators.Minnesota has been the North Star of civic engagement and voter-friendly laws. What took place on the legislative floors fails to reflect the values we hold so dear as Minnesotans. We must do better.Our elected officials are entrusted with the vote of the people. It is our vote that bestows political power on them. A healthy, transparent and accountable democracy means everyone has a voice; even those that differ.Annastacia Belladonna-Carrera is the executive director of Common Cause Minnesota.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_86,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Speaking freely at a glitzy Supreme Court Historical Society event earlier this month, Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that there are “fundamental things that really can’t be compromised” in society, and speculated that “one side or the other is going to win.” The comments were recorded by a documentarian who had attended the events and surreptitiously recorded the justices as they increasingly find themselves under the microscope for tossing precedent overboard and embarking on ideologically rigid right-wing path.At the same event, Chief Justice John Roberts showed how justices are supposed to approach these questions, telling the documentarian that the court should not be a moral compass for the country, nor trying to put us on the path towards being a Christian nation.Alito is right about one thing — one side or the other indeed will win. He may think of this as a battle between the political right and left, with the latter characterized as an out-of-control force wrecking the country. But that’s not really what’s happening here; it’s a contest between a conception of the court and the broader government as a tool to protect rights and small-l liberal commitments, or one to impose a reactionary agenda against all that.We cannot have a society that simultaneously respects values like self-determination, protection of civil rights and access to health care and abortion, while being run by minority factions hell-bent on imposing their personal religious values on everyone. The vision of strict and strictly enforced social and economic hierarchy based on some imagined bygone conservative principles is fundamentally incompatible with the principles that this country holds as its high ideals.The trouble is Alito, who holds an office that is meant to safeguard the latter, is fighting on the opposite side. Yet it’s considered impolite to point this out, despite the fact that the justice has been all but explicit about it, with his public rhetoric and with Jan. 6 and Christian nationalist flags (dubiously blamed entirely on his wife . Now here he is, being even clearer in agreeing that the country must return to some sort of “godliness.”This is just one instance that happened to be recorded, but there’s no doubt Alito and his fellow ultra-conservative justices are toeing this line elsewhere, like the privately-funded retreats put on by right-wing legal groups and the trips organized by Clarence Thomas’ benefactor Harlan Crow. They’re generally fine being so open about it because experience has shown they will face little accountability or consequences.That should change. The Constitution created the three branches of government as co-equal, keeping one another in check. It did not put the Supreme Court above everything else, untouchable by either electoral will or scrutiny from other branches.The Congress should force the justices to clarify some of their conflicts of interest and outside entanglements, under oath. No more polite invitations for justices to decline, no more justices reluctantly making disclosures only after reporters and oversight groups dig up million-dollar gifts they’ve received. Use the levers of government to rein the justices in, while we still have a liberal democracy to defend.—New York Daily News/TNSWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_69,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°The Democrats are underwater. Alarmingly so. That’s good news for President Joe Biden.A recent Gallup poll revealed that there are fewer Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents than at almost any time since Gallup began seriously studying party affiliation in 1992.Democrats are currently underwater by 7 percentage points, in terms of partisan advantage (“the percentage of U.S. adults identifying as or leaning Democratic minus the percentage identifying as or leaning Republican” .Only once before — in December 1992 — did Democrats face a similar shortfall. Since then, the party on the left has almost always been in the black, even reaching a partisan advantage of a whopping 18 percent in 2008.Doubtless those figures have the Biden campaign worried. The deficit has prompted some urgency. In recent weeks, the president has stepped up his attacks on former President Donald Trump, altered his immigration stance, touted his economic success, and even put money directly back into the pockets of his most skeptical audience.Democratic members of Congress have similarly celebrated the considerable successes of this administration. So has the Democratic National Committee. And yet the needle has barely moved. The last time the Democratic Party was consistently above water was the summer of 2021. Since then, the party of the left has been furiously swimming upstream, trying to gain traction with a largely disaffected electorate.So, what happened? What accounts for the significant decline in Democratic Party support in recent years?Well, the first thing one notices when reviewing the fine-grained data is the fairly significant increase in independent voters over the past two decades. The percentage of independent voters used to hover around 30 percent; they constitute almost half of the electorate now. That increase in non-affiliated voters has assuredly impacted the Democratic rolls.Of course, it’s also impacted Republican numbers. Thirty-eight percent of the electorate were registered Republicans in November 2004. Today, that number is 27%. It seems that the independent electoral movement is siphoning converts from both sides of the aisle.Perhaps it’s the incumbency problem at the top. Sitting presidents are frequently the source of partisan ire and admiration. Perhaps we can infer something about the Democrats’ deficit from presidential popularity over the decades. The answer is maybe.Biden’s job approval rating is low, averaging around 40% for the past many months. That’s bad news for the incumbent. But those numbers are within the margin of error for several former presidents, including Trump and, until right before the 2012 election when he saw a considerable spike, Barack Obama.One incumbent president was reelected with less than stellar approval ratings (Obama , and one was not (Trump . Throughout this period, though, Democrats were still doing well — they were above water.We might also surmise that Democrats face unprecedented headwinds, challenges no party or president has likewise encountered in the 21st century.COVID-19 wreaked havoc on public perception (the economy is not as bad as many suggest ; there is battle fatigue over the country’s support for overseas wars; both the Supreme Court and Congress appear feckless; polarization is testing our capacity for patience and compassion; traditional allies, like young voters, union members,and persons of color, are abandoning the party in record numbers; the party’s standard bearer is just plain old. I could go on. The list is long, the troubles are real and the Democrats are reeling.So then why is this good news for Biden? Why should Democrats feel some optimism about the current electoral landscape?Because he’s keeping it close. The most recent polls show that Biden is running neck and neck, nationally, with Trump. The current president is even remaining competitive in some of the crucial swing states. Staying competitive in a race where both candidates are facing eye-popping disapproval ratings may seem like a hollow victory.But in this political climate — where the Republican base is more energized, incumbency is a liability, Democratic Party registration has slowed, COVID’s electoral relevance is long gone, inflation remains high and traditional Democratic backers are questioning their allegiance — any victory is welcome. The contrast is rich. The Democratic Party is bleeding support while polls suggest that its leader remains electorally viable.Of course, the presidential race is barely across the starting line. Nov. 5 is a long way off and a lot can happen between now and then. If I’m Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s talented campaign manager, I’m focused as much on getting the Democratic Party above water as I am on the administration’s record, or the candidate’s experience, or even the virtue of continuity.What is more, a push to close the partisan gap in the months leading up to Election Day has the benefit of dimming the spotlight just a bit on an incumbent president who appears reluctant to spar with the press. Counter the president’s electoral vulnerabilities, I say, with a multifront campaign centered on his successes, Trump’s unpredictability and shoring up the Democratic Party rolls.In the end, it seems apparent that closing the 7% deficit Democrats face today may be the key to holding on to the White House, surging in the Senate and flipping control of the House. Democrats, it appears, will need to learn how to tread water once again."
minnpost_2024_82,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Here we go again. The wealthy, white and disproportionately powerful lobby groups rabidly promoting doctor-prescribed suicide for people with disabilities are back at it in Minnesota.So bold, they even buy advertisements in our disability rights publications to woo people into supporting their very own demise. Don’t let them fool you. They do not want “equity at the end of life” or equity at any time during the lives of people with disabilities. They are not out promoting the ADA Integration Mandate, which requires state and local governments to provide services to people with disabilities in integrated settings. Nor are they out ensuring that our rights as people with disabilities, and their families, are realistically living out the Olmstead Decision, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the rights of the disabled to receive assistance in community based settings.I have never seen them side-by-side with any of us demanding that Minnesota fix the catastrophic staffing crisis. I have never seen them wheeling next to my son and demanding that people have actual choice in where they live, who they live with, and who provides their care.Members of Compassion & Choices and other end-of-life groups want to be able to end their lives with a doctor’s prescription before they become people with disabilities. Many people with disabilities live in poverty without power to resist this privileged lobby. People with physical disabilities lack even the staff to get them up and out of bed and provide transportation to attend press conferences or to testify in Minnesota, or they live in congregate care facilities that just won’t do this.Doctor- and practioner-prescribed suicide will weaponize an already biased medical community even further against my son Kylen (who has a genetic disorder that causes quadriplegic cerebral palsy and his peers. We are already looked at as a burden to society and a drain on resources and finances. Let’s be clear and agree that it is poverty, not pain, that drives people to doctor-prescribed suicide. It is a lack of direct staff care providers to help people with disabilities bathe, and get dressed, transfer, and position themselves that lead people to want to kill themselves so that they are not a “burden to their family.”After 25 years ofphysician-assisted suicide in Oregon, Oregon Public Health reports that people want assisted suicide for these reasons:Six out of seven of the reasons for seeking a doctor’s prescription to kill oneself are attributes of people with disabilities. These reasons would be ameliorated by the implementation of the ADA Integration Mandate and an assurance that the Olmstead Decision will be applied to everybody with disabilities. People with disabilities lose autonomy without staff. People with disabilities lose autonomy when they are forced to live in a congregate care institutional facility that the state calls “community” living. People with disabilities feel like a burden on their mom, dad, sister, brother, spouse, siblings and friends when they do not have staff. People with disabilities feel like a financial burden when the system forces them to live in poverty and their family members cannot be gainfully employed because there is no staff to provide the direct care for activities of daily living.People cannot enjoy activities in their lives without staff to assist them. People with disabilities experience incontinence. The stigma, embarrassment and fear of incontinence and bodily functions can be reduced or eliminated with the right staff to provide this assistance versus a spouse or adult child. Incontinence does not equal an undignified life. If you are a person that believes that incontinence is undignified, then you are telling me and my son that his life is undignified. That fits the very definition of ableism.The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development predicts that Minnesota requires an increase of about 60,000 direct support positions to support people with disabilities. There can be no discussion of the medical community providing prescriptions for suicide during a catastrophic staffing crisis. There can be no discussion of doctor-prescribed suicide when there is no equity and no power for the most marginalized group in Minnesota — people with disabilities.Katheryn J. Ware, of South St. Paul, is a registered nurse and a public health nurse."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_148,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°My resident describes our next emergency room patient — a 32-year-old female with severe, crampy mid-abdominal pain, vomiting and occasional loose stools. The symptoms have been present for nearly a week, and there is tenderness to both sides of the upper abdomen. It could be a gallbladder problem, the resident says, hepatitis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis or an atypical appendicitis. She proposes routine blood tests along with an ultrasound and an abdominal CT scan.This is the time-honored approach to an undifferentiated patient complaint: Generate a list of possible diagnoses, decide which represent a “reasonable” concern and use the results from further testing to conclude what’s going on. Yet increasingly the second phase of this process — evaluating which diagnoses represent a reasonable concern — is getting short shrift. It is the heavy lift of any patient encounter — weighing disease probabilities, probing for details. It’s often simpler, and faster, to cast a wide net, click the standard order for blood work and imaging, and wait for the results to pop up.The issue of the “busy doctor ordering too many tests” has plagued medicine for decades. Now, as hospitals inject algorithms and technology into their workflow, it’s much worse. Medicine is moving inexorably away from the deductive arts, becoming more technology- and test-dependent and less patient-centric.Go to an emergency room today and you will likely be met within minutes by a doctor whose sole role is to perform a “rapid medical evaluation.” The provider asks a few questions, ticks boxes on a computer screen and, shazam, you are in line for the most likely series of tests and scans, all based on typically a less than 60-second encounter.This strategy seems obvious. When workups are initiated as soon as the patient arrives, wait times go down, patient satisfaction goes up, and fewer patients leave out of frustration before even being seen. These are the metrics that put smiles on administrators’ faces and give hospitals high marks in national surveys.But is it good doctoring? Without the luxury of time, these gateway providers typically lump patients into broad, generic categories: the middle-aged person with chest pain, the short-of-breath asthmatic, the vomiting pregnant patient, the septuagenarian with cough and fever, and so forth. The diagnosis is then reverse-engineered with tests to cover all possible bases for that particular complaint.In essence this is flipping the script on traditional doctoring while incentivizing doctors to use testing as a surrogate for critical thinking, dumbing down the practice of medicine and throwing gasoline on the problem of over-testing.Since rapid evaluation became the norm, use of laboratory, CT and ultrasound services at my hospital has increased nearly 20%. Just the other day, a pregnant woman in my ER went through a full battery of time-consuming, expensive and invasive tests even though she’d been through all of them at another hospital the day before. As far as I can tell, the only reason we did that was because that’s what an algorithm told us to do.This has real effects on patients. Contrary to popular perception, more tests may not supply more answers. That’s because the accuracy of any test depends on the likelihood that the patient has the disease in question before the test is performed. Testing performed without the appropriate indication or context can produce incidental or even spurious results that may have your doctor looking in entirely the wrong direction.The basic problem with hospitals’ growing obsession with efficiency is this: Algorithmic systems treat all patients the same, expecting precise, like-for-like responses to every question with just the right amount of detail. Except every patient is unique. And they tend to give up their stories at their own pace, in broken, non-linear fits and starts, sometimes conflating truth and fiction in ways that can be counterproductive and frustrating, but also uniquely human. I am often reminded of Jack Webb in the old TV series “Dragnet” imploring a witness to offer “just the facts, ma’am, just the facts.” In real life, whether from situational stress, self-delusion, superstition, health illiteracy, mental illness, drugs or alcohol, my patients’ initial version of their complaint is rarely “just the facts” or the final word on the subject.A colleague recently described her role in a clinical encounter as 9 parts translator to 1 part doctor. One question leads to another, and then another, and another until she successfully translates the patient’s lived experience into a language modern medicine and its algorithms might begin to understand. My experience is similar. Properly choreographed, the doctor-patient interaction becomes a pas de deux — two people in sync, jointly trying to solve a puzzle with each sharing their perspective and expertise. In the transition to front-loaded care, I worry health decisions will be made with information that may be incomplete or, at times, totally unreliable.Algorithmic medicine also seems tailor-made for an AI takeover. The logic is obvious. Use “big data” to assist doctors and nurses struggling to keep up with the demands of modern medicine. AI can ensure a level, consistent floor of care that avoids errors of omission by considering a deliberately broad list of diagnostic possibilities. In an ideal world, a synergy of human and machine intelligence could amplify the patient-doctor encounter. As likely, AI will lead doctors to abdicate judgment and responsibility to the automated response of the machine.And so, I complimented my resident on her list of concerns but suggested that we spend a little more time with the patient. The story of her symptoms didn’t feel complete. I recommended my resident grab a chair and simply ask the patient about her life. What emerged was the chaotic picture of an exhausted part-time student by day, working two evening waitressing jobs and surviving on pizza, pasta and energy drinks. She had always had a “fragile stomach.”Our list of reasonable diagnoses was expanding and contracting, replaced with irritable bowel syndrome, food intolerances, gut motility issues, all overlying a stressed individual barely keeping it together. The labs, ultrasound or CT scan initially proposed now seemed irrelevant.The result: The patient got out of the hospital faster. She received helpful suggestions about stress reduction, diet and sleep habits. She got an appointment with a primary care physician and avoided thousands of dollars in tests. Had we just relied on tests instead of asking a few more questions, there is a good chance we would have missed the best approach to her problem entirely.ER waiting rooms and wards are bursting at the seams, and the streamlining of care has never felt more essential. But this is not an excuse for doctors to relinquish their humanity or their “method.” We should tweak the process: Allow more time for doctors to get the story right, do less testing until we have weighed the risks and rewards, prioritize asking questions rather than merely looking for answers.Sociologists coined the term “pre-automation” to describe the transitional phase in which humans lay the groundwork for automation, often by acting in increasingly machine-like ways. As providers, we must not fall in line.Put another way, with AI primed to take on a substantial role in how doctors deliver care, we should remind ourselves: If we behave like machines, we certainly won’t be missed when machines replace us.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

minnpost_2024_111,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Last week, in one of those periodic “let’s get rid of our junk” bursts, I went through a file of old letters written to me in the late 1960s and early and mid-1970s. With a few notable exceptions, such as newsy reports from my mother and a near-perfect epistle penned by my eighth-grade educated paternal grand-mother wintering in Harlingen, Texas, they were from friends, girlfriends and ex-girlfriends-become-just-friends — all in their early to late 20s, my own age during that time.My first thought on rereading the letters was what a treasure technology has taken away from us. In those days, non-local phone calls were labeled “long-distance” and charged exorbitantly, particularly after three minutes. Emails, texts and mobile phone conversations existed only in the crazed minds of techies and a few far-sighted investors. Unlike those near-instant and quickly erased communiques, the act of putting thoughts to paper allowed writers more time and space to recall memories, assemble thoughts and express fears and hopes and for recipients to first read and then preserve the same for reading again another day.Confusion on life goals was a common theme among my chroniclers. I suppose that’s to be expected in any era among 20-somethings. They’ve recently cut loose from parents and academic institutions, often without a stable relationship and working on one of their first full-time jobs.For my 1970s letter writers, add to that the change-the-world impulse that was all around then because of Vietnam War protests and various civil rights and anti-poverty movements. The result was an almost universal sentiment in the letters that “I have to do something” about the mess the world is in.For example, one fellow law student wrote from a 1972 summer law-firm job in Louisville that she found law to be too constraining and wanted to work on the McGovern campaign. (She finished law school instead and, at age 76, according to Google, is still practicing public interest law in Kentucky. Two others, both teachers, were tired of the slow progress of learning and wanted to follow me to law school. (Luckily, they didn’t. One was later named North Carolina’s Teacher of the Year and the other became a school superintendent and a well-regarded consultant to school boards around the country. The letters also reflected lots of upheaval, both on social and personal levels.A set reminded me that FBI agents interviewed my mother because a friend was suspected of being responsible for the August 1970 bombing of the old federal building in Minneapolis (now the Paul Wellstone Federal Building , which then served as a site for both draft physicals and military inductions. When I told my friend about the FBI’s suspicions, he denied any involvement and pointed out that, because of a new job, he had recently cut his hair and shaved and now “looked like a Republican.” I doubt my friend, a terrible klutz, could have successfully lit a firecracker, much less ignite a bomb. Incidentally, nobody was ever arrested for the bombing despite a $25,000 reward offered by KSTP-TV.One friend, then aged 26, complained of married life. From a previous relationship his beloved new wife had a special-needs 4-year-old requiring a great deal of attention and my friend said the effort to care for the child amounted for him to “a long painful strangulation.” He asked, “How can I have my freedom and not harm a person I love very deeply?” (The couple divorced several years later. On the other side of parenting, a female friend I had known while living in Washington, D.C., wrote from Tennessee, praising both the Lamaze method of childbirth and the joys of breastfeeding for both mother and baby. Unlike my male friend, she believed life with her musician husband and child was exactly where she was meant to be. (Within five years from that writing she, too, was divorced. Finally, a summer 1969 letter from a childhood friend stationed in Vietnam reminded me in those days that that awful war always seemed to be present.Two of my brothers and I — each in our 20s and who each had avoided military service — spoke on a tape his mother had sent him saying that though we opposed continued U.S. involvement there we appreciated his sacrifices and those of other soldiers in Vietnam. In his letter, my friend thanked us for those thoughts and said he had played the tape several times for his sergeant and other soldiers. The sergeant instructed him to tell us, “He personally was very glad there’s some (expletives draft dodgers who appreciate us” and that our opinions echoed the way he and most of his fellow soldiers felt about being there.My friend wound up his letter with these words: “But then nothing makes sense in war. I guess that’s the way it’s supposed to be.”Ken Peterson, of St. Paul, is a retired attorney and served as the state’s commissioner of labor and industry under Govs. Rudy Perpich and Mark Dayton.

I arrived in Philadelphia as an undocumented child; my family came from Colombia seeking a better future. I know all too well the cruelty of our immigration system and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I watched my father get arrested, only to be deported. I have lived in separation from him for the majority of my life.Since 2021, I have been a naturalized citizen and a registered voter. The very same elected leaders who will be asking me to vote for them this year are not only throwing my community under the bus but actively harming it.Earlier this year, in reference to proposed border security legislation, President Joe Biden said, “If that bill were the law today, I’dshut down the border right nowand fix it quickly.” Two months ago, Sen. John Fetterman stated that “we need a secure border,” but made no mention of a pathway to citizenship for the11 million undocumented people in this country, a community thatused to include his wife. Sen. Bob Casey, who is also running for reelection this year, has openly endorsed “securing the border” and sending billions of taxpayer dollars for the United States’ proxy wars. These senators voted twice in favor of a package ofanti-immigrant billsthat would close the border and gut asylum. Now, the president is considering executive orders to enact those two actions.Biden, Casey, and Fetterman do not care about immigrants. Their actions demonstrate this clearly.The national conversation has only included measures for border militarization and the expansion of the deportation machine; all of the promises of a pathway to citizenship for the last 20 years have been abandoned. These concessions are in addition to theexpansion of detentionanddeportationsover the last three years, and thecontinued border wall constructionunderway outside of McAllen, Texas.This is an insult to the immigrant community. Our people and our families deserve dignity and justice. We are not political pawns to be used for stump speeches and campaign sound bites. These negotiations are an affront to all working-class people whose tax money is being used for war, weapons, and death while wages remain stagnant, the impact of inflation is still being felt, and there are housing, health care, childcare, public education, opioid, and environmental crises.In 2020, Biden campaigned onoverturning Trump-era immigration policies. Not only has he failed to deliver, Biden, with the support of senators like Casey and Fetterman, is now actively trying to restart or expand those policies.But we all know Biden and Casey cannot win Pennsylvania without the support of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC voters, many of whom are immigrants or children of immigrants. You can’t represent voters if you don’t listen to them, too.The failed Senate immigration bills are rooted in xenophobia and white supremacy, denying people their right to asylum. Yet, overwhelmingly, voters support the U.S.having a system for asylum-seekers. Turning your back on immigrants, demonizing and endangering families, and pursuing billions for wars is how you alienate not just voters like me but alsoyouth, Muslims, and people of color. We are tired of being used, talked at, or ignored. We are tired of always being thrown away.If Biden, Casey, and Fetterman want to be elected, then they need to earn our support. End the pursuit of anti-immigrant policies and legislation that reduces people’s rights to asylum and increases immigrant detention and deportations.Instead of expanding the deportation machine, demonstrate commitment to the immigrant community byending the ICE contractsat the Moshannon, Pike, Clinton, and Elizabeth detention centers. These prisons have years of reported verbal and physical abuse, medical neglect, lack of nutritious food, and overreliance on solitary confinement. Just last December, aCameroonian man died in the Moshannon Detention Centerright before he was due to be released.The seeds our politicians sow now will bear fruit in November.

philinquirer_2024_56,"Many people who are incarcerated or have been in the past are eligible to vote but don t realize it. And in a swing state such as ours, every vote matters.In Pennsylvania,tens of thousands of eligible votersdon’t realize they’re allowed to vote simply because they’re currently incarcerated, or they were at some point in the past.According tostate law, people who are incarcerated for a misdemeanor, who are in pretrial detention, or who are on parole or probation are all eligible to vote.When I was convicted of a misdemeanor in 2020 and incarcerated from February to April, I knew I could still vote. I wanted to continue my stellar record of voting, especially in an important 2020 election year. But almost all the people I was incarcerated with didn’t realize they could vote in that election, too.Still, knowing you can vote is only half the battle.In order to vote in the 2020 primary, I asked the correctional officers at the Centre County Correctional Facility in Bellefonte, Pa., how I could cast my ballot, and they informed me there was no way for me to cast a ballot.In order to vote for the primary election in June of that year, I was told to talk to the counselor, who was of little help. He told me I had to wait and hope for a volunteer organization to come in before the deadline and help me apply for an absentee ballot.When I waited and went to ask again how to vote, I was told there was no way for me to cast a ballot at that time. I became frustrated and concerned that I actually wouldn’t be able to vote in the primary.» READ MORE:Can this group of former offenders swing the Philly DA race?Act 77, passed in 2019, helped create a more efficientsystem of distributing absentee ballots, which should make it even easier for incarcerated people to vote. However, Pennsylvania county jails do not have a universal process for voter registration, voting by mail, or voter education, which discourages thousands of incarcerated people in the commonwealth from exercising their constitutional right to vote.More than half of the jails in the commonwealth don’t have a written policy regarding voting procedures,according to a reportdone by my organization,All Voting is Local, in conjunction with theCommittee of SeventyandCommon Cause. In 2020, 25,000 people were held in county jails across the state. Of those people, our report found that only 52 requested mail-in ballots for the 2020 general election that year.The current system is essentially disenfranchising tens of thousands of Pennsylvania residents. And in a swing state — whichDonald Trump won by less than 45,000 votes in 2016— every vote matters.Every vote matters.This is about more than voting, and it is much bigger than one election.Our criminal justice system hinges on the principle of rehabilitation. Being able to reenter society with full citizenship and the right to vote is essential to that rehabilitation process. Participation in our democracy is key to ensuring all people whose rights have been restored can remain engaged in their communities and are less likely to reenter the criminal justice system.Pennsylvania needs to do a much better job of helping people who are incarcerated, and those who have criminal records, participate in our democracy.Jail administrators need to build detailed policies and procedures that ensure every eligible voter can register to vote, cast a ballot, and have that ballot counted.My organization is working alongside partners in the state to remove barriers to the ballot box for Pennsylvanians who are incarcerated. In addition to advocating for statewide policy changes to jail voting policies, we’re also centering organizations led by people of color to lead in organizing efforts to educate currently and formerly incarcerated people about their voting rights. We do this by working with jail administrations to do direct voter registration, provide education around how to apply for a mail-in ballot, and nonpartisan information about which offices are being voted on and how to cast your mail-in ballots once received.It’s also important to provide training materials for prison staff and the families impacted by the criminal justice system so both sides can encourage incarcerated people to vote when they’re legally able to do so. Local organizations should continue to educate families on how their incarcerated loved ones can register to vote, apply for a mail-in ballot, and cast their votes both while serving their sentences and after they’ve returned to the community. Organizations should also educate these voters on the candidates running for public office, so they can make an informed decision.I was lucky: I was released from county jail in April 2020, so I was able to vote in the June primary and the November general election. But the experience of struggling to vote while incarcerated stayed with me.After seeing firsthand how little information and resources exist for eligible voters in the same position I was in, I know there’s a long way to go. I also know that our democracy works best when everyone participates. Together, we can ensure voters can make their voices heard and not be unfairly left out of the process.Nicholas Pressley is the Pennsylvania state director of All Voting is Local."
suffolknewsherald_2024_14,"Published 4:07 pm Wednesday, July 3, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy: Myrtle V. ThompsonJuly 4 is the day we celebrate our country’s independence. Our American red, white, and blue flag symbolizes freedom. It reminds us we became a great nation and influenced the world with what we believed was freedom’s essence. I will be flying my flag on July 4.I am a 96-year-old lover of my country. That flag is a reminder of many of the privileges we have in America. I love to hear our national anthem, the refrain of “God Bless America,” and patriotic songs like “This is my country, land of my birth …” We pledge allegiance to this flag. It should be the desire of every parent to teach their children why this country is special.I was a Deep Creek High School student in grade seven when WW II started. It did not take long to understand what was happening. We had only 11 grades of schooling but had already been taught the essentials — we saluted that flag. There had been no recent known threats to our peace. We would soon learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor. My oldest brother was in the Navy, stationed there. We had no TV, but our family had a small radio. My parents sat each night listening to the news.Now I am looking back, thinking of the emotional effect that war news must have had on everyone. The drafting of young men was in effect. My two older brothers quickly joined the Navy. It was important to everyone that our country be preserved. The churches were left open 24/7 for all who wanted or felt the need to pray. Certain foods were rationed or in short supply. I don’t think anyone complained because we seemed to understand our future was on the line.In my many world travels and extended years living in three foreign countries, I have never experienced freedom anywhere else like we have had it in our country. I hope we will not allow ourselves to be taken over by some who want us to comply with what they seem to prefer, a “ruling class” of wealthy individuals. A look at what has happened to countries around us should make us aware of what that could do to our freedom.I don’t remember studying much of the nation’s history in those early school days, but while clearing out old papers, I found a copy of the Constitution and wondered how much of its truths are being taught today.I then did what I seem always to do, I compared the truths of that great document to the truths found in our Bible, looking for their relevance. The writers of that document understood we cannot enjoy life in a nation where all is in confusion and leadership is combative. They came to an agreement and the Constitutionbecame the document for our nation/s guidance.The basis for many of the rules for good conduct is found in the Ten Commandments of the Bible. God set those standards. Teaching those relevant commandments in schools and to our children would help us ensure right living.I hope this Fourth of July will find all of us thanking God for our country and asking Him to keep us free. Flying our flag on July 4 will show our loyalty and perhaps remind us to thank God for all we have. Let’s not forget we are still a free country. Let’s humble ourselves and give thanks to God for all we have and have had. We have been blessed with so many good things.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss. The outings include the Los Angeles Dodgers squaring off…Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_261,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It’s an election year, which means we’ll be hearing a lot from both Democrats and Republicans claiming that their party is the one true champion of working-class Americans. Sure, but what does it mean to be part of the working class in America these days? It means being female.If there’s one statistic that describes the “working class” it is this: Of the 869,000 workers that are paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour or less, 69% are women, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Their ideal champion is one who fights for universal paid family leave, universal childcare, a higher minimum wage, improved regulations that guarantee paid sick days, and better enforcement of labor laws that protect them from wage theft and sexual harassment.The polling firm Gallup has routinely asked Americans to self-identify into a class: upper, upper-middle, middle, working and lower. By their categorization, the working class is somewhere between poor and comfortable, avoiding poverty but missing the hallmarks of middle-class life, such as retirement security or owning a home. The working class have jobs, but they’re surviving, not thriving.And as vague as the notion of “surviving, not thriving” is among workers, women are much more likely to fit the bill. Just under half, around 47%, of employed workers in the US are women but they are the majority of low-paid workers. There are a few ways to think about this. One is to look at the lowest-paying occupations and determine what share of the workers are women. Sure enough, among the bottom 20 lowest-paying occupations, in which a worker can expect to earn $30,000 to $35,000 a year, women are the majority in 15 of them, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics — a clear overrepresentation.An alternative to looking within low-paying occupations is to sum them up. Using this method, we find about 8 million workers are employed in the 20 lowest paid occupations and 4.9 million, or about 62%, are women. Clear overrepresentation again. Summing the data across the bottom 50 and 75 occupations would tell the same story. In other words, if it’s lower paid, women will be overrepresented.With that in mind, the policies that they need championing are ones that improve working conditions for women because low-wage jobs are less likely to have paid time off, retirement benefits or health insurance. Also, such jobs are more likely to be in high-violation industries, or those identified by the Department of Labor as having the highest incidence of wage theft.For women workers, there’s the added issue of harassment. Data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are hard to come by, but historically pregnancy discrimination and sexual harassment is much more common in low-wage industries, such as retail, accommodation and food services, than it is in higher-paying industries. Plus, there’s the burden of caregiving. Women are more likely to be caring for children as well as sick or elderly family members than men. Hence, a true working-class champion would also be fighting for labor law enforcement and paid family leave.The politics of the working class has largely ignored women because they have proven less interesting as a voting bloc. Over the last 40 years, White men without a college degree switched political parties. They were dubbed the White working-class male. It’s a political moniker, not borne from the actual working-class demographic, but a convenient shorthand to describe people who have not gone to college. That’s not the same thing as actually being working class. For example, defined that way, 62% of Americans would be working class, which is far too broad. That’s more than double what those in the Gallup polls self-identify as, which has held at around 30% since 2000.Sure, plenty of men are part of the working class, but they aren’t representative of the group overall because they generally earn too much. Consider that men with no more than a high school diploma outearn their female counterparts by around $6 an hour. Viewed another way, men who didn’t finish high school can expect to earn about the same as women who did —$19 an hour. The low wages for women are one reason they are more likely than men to be working at least two jobs.None of this is meant to minimize White, male, non-college degree holders as a group. They have a unique economic history that is deeply intertwined with the decline of blue collar work. Economists estimate that the wages of 25- to 54-year-old men without a college degree tumbled 18% in real terms between 1973 and 2015. But keep in mind that even after that decline they are still far out-earning similarly educated working women. Plus, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Chips and Science Act, and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will create more non-college jobs at higher pay in typically male occupations.The true working class — the surviving not thriving low-paid women in jobs without fringe, without leave, without care — deserve a champion, or at least a politician to recognize them for what they are.Kathryn Anne Edwards is a labor economist and independent policy consultant."
minnpost_2024_66,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Is local news readily available in your town? Do reporters still cover your school board and other municipal meetings?If you answered yes, you are likely wealthier than the average American, and you live in or near a metro area.The State of Local News Project at Northwestern University documents the changing local news landscape across the country. Ourlatest reportshows that where you live and how much money you make affect whether you live in a news desert or a news oasis. This divide is related to other factors affecting the health of our democracy, as analysis of our data by the nonprofitRebuild Local Newsshowed.For more than a decade, I have worked in organizations that study and support local journalism, and I’mintimately familiarwith both the challenges and the solutions for the local journalism landscape.One of the most vexing problems, as our report shows, is the persistence of inequity between communities that are local journalism haves and have-nots.The have-nots are news deserts with few, if any, journalists to do the daily newsgathering and reporting that people require to participate meaningfully in their local communities and democratic institutions.The main challenge for news outlets in have-not communities is themigration of advertising money from the printed page– where it made up roughly 80% of news organizations’ income – to the screen, where it now makes up less than 20%. This decline in ad revenue, a trend for the last decade-plus, has forced many outlets to rely on audience funding, philanthropy, cost-cutting or some combination of the three.In communities with little disposable income to put toward news subscriptions or donations and no local philanthropies, cost-cutting becomes the only option. This creates a self-reinforcing spiral of lower quality and declining readership and, ultimately, closure.In 2023, the country lost more than 130 print newspapers, which continue to be the newsrooms most likely to produce original local content that other outlets circulate.Since 2005, the U.S. has lost almost 2,900 papers.New digital outlets are not being created fast enough to fill that huge void. The number of digital outlets has held steady at roughly 550 in recent years, with about 20 new outlets opening each year – and roughly the same number closing.All told, 1,558 of the nation’s 3,143 counties have only one news outlet, while 203 are news deserts with zero, meaning there are likely thousands of communities that simply do not have access to local news.For example, both Texas and Tennessee had four counties lose their only remaining newspaper last year. All eight papers were independently owned.Wealthier communities do better sustaining local news organizations.Our data shows that counties with an average household income over US$80,000 can support a robust local journalism ecosystem – meaning 10 or more outlets. Those with an average household income of $54,000 or less are more likely to be news deserts. By the same token, the percentage of the population below the poverty line in news deserts averages more than 16%, versus 12% in counties with robust markets. This finding aligns withother research, including a previous study I did oflocal news in New Jersey.In addition to household income, population density correlates to the number of outlets serving a local community. In our data, counties with 10 or more outlets are overwhelmingly urban or dense suburbia, while news deserts are usually rural – though news deserts also occur in low-income pockets of metro areas. Densely populated communities tend to include higher-income households and have network effects that come from the ability of businesses to reach a larger number of people in a relatively small footprint.This phenomenon leads to the third factor related to number of outlets in a county: gross domestic product per capita. In any town, city or country, the GDP represents the amount of money netted from sales of services and merchandise, divided by population. For the news oases in our study, the average GDP per capita is $75,140. For the news deserts, it is just $8,964. This difference reflects the retail and services base, and the number of businesses that could buy advertising in their local news outlet, or create jobs that would allow residents to donate to one.An example that highlights the importance of this factor is the newspaperMoab Sun News, which is thriving in the rural rocky highlands of Utah, thanks in part to arobust tourism industry and retail base. Though it serves a relatively small permanent population of 5,321, the Moab Sun News has built a sustainable business model through strong advertising revenue, a user-friendly website that welcomes subscriptions and donations, and creative collaborations with other community organizations in town.The final factor that contributes to a community being a journalism have or have-not is access to high-quality broadband.Emerging metricsshow that this near-necessity of contemporary life is not yet reliably available to rural Americans.Despite these seemingly intractable problems, solutions to local journalism inequality are becoming clearer.One is collaboration. For example, in Colorado, the national nonprofit news outlet The Daily Yonder has hired a reporter based in a rural community to write stories about life there andshare them out with both local and national organizations.Another is philanthropy. The new Press Forward initiative has begunlocal chapters across the country, with at least one planning to serve rural communities. Organizations like theNational Trust for Local Newshave been buying outlets that would likely otherwise be sold to hedge funds, and turning them into nonprofits that will continue to serve their communities.Public policy should also play a role. At the state level,policiestosupport local newshave seen success in New Jersey, California and elsewhere, andmore billsare working their way through state legislatures.People seem to be realizingthat having quality local news is just as vital as having public education and access to health care. With any luck, every community will have the opportunity to be a journalism “have.”Sarah Stonbely, Director, State of Local News Project,Northwestern UniversityThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_62,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°TNSIn this 2020 file photo, Aileen Cannon testifies remotely before the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary on her nomination to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida in Washington, D.C. (U.S. Senate Television/CNP/Zuma Press/TNS In 2020, Donald Trump made a bet that is today paying off: nominating Florida Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, who now oversees the classified documents case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. Friday, Cannon held a stunning hearing on whether Smith was legally appointed in the first place.The authority of the U.S. attorney general to name a special counsel has been challenged before and always upheld, yet Cannon is entertaining this settled matter and not even with arguments submitted on paper alone, but by wasting a full day in court on the back and forth. She even let outside parties join the fray and make their points in court, an extraordinary display of judicial leniency.Smith’s position is constitutional, as was Bob Mueller’s when he probed Trump’s 2016 Russia connection, as are the two special counsels who looked at the Biden family: Robert Hur, who investigated President Joe’s handling of classified docs (which was dropped without charges and David Weiss, who prosecuted and convicted First Son Hunter in Delaware on gun charges and will try Hunter in California on tax charges in September.During Friday’s hearing, Cannon needled prosecutors about AG Merrick Garland’s role over the investigation, appearing to at least tacitly accept the premise that there might be some politically-motivated meddling here.Cannon is showing no actual legal philosophy, only that she’s a novice judge and loyal to Trump and skeptical of the efforts to hold him accountable, for ideological reasons that extend well beyond the boundaries of something as pedestrian as a cohesive legal approach.This is, of course, what Trump appointed her for; Trump couldn’t have known that Cannon, specifically, would one day be presiding over a federal criminal trial into his conduct, but legal acumen and experience were not big priorities in finding people for these lifetime jobs on the bench. Political alignment was what mattered.That’s paying off, and it should be understood as a racket by both observers and the legislators who have oversight functions over the courts. It’s not just the Supreme Court that has been openly co-opted by the extreme right and the MAGA crowd, but judges at all levels of the judiciary.The reality right now is that, even if this long-shot and harebrained effort at derailing the Smith investigations fails, Cannon’s already delivered Trump a significant victory. Her antics are eating up valuable time, making it less and less likely the documents cases will move to the trial phase before the November election.That means that the American electorate will not get to see the case presented against Trump in these very serious matters.

minnpost_2024_89,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.President Lyndon Johnson won the New Hampshire primary in 1968 by about 10 points – and promptly withdrew from the race. His narrow victory was widely interpreted as a loss. Interestingly, former President Donald Trump’s margin of victory earlier this month was about the same as LBJ’s, but no one is expecting him to withdraw from the race.Unlike Johnson in 1968, Trump will benefit from Republican primary electorates in upcoming states that are decidedly more conservative than New Hampshire. Trump won Republican voters who identify as conservatives by a wide margin. He lost to moderate Republicans and independents, but those center-right voters are scarce in upcoming Republican primary states. It seems likely that Trump will be the nominee.Yet Trump’s relatively narrow victory reveals some vulnerabilities. Since 1952, five incumbent presidents received less than 60% in the New Hampshire primary, similar to Trump’s total. All of them — Truman, LBJ, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush — either withdrew from the race or lost the November election. Seven of eight incumbent presidents who got over 60% in the New Hampshire primary went on to win the November election.Less decisive victories reveal a president who is unable to unify their party. George H.W. Bush won 57% of the 1992 New Hampshire primary vote against Pat Buchanan — forerunner of Trump — who won about 40%. Bush was unable to bring the party together and lost to Bill Clinton in the fall. Similarly, Jimmy Carter defeated Ted Kennedy by about 10 points and then lost the fall election.Successful Republican presidents unite the so-called Republican establishment with social conservatives or the more populist wing of the party. Richard Nixon’s “southern strategy” won over former supporters of George Wallace on the way to a November landslide. Ronald Reagan’s embrace of Christian conservatives was similarly successful and he won without alienating Wall Street Republicans who formed the core of the Republican establishment. More recent Republican presidential candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney have struggled to build the diverse coalitions led by Nixon and Reagan.Trump won in 2016 by shunning the Republican establishment as he advocated a starkly anti-immigrant agenda and opposition to free trade. Earlier Republicans like George W. Bush and Romney took opposite positions on those issues. Once in office, Trump ironically had more success in passing the core policies of the Republican establishment: a deep tax cut tilted toward the wealthy and reductions in regulation. This helped him retain the support of Republicans like Mitch McConnell.The conservative primary electorate may choose a candidate less able to win in November. With Trump as its leader, the Republican Party has suffered election losses in 2018, 2020 and 2022. That record shows Trump’s inability to unify different parts of the Republican Party. Together with Biden’s wide victory in the New Hampshire primary, the tides seem to be favorable for Democrats. Yet many things will happen before November.Dan Hofrenning is professor of political science at St. Olaf College.

The 59-year-old lawyer is a former U.S. senator and served as California attorney general and San Francisco’s district attorney.Yet when former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s nominee to be returned to the highest office in the land, speaks of Harris, he inevitably lowers himself to the language of racists and misogynists.At his first political rally after the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee — and despite all the calls from both inside and outside his party for unity and civility — the 78-year-old New York native, who once held the powerful post occupied by such statesmen as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, mocked Harris as “nuts” and “crazy.”“Kamala, I call her laughing Kamala,” Trump told the crowd gathered in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “Have you seen her laughing? She is crazy. You can tell a lot by a laugh. She is nuts. She is not as crazy as Nancy Pelosi.”Trump’s supporters ate it up, of course. MAGA enthusiasts started calling her the “DEI candidate” well before President Joe Biden’s announcement Sunday that he is not running for reelection.With Biden’s subsequent endorsement of Harris, and as each hour goes by and more Democrats rally to her candidacy, the vice president is clearly in the spotlight. And what message does it send to millions of Americans when a political rival directs himself not to her policies or positions, not to her resume or experience, but to crude, playground-level name-calling?Language that seems coarse when directed at a white male (“Sleepy Joe” or “Crooked Joe” as Trump so often describes Biden comes across as something far more malevolent and destructive when aimed at an educated and accomplished woman.Republicans claim to be the party of liberty, opportunity, freedom, and law and order. So why not run on a legitimate platform and not appeal to the baser instincts of voters? And please don’t tell us that this is all just harmless shtick.It isn’t. One would think that Trump’s history of sexual misconduct — including sexually abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996 and for having an intimate encounter with porn star Stormy Daniels in 2006 and subsequently paying her to keep silent about it when he ran for president — would preclude gender-based attacks, with both matters having resulted in costly court action. But they haven’t.If nothing else, it seems counterproductive for a candidate (a convicted felon at that who has suddenly gotten a bit weak-kneed over his past attacks on women’s reproductive rights (claiming victory over the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade yet backpedaling over a national abortion ban to treat Harris so disrespectfully.Has the Trump campaign forgotten how much a lack of support from political moderates and women cost him in the past, especially in 2020? In Grand Rapids, Trump referred to Chinese President Xi Jinping as “brilliant” and Russian President Vladimir Putin as “smart” and “tough.” Yet he described a fellow American, an accomplished woman of color, as “crazy.” What are we to make of that?This isn’t about diversity, equity and inclusion. This isn’t about socialism. It’s mostly about basic human decency. Young Black girls are watching this week’s extraordinary events and perhaps even seeing themselves in Kamala Harris. And what are they to think when this trailblazer is attacked for the sound of her laugh and not by the content of her message?Trump may yet win another term in the White House but the damage he may do before he gets there could prove lasting, if wholly unnecessary.— The Baltimore Sun"

These are among the most controversial and personal issues council members encounter as they serve the public. Decisions are made on a micro level down to one property adjoining the very next. This is done with scalpel precision in each community across the state. Zoning issues impact what are often individuals’ largest investments of their lives as they literally mortgage their future on a new home or business. Decisions on these delicate issues should not be made by legislators in St. Paul, but rather stay with local communities across Minnesota.A cadre of legislators have advanced legislation (SF3964 or SF3980 that would vastly undermine local decisions and instead provide a statewide solution for what is largely a metro problem. In Greater Minnesota, a lack of development for decades provides more than enough justification to reject these proposals because there is already a vested interest to keep regulations to a bare minimum so as to promote construction. The one-size-fits-all approach being advanced threatens to undermine the very housing gains some of us have seen in rural parts of Minnesota.For example, since the 1970s the City of Austin has allowed duplexes in single-family zoning areas (R1 . We’ve found the duplexes blend nicely, but having St. Paul dictate that eight-plexes are allowed in R1 zones threatens homebuilders’ confidence to make an investment because they might suddenly have a multifamily unit next door that could significantly impact their property value. Cohesive and thoughtful planning has been the hallmark of communities for time immemorial. This is an obvious unintended consequence that could actually stymie production — the reverse of legislators’ goal.Likewise, setting minimum lot sizes and dictating minimum square footage requirements from St. Paul continues the malignment of the good work done by municipalities. Requiring communities to accept a carte blanche tiny home approach forgets the other issues that can result when people have no place for their possessions and start accumulating them in their yard to more significant problems of dealing with infrastructure challenges caused by adding backyard small homes for density. Current water, sewer, electric or other infrastructure realities can’t suddenly accommodate a demand that hasn’t been planned for in the utility design. Determining long-term necessities, which are done in the local planning process, requires staff with intimate knowledge and elected officials at the local level to sort out these complex challenges.Cities’ positions aren’t the municipal equivalent of Not in My Backyard (NIMBY . Local leaders are best equipped to handle these decisions and promote progress while balancing compromise and accommodating real concerns. We don’t need any of Taylor Swift’s “bad blood” that would come from an encroachment on local control. Instead, we encourage more assistance from the state to help cities accomplish our goal of encouraging more housing construction.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_114,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°FILE — Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and his wife, Martha-Ann, visit the Capitol Rotunda as the Rev. Billy Graham lay in honor there on Feb. 28, 2018. Martha-Ann Alito has built a limited public life since moving to Washington that has mainly centered on apolitical projects and charity work. (Erin Schaff/The New York Times WASHINGTON — After Donald Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts in a Manhattan court, conservatives — from Marjorie Taylor Greene to George Santos to the Heritage Foundation — began posting upside-down American flags on the social platform X in solidarity with the “political prisoner,” as Trump absurdly styles himself.It was the same upside-down symbol that insurrectionists carried to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to proclaim that they thought the election was stolen and that was seen flying over Justice Samuel Alito’s house in suburban Virginia even as the Supreme Court was considering whether to hear a case about the 2020 presidential election.Now that it’s being used to show support for a felonious ex-president, Alito will have an even harder time trying to pretend he’s oblivious about its meaning.I don’t need a black robe to hand down a judgment on the Supreme Court.It’s corrupt, rotten and hurting America.The once august court, which the public held in highest esteem, is now hopelessly corroded: It is in the hands of a cabal of religious and far-right zealots, including a couple of ethical scofflaws with MAGA wives.Chief Justice John Roberts, who dreamed of being remembered as a great unifier of the court, is refusing to rein in Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas, who are thumbing their noses at the public and their own oaths to dispense fair and impartial justice.When Alito pushed a willing conservative majority into yanking away women’s right to control their own bodies, he was, in essence, blaming women: You get pregnant, you’ll have to live with it.In this latest firestorm, he blamed one woman in particular: his wife, Martha-Ann.Somehow, in Alito’s world, women are to blame.It was shocking when The New York Times’ Jodi Kantor reported that the upside-down flag cherished by “Stop the Steal” marchers was hanging outside Alito’s house. It was even more shocking when we learned that another flag carried by “Stop the Steal” rioters on Jan. 6, the “Appeal to Heaven” flag, was flying outside the Alitos’ vacation home in New Jersey as cases concerning the Jan. 6 assault and riot were pending at the court. This flag symbolizes support for Donald Trump and a desire to infuse the federal government with a lot more Christianity.“In coming weeks, the justices will rule on two climactic cases involving the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, including whether Trump has immunity for his actions,” Kantor wrote. “Their decisions will shape how accountable he can be held for trying to overturn the last presidential election and his chances for reelection in the upcoming one.”Alito’s conservative Christian, right-wing, deeply aggrieved views about the culture wars are reflected in his speeches, decisions and now flags that are red flags.He is refusing to recuse himself from the two cases about the attempted coup on Jan. 6. (One concerns the question of whether Trump is immune from prosecution for his role egging on rioters; the other involves a federal obstruction law used to charge the rioters. When leading Democratic lawmakers demanded Alito’s recusal, he wrote back, trying to make Martha-Ann Alito the fall guy. Alito has clearly heard enough criminal appeals to know you’ve got to point the finger at somebody else when you’re guilty.“My wife is fond of flying flags,” he wrote to the lawmakers. “I am not. She was solely responsible for having flagpoles put up at our residence and our vacation home and has flown a wide variety of flags over the years.”He’s happy to take away the rights of millions of American women to control their bodies, but respects the right of his wife to control their incendiary flags. While he’s on the Supreme Court, he said, Martha-Ann wields the gavel at home.“I was not even aware of the upside-down flag until it was called to my attention,” he wrote. “As soon as I saw it, I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused.” He said there was absolutely nothing he could do to get that pesky seditious flag taken down sooner.He was oblivious about the symbolism of the “Appeal to Heaven” pine tree flag, he claimed.Thomas is also awash in ethical snarls, some related to his wife. Ginni Thomas’ supporters also tried to defend her activism related to Jan. 6 by saying she is an independent spouse.But it doesn’t wash. As Jane Mayer wrote in The New Yorker, Ginni Thomas is a lawyer and a prominent member of hard-right groups and “has declared that America is in existential danger because of the ‘deep state’ and the ‘fascist left,’ which includes ‘transsexual fascists.’”In a Facebook post, she linked to a news item about the Jan. 6 protest and wrote “LOVE MAGA people!!!!”Mayer noted that it is getting harder to dismiss Ginni Thomas’ actions as harmless, given that the “Supreme Court appears likely to secure victories for her allies in a number of highly polarizing cases — on abortion, affirmative action, and gun rights.”Sen. Richard Blumenthal asked Roberts to make Clarence Thomas recuse himself from the case on Trump and the insurrection, but Thomas refused.The Supreme Court has two decisions on abortion cases due any day.“The Fall of Roe,” an insightful new book by The New York Times reporters Elizabeth Dias and Lisa Lerer, laid out the events and the strategy — and the failure of the Democrats to recognize the threat — that led to the fall of Roe. There was a determined group of religious zealots with a long-term master plan to pack the court with religious zealots.“These conservative Catholic and evangelical Christian operators believed they were fighting the biggest moral battle of the modern age, and forced America to debate on their terms,” they wrote. “But despite their public appeals, they did not convince broad swaths of Americans of the righteousness of their cause. Instead, they remained a minority, and leveraged the structures of American democracy in their favor, building a framework strong enough to withstand not only the political system but also a society moving rapidly against them. They took power to remake the nation in their image. And they were far more organized than their opponents or the public ever knew.”Now it’s up to Democrats to turn the tables and see if they can use this issue in the November election to save the country and women’s rights.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

This event, held on Tuesday, Aug. 6, is a nationwide effort to foster community bonds and take a collective stand against crime. Suffolk’s commitment to this initiative is evident, with over 100 communities, homeowner associations, civic organizations, neighborhoods, churches, and business sponsors coming together to create an unforgettable evening filled with block parties, cookouts, and mini-festivals.The festivities will commence with a Send-Off ceremony at 5 p.m. in the City Council Chamber at Suffolk City Hall, where dignitaries such as Mayor Mike Duman, City Manager Al Moor, Police Chief James Buie, and Fire Chief Michael Barakey will kickstart the night’s activities. Following this, seven motorcade units will traverse the city, visiting various registered parties and joining in the celebration.Suffolk’s dedication to National Night Out is unmatched. For over a decade, it consistently ranked in the top ten nationwide in its population category and secured five first-in-the-nation awards. Last year, Suffolk proudly placed second in its category, underscoring its commitment to this significant event.Sponsored by the National Association of Town Watch (NATW and locally co-sponsored by the Suffolk Police Department, National Night Out engages millions of people across the United States, U.S. Territories, Canadian cities, and military bases worldwide. The goals of National Night Out are multifaceted: to heighten awareness of crime, drug, and violence prevention; garner support for local anti-crime initiatives; strengthen neighborhood unity and police-community partnerships; and send a clear message to criminals that communities are organized and determined to fight back.But beyond these objectives, National Night Out represents something even more profound. It symbolizes the power of community and the shared responsibility of ensuring a safe and caring environment. In a time when societal challenges can often feel overwhelming, National Night Out serves as a reminder that unity and collective action are potent tools against crime and violence.So, as Aug. 6 approaches, let’s prepare to lock our doors, turn on our porch lights, and join our friends and neighbors in celebration. National Night Out is not just an event; it’s a testament to Suffolk’s enduring spirit of solidarity and its unwavering dedication to building a better, safer community. Let’s come together to show that Suffolk stands united and committed to creating a city where everyone can thrive in safety and harmony.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_35,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°The United States of America needs more housing — lots of it. The lack of supply in cities and suburbs in particular is the main force driving up the cost of living for millions, and keeping young people on the outside looking in, their faces pressed against the double-pane glass.Though street homelessness like what we see on sidewalks and subways is often an outgrowth of complicated maladies including alcohol and drug addiction and mental illness, the wider phenomenon of homelessness in America is undoubtedly driven by high housing costs.For all those reasons and more, we are pleased as punch to see the Democratic Party trying to become the city of “Yes In My Backyard,” the movement that’s emerged across the nation to try to bulldoze restrictive regulations and let more types of housing get built in many more places.For generations, America’s suburbs have been single-family zones, where granny flats and garage apartments and even low-rise complexes near train stations are often verboten. And for just as long, too many of our cities have been places where steep building costs, onerous zoning and piles of red tape conspire to make it all but impossible for housing supply to begin to meet demand. New York has been the laggard of laggards.Fortunately, New York City under Mayor Eric Adams, like New York State under Gov. Kathy Hochul, is in the thick of an awakening on this front. Adams’ City of Yes for Economic Opportunity relaxed tons of ridiculous and out-of-date rules dictating what kinds of businesses could go where, and his City of Yes for Housing Opportunity will come before the City Council in the fall.Those crucial reforms would gently add more density all across New York, especially in the vicinity of transit. One can credibly argue that it’s not ambitious enough, but given the punishing cost of housing here, it’s impossible with a straight face to make the case that these modest reforms would destroy the city or the character of its neighborhoods. When New Yorkers see some of the same local leaders who never miss an opportunity to lament the city’s exorbitant cost of living line up against City of Yes, they should roll their eyes and close their ears.At the federal level, Democratic presidential standard-bearer Kamala Harris chose her first major policy address to lay out a housing production and affordability agenda that includes, among other things, a pledge to build 3 million new homes; hefty down-payment subsidies and tax credits for first-time homebuyers; tax incentives for builders erecting affordable homes for those buyers; and the much more aggressive use of federal land to construct affordable housing. What she’s laid out isn’t everything America needs on this front, but it’s a damn good start.Harris can speak for herself, but it was also pretty great to see the last two-term Democratic president, Barack Obama, offer hearty support to these ideas in his DNC speech last week. “if we want to make it easier for more young people to buy a home,” said Obama, “we need to build more units and clear away some of the outdated laws and regulations that made it harder to build homes for working people in this country.”Amen.

What’s even more striking is that80% of these businessesare solely owned and operated by one person. Small business in America is a cornerstone of our society and imperative to the health of local communities. And thanks to more tools and resources than ever, the opportunity to open your own business is a reality for more people than ever — including for me.For the longest time, having enough capital to gain and retain customers has been a barrier to entry in creating new businesses and creating new jobs. The biggest companies were the only ones that could afford massive advertising buys in legacy media channels.Today, the playing field has been equalized through technology and the creation of digital ad networks. At Uncle Charlie, we advise clients on how to maximize their marketing budgets. For example, I’ve worked with a client recently out of Miami, Florida. This client had a limited budget and was initially zeroed in on their local market, but thanks to our services, we could stretch that budget to the limit and work them into a variety of different markets, including here in Minnesota.Companies like mine, with a limited advertising budget, in many cases can be much more effective than the bloated big business with a $1 million budget. You don’t need a massive budget, sometimes all you need is agiant cat filterand some humor.Small businesses like mine use digital platforms as advertising agencies to save thousands of dollars when targeting new and returning customers, but the ongoing “techlash” that’s gripped Washington, D.C., risks hurting small businesses across America. For example, the Federal Trade Commission has proposed rules that could undermine how small businesses use advertising on these platforms, all under the guise of addressing harms from what they call “commercial surveillance” and lax data protection practices.While the FTC is concerned about limiting the power and control of the advertising giants, many small businesses are growing concerned about their future ability to keep the lights on should laws change.Limiting the effectiveness of digital data is bad for consumers and bad for small businesses. It leads to wasted ad budgets, unnecessary content experiences for consumers and fewer jobs for said small businesses. In reality, restrictions on digital data use puts more power into the hands of the large corporations who can afford to be less-targeted with their advertising.We need unfettered access to the internet to reach customers, share content and serve up ads that will help us compete against our largercompetitors who spend millions on advertisingacross a multitude of platforms. In a globalized economy that’s as hyper-competitive as ours, we can’t just expect business to come in the door; we need to advertise to succeed and, ultimately, thrive.Not only does digital advertising stimulate the economy at all levels, it also puts the success of small businesses in the hands of those who should control the success — the owners and their employees, not a lawmaker.As part of a coalition known asInternet for Growth, we’re advocating for the digital economy and urging lawmakers to look to the small businesses that support them and listen. I hope that our lawmakers that represent us in Washington take notice.

The coral reef, the largest in the continental US, is considered a barrier reef and is around 350 miles (563.27 km wide from the Dry Tortugas National Park to the St. Lucie Inlet in Martin County, Florida. (Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images/TNS The ocean is a beautiful backdrop for many of our memories. But are we destroying our summertime sanctuary with our food choices? Coral reefs are home to more than 25% of marine life. They also play a critical role in protecting coastlines, absorbing 97% of wave, storm and flood energy. Going vegan is the most powerful thing anyone can do to save these aquatic treasures, so for Coral Reef Awareness Week (July 15–21 , let’s ditch meat, eggs and dairy.If the ocean were a pot of salt water on a stove, then animal agriculture would be the heat bringing it to a boil. Animals raised for food generate substantial emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide and methane, through digestion and in manure. Methane—more than 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide—contributes significantly to the climate catastrophe. And animal agriculture is the single largest source of methane emissions in the U.S., according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Global temperatures have shattered records for the past 12 consecutive months. And as the world smolders, the ocean bears the brunt of the heat — around 90% of the heat generated by increased greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.N. The changing climate is a leading cause of coral bleaching, which occurs when coral is stressed and expels the algae that inhabit it. If the high temperatures persist, the coral won’t allow the algae to return and will eventually die. Changes in ocean temperature can also affect marine life, including the distribution of species and the timing of biological events such as reproduction.But greenhouse gases aren’t the only way the cruel animal agriculture industry destroys coral reefs. Waste from animals raised for food pollutes waterways, eventually reaching the reefs and causing severe damage. And cultivating crops to feed billions of animals involves chemicals like those found in pesticides and fertilizers, which also cause pollution.Another reason to go vegan? Fishing is a major contributor to plastic pollution, which is another grave threat to coral reefs. A study in Nature found that up to 75% of plastic pollution on coral reefs comes from abandoned fishing equipment. Destructive fishing methods, like blast fishing, can obliterate 64 square feet of reef in a single explosion. And commercial practices such as bottom-trawling and long-lining strip the ocean floor of life, devastating coral reefs.Fish experience pain, form friendships and enjoy playing games. Some fish even have longer attention spans than humans. They are complex animals who use squeaks and squeals to “talk” to each other and various forms of body language to give directions or signal potential dangers. They don’t want to die for anyone’s fish fry. Likewise, animals raised for food on land want to live. We can help all animals simply by leaving them off our plates.There are many vegan fish products on the market today. The vegan fish market is projected to surge from $183 million to $2.19 billion by 2033, so even more options will likely be hitting grocery store shelves. Vegan fish can help reduce the demand for aquatic animals as food, allowing populations to recover and supporting reef health.Vegan living is an easy, powerful and compassionate way to help heal the planet’s human-inflicted wounds and build a future where coral reefs can thrive.The city of New Orleans must pay $1 million to a teenager who was groomed and raped in 2020 by a former police officer who presented himself as a mentor to the girl, a federal jury decided Wednesday.A pair of county bills aim to increase regulations on the construction of cell towers on the island."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_102,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The recent Homeless Point-in-Time Count (PITC results for Hawaii County, as reported on by the Tribune-Herald on June 6, indicates a significant reduction of 285 individuals or 28% in our unhoused population and should be celebrated. Yet this positive step may seem contrary to what many experience daily in downtown Hilo.The recent Homeless Point-in-Time Count (PITC results for Hawaii County, as reported on by the Tribune-Herald on June 6, indicates a significant reduction of 285 individuals or 28% in our unhoused population and should be celebrated. Yet this positive step may seem contrary to what many experience daily in downtown Hilo.Moving forward, it’s important to examine these seeming contradictions and the complexity of homelessness to continue securing long-term housing and reducing the unhoused population on our island.First, some people experience many more challenges securing shelter than others. Those who have experienced homelessness for many years, very large families, or those with other major contributing factors like addiction or mental/physical health issues struggle to stay housed. Except for the very large families, these are the people we are most likely to see sleeping in the doorways in downtown Hilo and Kona.Although they make up a small percentage overall, just 4% based on service utilization over the past year, new arrivals to the island who become unhoused and may not have social and familial connections tend to be highly visible in our urban spaces.Families and individuals who have recently lost their housing, have some source of income, and those who stay in their cars or with family and friends intermittently, tend to be less visible. These folks are often easier to connect to housing if they can be located when it becomes available.For instance, the data shows a 52% reduction of unhoused families with children between 2018 and 2024. For those who are born and raised on Hawaii Island and experiencing homelessness, there may also be a strong sense of shame that keeps them out of public view.In 2022, the Hawaii County Council created the Homelessness and Housing Fund via Ordinance 26-22 which appropriates $9 million to $10 million annually through 2027 for homeless support services and housing. To continue the positive trend of reducing the number of unhoused people on our island and especially in the urban core areas, we must continue providing support services in coordination with our efforts to expand housing. Mental health care, substance abuse treatment, job training, and access to healthcare are indispensable components of a holistic approach to ending homelessness.Finally, addressing homelessness requires a coordinated, many-pronged approach. Expanding our housing stock to include adequate and obtainable housing remains the most important strategy for consistently keeping our residents housed. Providing short-term shelter to get people off the streets and connect them with our service providers is also key. This can include programs like the overnight cot shelter at the Salvation Army, a Kau Hale, and a safe camping area in Hilo.In conclusion, while the reduction in our unhoused population as indicated by the 2024 PITC results are a step in the right direction, we are far from done. We must remain vigilant and committed to enacting meaningful, long-term changes that address the multifaceted nature of homelessness in our community.Jenn Kagiwada is the Hawaii County Council member for Disctrict 2 (Hilo .WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
leoweekly_2024_0,"“If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, never make a pretty woman your wife/ So for my personal point of view/ Get an ugly girl to marry you” — Jimmy SoulThere is an epidemic of man-children who believe that the purpose of the woman is solely that of childbearing, and subjugation to their desires. Those same man-children believe that if a woman is beautiful and successful, then she must be sucking men off to climb the ladder of success. All of this hatred directed towards the woman is almost always grounded in the fact that these men simply don’t measure up to the woman.As Kamala Harris has become the Democratic nominee for President, the rhetoric about how she got to her position is amped up and skewing sexist as fuck.Kamala Harris graduated from Howard University with a degree in political science and economics. The other person also graduated from university with a degree in economics. However, when it was suggested that he release his grades, people were threatened with legal action. What we do know for a fact, is that during “his” time in college, he obtained four deferments from Vietnam military service due to “bone spurs.”While young Americans were dying on the battlefields of Vietnam, and coming home, in various ways, maimed and mentally struggling, he called himself a “brave soldier for escaping the deadly scourge of the sexually transmitted infection.It s amazing, I can t even believe it. I ve been so lucky in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there. It s like Vietnam, sort of. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier, Trump said when speaking with shock radio DJ Howard Stern during an interview in 1997.Kamala Harris went on to secure a Juris Doctorate and become a lawyer. She worked as a deputy district attorney, ran for and won her race for district attorney of San Francisco, then ran for and won her races for Attorney General of California, and her 2017 U.S. Senate race replacing Barbara Boxer.Trump was gifted a position by his father.Now facing Harris as the Republican nominee, Trump is struggling to stick to the facts, the party platform, or any thread of logic, including how to form a line of attack against Harris that doesn’t reduce her to being an attractive woman that he can’t have.On Aug. 27, Trump retweeted a Truth Social post by another user that showed an image of Harris with Hillary Clinton. The post also read,Funny how blowjobs impacted both their careers differently...This is the top of the ticket for a party that somehow still includes women. In fact, towing the party line, some of his female followers have picked up the disgusting rhetoric and are repeating it, accusing Harris of “sleeping” her way to the top. Despite earning her degrees, winning multiple elections, and being fully competent at her job.It’s a disgusting line of attack. Here’s why.If a woman who has the credentials of Harris can “sleep” her way to the top, she sure put in a lot of effort for nothing when clearly, according to Republicans, she only needed to use her lips or her body.Fucking god bless her if it were the case. Her Bad Bitch cred would go up exponentially.It’s absolutely bonkers to think that Harris needed to sleep her way anywhere to become nominee of the Democratic Party. It’s also very low class for the nominee of the other party to spout these types of lies, when women in his own life, and his own party (Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Bridget Ziegler, and Lauren Bobert have been caught up in verified scandals including one of them caught on videofondling her date at a family theater show.This is not to slut shame any of these women because their bodies, like Harris’, belong to them. It s simply to illustrate the hypocrisy.Why is it that men like Trump can fail upwards, and no one accuses them of sleeping their way to the top?I mean, we could accuse our own Senator Mitch McConnell, whose fortune increased due to that inheritance of his second wife, Elaine Chao.Maybe he also needed a little help to age into the specter he is, currently haunting the U.S. Senate past his “Use By” date.Or maybe we point fingers at Newt Gingrich who dipped on his dying wife, Jacqueline May Battley, and went off to marry the woman he was sleeping with? Though he denies saying it, Gingrich was quoted as saying, “She s not young enough or pretty enough to be the wife of the President. And besides, she has cancer.Gingrich went on to marry a woman six months later who helped him get out of debt but that relationship was “difficult,” so Gingrich did as he knew best, had an affair with a House of Representatives staffer 20 years his junior.I mean, look at these slutty man-bitches. We could certainly include Trump in the slutty man party because his life is filled with baby mamas and broken homes.The point I’m trying to make is this.Before men start tossing sexist insults at qualified, educated female politicians, CEOs, workers, etc. it might be a good idea to first change the name from the woman they want to accuse to their own.It might get a little clearer that as adults we have the right to do with our bodies as we wish, and that if we’re good enough to get benefits from that body, maybe we should celebrate.I don’t think Harris had a need to use her body for success. She had the benefit of a brain.But to be clear, we see how Trump uses the women in his life to improve all of his “short”-comings. It’s too bad he can no longer reap the benefits from the women his money provides.He is a miserable old man.His unhappiness is woven into every fabric of his campaign, and his being. He’s an aging former billionaire whose heyday is almost 50 years in the rearview.

eugeneweekly_2024_15,"We ve got issues. What happens when we fall silent on issues that compromise the wellbeing of our community? The first question would be: Can you describe your communities? What makes them your community? Take a good look, then ask another question: What do you consider diversity? Picture what you see when you see or hear your version of diversity. Is your definition of diversity reflected in your communities? Many of us have several communities: salsa community, yoga community, parent community, book groups, a university community. We engage in those communities on different levels depending on our investment in it. However, how many of us examine why we call that communityourcommunity? Generally speaking people come together for a common cause, reason and practice that mirrors goals that we feel somehow help us reach or flourish in some part of our value system. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Typically, I find we can get fast and loose with the word “community” and what it actually means. There’s generally context to the meaning or depth of your connection. Would you feel any way about your community if all of a sudden your community — let’s say your dance community — decided to add an unexpected element, like a new type of style of dance. Let’s think further that if all of a sudden the music choice for your favorite restaurant changed from the easy going soothing jazz you love to a gothic, loud mesh of eclectic sounds that plays on a constant loop. You may decide that this change is so outside of your norm that you can’t enjoy your space anymore and wonder who even decided to change something as integral as the ambiance? Some people may see this change as no big deal and a nice variation — they didn’t pay that much attention anyway. So they don’t say anything, it means nothing to them. The food tastes the same either way. Must be nice for them to be so oblivious. Now what if the music change seems to be getting more and more popular, and you barely hear any of the music you enjoyed while eating there before? Would you ask the spot, that you considered your community, to stick to what was originally agreed upon? Would you wonder how the change was made without a vote, or a survey done? How long would you continue to patronize that spot, or continue to join that community on a regular basis? See, as a Black woman, when someone says “community” to me, I generally have a distinct role in it. When it comes to race, Black and Brown bodied people are added as a bonus feature to the community. As a bonus, our needs are considered and are not normalized. This was supposed to be a kind gesture, historically. As we see with DEI being cut out and talked about in ways that are not only untrue, but gaslighting and dog whistling all at the same time, you can easily realize that your community considered DEI as a change, not an integration. The result was a variation in the “regular” ways things were done. The inclusion was not a part of the community or society at large, which in turn leaves question to how your values are protected within said communities. Once DEI, and everything describing the value of inclusion, has been attacked, turned upside down, truths mislabeled as lies being hidden by the “woke few.” You didn’t see your community crumbling; you acted as if you were watching something happening to other people’s community. If your community represents your values, does it value everyone in the community? Everywhere we go, it is our collective responsibility to uphold inclusion, safety and opportunity for not only ourselves but for each other. Communities are places of your truth. Stop the normalization of lies, mistruths and omissions. Stop them dead in their tracks. If we don’t, soon the community we know and love will cease to exist and we will be stuck within the walls of what they decide weshouldaccept.

minnpost_2024_70,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.I was encouraged to learn that several community leaders met last year to discuss how we can accelerate small business growth and continue to rebuild our communities in 2024. We know that catalyzing education for children and adults, especially in low-income communities, is essential if we hope to reshape the reality of what can be accomplished within the Twin Cities.However, there is a pattern that sees the policies that our communities must advance lost in a heap of priorities in our fast-moving news cycle – especially during a presidential election. Thankfully, Minnesota’s non-profit community has grown vastly in our interconnectedness throughout the years.Through a coalition of community leaders and non-profit support in the Twin Cities working with elected officials, we have an opportunity to keep our concerns at the forefront of next year’s larger election conversation if we have proactive conversations on the direction of our state’s political discourse and priorities.For example, we have spoken about how our nonprofit organizations can further educate low-income communities on the many affordable digital tools online that can be used to get ahead. Folks must understand that there are pathways to obtaining affordable credit and debt counseling, a low-cost education, or a certification from the comfort of their computer — or mobile phone if needed. We must double down on our work to educate our neighbors about the many avenues for advancement available online, empowering Minnesotans with the tools to secure quality employment opportunities and grow our local economy.We also highlighted the importance of not getting distracted from the issues that matter most in our state. As the 2024 election cycle picks up, there will undoubtedly be a myriad of issues that percolate to the top of the conversation that risk derailing the policy priorities that our collective hopes to accomplish. As some issues — tech among them — become politicized, we would much prefer to see legislators ground their approach to fighting for the people by taking on more salient priorities — whether that be advancing racial equity in America’s workforce or finally addressing predatory home lending policies and the lineages of redlining that have broken up our communities.This is shaping up to be a big year for Minnesota’s coalition of like-minded non-profit organizations. Suppose we start our work today by having critical conversations regarding the changes that our communities require. In that case, we can keep our policies in the hearts and minds of decision-makers across our state, shining as an example to non-profit collectives across the nation.Robbie Droddy is a Twin Cities nonprofit advocate."
leoweekly_2024_13,"For college seniors on the cusp of graduation, the last semester is filled with excitement. After four years of academic rigor, students are finally ready to don their caps and gowns, receive their degrees, and walk across the commencement stage directly into post graduate life. This was what Italian student Giulia Cecchettin was looking forward to in November of 2023. The 22-year-old University of Padua student was five days away from receiving her degree in biomedical engineering.On November 11, Giulia met with her ex-boyfriend Filippo Turetta, to purchase the outfit she planned to wear when she received her degree. The two had previously dated, however as Giulia’s sister would later state, Filippo was both extremely jealous and possessive in the relationship. Giulia wanted to cut all ties to Turetta, but felt afraid to do so as he regularly threatened suicide.After stopping for a sandwich at a shopping center, Turetta drove Giulia home where CCTV footage shows him beating her in the car. Giulia attempted to escape, but prosecutors state that he duct taped her mouth shut and forced her to get back into the car. He’d then drive Giulia to an industrial area and continue his attack. After a week long search, Giulia’s body was found at the bottom of a ditch, wrapped in black plastic bags, and riddled with at least 20 knife wounds to the neck and head.The U.S. Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women, defines dating violence as “violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim.” As with most sex and relational crimes, dating violence is about one person obtaining and maintaining power over another in the relationship. “All forms of interpersonal violence come down to power and control,” says Danielle White, the advisor of Brave BU at Bellarmine University. “Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking; all of these things at the end of the day, come back to issues of power and control,” she continues.The very name of “dating violence” conjures thoughts of abuse physical force. But dating violence often takes other forms including sexual assault through forcing a partner into a nonconsensual sexual act, economic abuse through controlling a partner’s ability to acquire, use, and maintain resources, and general stalking behaviors. These forms of dating violence routinely accompany psychological aggression.“If it was just the physical abuse, nobody would stay,” says victims advocate Elaine Hoffmann. “It’s the manipulation, the gaslighting, and the making you feel less than, that allows the abuser to maintain control,” she states. White agrees adding, “sometimes people will mis characterize acts of power and control as acts of romance and passion. For instance, not allowing a partner to see their friends gets turned into ‘my partner loves me so much, they want me to spend all of their time with them.’”From eliciting guilt, lying, and feigning innocence, to playing mind games and resorting to emotional blackmail, abusers will rely on a wide variety of manipulative tactics to persuade their victims into staying in the toxic union.As with most interpersonal crimes, dating violence is about control. And when the abuser fears they are losing said control, they’ll sometimes resort to grand displays to regain it. These deceptive tactics may be as simple as showing basic emotion. “He would never hold my hand, kiss me, or hug me,” Hoffman says of her ex. “But if he suspected I was about to leave, then he would turn up the affection and emotional intimacy he knew I was looking for.” Gifts like flowers, jewelry, or in Hoffman’s case, a holiday cruise, can also be used as tools for the abuser to regain control as it slips away.Sometimes these grand displays are far more extreme. The threats of self-harm like the ones that Turestta made, serve as an example. The National Domestic Violence Hotline states that a partner regularly threatening suicide, especially when their victim is attempting to leave the relationship, is a form of emotional abuse. Victims may feel guilty and thus choose to stay in the relationship despite seeing the clear signs that leaving is necessary.When perpetrators feel they have totally lost control, homicide can become thefinal act of the desperate. This was the fate for Giulia as well as for 34% of the 4,970 female victims of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter in 2021, as reported by the United States Department of Justice. This statistic reflects data reported by law enforcement agencies. It is important to know that this data does not reflect incidents that were not reported.In a 2017 study, British criminology expert Dr. Jane Monckton Smith found an eight-stage pattern that leads to the murder of dating partners. Smith’s research states that once the perpetrator feels that he has exhausted all forms of escalation to retain control, a change of thinking can happen leading the perpetrator to move on, either through revenge or homicide. This leads to the planning stage where the perpetrator may obtain weapons and find opportunities to isolate their victim. It ends with the final stage of homicide, where the victim kills their partner and, in some cases, hurts others such as the victim’s children.The advice given the victims of dating violence situations, has long been echoed through various resource outlets. “When I am asked to give advice to someone who is experiencing the abuse, so often that advice centers around learning the signs and being able to identify characteristics of an unhealthy relationship,” White says.While this advice is crucial and sound, it is far past due to have conversations with the perpetrators of dating violence, offering advice that has the power to be preventative. “You know if something you’re doing isn’t right or not healthy,” White says. “So, it’s taking the time to take a breath before you respond to something, recognizing your harmful actions, and then seeking services and support.”Of course, there still exist stigmas that prevent many from asking for help when it is sorely needed. As White points out though, realizing and seeking to correct toxic and dangerous behavior is the antithesis of“weak.”“There’s strength in asking for help andseeking support. And there is so much strength in changing the behavior and breaking the cycle.”*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_155,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°A thousand ‘Janets’but very little helpA thousand ‘Janets’but very little helpAs a disclaimer, I’d like to state that I’m not up to date on every program or legislation passed to address my concerns. My perspective is based solely upon my observation through my job and personal experiences.I was prompted to write this after seeing the headline from April 30 newspaper about addressing the feral chicken problem.I understand that it’s a health concern, but I was frustrated because there are so many other, in my opinion, more important issues being under-addressed in the community. Specifically, I’d like bring up the severe lack of resources for our elderly population, people with behavioral health issues, and those with disabilities.I could tell story after story of people falling through the cracks due to lack of housing, financial assistance, transportation options, etc. One story comes to mind that serves as an example of many others.Janet (not her real name was living on Oahu when her husband left her. He gave her some money so at least she wouldn’t be destitute and homeless. The money only allowed her to buy a small piece of property in a very rural area on the Big Island with a very small home with only a few solar panels and a catchment system that wasn’t fully installed.Janet has a son from a previous relationship who has significant behavioral health issues. Janet herself has several health issues, including diabetes, that require medication for her to live, but these same health issues make it extremely difficult to get out of bed and impossible to walk to the nearest bus stop. She has almost no cell service — just enough to text but not make calls.She has no car, and she can’t leave her son alone due to his behavioral issues. She refuses to be taken to the ER when she has a health crisis, because the last time she did, her son got into fights up and down their road due to being unsupervised.We live in a great, caring community here on Big Island, and there are many people willing to assist short-term, and I’m thankful for those people. But you can’t expect those people to carry other’s burdens long-term, and it’s even worse for those people who aren’t connected in any way with the generous, giving community members.It’s people in these rural areas who don’t have access to simple resources like someone to take them to the post office to rent them a P.O. Box so they simply receive the mail they desperately need in order to sign up for other basic resources.Office of Aging para-transit only goes so far off the established routes, so that ruled out that resource for Janet. So, she’s stuck at home, running out of food, medicine and propane to keep her house warm. She hopes a neighbor will stop by to assist, but perhaps they are getting tired of her asking for help all the time.There are a thousand “Janets” out there with these problems and others problems not mentioned. There are too few home-care agencies to assist the population in these areas, and they can’t find good employees because the reimbursement from the state is so low, they can only afford to pay these employees slightly above minimum wage. They can’t pay their employees mileage, even though the clients desperately need grocery shopping and other errands.I could go on and on, but I hope the picture is clear enough. Let the feral chicken management keep their $100,000. This problem needs millions and millions to even start addressing it.Caleb MohrmannHiloObesity isn’t newproblem in U.S.The first line of Leighton Loo’s letter to the editor in the April 30 paper kind of took my breath away.It’s bizarre to compare obesity in this country — a serious problem since 1976, according to the National Institutes of Health — to a worldwide pandemic that rapidly killed millions of people.Dr. Anthony Fauci addressed an emergency situation as best he could.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_74,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Aquarter century has passed since Robert Putnam released “Bowling Alone,” his heralded work on America’s decaying social fabric. The book was sobering at the time. Things are worse now: Not only are we still bowling alone, but now we’re playing an altogether different game.Putnam was fascinated by whether Americans were abandoning those very institutions — family, schools, places of worship, community organizations, even the voting booth — that, historically, have bound us together. Were we pulling back from those civic centers that gave our collective lives meaning, he asked? Were we forsaking those root organizations that provided us with a forum for understanding others and a venue for calibrating our moral compasses? Yes, he concluded. What he found was that there has been a marked deterioration of America’s connective tissue, a significant decline in social engagement. Americans were once “joiners”; they are decidedly less so now.Putnam put Alexis de Tocqueville’s wonder to the test. When traveling around the United States in the 1830s, the Frenchman was amazed at the country’s capacity to foster, encourage and sustain “associations.” “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition,” Tocqueville observed, “are forever forming associations. There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types — religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute.” “Nothing,” he wrote, “more deserves attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America.” Putnam agreed: Nothing deserves more attention. The problem Putnam uncovered is that Americans are turning away from these associations; they are ditching their membership in civic life.Take the church. Only 2% of Americans admitted to no religious affiliation in 1967. That number rose to 11% in 1990. Today, almost one in three Americans claim no religious connection. Places of worship once grounded Americans in a collective morality. That’s where people learned right from wrong. No longer.The same trends have plagued the workplace. Union membership is way down from its peak in the 1950s. So is involvement in professional associations like the American Medical Association and the American Bar Association. Disaffection is in the water, it seems. Americans no longer believe “associations” merit their time.The political picture is a bit more nuanced, and this is where we are now playing a different game. For Putnam, voter participation is an important indicator of civic commitment. Indeed, the Harvard scholar noted the steady decline in voter turnout prior to 2000 and insisted that electoral apathy is part of the story. True enough. But participation in presidential elections has actually increased in the 21st century. From a high of 63% voter turnout in 1960 to a low of 49% in 1996, we’re hovering around the mid-50s these days.Electoral participation is an important measure of civic engagement. But it is not completely telling. It’s apparent that a number of factors contribute to the ebb and flow of American voter enthusiasm. One of those factors is anger. Polarized electors are galvanized by hatred. A certain percentage of American voters are motivated by a desire to bury their partisan opponents; they are energized not so much by the appeal of their particular candidate, but by a deep dislike of the other. Donald Trump’s base believes Joe Biden and the Democrats stole the 2020 election; Biden’s base believes Trump and the Republicans want a return to Jim Crow. Neither is correct, and perpetuating the lies just exacerbates division. Pew Research Center data suggests a high percentage of voters are simply fed up with the candidates themselves, and with the political system as a whole. Robust turnout rates can thus be a consequence of loathing.And therein lies the problem. The data seems to confirm that Americans are more politically engaged — of a certain type at least — and they feel more informed about the civic goings-on around them. And yet that deeper participation looks and feels a good bit different than the engagement Putnam had in mind. Anger at your partisan enemy might get you to the ballot box, but it will not get you to the bowling alley or to the corner diner to talk with that opponent. Distrust of the political other is not an adhesive; it’s a repellent, one that runs counter to the virtue of bowling leagues.Putnam chose bowling leagues as his metaphor because he admired what those collectives used to do. At their height, they brought together different peoples, from different backgrounds and cultures, to share in a common purpose. You learned something about your bowling buddy, who happened to be Black, by flocking to the alley once a week. You learned something about your Jewish 10-pin partner by sharing the frustration over gutter balls and 7-10 splits. You learned something about your South Asian teammate, or your nonbinary team captain, by splitting a mediocre sheet pizza. Indeed, there was commonality in beer frames and ugly shoes.Politics was once that way. I grew up in the Tip O’Neill era where “working across the aisle” was the political equivalent of bowling with someone who shared none of your background and even less of your life story. I grew up in a conservative household where my liberal views were respected even if not embraced. My father, from Selma, Ala., didn’t hate me because I thought Ronald Reagan was misguided, and I didn’t hate him because he thought Reagan was the second-coming of George Washington. We bowled together. Not literally, but we showed up and we talked, and we understood. We were never political teammates, but we were always committed to our league. And that made all the difference.Breslin is the Joseph C. Palamountain Jr. Chair of Political Science at Skidmore College and author of “A Constitution for the Living: Imagining How Five Generations of Americans Would Rewrite the Nation’s Fundamental Law.”DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."

The court’s decision was just the beginning of a series of rulings showcasing its alarming readiness to influence almost every facet of American life.In a recent move, the court annulled the Chevron doctrine, a 40-year-old precedent that granted federal agencies extensive regulatory power. This ruling, coupled with the undermining of Roe, reveals a court determined to reshape the nation in its image, regardless of the cost to established law or the balance of power in our government. The situation is not just concerning; it’s urgent, and immediate action is needed now.The high court, tilted sharply to the right in its present configuration, seems determined to impose a rigid and distinct ideology on the nation. It’s not just about abortion rights, though the loss of a half-century-old precedent is seismic enough.It’s about the court’s growing tendency to disregard precedent, ignore legal consensus and side with the powerful at the expense of the vulnerable. This disregard for precedent is not just a legal issue; it’s a threat to our established law’s fabric. For instance, the court’s decisions have disproportionately affected women, minorities and low-income individuals These decisions further widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.The justices’ expansive view of their authority threatens the delicate checks and balances that safeguard our democracy. This trend, if left unchecked, could have far-reaching consequences for the health of our constitutional system. When the court intrudes into areas rightfully belonging to the legislative or executive branches, it undermines the people’s ability to effect change through the democratic process.Only select judges should have the final say on matters of policy, which are best left to the people’s elected representatives. By overstepping their constitutional role, the justices disrupted the careful balance of power envisioned by the Framers and diminished the citizenry’s voice and power. In a representative democracy, the people must have a meaningful avenue to share in the country’s direction.When the court legislates from the bench, it circumvents this process and consolidates excessive power in the judicial branch. This erosion of checks and balances is a dangerous trajectory that could ultimately imperil the stability and resilience of our democratic institutions.The Supreme Court’s recent decisions demonstrate a court in thrall to ideology rather than a moral commitment to the law. They expose the dangers of lifetime appointments and the court’s lack of accountability. They underscore the urgent need for reform, whether through term limits, expansion of the court or some other mechanism to restore its balance and legitimacy.The need for reform is not just required; it’s pressing, and our advocacy can make a difference. Moreover, the court’s overreach threatens to alienate Americans from their democracy. When citizens see their elected representatives stripped of power and their votes rendered meaningless by unelected judges, they lose faith in the system. They grow apathetic, disengage from the political process and cede the field to extremist minorities.The court’s expanding reach presents a grave danger: not just the loss of this right or that, but the potential hollowing out of our democracy. The court needs to understand that its vast power is not without limits. If it does not voluntarily pull back from the brink, then the other branches of government and the people themselves must step in to restore the balance.The potential dismantling of democracy is an existential concern that we must all address. The fight to save democracy is not just about the next or future election. It’s a generational struggle to ensure that our system of government remains accountable to the people above the shouts of a reactionary elite. The threat to our democracy is accurate, and we all have a responsibility to protect it.The Supreme Court’s recent power grab poses a threat not just to specific laws or rights but to the foundational principles of our democracy itself. Regardless of our political leanings, every American who cares about the future of our republic must recognize the danger this shift represents. In their rush to impose a narrow and divisive vision upon the nation, the court’s ideologues have upset the delicate balance of power our system depends on.They have chosen to ignore decades of legal precedent, dismissing the people’s will and our elected representatives’ role in shaping the country’s laws. This court’s practices are not just an attack on certain cherished rights, though those are also undoubtedly under threat. It is a threat to the very essence of our self-governance, to the idea that, in a democracy, it is the people who ultimately determine the nation’s direction.We cannot afford to be complacent in the face of this threat. The court’s actions demand a swift and decisive response from all of us. We must organize, mobilize and make our voices heard in the streets and at the ballot box. We must demand that our elected officials take action to check the court’s power and defend the rights and principles that are under attack. This can be done through civic actions like contacting elected officials, participating in peaceful protests or voting in upcoming elections.This will not be an easy fight and will only be won over time. But if we cede the field to the court’s ideologues and allow them to reshape our country without resistance, we risk losing a few cherished freedoms and the heart of our democracy itself. Your engagement is crucial in this fight. Every voice matters, and every action counts. Together, we can and must defend the republic and ensure that it remains the people who have the power in the United States.Johnson is a United Methodist pastor, the author of ” Holding Up Your Corner: Talking About Race in Your Community ” and program director for the Bridge Alliance, which houses The Fulcrum."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_207,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Last fall I argued that Joe Biden was the Democratic Party’s strongest 2024 presidential nominee. I believed that for two reasons: He has been an effective president, and he is the Democrat most likely to appeal to working-class voters.I still believe Biden is the party’s strongest candidate, but I’m getting more pessimistic about his chances of winning.The first reason is not political rocket science: Voters prefer the Republicans on key issues like inflation and immigration. Most Donald Trump supporters I know aren’t swept up in his cult of personality; they vote for him because they are conservative types who like GOP policies and think Trump is a more effective executive than Biden.The second reason I’ve become more pessimistic is because of what’s happening to the youth vote. NBC News released an interesting poll last weekend finding that interest in this election is lower than in any other presidential election in nearly 20 years. Only 64% of Americans said they have a high degree of interest in the election, compared with, say, 77% who had high interest in 2020.But what really leaps out is the numbers for voters ages 18 to 34. Only 36% of those voters said they are highly interested.I imagine that’s partly because it’s difficult to get enthusiastic about candidates who are a half-century older than you. But part of it is also about Biden’s approach to the Israel-Hamas war. Young people are much more critical of Israel than other groups, and there are no candidates representing that point of view.I think what we’re seeing at Columbia University and on other elite campuses is a precursor to what we’re going to see at the Democratic convention in Chicago. In 1968 the clashes between the New Left activists and Mayor Richard Daley’s cops were an early marker of the differences between the more-educated and less-educated classes. They were part of the trend that sent working-class voters to the GOP.If there are similar clashes in Chicago this August, the chaos will reinforce Trump’s core law-and-order message. It will make Biden look weak and hapless. Phrases like “from the river to the sea” will be 2024’s version of “defund the police” — a slogan that appeals to activists but alienates lots of other voters.The folks in the administration project confidence that their man will prevail. I wish I could share that confidence.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Minnesota Gov.

suffolknewsherald_2024_72,"Published 6:06 pm Tuesday, February 27, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,The School Board Member Alliance of Virginia (SBMA is a dedicated organization for Virginia school board members, aiming to enhance their professional development in alignment with the constitutional and statutory requirements of Virginia.In recent decades, the functioning of local school boards has leaned more on habit and hearsay than on the actual legal mandates from the Codes and Statutes of Virginia. A critical question recently posed by an opinion piece in the SNH concerned the defined jurisdiction or lane of local school boards.Rooted in both the U.S. and Virginia Constitutions, local school boards are endowed with comprehensive governance powers over local school districts. They are the principal authority, charged with the duty to ensure the adherence, enforcement, and comprehension of school laws as also outlined in the statute (§ 22.1-79.1 , granting them the broad scope of authority over the local school division.According to (§ 22.1-79 , local school boards have explicitly defined Powers and Duties, encompassing thirteen distinct areas. Specifically, in22.1-79.2the law mandates boards must “Secure, by visitation or otherwise, as full information as possible about the conduct of the public schools in the division and take care that they are conducted according to law and with the utmost efficiency.” No permission is needed for any board member to follow this law. It is a non-negotiable legal duty immune to override by any policy or employee within the school division. This is but one area of law that guarantees the breadth of local board authority, reaffirmed by an abundance of Virginia case law.Additionally, the statutes of Virginia State, specifically§ 22.1-253.13.1-9, referred to as the Standards of Quality (SOQs , highlight the extensive range of duties and requirements imposed on local school boards, many of which must be met yearly. The combined authority of the state Board of Education and the local board is overwhelmingly emphasized. Directives toward just local boards are mentioned over 100 times in the SOQs, underscoring their extensive jurisdiction. Local boards are expected to fulfill these obligations. Unfortunately, a board’s effective governance is often hindered by a lack of awareness of these laws, preferring to follow traditional talking points instead of doing what the law requires.The School Board Member Alliance, an approved agency of the VDOE, dedicates itself to providing effective board training for Virginia school board members, emphasizing their authority and responsibility, and providing truth and knowledge for effective governance.Sherri StorySBMA Chair and Executive DirectorFormer Suffolk School Board MemberOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

philinquirer_2024_30,"The GOP vice presidential nominee came to prominence by claiming people live in poverty because they made bad decisions, rather than by dint of the capitalism game played against them.Early in the introduction of Sen. JD — no periods after the letters ishis preferred spelling — Vance at the Republican National Convention on Monday, the new vice presidential candidate was called “a living embodiment of the American dream.” As the Milwaukee crowd chanted his name, Vance was presented to delegates as someone who “has never forgotten the working people of our country, and he never will.”I’d like to interrupt the love fest with a little reality.Sometime around page 10 in Vance’s 2016Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of Family and Culture in Crisis, I lost interest. By the second chapter, I was ready to toss the book across the room.By the third chapter, I did.» READ MORE:America will never be the same after Milwaukee’s tent revival for the cult of Donald Trump | Will BunchI wanted to read this book. After all, I am a hillbilly — born in Kentucky, raised in the lap of Jesus in the Missouri Ozarks, andVance, a fellow hillbilly from Appalachia, had made good. From a raggedy childhood, he’d gone to far-off Yale University, made money, and now he could be the nation’s guide to those mythical hill people who huddle around their stills in the back 40.But the book was rife with half- and ill-formed conservative talking points that boiled down to a repetitious recitation of the old trope that Vance’s cousins and mine were failing because they weren’t pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.In other words:Get a job, hillbillies— which skirted entirely the reality of small-town and rural poverty.Vance knew better, but the spotlight is a powerful drug.His message was easily digested because it’s convenient to believe people live in poverty because they made bad decisions, rather than the idea that they’re there by dint of the capitalism game already being played against them.But those who’d never sat in a hard pew saw only a man who made it out of poverty. The book sold millions and was made into a movie I didn’t watch, and along the way, as Vance himself has said, the media began to see him as something of a Trump Whisperer. As a rare cross-cultural public figure, Vance could explain how so many conservatives living in double-wides could embrace a rich showman who owned a gold toilet.I don’t think Vance much wanted that role. I think he had his eye on something bigger, but he dutifully tried to explain his demographic origins as best he could. His fellows’ support of Trump seemed to baffle him. Early on, he said Trump was “reprehensible” and an “idiot.”» READ MORE:Trump was right, it’s time to fight | Helen UbiñasBut what we once called political flip-flops are an act performed by many of the stars in Trump’s constellation. His list of converts includes Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Lindsey Graham, the latter of whom went from suggesting voters tellTrump to go to hellto telling the candidate “I love you” after Saturday’s shooting.I am not here to speak for hillbillies. Far from it. There is no one story coming out of the hills, and no one storyteller fit to tell them. I would caution, though, that we love our rags-to-riches stories because those stories gloss over the realities of the people who never make it out of their rags — like those 36.5% of Ohio workers whoearn less than $15,000 a year, orOhio’s children who are more likely to live in poverty than are the state’s adults.Vance told his half-story story all the way to a U.S. Senate seat in 2022, but a quick trip through the bills he has backed leaves you with thin gruel. There’s the oh-so-important Stop Trying to Obsessively Vilify Energy Act (the STOVE Act, meant to SOGS — save our gas stoves , and an attempt to declare English our national language.On Thursday, Vance signed on as acosponsor to a billthat would amend Title 28, “to authorize removal of a civil action or criminal prosecution against a president, vice president, former president, or former vice president.”Sigh.I would suggest that the ladder has been pulled up by ol’ JD, and that’s not just me talking.If Vance’s star is shining, people back home remain unimpressed. While Vance was being lauded as the hero of the middle and lower classes, the Columbus Dispatch ran a story about the “not-so-pretty things” his constituents had to say about him. Most of the comments and letters aren’t laudatory — save for the guest editorials Vance wrote himself.He’s been called a “craven shape-shifter,” “disgraceful,” and “No. 1 saprophyte” (an organism that lives on dead things . In a May letter, one writer asked Trump to choose Vance as his running mate so Ohio could be less one “lying, bootlicking, butt kissing, weak-willed, integrity lacking, sickening obsequious sycophant.” Try saying that in one breath.So, in the vernacular of my youth: Hillbillies don’t need no elegy.

minnpost_2024_177,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As the founder of JIIVE (Justice Impacted Individuals Voting Effectively and leader in my community, I had time to reflect on the complexities of our criminal injustice system, a political apparatus that has tricked us into believing our vote does not count, as well as societal norms.The Minneapolis City Council passed an ordinance that sets a minimum price for cigarettes at a staggering $15. While the intention may seem noble — to deter smoking and improve public health — it’s crucial to question whether such measures truly address why “justice impacted individuals,” who are under constant social-economic stress, smoke.Let’s be clear: I am not trying to downplay the seriousness of tobacco-related deaths in the United States, which amount to more than480,000 per year.I am not advocating for the widespread use of tobacco, either. Having witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of addiction, I understand the need to combat it urgently. However, I am concerned about the approach policymakers have taken. Instead of relying solely on punitive measures, such as high taxes and outright bans, we should be exploring more effective alternatives.Income is a crucial factor in determining our quality of life. It’s ironic that a pack of cigarettes costs the same as what is considered to be the minimum wage required to lead a decent life. It’s distressing to think that an average person has to work for a full hour just to afford a smoke break.This could be one of the reasons why people continue to smoke despite knowing its harmful effects. As an hourly worker, my only respite from work is a quick smoke break. But if I cannot afford a pack of cigarettes, I must continue working on the floor without any break. This raises questions about whether we are creating more problems than we are solving.While it’s true that many people are unaware of the options available to help them quit smoking, the reality is that smoking is a coping mechanism for many who are struggling to deal with the challenges of being justice-impacted in America.It’s also important to consider the impact of punitive measures like minimum pricing on small businesses and marginalized individuals. For many in underserved communities, cigarettes serve as a coping mechanism amidst systemic inequalities and socio-economic challenges. Punitive measures only deepen the cycle of poverty and addiction, further marginalizing those who are already disenfranchised.Instead of wasting resources on prohibitionist policies, we should invest in healthcare providers who are at the forefront of tobacco cessation efforts. By providing them with the necessary tools and knowledge to effectively counsel patients on harm reduction strategies, we can make significant progress in reducing tobacco-related diseases.Unfortunately, this message is often overlooked due to concerns about youth initiation and misguided perceptions of e-cigarettes as equally harmful as combustible tobacco. Such perceptions can also make it harder for Justice Impacted workers to choose legal drugs because they are often more expensive.This is not the solution we want. Instead, we need to embrace harm reduction principles and reject blanket bans and punitive measures that only worsen the problem.It’s time to shift the paradigm from prohibition to harm reduction. Bans, prohibition and taxation do little to deter smoking — they merely drive it underground, exacerbating existing disparities. Education and access to lower-risk cessation products hold the key to meaningful change.Maurice “Moe” Ward is founder and executive director for JIIVE, which worked to restore the voting rights of formerly incarcerated individuals in Minnesota."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_58,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Are the Ten Commandments the basis of our moral system? If they are, then it is odd that they say nothing about slavery, rape, torture or other heinous crimes, writes Kenneth Seeskin. (Dreamstime/TNS The governor of Louisiana just signed a law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public schools.There are two problems with this. The first and most obvious is that the Constitution prohibits the government from making laws that mandate an establishment of religion. While the Ten Commandments may be central to the Judeo-Christian tradition, the government has no right to pass laws that discriminate against Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Taoists, Sikhs or atheists.But there is a second problem: Whose Ten Commandments are going to be displayed? The original text does not number the commandments and contains more than 10 imperative statements. Even within the Judeo-Christian tradition, there are disagreements on how to parse them and what they mean.The standard Jewish version holds that the first commandment is, “I am the LORD thy God,” while the second commandment is, “Thou shall have no other gods before Me.” For Christians, “I am the Lord thy God” is not a commandment but a preamble.Catholics and some Protestants differ on where to put the prohibition of graven images and how to interpret it.According to the Exodus version of the commandments, observance of the Sabbath day (or in some versions the Lord’s Day is justified because God rested on the seventh day from all the labors associated with creation. But according to the Deuteronomy version, the Sabbath day is supposed to commemorate the Exodus from Egypt. In any case, Jews celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday and Christians on Sunday.There is still confusion on whether the text means “Thou shall not kill” or “Thou shall not commit murder.” Though most editions of the Bible have “murder,” the King James edition has “kill.”Adultery in the ancient world involved a man sleeping with a married woman. Nothing in the original text of the Ten Commandments prohibits a married man from sleeping with an unmarried woman, concubine or enslaved person.While there is a commandment prohibiting false testimony in court, contrary to popular belief, it does not prohibit lying, at least not explicitly. Nor does it prohibit promise breaking.According to some versions, there are two commandments dealing with coveting: one involving your neighbor’s house and another involving your neighbor’s wife. Other traditions combine them into one commandment.Are the Ten Commandments the basis of our moral system? If they are, then it is odd that they say nothing about slavery, rape, torture or other heinous crimes. Jesus reduced the commandments to two primary ones: love of God and love of one’s neighbor. But neither of these is mentioned in the original 10.So which version does the governor of Louisiana want to put up in public schools and how will students be instructed about their meaning?Your guess is as good as mine. It was disputes like these that led the Framers of the Constitution to decide that when it comes to religious matters, it is best for the government to step aside and let people make up their own minds.In an age when many people complain about the intrusion of government into people’s private lives, wouldn’t it be better to put up the Bill of Rights, whose wording is beyond dispute, rather than the Ten Commandments?.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_179,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°In the weeks since President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, a new narrative about the election has taken shape.In one corner, there’s presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris — the former chief legal officer for California who says she’s here to “prosecute the case” against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. In the other is Trump, the self-proclaimed candidate of law and order who wants to “make America safe again.” Crime was already on voters’ minds. Now it sits squarely at the center of the debate — and both candidates will work strenuously to win voters’ trust on the issue of safety.As they do, they’d be wise to remember that Americans aren’t interested in overheated rhetoric or petty name-calling. What people want are real solutions to make our communities safer and more just.A debate on those terms — constructive and future-focused — would be a departure from the historical norm. Too often, our political discourse about crime and safety has become a war of constant escalation, in which candidates go to extreme lengths to claim the mantle of “tough on crime.” This dynamic hasn’t done anything to advance public safety. Instead, it’s given us the war on drugs and the highest incarceration rate in the world.Is that really a mistake we want to repeat?The polling data says no. Last year, Gallup showed that when you ask Americans whether the criminal justice system is “too tough” or “not tough enough,” most say it should be tougher. But then the pollsters went a level deeper and asked people what should actually be done. The top answer wasn’t to hire more police. It was to address the social and economic problems that drive crime in the first place — by a margin of 2 to 1.Absent leadership from the top, people have spent the last decade developing those solutions from the ground up. Their movement travels under the broad banner of “criminal justice reform.” But really, the work is better understood as a process of democracy unfolding in big cities and small towns across the country — red, blue and purple.Reformers are ordinary people working to center safety and justice in a way that’s specific to where they live. Together, they seek to understand what’s driving crime in their communities, from family instability to the absence of mental health services. They design policies to address those issues. They build political power and support networks. And they work with elected officials to get better laws on the books.The reform movement has notched remarkable wins, beginning with the fact that 3 in 4 Americans— Democrats and Republicans — now believe in its aims, according to a report from the bipartisan group FWD.us.Many of its solutions enjoy broad political appeal — among voters and legislators alike. States have passed laws to give police the resources they need while improving oversight and accountability. They’ve also pushed ahead on other fronts — strengthening the public defense system, ending mandatory minimum sentencing and juvenile life without parole, creating deflection and diversion programs, funding education and workforce development in prisons, expanding access to parole, sealing criminal records and making sure people who leave the prison system have the support they need to reenter society successfully.Now the prison population is shrinking in many places, and crime rates are plummeting.We have to protect those precious gains. And we can’t let the overheated rhetoric of a presidential election keep us from making more.The way to start is by throwing a spotlight on progress. The bright-red state of Oklahoma, for example, just passed a law to help survivors of domestic abuse who were imprisoned because they committed a criminal act while defending themselves. Their sentences will now be reduced, thanks to a politically diverse group of advocates, legislators, funders and community members who spent two years working to right an obvious wrong.Stories like this remind us that “tough on crime” policies aren’t the only option. Even in an era of profound political division — and a moment when the presidential election will pry us even further apart — we are still capable of crossing party lines to make change.It’s only when we lose sight of that fact that we end up with laws such as the Safer Kentucky Act, which promises to sweep even more people into the state’s bulging prison system, some for life, while doing nothing to prevent crime.People seeking elected office —Trump, Harris and everyone down-ballot — ought to take note. Voters might be willing to back a bad policy if it’s the only thing on the menu. But if you actually listen to what they’re asking for and give them a choice between senseless punishment and pragmatic solutions that deliver safety, accountability and justice, they’ll pick the better option. Sometimes, good policy really is good politics.If we can manage to remember that, I’m optimistic about what November will bring for public safety measures across the country — regardless of who wins the White House.No matter what, I urge everyone who cares about these issues, and especially the donors who sustain this movement, to stay committed. Politics is transient. Candidates come and go. But as we’ve proved together over the past decade, the criminal justice reform movement is durable.If we keep investing in smart policies that the majority of Americans want, this work can remain an evergreen, bipartisan focus that can win in every state.Trump and Harris may have the loudest megaphones. But it’s voters’ voices that matter most, and they’ve made their wishes clear.The Miami Dolphins have stamped their approval of coach Mike McDaniel for the long haul.SAVANNAH, Georgia/WASHINGTON— Kamala Harris vowed a tougher approach to migration along the U.S. southern border and said she would not withhold weapons to Israel, in her first interview with a major news organization since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.A 44-year old Kailua-Kona man has been charged for a Thursday afternoon bank robbery in Kailua-Kona.Inflation held steady in July on a yearly basis and consumer spending was robust, fresh data released Friday showed, the latest sign that progress toward cooler price increases remains firmly intact even as the economy holds up."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_196,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Judge Juan M. Merchan has, in his soft-spoken but hard-nosed way, told Donald Trump something no other court has over the course of his many civil and criminal cases: He’s down to his last chance.Merchan ruled Tuesday on contempt motions brought by the Manhattan district attorney’s office in response to Trump’s serial violation of a gag order prohibiting public statements about witnesses, jurors and others connected to the hush money case. The judge was calm, straightforward and utterly undramatic in announcing that he had found violations in nine of the 10 instances cited by prosecutors.It was Merchan’s written order that contained the thunder. It forcefully and convincingly rejected Trump’s arguments that the order permits him to respond to supposed political attacks or excludes reposting of others’ social media comments. (It was when Trump lawyer Todd Blanche made those arguments in court that Merchan ominously warned he was in danger of “losing all credibility.” Merchan really lowers the boom near the end of the written ruling, advising Trump in no uncertain terms that if he insists on forcing the judge’s hand, he is prepared to put him in jail.“Defendant is hereby warned,” Merchan wrote, “that the Court will not tolerate continued willful violations of its lawful orders and that if necessary and appropriate under the circumstances, it will impose an incarceratory punishment.”That’s appropriate given the limited legal tools at Merchan’s disposal.Other courts — for example, the federal court handling the Jan. 6 case — can take several intermediate steps to manage a recalcitrant defendant. And those courts have done back flips to avoid putting Trump in jail, being very aware of the political cyclone it could occasion.But Merchan’s court is more constrained. New York law essentially gives him the option of a fine of up to $1,000 for each act of contempt or a jail term of up to 30 days.And as Merchan wrote, “While $1,000 may suffice in most instances to protect the dignity of the judicial system, to compel respect for its mandates and to punish the offender for disobeying a court order,” it doesn’t do the trick in the case of a defendant as wealthy as Trump.Given this dilemma, Merchan could go through several rounds of thousand-dollar fines. But he left it to Trump to decide whether to play the martyr and go to jail for political reasons.If the former president is determined to continue on his defiant course, Merchan’s unavoidable responsibility will be to have him ushered to a jail cell, beginning perhaps with a short stay in the holding cell at the back of his court.The judge must recognize that his credibility and that of the proceedings are at risk if he lets Trump continue to thumb his nose at his orders without more serious consequences.Merchan has already scheduled a hearing Thursday to adjudicate four additional alleged instances of contempt on Trump’s part. Don’t expect him to put Trump in custody for those: They occurred before he had issued the clear warning in Tuesday’s opinion.But if Merchan does find those to be more willful violations of his orders, they look to be the last he will tolerate without a dramatic escalation of the penalties. The lines are drawn; Trump is almost out of chances and knows it.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.Fumie Christine Cabral, 96, of Hilo died Aug. 26 at a private care home in Hilo.

eugeneweekly_2024_39,"We ve got issues. The Oregon Country Fair has been a bright thread woven throughout the fabric of my life. My first Fair was in 1983 — inside my mom’s very large tummy — and I have returned almost every year since. But that will not be the case for my children. My 14-year-old twins were born three months premature. Both are autistic, have ADHD and one is a power wheelchair user due to his quadriplegic cerebral palsy. The Fair has not been a pleasant experience for them during the handful of times we have tried it. We are not the only ones who have noticed the Fair has work to do around access and inclusion. This year, I was honored to moderate a panel discussion on Disability and Fair Access featuring Paralympian Ravi Drugan and his mom Keli Schunk, as well as Oakland, California, activist Maya Scott-Chung. Drugan and Schunk have been longtime fairgoers, whereas this was Scott-Chung’s first experience at Fair, which made for a rich conversation. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Many members of the 4A crew showed up to contribute, too. The OCF’s Access Advocates for the Alter-Abled already does great work offering accommodations. These include: rest areas at the Dragon (main gate and Community Village, sign language interpretation, powerchair charging, accessible route maps, service dog rest areas, wheelchair rentals and adult-size diaper changing at White Bird Clinic. We also put out a survey that had 55 responses from fairgoers — though eight of those said they do not go to the Fair anymore because it is inaccessible to them. Respondents were mostly either disabled themselves (57.4 percent or were friends and family of disabled people (9.3 percent and 24.1 percent, respectively . Being a word person myself, I was particularly interested to learn that the crowd was split rather evenly on whether they preferred person-first language (“person with a disability” , identity-first language (“disabled person” or an alternative like the OCF term “alter-abled.” Most respondents preferred person-first language (40.4 percent with alternative terms at 32.7 percent and identity-first language at 26.9 percent. (Adjusting for only those who identified as having a disability themselves, person-first and identity-first language were tied at 12 respondents each and seven said they preferred alternatives. Almost 90 percent had been to other outdoor festivals, which gave them something to compare to the Fair. On a scale of “terrible” to “fantastic,” most (36.4 percent thought OCF’s accessibility was middling, with 30.9 percent finding it only a step above terrible. It’s clear the Fair has some work to do. For a family of children with significant needs, my family has done a decent amount of traveling, and we have learned a thing or two about the burgeoning new interest in accessible travel. Almost every attraction we’ve been to has an accessibility page with a range of accommodations listed. Nonprofits likeKultureCity, which trains staff at venues and then certifies venues that have sensory inclusive modifications, are partnering with these locations to provide sensory bags. Accommodations like these and better information about what disabled fairgoers can expect would go a long way to improving the Fair’s accessibility to people like my sons. Survey respondents and our guest panelists had many other suggestions, too. These included: Better and cleaner ADA bathrooms (Why are we still talking about these basics in 2024?! ; better in-Fair transport options; more benches and rest areas; closer, reservable alter-abled parking; free companion tickets; better heat mitigation (distribute cooling towels ; and more awareness of other people’s needs and the history of disability justice. As is often the case when we listen to our disabled community members, improving these issues could actually improve the experience for everyone. Who hasn’t been overwhelmed by the sensory input at the Fair? Who doesn’t want a cleaner port-a-potty? Who isn’t stunned by the heat? One of my favorite signs at the Fair says: “Thank you for being us.” It’s time the Fair puts more resources towards making sure the “us” can include folks like my kids.

minnpost_2024_120,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.After President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance at the June 27 debate,many Democratshave raced to ring the alarm bell, proclaiming that it’s time for him to step aside, time to let someone else take the reins in hopes of defeating Donald Trump in November.With that in mind,as politicalscientistswith a side interest in sports, we recount three moments from history when men and women faced the difficult decision to stay or go. We hope they will help inform the current discussion.We begin with two who worked at the highest levels of power in the U.S.:On the final night of March 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson, known universally as “LBJ,” spoke to the nation from the Oval Office to say that the United States would unilaterally halt nearly all its bombing in North Vietnam.But as his address came to a close, he had something more to say:Shocking his audience,LBJ added: “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.”Johnson was 59 years old. Three-and-a-half years earlier, he had scored one of the greatest landslides in American history, winning 61% of the vote and 44 states in the1964 presidential election.A scant few individuals so aptly defined the term “political animal” as LBJ. He had come to Washington as a young man bursting with ambition and succeeded like few others.Indeed, since becoming president afterJohn F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination, Johnson had ushered through Congress anavalanche of progressive legislation, including the historic 1964 Civil Rights and 1965 Voting Rights acts. With the possible exception of Franklin D. Roosevelt, no other president had achieved so much legislatively.But on that March day in 1968, at a time of growing antiwar protests and theaccelerating pull of rival candidatesfor the Democratic nomination, he understood that he now led a country coming apart at the seams. Despite having declared his candidacy for reelection, seeking another term might make things worse.It was time for someone else to have a turn.As one of us recounts in his book, “A Supreme Court Unlike Any Other: The Deepening Divide Between the Justices and the People,” President Barack Obama invited Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for a private lunch at the White House in the summer of 2013.Obama wanted to nudge Ginsburg into retirement. The 80-year-old justice was a two-time survivor of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest of all cancers. She had already served on the high court for two decades and had carved out a legacy as a staunch liberal and champion of women’s equality.Additionally, Obama was concerned about the upcoming midterm elections. If the Democrats lost the Senate, he would not be able to replace her with a like-minded justice, because a GOP-run Senate would not confirm such a nominee.Ginsburg didn’t take Obama’s hint.Soon after the lunch, she noted, “I think one should stay as long as she can do the job.”She added shortly after, “There will be a president after this one, and I’m hopeful that that president will be a fine president.”That next president was Donald Trump.Ginsburg died in mid-September 2020, just weeks before Joe Biden would oust Trump from the White House. But significantly, Trump had sufficient time tofill Ginsburg’s seat with the conservative Amy Coney Barrett.In 2022, Barrett provided the fifth and decisive vote in the Dobbs decision,which overturned Roe v. Wade’s federal protection of abortion rights.Deciding when to step away or stay may have deep consequences in the political world.The consequences are big in sports, as well, but at a more personal level.Skeptics said he was too small to play among the giants on an offensive line in the NFL. Not strong enough. Not tough enough. A former walk-on who had beendrafted in 2011 in the sixth round.But in a short space of time, Jason Kelceredefined the position of centerand helped guide his team to its first-ever Super Bowl win.In 2024, Kelce’s team, the Philadelphia Eagles, was still one of the best in the NFL. It had been to the Super Bowl just a year earlier, and Kelce was still considered to be playing near the top of his game.But Kelce had had enough. It was time for him to end his playing days.Sitting before a packed room of reporters and family members, the bare-armed and burly-chested 36-year-old Kelce set out tosay goodbye.But before he could even get a sentence out, his emotions took over, forcing him to pause for several moments. He held his head in his hands, sobbing, sniffling, snorting, taking deep breaths. Tears streamed down his face throughout the news conference. Repeatedly, he had to stop and wipe them away with a washcloth someone tossed to him.As he struggled to get through his statement, listeners could hear him motivate himself several times with the phrase, “Come on.”Kelce’s retirement announcement is both difficult and extraordinarily captivating to watch. During those 40 minutes, he displays the courage it takes to call it quits when there is still something to be gained.The picture was of a man coming to terms with his fate. Not because of injury or lack of skill, but because he believed it was necessary to take this step before those things forced him out.Are there moments when we can judge for another when it is time to bow out? Most assuredly, there are. Hopefully, we do so with compassion and gratitude, but there are simply times when conscience demands an honest reckoning and unflinching truth-telling.Kevin J. McMahonis a professor of political science at Trinity College.Michael Parisis the chairperson and associate professor of law at College of Staten Island, CUNY.This article is republished from The Conversation."
philinquirer_2024_67,"The GOP vice presidential nominee came to prominence by claiming people live in poverty because they made bad decisions, rather than by dint of the capitalism game played against them.Early in the introduction of Sen. JD — no periods after the letters ishis preferred spelling — Vance at the Republican National Convention on Monday, the new vice presidential candidate was called “a living embodiment of the American dream.” As the Milwaukee crowd chanted his name, Vance was presented to delegates as someone who “has never forgotten the working people of our country, and he never will.”I’d like to interrupt the love fest with a little reality.Sometime around page 10 in Vance’s 2016Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of Family and Culture in Crisis, I lost interest. By the second chapter, I was ready to toss the book across the room.By the third chapter, I did.» READ MORE:America will never be the same after Milwaukee’s tent revival for the cult of Donald Trump | Will BunchI wanted to read this book. After all, I am a hillbilly — born in Kentucky, raised in the lap of Jesus in the Missouri Ozarks, andVance, a fellow hillbilly from Appalachia, had made good. From a raggedy childhood, he’d gone to far-off Yale University, made money, and now he could be the nation’s guide to those mythical hill people who huddle around their stills in the back 40.But the book was rife with half- and ill-formed conservative talking points that boiled down to a repetitious recitation of the old trope that Vance’s cousins and mine were failing because they weren’t pulling themselves up by their bootstraps.In other words:Get a job, hillbillies— which skirted entirely the reality of small-town and rural poverty.Vance knew better, but the spotlight is a powerful drug.His message was easily digested because it’s convenient to believe people live in poverty because they made bad decisions, rather than the idea that they’re there by dint of the capitalism game already being played against them.But those who’d never sat in a hard pew saw only a man who made it out of poverty. The book sold millions and was made into a movie I didn’t watch, and along the way, as Vance himself has said, the media began to see him as something of a Trump Whisperer. As a rare cross-cultural public figure, Vance could explain how so many conservatives living in double-wides could embrace a rich showman who owned a gold toilet.I don’t think Vance much wanted that role. I think he had his eye on something bigger, but he dutifully tried to explain his demographic origins as best he could. His fellows’ support of Trump seemed to baffle him. Early on, he said Trump was “reprehensible” and an “idiot.”» READ MORE:Trump was right, it’s time to fight | Helen UbiñasBut what we once called political flip-flops are an act performed by many of the stars in Trump’s constellation. His list of converts includes Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Lindsey Graham, the latter of whom went from suggesting voters tellTrump to go to hellto telling the candidate “I love you” after Saturday’s shooting.I am not here to speak for hillbillies. Far from it. There is no one story coming out of the hills, and no one storyteller fit to tell them. I would caution, though, that we love our rags-to-riches stories because those stories gloss over the realities of the people who never make it out of their rags — like those 36.5% of Ohio workers whoearn less than $15,000 a year, orOhio’s children who are more likely to live in poverty than are the state’s adults.Vance told his half-story story all the way to a U.S. Senate seat in 2022, but a quick trip through the bills he has backed leaves you with thin gruel. There’s the oh-so-important Stop Trying to Obsessively Vilify Energy Act (the STOVE Act, meant to SOGS — save our gas stoves , and an attempt to declare English our national language.On Thursday, Vance signed on as acosponsor to a billthat would amend Title 28, “to authorize removal of a civil action or criminal prosecution against a president, vice president, former president, or former vice president.”Sigh.I would suggest that the ladder has been pulled up by ol’ JD, and that’s not just me talking.If Vance’s star is shining, people back home remain unimpressed. While Vance was being lauded as the hero of the middle and lower classes, the Columbus Dispatch ran a story about the “not-so-pretty things” his constituents had to say about him. Most of the comments and letters aren’t laudatory — save for the guest editorials Vance wrote himself.He’s been called a “craven shape-shifter,” “disgraceful,” and “No. 1 saprophyte” (an organism that lives on dead things . In a May letter, one writer asked Trump to choose Vance as his running mate so Ohio could be less one “lying, bootlicking, butt kissing, weak-willed, integrity lacking, sickening obsequious sycophant.” Try saying that in one breath.So, in the vernacular of my youth: Hillbillies don’t need no elegy.

suffolknewsherald_2024_25,"Published 7:05 pm Wednesday, June 26, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial Board“There’s no place like home,” a popular reference to a movie with a tornado putting a girl and her little dog too on an unknown path looking for her way back home. A story that is eerily familiar to Suffolk News-Herald staff. Those of us who were here in 2020 experienced what it was like to be put on an unknown path by a tornado.During tropical storm Isaias, the historic building on Saratoga Street where Suffolk News-Herald had resided for decades was hit hard by a tornado, displacing our entire operation in the blink of an eye. Desks covered in ceiling tiles, gaping holes in the roof in the back of the building, and front windows blown completely out and clear across the street — the building was devastated. Our home away from home, where we spend eight hours or more out of everyday life, was destroyed.Where would we go? What would happen next? These were all big unknowns for us but one thing was clear: readers of the Suffolk News-Herald would still receive their papers that week. Through all of this, we never missed a paper. The press stops for no one, not even a tornado. Thankfully, with the help of some friends within the community, we quickly found a new temporary home at 157 N. Main Street to set up shop and resume normal office functions. It’s a special feeling knowing that the community that you serve will come to your aid. We are grateful to all those who stepped up in our hour of need. Truly, thank you.These walls have housed Suffolk News-Herald’s staff for the last four years, and they have seen it all. This is where we have met new friends, a few of whom have stopped by to visit us by accident on their way to Workforce Development. We’ve worked here with you, the people of this great city, on matters important to you. We’ve held people accountable here, after all, your community newspaper is your watchdog. We’ve won multiple Virginia Press Association awards over multiple years while at this office. Most important of all, we’ve produced here. We’ve produced, without interruption, the quality local journalism that this community deserves. We are grateful for all these walls have provided.However, it is time to find our way back to more permanent roots, and today, we are excited to announce that the Suffolk News-Herald has found a new home at the O’Connor suite located at 110 Finney Ave., in the Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts. We’re thrilled to have an opportunity to move our operations to such a historic site in Suffolk. Though we will not be on Main Street anymore, we are still nestled in the hustle and bustle of Downtown Suffolk. We will still be available for walk-ins at any time during office hours. Simply pull into the parking lot behind The Center and park near the wooded area. If you look toward the back of the building you’ll see a red loading door and a pergola to the left of it. Walk down the short path, next to the lovely bushes to the open patio on the right. There you will find our new offices’ double doors and there we will be — ready to serve you and continue to provide you with top notch local journalism and marketing solutions, as we have been since 1873.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_250,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°As the presidential campaign enters its final phase with the unexpected ascension of Kamala Harris to the top of the Democratic ticket to face Republican Donald Trump, it’s easy to forget that there are actually three, not two, candidates with some notable polling in the race. The third is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who having failed to secure a credible shot at winning the Democratic primary against Joe Biden is now running as an independent, hitting around 5% in national polls.RFK Jr. has the perfect confluence of characteristics to make him an attractive sideshow; for a certain generation nostalgic for the potency of the “Camelot” myth and the Kennedy heyday, he’s an ideal contender. For anti-establishmentarians on either political side — libertarian-leaning conservatives upset that Trump pushed vaccines during COVID or leftists who consider any U.S. military support or intervention an imperialist transgression — he’s the guy who’s going to buck the powers that be. To the conspiracy-minded, he’s the person who’s long fought the good fight against some globalist Big Pharma plot.These people don’t constitute a plurality in any state, but they’re enough to register in polls. In swing states like Georgia and Nevada that he has no chance of winning, his presence on the ballot could conceivably shift the outcomes. Kennedy won’t win, can’t win, but he seems aware of who benefits most from his insistence on running this campaign anyway.Kennedy often talks about playing spoiler to both Trump and Biden (who was the presumptive Democratic nominee until about 10 minutes ago , but appeared to agree with Trump that the Republican would win during a phone call between the two last month and expressed interest in joining a Trump administration. At the RNC, Kennedy reportedly said that Trump was “barely even human” and “probably a sociopath,” but that Biden was “more dangerous to the Republic and the planet.”If he really believes that — on what basis, we can’t even begin to imagine — then he likely hasn’t changed his mind now that the candidate is Biden’s vice president, Harris.RFK Jr. is not his father Bobby or his uncles Jack or Teddy. Nor is he an outsider in any way. He is the product of the closest thing we have to political royalty, yet has uniformly had his candidacy condemned universally by his very large family. He’s also just a deeply strange guy who seems to operate at every moment under the impression that he’s right and can act on his whims, like dumping a dead bear cub Central Park as some kind of joke a decade ago, one of several bizarre anecdotes reported out in a recent long profile in the New Yorker.His whims also include the hallmarks of an unserious campaign run by an unserious person, like stunning his own campaign by adopting a fully pro-choice position on a podcast when that ran counter to their own messaging.In this and other accounts of the conspiracy candidate and gadfly candidate, the picture that emerges is that of a consummate opportunist who wants to turn his Uncle Jack’s famous words on their head; what, RFK Jr. asks, can this country do for him?— New York Daily News"
leoweekly_2024_29,"In honor of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — and Louisville as a city in flux (and because he mentions Muhammad Ali — his Your Life s Blueprint speech from 1967 to a group of students in Philadelphia seems especially poignant.

eugeneweekly_2024_3,"We ve got issues. On the Fourth of July, 25 people rallied at the Federal Building against the rush of June Supreme Court decisions. I loved these talks for two reasons — they all mentioned that our struggle, our movements, are within a context of global imperialism and global capitalism. And that the movements have to cooperate and fight for everyone’s rights, or we’re all toast. These two themes have been widely repeated at other rallies — for Palestinians, at the students encampment, at Eugene City Council, homeless protests and many other events this year. There were excellent talks for each different movement: LGBTQ, Gaza, economic injustice, homelessness, loss of democracy, etc. I want to focus on the theme that we’re being ruled by a ruthless imperial system, and we have to have each other’s backs. Why would people in the LGBTQ movement or the climate movement or Black people have common ground with Labor or Palestinians, for example? Or vice versa? Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. They’re not all leftist.They’re composed of a cross-section of society. They’re less conscious of other issues. But advancing any of their goals involves changing laws or changing the Constitution. And these can never be done until you confront global capitalism who control the media, legislation, the military and police. Steve Dear, a community organizer and activist involved with Extinction Rebellion, Planet Versus Pentagon, Springfield Eugene Anti Imperialism Coalition, said on July 4: “We are here because the deeply corrupt U.S. Supreme Court has issued three new decisions that represent a tectonic shift away from basic legal protections of civil liberties, environmental health, worker safety and limitations on presidential power: the Chevron case, the Trump case — presidential immunity from criminal prosecution — andCity of Grants Pass v. Johnson,effectively criminalizing sleeping in the only location available to homeless people in Grants Pass.” Dear continues, “Let us understand the context of these recent decisions.The United States of America was never a democracy, only a nominal republic. The legal documents upon which the structures of our economy and legal and political system are based from the U.S. Constitution back to the Magna Carta were designed to protect the property and interests of a small elite. Wealth is now concentrated in fewer and fewer hands… Operating within the iron cage of capitalism, journalism is mostly dead.” Back on June 26, John Monroe told the Eugene City Council that he’d “like to address the question of why this council and why this city should be concerned with the genocide happening in Gaza in Palestine or broadly because what we’re seeing there is the most extreme edge of a process that’s happening everywhere, including here in the U.S. The bombing that has destroyed every university in Gaza is an extreme form of the gutting of our libraries and of our 4J school system that is damaging the future of our residents and taking away basic education.” Finally, Kamryn Stringfield, at the Pinkwashing Rally June 16 said, “On the working class, our liberation, as well as Palestinian liberation, Black liberation, women’s liberation, and all liberation is tied to the liberation of mankind from imperialism once and for all. With that, I want to leave you all off with a quote from Comrade Fidel Castro in an interview he did in 2010 with theLa Jornadanewspaper in Havana, where he apologized for his role in LGBT-plus oppression in Cuba early on. At the conclusion of his interview, he said, the world of the future has to be common and the rights of human beings have to be above individual rights. And it will be a rich world where our rights are equal for all. The interviewer asked, how are you going to achieve that, commander?

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_180,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Ten years before I was born, at 4:40 on the morning of Nov. 10, 1971, my mother and another woman sat “yogi-style” on the floor of an Ann Arbor, Michigan, kitchen and lit themselves on fire. They were just blocks from the University of Michigan campus, where my mother had been a student. She had just turned 20. Police tracked the smell of burning hair to find the women sitting on the floor, facing each other, screaming.“They weren’t doing anything to put the fire out,” Police Chief Walter Krasny told the Ann Arbor News. “We have no idea why they would do something like this. They didn’t use gasoline or anything. We presume they were fully clothed in street clothing and just set themselves on fire.”My mother’s self-immolation was the prologue to my life. Every time another instance of self-immolation occurs, as happened earlier this month outside a courthouse in New York City, I wonder about the people and where they sit in the lineage of the act. The inevitable think pieces after a high-profile self-immolation often sound the same, because what can one say? It’s an incredibly contextual act. It’s personal, and political. The act is the message, and vice versa. You cannot understand what it means without knowing the person’s story. And sometimes not even then.I’ve always been reluctant to link my mother’s story to any sort of protest. It felt both sensational and inaccurate to place her suicide attempt into the political history of self-immolation. Because of our cultural tendency toward binary thinking, people are quick to pick a label to understand this act: protest or illness. To accept an act as protest neither negates nor implies mental illness. Both things could be true at once, and other factors altogether could be in play. Implying that mental illness precludes taking a stance is infantilizing.Many rushed to conclude that mental illness had led a U.S. airman, Aaron Bushnell, to kill himself in February. He set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington. However, Bushnell had posted on social media that he was going to kill himself in protest, and screamed “Free Palestine” as he went up in flames.If an individual offers an explanation, I’ve always been inclined to accept their statement as is. When they do not, things are stickier. My mother, who died in 2005, spoke about her decision to me only once, when I was 12. Looking back on her account as an adult, I believe that mental illness was one factor. But she also told me she had been drawn to the student activism sweeping the country at that time. I have never found either of those explanations complete enough.The year my mother and the woman with her burned, 1971, marked the end of a string of Vietnamese monks self-immolating following Thích Quang Đuc’s burning at a Saigon intersection. It was an era of protest, student unrest, spiritual awakening and the cultism that often accompanies fading trust in institutions. Martyrdom and protest, profound grief and psychological angst were in the ether — as they are now. This month in New York City, as one man burned himself in the protest zone outside Donald Trump’s trial, students uptown were demonstrating for a free Palestine. I can’t help the gnawing sensation that while moving forward, we have also traveled back. Now, I wonder, whether my mother and the other woman were somehow tapping a cultural current of the early ’70s. Channeling it.In a 1965 letter to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Vietnamese monk Thích Nhat Hanh wrote about how difficult it is for the Western Christian conscience to understand the self-immolation of Vietnamese monks. He explained that the actions were neither suicide nor protest, but were devotional: “During the ceremony of ordination, as practiced in the Mahayana Buddhist tradition, the monk-candidate is required to burn one, or more, small spots on his body in taking the vow to observe the 250 rules of a bhikshu, to live the life of a monk, to attain enlightenment and to devote his life to the salvation of all beings. … The importance is not to take one’s life, but to burn. What he really aims at is the expression of his will and determination, not death.”According to news reports, in the ambulance on the way to the University of Michigan Burn Center, my mother or the woman she burned with whispered: “It’s lovely to die together.” At no point that night, or in the months that followed, as my mother healed and the other woman eventually died in the hospital, did they ever make a statement to police. They refused to say more about their intent. As such, theirs was an almost anomalous case — resisting efforts to be categorized as protest or illness.For a long time, I thought her burning had no place in this larger sociopolitical context, but the more I see it refracted through today’s lens, the more I understand that even without stated intent, an act of self-burning is inherently political. People around the world have self-immolated because of job loss or oppressive domestic or cultural environments. They have burned to protest political regimes and to decry imperialism. They have burned, as the monks did, to express will. Whatever the impetus, maybe no other act has so exemplified the personal as political. And maybe it’s no coincidence that “personal is political” was coined by feminists in 1970 — the year before my mother’s suicide attempt, when people were fighting for many of the civil rights being rolled back now, state by state.What does an individual act of self-immolation mean? That can be hard to answer, but what’s clear to me is that these acts have meaning, and that meaning is often multifaceted. They could be conveying pain within themselves, or in their families, or in the larger systems in which we work and love and live. Whether in illness or protest or both, or for other reasons entirely, they are expressing their “will and determination.” With their bodies, they are saying “look here now.” If burning oneself is a way of speaking out, we oversimplify or sensationalize the act at our own peril.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

This shift directly correlates with the makers of the policy, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC , and the pseudo-statesmanship ideology from the Rhode Scholars in the 21stcentury. This global panel thinks they control what the industrial sector can, and cannot manufacture based on the ideology of climate change, which has been identified as a means to control the economic growth of nations that do not fall in line with the UN global policy on climate change and not necessarily fight true environmental challenges. The fact of the matter is this agenda has been identified by many experts and scholars, as well as other United Nations agendas such as replacement migration, as a means to destroy the US sovereignty through backdoor policies and umbrella corporations, which are not backed constitutionally by no means. How long will Americans allow this to happen before we realize that we are surrounded by global diasporas who align themselves more with the global agendas of the UN and not the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution? These policies can only exist if “we the people” allow these globalists to determine our economic growth, but if we follow a national policy directive and focus on getting these global agents out of our institutions, we can have a grassroots movement that has not been seen before. Foreign entities undermining the US sovereignty should spark an ignition to unite all walks of life here in the states and allow the American people to throw off the global shackles that are bound to bring us under a global cabal and write our history of true independence and freedom.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

The minimum lot size is not an absolute requirement, as long as you show the viability of your farm on a smaller lot.The main change to the bill is that a farm plan will be needed at the time of application. To make it easy, the Real Property Tax Office is creating a farm plan template. And even that is not an absolute requirement. If you don’t want to do a farm plan, there are other documents that will be acceptable.While they may take some getting used to, these new requirements are actually pretty simple for anyone who is producing food. However, those who wish to cheat on their taxes by claiming a farm exemption without making a meaningful contribution to our community’s food production would find it difficult to comply.Like any new policy, there’s always room for improvement. My suggestion would be to add a grandfather clause allowing people whose families have been doing subsistence farming for two generations or more on the same land to be exempt from the new requirements.With this small improvement in place, the new rules would help us prevent gentrification, preserve the character of the Hamakua Coast, and ensure that tax cheats pay their fair share.We’ve got wastewater treatment facilities, public gyms, parks, bridges and fire stations in desperate need of repair. Gentleman farmers are claiming agriculture exemptions for their beautiful, multi-million dollar properties without contributing to food production. And still, many of them live in farm communities like Hamakua, which brings in only about 6% of the county’s tax revenue.When the cheaters don’t have to pay their fair share of taxes, it hurts all of us.We need to do what’s best for Hamakua and for our island and support tax fairness through Bills 57 and 58.Koohan Paik-ManderHamakuaState and county roadsides are a messCan someone please answer me as to why the roadsides on county roads and state highways are in such an overgrown, unkempt or partially pushed down condition?

philinquirer_2024_71,"In the past year, I ve learned that Philadelphia is better behind handlebars. I’ve started to fall in love with this city in an entirely new way.I loved my car.It was a silver 2004 Subaru Forester, and it was once my home for three months when I traveled across the country. Through a bug-splattered windshield, I saw some of the most beautiful sights our nation has to offer, from the Smoky Mountains to Yosemite and back.It was great until it wasn’t. I eventually grew sick of relying so much on a heavy-duty machine that drained my wallet, especially for short city trips. So last year, I made a drastic change:I sold it.Now, I get around Philadelphia on my trusty Trek bicycle, and I’ve started to fall in love with this city in an entirely new way.For one, I’ve been able to observe and interact with the people of Philly in a way I never could in my car. From behind my handlebars, I’ve witnessed countless instances of Philadelphians trusting, helping, forgiving, and loving their fellow neighbors and nearby strangers. The comfy confines of a car cannot compare to the warmth of these subtle interactions, like when an old man and a fussy baby make eye contact and share a smile, or when a complete stranger compliments your mustache as you ride by. There’s a genuine human connection that occurs when a road dispute is settled with a verbal apology instead of a facelessbeeeepfrom behind the wheel.When we move about our city on bike or foot, we’re forced to humanize the people we’d otherwise avoid behind the protective armor of a vehicle.Author andPennsylvania native Jane Jacobstouched on this in her 1961 book,The Death and Life of Great American Cities: “The trust of a city street is formed over time from many, many little public sidewalk contacts,” she wrote, even citing the “ballet” of Rittenhouse Square as a hot spot for these little contacts. “Most of it is ostensibly utterly trivialbut the sum is not trivial at all. The sum of such casual, public contact at a local level … is a feeling for the public identity of people, a web of public respect and trust, and a resource in time of personal or neighborhood need.”Rolling around Philly on my bike, I notice the “little public sidewalk contacts” Jacobs references are on full display. The sum of these contacts is unquantifiable, as she suggests, but it’s the purest distillation of the true love that courses through this city daily.Unfortunately, this inherent beauty that exists in Philadelphia isinvisible to most of its residents, simply because our default mode of movement is a personal car.» READ MORE:For my low-income family, biking is not recreation. ‘It’s survival.’In a city peppered with parking lots, auto body shops, and towing companies, it’s no surprisecar culture is deeply woven into the fabric of Philadelphia’s communal identity. As a result, local drivers have long displayed a sense of entitlement to the public right-of-way, so much so thatA&E’s hit showParking Warswas launched in 2008 to document spats between drivers and the Philadelphia Parking Authority.While these televised disputes became somewhat of a “claim to fame” for Philly, they underscored a deeper issue around car dependency and unsavory driver behaviors that have continued to worsen over the years. Philly’s biggest roadway challenges today includereckless driving, heavy congestion, androad rage, all of which are rooted in a sense of entitlement that inherently creates a divide between drivers and pedestrians or cyclists.Simply put, our cars are preventing us from experiencing the organic interpersonal interactions that allow us to feel included, connected, and safe in our city.To reclaim our reputation as a community of brotherhood and love, we need to break out of our isolating, gas-guzzling vehicles and invest in the people-friendly infrastructure that was originally intended for Philadelphia’s streets.Take our famed Art Museum, for example. The popular attraction sits at the top of Benjamin Franklin Parkway, whichwas designed in 1907to connect Philadelphia’s denser urban neighborhoods with the nature of Fairmount Park,drawing inspiration from Paris’ famously pedestrian-friendly Champs-Élysées. However, the last century has seen the Parkway overrun with car traffic that pours into Eakins Oval and circles the foot of the museum like a moat, forcing hundreds of daily museum visitors toplayFroggerwith local drivers.These stressful interactions between drivers and pedestrians illustrate the negative impact car culture has on how we connect with our communities. And while several efforts to improve city roadways have been introduced in recent years, real change won’t happen until our daily habits change — when we swap our car keys for sneakers and become active participants in our community instead of passive observers.Maybe if we turned the volume down on cars and up on human interactions, our lived environment and lifestyles would reflect our heightened regard for humanity.Thankfully, organizations like theBicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphiaand projects likeReimagine the Benjamin Franklin Parkwayare already working hard to make our city more human-centric. And while it may take some time to dismantle the deep car culture we’ve established, significant change starts with us as individuals, today.So the next time you head out the door, strap on your bike helmet or grab a SEPTA Key card instead of your car keys. I guarantee a more lovely Philadelphia is waiting for you outside the driver’s seat.Leo Walsh is a senior customer success managerat Jawntand an avid cycling advocate.

minnpost_2024_136,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Tragedy seldom unifies Americans today.Every year, horrific crises induce tremendous suffering. Most are privately tragic, affecting only those directly harmed and their immediate relations.A small number, though, become politically notorious and, therefore, publicly tragic.Natural disasters,school shootings,terrorist attacksand economic crises can become public tragedies. Sexual assaults — primarily of women — by abusive executives and other men in positions of powerrecently emerged as a public tragedy, as haspolice brutality against African Americans, which has sown political unrest across the United States.Even the COVID-19 pandemic, a seemingly natural disaster, quicklytransitioned into a public tragedyas deaths mounted and a pervasive sense of mismanagement, distrust and blame galvanized the public on the political left and right.Events like these represent a change in how tragic circumstances are cast and how they are responded to in the United States and beyond. Public tragedies are heartrending events that gain widespread public attention. They involve stylized public expressions of shock, outrage, social blame, claims of victimization, protest and memorialization.My book, “After Tragedy Strikes,” explores the recent proliferation of public tragedies as a distinctive kind of political crisis that has produced far-reaching positive and negative effects on social and political relations in the 21st century.As asociologist who studies risk, politics and social movements, I didn’t set out to evaluate the authenticity of claims made in public tragedies. Rather, through comparison, my goal was to understand better why some of these events exert tremendous influence, while other, objectively similar, traumas do not.Public tragedies have contributed to the increasing political polarization and the sectarian tone of political rhetoric today. One question I sought to answer in my book is why?The short answer is that the public’s understanding of tragic events has changed.Well into the 20th century, tragedies were mostly explained differently than now. Explanations often referenced forces such as God, fate, bad luck, blameless accidents or, in line with the U.S. liberal political tradition, individual responsibility. Even when suffering was extreme and known to have been caused or worsened by the actions or omissions of other persons, explanations of what caused it typically took these forms.TakePennsylvania’s Johnstown Flood of 1889, in which more than 2,200 people and much of the city were swept away by a deluge after a dam failed. The wealthy South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club had built the dam to create a private lake. Despite the failure due to poor construction and maintenance,neither the club nor its wealthy members would be held responsible. In the most prominent legal case brought against the club, the final verdict attributed the tragic deaths and destruction to an act of God.Today, this explanation would be indefensible.After a tragedy, accounts now focus on assigning blame. I found that they also typically center on social blame, in which societal institutions such as the government, industry, civil society and even American culture are held responsible.Social blame attributes harm to social forces, not individuals or God. And because some group or aspect of society is blamed, public tragedies involve political conflict.Another reason public tragedies have become so politically consequential lies in a change in the contemporary American mindset.Pollsshowthat many Americans are experiencing fear and a deep sense of vulnerability to circumstances that feel beyond their control.This mindset inspires sympathy for victims of tragic circumstances, especially when the harms they suffer are portrayed by political elites, the media and social activists as reflecting political failure and an unfair society. Political interests on both the left and right nowroutinely use claims of victimization to gain supportand advantage.Take the story ofGeorge Floyd, killed in 2020by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.Floyd’s murder provoked nationwide outrageas video footage of it circulated first on social media and then through sustained news media coverage. The news and social media story of Floyd’s death emphasized his innocence: As a Black man, he had suffered an unjustified death at the hands of the police.This representation was unusual at the time. Standard coverage of such killings often focused on resistance to arrest, prior indiscretions or the victim’s criminal record, which implies individual responsibility. Stories regarding Floyd’s death did not emphasize these elements.Nor did the stories suggest Floyd’s death was a necessary part of police fighting crime — another common feature of news accounts. Nor did stories emphasize that Chauvin was a rogue cop, which would have suggested his killing of Floyd was his responsibility alone.Rather, the initial stories connected Floyd’s killing to police violence across the country, suggesting it was a common police behavior.Thus, Floyd’s murder was quicklyblamed on “policing,” gaining enormous public sympathy and notoriety — and, with this, political significance. It became a public tragedy, highlighting a set of societal conditions surrounding Floyd’s death in a way that few police killings of Black men had achieved.In the past, Americans might have attributed Floyd’s killing to fate, bad luck, accident or his individual responsibility, which might have weakened public outrage.Yet explanations of this kind are not as believable as they once were. Instead, the heartrending stories characteristic of public tragedies follow a routine storyline I call the “trauma script.” It is a stylized rendering that taps into American fears and vulnerabilities and prompts emotional response and moral panic.The script centers on innocent victims harmed by unforeseeable, uncontrollable and unwarranted circumstances blamed on the actions or omissions of “society.”In this telling, public tragedies convey a moral struggle in which good people are brought low by a bad society. This tragic struggle is not internal and personal but external and socially focused. It’s a scenario in which bad things happen to good people who have no choice.The public perception of trauma and loss and its underlying causes has, therefore, changed over time.In an earlier era, Americans often justified hardship because it reflected the sacrifice necessary to get ahead. Now, a shift in sentiment reflects a change in view. Americans now focus on unjustified hardship caused by society. This reflects a cultural shift from a progress-centered worldview toward a risk-focused one.As Americans have become more aware of risks, they increasingly view them as reflecting political choices.Whether the issue is climate change, energy sources, guns, sexual harassment, discrimination, policing, abortion or even free speech, these are now understood as involving decisions regarding risks that will benefit some and victimize others.Politically, these have become zero-sum disputes, leading to political polarization among Americans and social distrust of American institutions.RecentPew surveysshow that two-thirds of Americans believe other Americans have little or no confidence in the government or other citizens. Gallup, too, has shown that American confidence in the government and other major societal institutionshas fallen to historic lows.Growing American distrust of their fellow citizens and perception of an unfair government have also intensified political competition. Americans increasingly blame their political rivals for their hardships and show compassion only toward those who share their beliefs. This shift has also cultivated sympathy for claims of societal victimization and elevated victimhood as a political identity.These conditions are the context within which public tragedies, as polarizing not unifying political events, have proliferated.Thomas D.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_138,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Nikki Haley was once perceived by many Republicans as their hope for redeeming a party that had been taken over by a morally corrupt, lying and craven narcissist. Donald Trump, she declared, exhibited “everything I taught my children not to do in kindergarten.”But by announcing Wednesday that she will be voting for Trump after spending months skewering him as “unfit for office,” “unhinged,” “diminished” and a chaos agent, she proved what many Americans believe: You can’t trust politicians, especially Trump-supporting ones.By prioritizing career over country, Haley extinguished any hope that she might emerge as a party bulwark to an authoritarian regime if Trump is returned to the White House. She has squandered the little credibility she had left after raising her hand in a Republican debate when asked if she would support Trump as the party’s nominee even if he were a convicted felon.And she left us with the clearest window yet into her character. We now know she lacks the courage needed to lead a misdirected and fractured party, let alone a divided nation.Remember when Haley said, “I don’t put up with bullies?” She’s just told us she’s voting for one to lead the most powerful nation in the world. Remember when she ended her campaign in February without endorsing Trump and said, “I feel no need to kiss the ring.” She’s just left that ring with a nice big lipstick smudge. Remember when she told Trump to “earn the votes of those in our party and beyond who did not support him?” Trump never retreated from the policy issues on which she clashed with him — his opposition to support for Ukraine, his threat to let Putin attack NATO allies and his dehumanizing refusal to embrace a border deal.It didn’t matter.To the pundit class, whose cynicism runs deep about Haley because she became Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations after calling him a liar, her announcement Wednesday was no surprise.Haley can now spend the summer reminding Republicans of their tribal goal of uniting to achieve victory in November. She’ll undoubtedly draw a coveted spot at the Republican National Convention in July, where she may even win over the red-hatted hall of MAGA supporters.Haley outlasted a crowded field of rivals to survive as the last Trump alternative standing. Awash in cash and with an often-adoring media, she stayed in the race even as Trump racked up victories in the early states. Her decision so aggravated the former president that he reminded her and her voters why they despised him.He insulted her husband, Michael Haley, who has been deployed to Africa since June with the South Carolina Army National Guard. Michael Haley responded on X with a photo of a wolf. The caption on the image read: “The difference between humans and animals? Animals would never allow the dumbest ones to lead the pack.”People had forgotten what they didn’t like about Trump, and as Haley sharpened her attacks on his character and policies in the final weeks, she purposefully reminded us of how chaotic another Trump term would be.Even after ending her campaign, Haley continued to amass votes in Republican primaries, collecting more than 93 delegates to date. It may be just a fraction of the 2,229 collected by Trump, but it was enough to earn a respectable amount of attention at the convention this summer.If Haley sees her success in those primaries as a sign that she is still popular, she misinterprets the message. Those voters could have stayed home but cast a vote instead because they were protesting Trump. By embracing him and undermining her perfectly accurate critiques, she is saying “never mind” to all her supporters, leaving them nowhere to go.This is an opening President Joe Biden’s campaign should seize. They should seek orphaned Haley voters by embracing the argument former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan used in an op-ed this month: “Why I’m voting for Biden and other Republicans should, too.”Haley waited to announce her vote for Trump until almost every GOP primary was over. We now see it for the cynical move that it was. It allowed her supporters to hold out false hope that their protest vote might count for something when, privately, she was planning to break with them in the self-interest of advancing her career.The most shocking failure of our modern political era isn’t Trump’s inciting violence to prevent the peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 6. It has been the failure of his party to course correct away from authoritarianism. Haley had a chance to lead instead of follow. She wimped out and joined the growing list of cowards, including US Senators Marco Rubio, Mike Lee, Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, Ted Cruz, J.D. Vance, former US Attorney General Bill Barr and many more.They have chosen to promote a man who tried to overthrow American democracy. If Trump is reelected in November, he may finally succeed.

minnpost_2024_161,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.A Georgia Supreme Court incumbent has successfully fought off an election challenge from a former Democratic member of Congress. Justice Andrew Pinson, first appointed to the court by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022,won election to a six-year term on May 21, 2024. The nonpartisan race was dominated by challenger John Barrow’s attempt, as local newspaperThe Atlanta Journal Constitution described it, to turn it into “a referendum on abortion rights.”State supreme court raceshave become pivotalin current legal battles over issues includingabortion, elections, education, the environment and LGBTQ rights. With more than 80 state supreme court seatsup for election this yearin 33 states, voters have the potential to shape the future of their states for years to come.That is, if they actually get to choose who joins the court.Our research shows that in two states with judicial elections – Georgia and Minnesota – nearly every state supreme court justice steps down midterm, allowing the governor to appoint a successor instead of the state holding an open election for a new justice. This practice can at times place the governor at odds with the voters. It is also an incentive for governors, justices and other state officials to manipulate the process of judicial selection for partisan gain.The mechanics of selecting state supreme court justicesvary throughout the country.In the founding era,all states usedgubernatorial or legislative appointments to select justices.Elected judiciaries, including in Georgia and Minnesota, largely came about in the 1800sin response to concernsabout appointed judges serving the interests of the governors and legislators who appointed them instead of those of the people. Later innovations included the use of nominating commissions that recruit and vet candidates and retention elections in which voters are asked to vote “yes” or “no” in an uncontested election on whether a judge should remain in office.Today,21 statesinitially select supreme court justices through popular elections. Another26 statesselect justices through appointments, all with some form of check on the appointment power – either by means of a nominating commission, a confirmation vote by another elected body, or both.New Mexico usesa hybrid system in which the governor appoints justices who then run in partisan elections, while South Carolina and Virginia select justices via legislative elections.Georgia’s and Minnesota’s constitutions provide for nonpartisan elections to select and retain justices. Yet in practice, justices in both stateshave long been selectedprimarily through appointment by the governor.Since 1980, for instance, all but three of the 25 justices to jointhe Georgia Supreme Courtwere appointed rather than elected, as were all but one of the 30 justices to jointhe Minnesota Supreme Court. Eight of Georgia’s nine current justiceswere appointed, and all seven of Minnesota’s current justices were appointed.Continuing this tradition, two Minnesota justices this year arestepping down– one voluntarily, the other due to mandatory retirement. That allows Democratic-Farmer-Labor Gov. Tim Walz to appoint their replacements. Walz’sappointeesfirst face elections in 2026.Although appointees in Minnesota and Georgia face elections for subsequent terms, in practice, they stay until they choose to leave or face mandatory retirement. No incumbent Minnesota justice has lost an election since 1946, and no incumbent Georgia justice has lost an election in the court’s nearly 180-year history.This ability of appointees to prevail in elections is a key factor in the states’ high rates of appointments. In contrast, in states like Ohio where incumbents lose more frequently, or in the two states where appointees cannot run for subsequent terms – Louisiana and Arkansas – more justices reach the bench via elections.In addition to appointee win rates, manycomplex and interrelated factorsinfluence the rate of appointments in states with judicial elections, none of which fully explains the practice in Georgia or Minnesota.As noted, many other states initially select their justices through appointments,and some scholars and policymakers arguethat appointments are a better judicial selection method than elections.But the practice can place the governor at odds with voters. For example, in 1992, Alan Page overwhelmingly won election to the Minnesota Supreme Court,making historyas the first Black justice. Yet his win came only after two governors opposed his candidacy andsought to cancel electionsthat would havefeatured Page. Page successfully overcame the second governor’s effort and became the only justice since 1967 to be elected to the state’s high court.Another concern is that, unlike other states that require selection through appointment, both Georgia and Minnesota lack explicit checks on the governor’s interim appointment power. Neither state requires a confirmation vote for appointees. And while several governors in each state have convenednominating commissions, they arenot requiredto appoint someone the commission recommends.Furthermore, as scholar Stephen Ware has written, the use of a nominating commission “all or mostly appointed by the governorhardly serves as a check on the governor.”In reality, a similar concern is present even in some states that do have explicit limits on the governor’s appointment power. InFlorida, for example, the governor has consolidated power over the state’s nominating commission, reducing its effectiveness as a check.But it is notable that today no state has intentionally adopted a system of wholly unchecked gubernatorial appointment, like the de facto systems Georgia and Minnesota have implemented. This raises the question of whether Minnesota and Georgia voters would have adopted this system in their respective constitutions had they been asked.Such unconstrained power can also contribute to partisan gamesmanship. In 2020, Republican-appointed Justice Keith Blackwellresigned from the Georgia Supreme Court just before the end of his term, allowing Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to appoint his successor. The Republican secretary of state thencanceled the already-scheduled electionfor Blackwell’s seat, leading one commentator todescribe these eventsas a “scheme to keep Blackwell’s seat in the GOP’s hands.”As state supreme courts have the last word on an increasing number of high-profile disputes, this practice of substituting elections with appointments by a governor is increasingly consequential. Withheightened spendingon governors’ races aimed at influencing appointments to all levels of state courts, it is unclear whether other states will follow Georgia’s and Minnesota’s lead in moving to a de facto appointment system or, conversely, if they will maintain a greater role for the voice of the people.This story has been updated to reflect the election of Georgia Justice Andrew Pinson to a full term.Bryna Godar, Staff Attorney, State Democracy Research Initiative, University of Wisconsin Law School,University of Wisconsin-MadisonandHarry Isaiah Black, Staff Attorney, State Democracy Research Initiative, University of Wisconsin Law School,University of Wisconsin-MadisonThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

And if the AR-15 isn’t a firearm, then Crooks couldn’t be penalized for having one — even though he had no permit to carry it, and wouldn’t have been eligible to apply for a permit to carry a firearmuntil he was 21.The Pennsylvania Crimes Code was drafted in the 1970s, at a time when weapons like the AR-15 were only available in the military. The rifles that the “firearms” definition sought to exclude were long guns, used by hunters and target shooters, from the Pennsylvania backwoods to theOlympic Games. Because AR-15s also have a 16-inch barrel, they are also excluded from the definition of “firearms.”Butthe AR-15 is not a hunting rifle. The bullets move so fast and in such quick succession that they tear up deer and other game, making it impossible to eat. But the Pennsylvania legislature has done nothing to reclassify this gun despite its popularity —one in 20 adults in America now owns one.The AR-15 is not a hunting rifle.There are a couple of caveats, which should give readers small comfort. Semiautomatic rifles are defined as “firearms” under thestatute used to prosecute felonswho are found carrying guns. And, in Philadelphia,it is a misdemeanor to possess any gun, including any kind of rifle, without a license. But Philadelphia only accounts for 12% of the state’s population.It would be nice to think this loophole’s continued existence is merely an oversight. But that might be naive.Republicans, who have controlled the Pennsylvania legislature for decades,often rely on the National Rifle Association to fund their campaigns, making any increase in gun regulation a nonstarter. U.S. Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del. recently told the Washington Post that he believes protecting the AR-15 is “the number one priority of the gun lobby.” Some Republican lawmakers have taken to wearing miniAR-15s as lapel pins. In many ways, the AR-15 has become a powerful political symbol associated with the Republican Party, acultural touchstoneamong gun enthusiasts.Pennsylvania Republicans are all too happy to police handguns in Philadelphia, but they are not so eager when it comes tothe guns most commonly seen in rural, white communities.The attempted assassination of former President Trump presents an opportunity to address this indefensible hole in our gun laws. Let’s urge Pennsylvania lawmakers to revisit this strange exclusion, and stop ignoring these weapons. And if Republicans block these efforts, let’s make sure they pay for it at the ballot box in November.Dana Bazelon is the former policy director for Philadelphia District AttorneyLarry Krasner."

Not only did she discover she was allergic to shrimp, but she was told that she suffered from hypertension (high blood pressure . Her blood pressure was a shocking 210/120 and didn’t normalize after the crisis was past.•••WHAT IS BLOOD PRESSURE?A blood pressure cuff measures the pressure inside your arteries when the heart pumps blood throughout the body.When blood pressure is measured with a simple blood pressure cuff, the two values are written as the systolic pressure over the diastolic. For example, if you see a blood pressure value of around 125/85, the systolic pressure is 125 mmHg and the diastolic pressure is 85 mmHg.•••WHAT IS HEALTHY BLOOD PRESSURE?The American College of Cardiology established values for normal blood pressure in 2017 as follows:— An ideal blood pressure is anything less than 120/80.— Hypertension (high blood pressure involves consistent values of more than 130/80.•••SYMPTOMS OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSUREMalea’s trips to see her primary care physician in the coming weeks after the diagnosis were an education for her. She learned that most people have no symptoms of hypertension at the time of their diagnosis. Her doctor also told her that measuring blood pressure routinely is the only way to know if it’s a problem.While most people have no symptoms of hypertension, there are a few signs of extremely high blood pressure. These include severe headaches, nausea/vomiting, chest pains, blurry vision, anxiety, shortness of breath, dizziness, buzzing in the ears, confusion and nosebleeds. These symptoms are rare but generally indicate a serious blood pressure elevation.•••WHAT CAUSES HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE?Hypertension stems from several interrelated risk factors, some of which can’t be changed. Being over 65 years old, having family members with hypertension, and having diabetes or kidney disease are nonmodifiable risk factors for developing high blood pressure.Risk factors that can be changed include eating excessive amounts of salt, being obese or overweight, lacking in physical exercise, and eating foods high in saturated fat (like red meats and trans fats.Excessively high blood pressure can be extremely dangerous. Untreated hypertension can lead to kidney failure, strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.•••HOW IS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MANAGED?Many anti-hypertensive medications exist to manage high blood pressure, including those that act on the brain, heart, blood vessels and kidneys to lower the pressure in the arteries.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends several ways to manage high blood pressure at home, including stopping smoking, eating less than 1,500 mg of sodium-containing salt daily, reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating more fruits and vegetables.When you exercise, be sure to break a sweat for at least 150 minutes each week. Stress-reducing activities like yoga, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback can also help lower blood pressure.Despite being shocked by the diagnosis of hypertension, Malea was determined to manage her health by checking her blood pressure at home, exercising and watching her daily salt intake. She tracked her numbers daily and lost some weight. While she still takes medication for hypertension every day, she hopes to be able to control her high blood pressure through ongoing lifestyle changes.Christine Traxler is a physician at Alii Health Center, which was founded in 2007 with the mission to provide high-quality care to the West Hawaii community.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_266,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Vice President Kamala Harris has a golden opportunity to demonstrate she is ready to govern from the middle by frankly addressing her role in the Biden administration’s ineffective immigration policies. She should seize the moment before it slips away.In the whirlwind week when she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Harris failed to significantly speak to border issues, let alone reveal what her policies might be and how they may be different from President Joe Biden’s.Her public comments have centered more generally on her base and on preserving abortion rights, an issue that has played well with Democrats and moderates amid conservative overreach throughout the country.Because Harris didn’t have to debate immigration concerns with any primary opponents, she hasn’t been pressed to defend her record after Biden appointed her in 2021 to examine the root causes of the surge in migration from Central America.Meanwhile, Republican leaders from former President Donald Trump to Gov. Greg Abbott have been relentless in their criticism of Harris, repeatedly referring to her as Biden’s failed “border czar.” In a recent editorial, we adopted similar language, calling Harris the “immigration czar,” a term the Biden administration didn’t use despite giving her major strategic oversight.Harris might not have been a “czar,” and we regret adopting what has become unhelpful partisan language. But there is no question she had a key role centered on one of the administration’s most serious policy weaknesses.She shouldn’t wait for a debate with Trump to answer the criticism about her work. She should soon signal, strongly and directly, that even as the number of illegal crossings has fallen in the last few months, she understands that border security remains a serious problem, especially for Texas, and one that can’t be ignored.Harris missed a good chance to do just that on Thursday when she was in Houston and shared her vision for the future in addressing the American Federation of Teachers union. Why not make the easy trip from there to the border to announce renewed support for sweeping immigration reform and to show she understands that most Americans want a secure border?Last year we examined the root causes of migration in our series The Unraveling of Latin America, something that went much deeper than Harris’ 20-page strategic report on the same subject.We know that the U.S. approach to answering the immigration crisis must strike the right balance between border security measures and smart diplomacy with our southern neighbors. We’d like to hear more from Harris on how she’d do that. We would also like to see her acknowledge that the kind of hands off approach to border security Democrats have too often embraced is not acceptable.Harris must not shrink from the onslaught of criticism about the border. She must rise to it and demonstrate that she shares the nation’s concern about illegal immigration, toning down the GOP rhetoric and offering solutions with bipartisan appeal.— Dallas Morning NewsIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt."
suffolknewsherald_2024_13,"Published 4:46 pm Tuesday, July 16, 2024ByStaff ReportsWhile Comprehensive Plan stakeholders appreciate the efforts of city staff to elicit robust public comment during its update, the rush to get the most recent draft approved and the failure to provide full transparency of revisions belie those efforts as insincere.Granted, we have collectively been at this since March 2022, when the steering committee first met, and it is time to complete the task. City staff are justifiably proud of the more than 7,500 “discrete” comments they collected through online and paper surveys and multiple in-person events, but voices are left unheard.When Suffolk citizens received the first draft in February, they were unhappy with the tremendous expansion of the growth area and believed that lip service was being given to citizens’ desire to see Suffolk’s agricultural heritage preserved. Also concerning was the document’s failure to address the environmental, traffic, school, and infrastructure challenges of the growth it proposed and what the city was already experiencing.The draft was the focus of a rare joint Planning Commission/City Council work session on May 1. Several participants voiced their concerns that echoed those of citizens, letting city staff know that more work was needed and the growth area needed to be reduced.On June 18, city staff updated the Planning Commission on the revisions it had made in response to this commentary. Keith Cannady, Comprehensive Plan Manager, highlighted three “substantive” changes to the document, specifically on pages 50, 67, and 100, and “proposed” a schedule that had a Planning Commission public hearing and vote on July 16, an update to City Council on July 17, and a City Council public hearing and vote on August 17. The revised draft document was posted on the Comprehensive Plan website (https: suffolk2045.org/ the following day.Although we have not heard that the Mayor approved the “proposed” schedule, the public hearing for the Planning Commission on July 16 was announced on July 3.Particularly troubling is the lack of transparency in what changes have been made to the draft released in February, leaving stakeholders and our elected and appointed representatives in the dark. In response to our request for a document that shows all changes made to the original, Mr.Cannady reiterated that the only “substantive” changes were those highlighted on pages 50, 67, and 100. We have heard from city council representatives that they do not have an edited first draft either. A request for a printed copy for our organization, which was available for the February draft, was also denied.Nevertheless, concerned community groups have identified multiple changes that deserve scrutiny and public discussion. For example, an addition on page 68 proposes amending the city’s regulations so that “exceptional growth opportunities outside of the growth boundaries” can be reviewed and pursued. This may or may not be beneficial, but without public airing, it appears to be a way around a preference for more limited growth and preservation of agricultural land.Citizens want to know the financial impacts of ongoing and proposed growth, both pro and con, on the taxpayers who support it. This wasn’t in the original draft nor in the revision, so this new addition seems particularly troubling.Mayor Duman and City Council members should slow this process down and demand that we are provided full transparency on changes made to the original draft before this is put forward for a vote. Suffolkians have demonstrated they understand why the Comprehensive Plan is important, and they deserve an informed final say.We urge Suffolk citizens to contact your city council representatives to demand that we see all the changes, not just the one’s city staff want to highlight, and be provided time to thoroughly review them before a public hearing.

philinquirer_2024_51,"The city must learn from past mistakes, have the courage to tackle the root causes of Kensington s problems, and cocreate solutions with the community. Otherwise, we could be facing another danger.I have lived across the street from McPherson Square in Kensington for more than 20 years. I’ve also spent 25 years developing, evaluating, and implementing ideas of how to help my neighborhood, and have worked on almost every major problem it’s facing.In that time, I’ve seen the same thing happen over and over: When the neighborhood is in the spotlight, people in power enact plans to displace the unhoused, crime, and drug use taking place,without addressing the root problemsof poverty, disinvestment, and racism.So after a period of time — usually around five or six years — all the problems of Kensington return.Now, in 2024, with a new administration and new faces on City Council, we’re about to embark on a new cycle of ideas and proposals to “fix” Kensington.In recent weeks, the latest plans have begun to take shape, and include clearing unhoused encampments and arresting peopleusing drugs on the street.Some of these measures may temporarily displace the problems. But unless we can work together to find a plan to tackle the root causes of Kensington’s problems, in a few years we could be facing another danger brought on by new obstacles.It doesn’t have to be this way. The city has a chance to forge a new path if it can learn from its past mistakes.The last major attempt to “fix” Kensington came in April 2017, whenMehmet Oz visited the encampmentsat “El Campamento,” alongside the Conrail railroad tracks. There was an explosion of national attention on Kensington, and a few months later, thecamps were cleared out.But with no clear path toward solving the actual issues that led to the camps,many relocated to underpasses along Lehigh Avenue, to the El stop at Kensington and Allegheny Avenues, and to McPherson Square Park. The librarians at the McPherson Square Branch of the public library becametrained in administering the overdose antidote Narcan, exemplifying the intersections of suffering between children, families, and addiction. The situation for residents became even more untenable than ever, and over the next year, the city declared a citywide emergency and launchedmajor cleaning and policing efforts.These effortspledged to include resident input, so I reached out to the city’s managing director spearheading the effort to ask if I could assist. I also expressed my skepticism about the effort, born from years of witnessing countless programs and initiatives come and go in the area.He responded right away, saying the first two weeks were earmarked to work with the community to define what “fixing” Kensington should look like.Two weeks later, after the defined community engagement period had ended, without hearing from him again, I wrote back. “As I said in my original email I can only assume that the usual players have been engaged in a similar process to ones in the past so that similar results can be achieved. I will save this thread for 6-7 years from now when the next initiative is launched after the success of this one.”Here we are, exactly as I predicted: six to seven years later, attempting to recover from the failed efforts of 2017-2018, and about to launch a new effort.When it comes to Kensington, the new administration haspromised to succeed where those in the past have failed.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker has suggestedcutting nearly $1 million in fundingfor Prevention Point, an organization that provides sterile syringes to people who use drugs.City Council has enacted a curfew, and sentmore police and outreach workersto the neighborhood, informing people about housing and treatment options, and posting notices letting people know they plan to clear unhoused encampments.Many in our community are excited for these coming “successes” because we are all so exhausted and desperately deserve change. But these efforts will only reduce the chaos to a level that is less embarrassing for the city so national attention will dissipate.Without a greater plan, the community will return to its previous status: a poor, divested neighborhood quietly being mined for the resources that do exist here — particularly, real estate.What’s more, many of the newly proposed “solutions” to Kensington have been tried already.Yet, unlike in 2017 when Oz came to town, we face different challenges, which present new obstacles. They include:Development is firmly at the gates with gentrification from rising home and rental costs, increased property taxes, andnewly proposed incentives for private development along the El.Overdoses and deaths havedrastically risen for Black and brown Philadelphia residents and dropped for white residents.Thesymbolic dismantling of harm reduction(such as syringe exchange through government defunding will lead to privately funded efforts. With that may come less incentive or need to coordinate with the city or long-term residents. Without clear coordination with the community, there will be less say in where these resources are placed or how they operate.There is no clear plan for the impactdisplacing the unhoused populationwill have on other neighborhoods once displaced. Are other communities prepared to handle the pressures Kensington has been facing for decades?Without clear plans from the city, state, and federal governments that are cocreated with the community to identify resources for the long term, Kensington will be turned over to privatization and the free market, neither of which have ever been kind to people of color and those with limited means.As a consequence, Kensington residents already face another danger, which hasn’t been discussed nearly enough: displacement through gentrification.The last wave of “progress” in 2017-2018 sawmassive investment by prospectors and developers, who are now giddy with the opportunity of finally seeing their investments come to fruition.Any effort to “fix” Kensington should not just be about eliminating the drug economy or ending Kensington as a containment strategy for the city; it should be about preserving a community.While we are focused on what we will be told are the solutions to clearing the streets, we also should expect answers as to how theestimated $1 billion drug economy— which permeates all corners of the community — will be replaced, what the workforce development efforts will entail, how the improvements to education will look, and when the hundreds of millions of funding for housing stability will arrive.If none of these answers exist, the second stage of displacement — this time of long-term residents — is already underway.Without a greater plan that deals with thecore causes of how we got here in Kensington, after the initial “successes” fromcleaning,curfews, andpolicingare celebrated, the crime, drugs, and encampments — which relocated for a time — will return. And without a greater plan to address the long-term needs of residents that’s cocreated with the Kensington community, my neighbors and I could be cheering our own demise.But it doesn’t have to be this way. As plans are designed for Kensington, the city can — for the first time — connect its resources to atransparent, robust, and engaged community network.As a direct result of the failures of the past, a stronger civil society has emerged in Kensington. Decision-makers can plug into a participatory framework that centersmeaningful engagement and cocreation with the community. For the first time, the city can really work with us, rather than simplyinforming, placating, and, in the end, manipulating us as they have in the past.We also have an abundance of organizations that operate throughtrauma-informed frameworks. We have a police commissionerwho is well-versed and committed to these principles, a deputy police commissioner who is well-respected by the community, and a mayor espousing transparent community participation. What better time to make good on the promise that solutions to our most complex problems can be cocreated by those most impacted by the outcomes and that community participation is the engine that drives sustainable, positive change?I recently met with a newly appointed cabinet-level city official to discuss Kensington, and at the end of the meeting, they said: Please, just remember we just got here, so all I ask is for some grace.I reminded them that I am a resident now entering the fourth plan to “fix Kensington” over the last 20-plus years, amounting to an entire generation for this community. And each time a new plan arrives, someone asks me and my neighbors to please be patient and give them time and grace. I responded: If you accept my grace, you have to accept my advice.I think grace for advice is a fair deal for all residents who have been eager to participate in a cocreated process so we can sustainably address Kensington’s challenges, together.Bill McKinney is a Kensington resident and the executive director of New Kensington Community Development Corp."
minnpost_2024_116,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.My activism started in my living room. At that point, I was a registered nurse at the Estates for nearly 15 years, and change couldn’t come soon enough for me and my coworkers. We formed plans to organize a union, and the rest was history. Nine years later, we are 100 union members strong at my nursing home — and facing our next big challenge.I have never seen our industry in more crisis. Our pay and benefits can’t keep pace with the rising cost of living, and nursing home workers are leaving the industry in droves. More than 41% of Minnesota skilled nursing facilities are experiencing a staffing shortage,with that number only on the rise.The ripple effects of our staffing shortage are impossible to ignore and deeply felt. Without proper staffing, we need to limit admissions to our facility at a time when the demand is only growing. From a fiscal perspective, empty beds means less money to support the day-to-day operations of our work.Most importantly: A staffing crisis impacts the care we provide our residents. Consistency of care is so important in what we do. We see our residents in their most vulnerable states, from administering medication, to changing and feeding them, to making sure they are clean and cared for. Just like anyone receiving care, residents want and deserve to establish trust with the same care provider. Being short or understaffed deprives us of the meaningful connections we want with our residents — and creates anxiety and uncertainty for them and their loved ones.With the state’s senior population expected to skyrocket, policymakers could no longer ignore the crisis. That’s why last year, the first-in-the-nation Nursing Home Worker Standards Board (NHWSB was created to tackle our biggest challenges and to empower workers like me to have a say in their future. The NHWSB brings together workers, employers, and government to set workplace standards for the nursing home sector and address longstanding issues in our industry.In April, the NHWSB approved its first set of standards: a minimum wage fornursing home workers of at least $20.50 per hourand guaranteed overtime pay for the 11 state holidays that we must often work. For CNAs and LPNs, ourhourly minimum wage would climb to $24 and $28.50 per hour, respectively.These standards are not law just yet. Until July 24, thepublic can provide inputon these pay and holiday standards before they land in the final budget in August. Public comment periods may sound wonky or bureaucratic, but they let policymakers know how we feel about new reforms or laws before they become official.We need Minnesotans to weigh inon how the nursing home shortage is impacting them — and why these new standards would improve the lives of our aging seniors and their care providers.I am beyond proud of the work I do: providing compassionate care to those who need it most. I want to stay in this work for as long as I can. These new standards make that future possible for the many of us who are dedicated to the field.None of us enter this work for the paycheck. But it should be a little easier to make ends meet and support our own loved ones. The standards board levels the playing field for our industry, charting the path needed to create a resilient workforce that cares for those who need us most.Jared Mituga is an RN at The Estates and a member of SEIU Healthcare MN & IA."
philinquirer_2024_2,"All our fears about AI have come to roost in Gaza, as a report links Israel s Lavender program to mass killing of women, childrenThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas markedits grim six-month anniversaryon Sunday, and one of the most jarring things about this very 21st-century conflict has been the almost daily headlines about Israeli airstrikes obliterating the homes of notable Palestinians — sometimesknown Hamas operatives, but oftenjournalistsorphysiciansoraid workers. In many of these attacks, large numbers of family members,including young children, die under the rubble.In one of the war’s most notorious incidents, the prominent Palestinian poet and professorRefaat Alareer—so haunted by the daily devastation and the likelihood he and his own family would be targeted that in his final weeks he wrote a poem called “If I Must Die” — had sought refuge at a family home when an Israeli airstrike killed not only him but his brother, sister and four children.It’s a similar story for journalists in Gaza, whose death toll —at least 90 Palestinians, according to the conservative tally of the Committee to Protect Journalists — has exceeded any other modern conflict, in just half a year. Just two days after Alareer’s death in December, an Israeli airstrike on the home of reporter Ola Attallah killed not only herbut nine members of her family. That same week, Abdalhamid Abdelati, head of the Al Sawt Al Sha’b radio station, wasn’t home when an Israeli bomb struck, but his mother, brother, sister and four other family memberswere killed.This frequent death from above — in a war that has claimed the lives ofmore than 33,000 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children — has raised some uncomfortable questions about Israel’s conduct in the conflict. Just who are Israeli commanders targeting for these deadly strikes? And how are there targets selected?This week,an investigative reportfrom +972 Magazine and Local Call — led by independent, left-leaning Israeli journalists covering the region from Tel Aviv — offered some answers that are deeply disturbing, posing questions about the blurred lines between artificial intelligence and real morality that cut to the core of our basic humanity.The +972 Magazine report, which it confirmed in interviews with six Israeli intelligence officers, said an AI program known as “Lavender” has been used by the Israeli Defense Force to identify targets in Gaza since the start of the war on Oct. 7.The IDF has confirmedthat AI is used by its intelligence officers in guiding its tactics in Gaza, but the military and the magazine differed sharply on the issue of human involvement. IDF claims the computer-driven data is only advisory and that humans are still making the key decisions for targeting bombs, but the +972 report said human reviews of the AI targets were often “a rubber stamp” as brief as 20 seconds.The 20-second finding is deeply troubling, and yet arguably not the most bothersome disclosure in the magazine’s investigation. For one thing, our faith in computers is centered on the notion that advanced technology might reduce the fatal mistakes that occur during the fog of war, but +972 reported that Lavender’s error rate in targeting is still 10% — bombing someone with the same name as a Hamas member, for example, or even someone who just inherited a phone number.But even when Israeli intelligence, with the help of AI, pinpoints a target that it suspects of ties to Hamas — whichtriggered the warwhen it killed 1,200 Israelis in a surprise attack and which still holds 130 or so hostages — it faces a decision on the fate of civilians who might be in the home or nearby. In the early weeks of the war, +972 reported, Israeli commanders deemedit was OK to killas many as 15 or 20 innocent civilians for every low-level Hamas operative targeted, a number that rose to the hundreds for higher-level Hamas leaders.What’s more, the intelligence sources told +972 that alleged low-level Hamas operatives were targeted withso-called dumb bombs, less-precise weaponry that leads to more collateral killing, in order to save more expensive “smart bombs” for their higher-ups.In an earlier reportlast fall on Israel’s use of AI, a military source told +972: “When a 3-year-old girl is killed in a home in Gaza, it’s because someone in the army decided it wasn’t a big deal for her to be killed — that it was a price worth paying in order to hit another target.” The devolution from Biblical commandment in the Book of Exodus of “an eye-for-an-eye”justice to a 20-1 kill ratio is hard to fathom.Yet not as unfathomable as this: +972 also reported that the Lavender AI excelled at tracking its selected targets to their homes, where it was deemed an airstrike would be most successful. Of course, the target’s home is also where their wives, children and other family members would be killed in their sleep. Even worse, the AI was better at finding the target’s home than at determining if he was actually there. “It happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn’t even home,”one source told +972. “The result is that you killed a family for no reason.”The Orwellian name for this particular operation? “Where’s Daddy?”In one sense, the exposure of Israel’s Lavender program is the latest twist on a story that goes back hundreds of years — the use of new technologies not to better humankind but to destroy it. Think about themachine guns that made a mockeryof front-line warfare in World War I, the Nazis harnessingZyklon B gasfor their death camps, or America dropping atomic bombs on the civilians ofHiroshima and Nagasaki. But the rise of AI brings this to a troubling if inevitable level: The fantasy that we can escape moral culpability by assigning life-or-death decisions to a machine.» READ MORE:We interrupt this Super Bowl for a massacre | Will Bunch NewsletterIf nothing else, these disturbing stories coming out of Gaza should confirm that the rise of AI, and the decisions we have to make as a society about how to deploy it, is the issue that will come to define who we are in the 21st century. How can we make the most out of this remarkable technology — identifyingcures for diseases, for example — while avoiding the many pitfalls fromclassroom plagiarismtorising unemploymentas machines learn to perform human jobs?But are we even asking the right questions? The ultimate fear around AI has always been that the machinesbecome sentient, rise up, and overthrow humankind. It’s not wrong to worry about that dystopian scenario, but isn’t it just as bad when we abdicate our morality by farming out mass death to a computer program? Perhaps someday artificial intelligence will evolve to a higher state of consciousness, but right now Lavender is issuing death warrants for toddlers and their mothers because it reflects the inhumanity that we programmed it with.The +972 report happened to come out at a moment when Americans, including our leaders, may be more receptive to hearing it. We don’t yet know if AI played a role in Israel’s decision last week to target a convoy of aid workers for renowned chef Jose Andrés’ World Central Kitchen,killing seven people, including aCanadian American veteranof the war in Afghanistan. But the shocking incident has led even some of Israel’s staunchest allies in Congresslike former Speaker Nancy Pelosito call for restrictions on the massive flow of U.S. weapons, unless the bloodshed is reduced.Afterjust one phone callfrom a clearly angered President Joe Biden to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel approved a newfood corridorinto famine-stricken Gaza. That one small step for humanity also begged the questions of why Biden and U.S. officials didn’t use their leverage sooner, and why an attack on Western workers for politicians’ favorite Beltway chef provoked a response when the killing of innocent Palestinian babies did not?The reality — whether the fighting is with sticks and stones or cruise missiles guided by supercomputers — is that the horror of war always hinges on our tragic flaw to see some people as more human than others. Last week, former U.S. State Department official Aaron David Millertried to explainto the New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner why Biden had a more visceral reaction to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel than to its massive retaliation, even as the deaths of children mounted. “Do I think that Joe Biden has the same depth of feeling and empathy for the Palestinians of Gaza as he does for the Israelis?” Miller asked rhetorically. “No, he doesn’t, nor does he convey it. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that.”Whatever flaws exist in an AI program such as Lavender, the real computer bug is the lack of human love and understanding that we program it with, the ghost in the machine. Artificial intelligence won’t have the capacity to distinguish between a Hamas killer or an acclaimed poet or the baby in a crib nearby unless we input the values that cherish all innocent human life equally. It wasn’t AI that named a poorly discriminating murder program “Where’s Daddy?”; it was humans, who programmed it with a moral compass that is spinning out of control. Until we can rediscover our depth of feeling and empathy, war by computer is merely garbage in, garbage out.» READ MORE:SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_289,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°If you left the U.S. for a summer vacation, you may have encountered a strange and refreshing custom: not tipping. Or at least not tipping everyone in sight.Americans have long been among the world’s most profligate tippers. “We tip more occupations than any other country, and we tend to tip larger amounts than other countries,” says Michael Lynn, a professor of consumer behavior at Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration whose research focuses on tipping. “We’re kind of the tip-happiest country out there.”Just wait. American tipping culture is poised to get even more intense. In a rare case of bipartisan agreement, presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both advocate exempting tips from federal income taxes. It’s a popular stance with many potential voters, notably in Nevada, a swing state whose many casino, hotel and restaurant workers rely heavily on tips.The idea would be bad news for customers — and perhaps even for tipped workers themselves.Consumers are already weary of the way tip expectations have expanded since the pandemic. As people curbed their restaurant dining to avoid COVID-19, they increased the size of the tips they left. Meanwhile businesses gravitated toward machines for cashless, no-contact transactions.Soon tip jars that once collected loose change at cash registers morphed into touch screens suggesting significantly larger tip amounts. Restaurants without waiter service — and takeout coffee places — now come with pressure to tip.A Pew Research Center survey last November found that 72% of U.S. adults believe tipping is expected at more places than five years ago. You have to wonder how often the other 28% get out of the house.It’s all a bit much. In a February WalletHub survey, three out of four respondents said tipping has gotten out of control. Tipping isn’t just a financial burden. It creates psychological stress. Is a tip optional or expected? How much is enough? Am I a bad person if I say no?Excluding tips from federal income tax might simplify employer paperwork and erase the difference between easily tracked credit card charges and cash gratuities, which often go unreported. The exemption could also allow employers to pay lower (taxed wages, because workers would have the hope of keeping more (untaxed tips.All of those factors would encourage even more transactions to come with real or virtual tip jars. If your barista, tattoo artist and massage therapist get tips, why not the supermarket cashier, dental hygienist and plumber? Tipping in those situations might seem odd, even unseemly today, but tax-free income is hard to resist.Vice President Harris has specified that the exemption would apply to “service and hospitality workers,” but they aren’t the only people who currently receive tips. It’s hard to imagine those limits surviving the political pressure to include at least all tipped workers below a given income threshold.Either way, however, the proposal picks winners. To help all workers in low-paid jobs, presidential candidates might propose increasing the standard deduction or the earned income tax credit. That would be fairer. But the tip loophole isn’t about a general increase in take-home pay; it’s about winning votes in Nevada.Like the tax credits that oil companies get for blending ethanol with gasoline, thereby subsidizing demand for Iowa corn, making tips tax free offers big benefits to a concentrated group while spreading the costs over the general public. Nobody’s likely to vote against a candidate because they dread proliferating tip jars, but workers who make a lot of tips might vote for them.If either proposal came to pass, the revenue forgone by the Treasury would have to come from somewhere else. But that would be a “next year” problem, an unpleasant reality not destined to get much attention this fall or sway many votes in November.That’s why we see two fiercely opposed candidates rushing to agree on this harebrained scheme. We can only hope that they cancel each other out and that whoever is elected drops the idea."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_81,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°The numbers look grim for President Joe Biden and his party. Donald Trump, despite his criminal convictions, still leads the 2024 race by about a percentage point nationally and by significant margins in almost every battleground state. Biden’s approval rating has been underwater since 2021 and hasn’t topped 40% in nine months. Democratic Party activists report a “full-blown freakout.”Of course, the polls may be wrong. Trump might still self-destruct (or indeed go to jail . Voters aren’t yet paying full attention. Things can change. But with just five months until the election, alarm bells should be ringing. The president needs to change course if he wants a second term.Emphasizing things people care about would be a good start. Biden’s advisers reportedly want to keep the electorate focused on the attacks of Jan. 6 and related issues. But such issues barely register in most polls of voters’ top priorities and, disturbing as this might be, the country is about evenly split on which candidate is a bigger threat to democracy.Where, then, should the focus be? Voters consistently say illegal immigration is a top concern. Yet Biden has failed to establish a coherent approach. After dismantling his predecessor’s policies, he was slow to take meaningful action as a record-setting surge of undocumented migrants arrived in American cities and Republicans made hay. Now he’s about 30 percentage points underwater on an issue that could prove decisive in November.This month, the president issued executive orders that, in effect, ban asylum seekers who’ve crossed the border illegally. But this move was late, limited and will be challenged in the courts. Biden needs to step up enforcement and curb the incentives for illegal entry. Blaming the opposition won’t work. Voters know where the buck stops.The same goes for voters’ other top priority, the economy. Biden deserves credit for presiding over a post-pandemic soft landing, with inflation slowing, wages rising and job growth holding up. But voters aren’t happy, and they dislike being told to snap out of it. Biden trails Trump by nearly 20 percentage points on the economy, while almost two-thirds of voters disapprove of his efforts to reduce inflation. Working-class voters — in particular, Blacks and Hispanics — are deserting him in significant numbers, mostly citing the cost of living.Biden’s policies fail to confront the problem, and too many of them risk compounding it. His ill-considered tariffs will impede competition and tax American consumers. His $1 trillion effort to forgive student-loan debt is regressive. He should stop subsidizing housing demand while raising the cost of new supply. He should ease the federal contracting and procurement rules that raise construction costs. He should limit his blitz of new regulations. And he should moderate his endless concessions to labor unions, which help a minority of voters at the expense of the majority.The president can’t keep doing what he’s doing and expect a different result. He can’t campaign from the basement, as he did during the COVID chaos of 2020. He can’t keep turning down interviews. He needs a vision for the next four years that would broaden his appeal beyond his current base of lukewarm supporters. If he doesn’t change, the election will be Trump’s to lose.— Bloomberg Opinion/TNSWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
minnpost_2024_85,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.One of the most robust measures of Earth’s changing climate is that winter is warming more quickly than other seasons. The cascade of changes it brings, including ice storms and rain in regions that were once reliably below freezing, are symptoms of what I call “warming winter syndrome.”Wintertime warming represents the global accumulation of heat. During winter, direct heat from the Sun is weak, but storms andshifts in the jet stream bring warm airup from more southern latitudes into the northern U.S. and Canada. Asglobal temperaturesandthe oceans warm, that stored heat has an influence on both temperature and precipitation.The warming is evident in changes to growing seasons, reflected in recent updates to plant hardiness zones printed on theback of seed packages. These maps show the northward and, sometimes, westward movement of freezing temperatures in eastern North America.Istudy the impact of global warmingand have documented changes to the climate and weather over the decades.On average,freezing temperatures are movingnorthward and, along the Atlantic coast, toward the interior of the continent. For individual storms, the transition to freezing temperatures even in the dead of winter can now be as far north as Lake Superior and southern Canada in places where, 50 years ago, it was reliably below freezing from early December through February.The character of snow also changes near the freezing line. When the temperature is well below freezing, the snow is dry and fluffy. Near freezing, snow has big, wet, heavy flakes that turn roads into slush and stick on tree branches and bring down power lines.Because the climate in which snowstorms are forming is warmer due to global accumulation of heat, and wetter because of more evaporation and warmer air that can hold more moisture, individual snowstorms can also result inmore intense snowfalls. However, as temperatures get warmer in the future, the scales will tilt toward rain, and thetotal amount of snowwill decrease.For communities, planning for water supplies and extreme weather gets more complicated in a rapidly changing climate. Planners can’t count on the weather 30 years in the future being the same as weather today. It’s changing too quickly.In many places, snow will not persist as late into spring. In regions like California and the Rockies that rely on the snowpack for water through the year, those supplies willbecome less reliable.Rain falling on snowpack can also speed up melting, trigger flooding and change the flows of creeks and rivers. This shows up in changingrunoff patterns in the Great Lakes, and it led toflooding on the East Coastin January 2024.For road planners, the rate of freeze-thaw cycles that can damage roads will increase during winters in many regions unaccustomed to such quick shifts.An especially interesting effect happens in the Great Lakes. Already, theGreat Lakes do not freeze as earlyor as completely as in the past. This has large effects on the famous lake-effect precipitation zones.With the lakes not frozen, more water evaporates into the atmosphere. In places where the wintertime air temperature is still below freezing,lake-effect snow is increasing. The Buffalo, New York, region saw6 feet of snowfrom one lake-effect storm in 2022. As the air temperature flirts with the freezing line, these events are more likely to be rain and ice than snow.These changesdon’t mean cold is gone for good. There will be occasions when Arctic air dips down into the U.S. Thiscan cause flash freezingand fog when warm wet air surges back over the frozen surface.What we are experiencing in warming winter syndrome is a consistent and robust set of symptoms on a fevered planet.Novembers and Decembers will be milder; Februarys and Marches will be more like spring. Wintry weather will become more concentrated around January. There will be unfamiliar variability with snow, ice and rain. Some people may say these changes are great; there is less snow to shovel and heating bills are down.But on the other side,whole economies are set up for wintertime, manycrops rely on cool winter temperatures, and many farmers rely on freezing weather to control pests. Anytime there are changes to temperature and water, theconditions in which plants and animals thrive are altered.These changes, which affectoutdoor sports and recreation,commercial fisheriesand agriculture,have enormous consequencesnot only to the ecosystems but also to our relationship to them. In some instances, traditions will be lost, such as ice fishing. Overall, people just about everywhere will have to adapt.Richard B.

Your family can be amazed by the majesty of the Northern Lights. It can see the twinkling stars of a constellation, the bright haze of the Milky Way galaxy with its billions of stars, and the comets of the Perseid meteor shower streaking across the night sky.Approaching storms with dazzling lighting have an awesome majesty of their own.Then it is all ruined.Blinking lights from a cell tower or a dozen windmills now intrude. Massive powerlines trail their lights across your view. Fields of native grasses and wildflowers are replaced with solar arrays.With increasing frequency, we are seeing windmill towers, 5G cell towers, and solar fields dot the rural landscape. Progress you may say. It happens for the greater good. But we must consider whether our counties can do more to mitigate the intrusion of these green energy producers.Minnesota currently leads the U.S. by producing 33% of its electricity from wind and solar sources. That is 10% above the national average. It is imperative we produce more renewable energy in Minnesota and the nation to ensure future generations don’t suffer the severe consequences of a rapidly warming climate.It is beyond denial today that our planet is getting hotter rapidly, and our consumption of fossil fuels is the cause.“It’s official: 2023 was the planet’s warmest year on record, according to an analysis by scientists from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information,” the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in January. “Along with the historic heat, Antarctic sea ice coverage dropped to a record low in 2023.“The findings are astounding,” NOAA Chief Scientist Dr. Sarah Kapnick said. “Not only was 2023 the warmest year in NOAA’s 174-year climate record — it was the warmest by far. A warming planet means we need to be prepared for the impacts of climate change that are happening here and now, like extreme weather events that become both more frequent and severe.”Just this last week more bad news for the climate was published.“Atmospheric levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide aren’t just on their way to yet another record high this year — they’re rising faster than ever, according to the latest in a 66-year-long series of observations,” Scott Dance writes in an article for The Washington Post. The observations come from Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.It could take 200 years for CO2 levels to drop back to a level where they were driving climate change even if emissions levels fell to zero now, he writes. This challenge is going to affect generations of our descendants with increasing climate disasters and political upheaval caused by parts of the world becoming uninhabitable. Climate refugees will stream into already crowded areas seeking water and food. We will deplete our aquifers even faster as crops demand more water as temperatures rise.Biodiversity that sustains world ecosystems will collapse, threatening the world’s food supply.“With Minnesota’s drive to reach 100% clean energy by 2040, the state is leading the nation in delivering the benefits of an equitable clean energy future for all — from reducing pollution and improving quality of life to creating jobs and economic prosperity for more Minnesotans,” Sarah Christiansen, Director of the McKnight Foundation’s Midwest Climate & Energy program, is quoted on the Clean Energy Economy MN website.Rural quality of life must also be a consideration in the planning and siting of these green energy projects.Minnesota’s Legislature has been considering ways in which it can reform permitting rules to speed the state’s path toward its 2040 goal of being 100% carbon free.But we would be wary of how it would make permitting “faster and cheaper.” What will be the consequences of such actions on rural Minnesotans?Young people are becoming more active in seeking action from legislative leaders on climate concerns. This past February, dozens of high school and college students met with state legislators. Part of Youth Environmental Activists (YEA! at the organization Climate Generation, they want more education on “air quality, ecosystems, biodiversity and land and water in Earth and environmental science classes,” a story by the Associated Press’s Alexa St. John and Doug Glass earlier this month said.Their voice will be stronger and more influential in elections in the coming years.We know that metropolitan corporations see our concerns as a nuisance as they seek to build future revenues. Our job is to ensure we protect our natural resources and among them, our skies free of manmade eyesores.An absentee landowner, even some local landowners, won’t consider the impact of blinking lights in the night sky, the noise of wind turbines, or blemishes on rural landscapes. They’ll take the revenue and have others suffer the environmental consequences.Good neighbor provisions in county ordinances should see that if a landowner signs a contract for the placement of windmill or cell phone towers on their property, they be located near that landowner’s homestead, not placed at the edges next to a neighbor.We must protect our county residents against the cost of decommissioning large green energy projects if their investors walk away.We are going to see an increasing number of requests for large solar energy arrays across the rural landscape, along with not just one or two wind towers but dozens.As corporations review local ordinances governing the placement of wind towers, solar fields, and cell phone towers, their attorneys will study them to inform their siting strategy. Ordinances that don’t spell out their obligations will see projects shaped to benefit corporations, not rural residents. We must ensure the impact on wildlife is taken into consideration.Now is the time to amend local ordinances to protect rural residents and the natural beauty of rural Minnesota.Reed Anfinson is the publisher of The Swift County Monitor-News, where this column originally appeared."

In response, wealthy nations must do everything possible to stop the disease’s spread.Mpox, formerly known as the monkeypox virus, made the news in 2022 when a global outbreak, including in the United States, prompted a public health emergency. But by May 2023, cases in wealthy nations had receded, largely because of vaccination drives and behavior change among those most at risk of contracting the virus. The WHO ended that mpox emergency.But the virus hadn’t disappeared, and it’s now back on the rise, potentially with a vengeance.The mpox virus has two types: a much deadlier Clade I and a less severe Clade II. In 2022, the United States experienced an outbreak of Clade II. But lacking support for eradication efforts, including vaccination drives, Clade II simmered in African countries. Worse, Clade I — estimated to have a 3% to 6% fatality rate — also spread, though it was confined to the war-torn Congo. Despite all the global attention heaped on this disease at the time, African countries never received enough vaccines or sufficient support to eradicate the virus.Now, Clade I cases are sharply on the rise in Congo, where the disease has claimed the lives more than 1,000 people, most of them children. It has reached more urban areas. Cases have begun to pop up in other African countries, including Burundi, Kenya and Uganda.So far, wealthy nations have failed to send enough vaccines to counter the disease’s quick spread. The African Union’s health agency has said it has only about 200,000 mpox vaccine doses available out of the 10 million needed. Global vaccine alliance GAVI told Reuters it needs $84 million to respond in areas at most risk, but it has raised only $8 million.But providing vaccines alone is not enough. In Congo, stigma, regulatory obstacles and other crises — including measles and cholera outbreaks — have made a coordinated response difficult. The country finally approved two mpox vaccines just a few weeks ago, Reuters reported, but it has only about 65,000 vaccines available in the short term (for a population of about 100 million people , and vaccination campaigns appear unlikely to begin before October. Comprehensive international support may be the only thing that could beat back the disease.Will we get it right this time around? If not, the United States and the rest of the world may get an unfortunate shot at a Round 2 of the virus too, perhaps in its much deadlier form.This article originally appeared inThe New York Times.© 2024 The New York Times Company"

They are desperate to control the U.S. and consider us their lapdog.Some political analysts believe the electorate is stupid and can be easily swayed. Fortunately or unfortunately, they may be half right, but which half is difficult to tell.For many years, it was said the United States of America had the best government money could buy, but now quality has been replaced with what a former classmate called flamboyant mediocrity.Foreign nations are trying to buy their way into our federal government. One nation doesn’t want anybody saying anything bad about them, so they drafted legislation which, if passed, Americans could be arrested for “defaming” that country.

In this hearing, it was brought to the attention of the generals and the audience that China is building a deep water port in Peru, which is due to be done this November. This will be the first Latin American port controlled by China.In the Northern Hemisphere, Russia and China appear to outnumber the US with particular Ice-breaking vessels, declaring that our transportation is hindered in that maritime region. It appears that our enemies are surrounding us and establishing infrastructure in our region.With the recent cargo vessel situation in the Baltimore harbor, which is currently under investigation, we may be under attack and in the early stages of a homeland war. This is not a political matter; this is a national security matter and must be communicated that way, or we may allow our enemies to divide us with information warfare.“A house divided against itself cannot stand,” declared Abraham Lincoln at the Republican State Convention, echoing the words of Jesus Christ.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_227,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°About two and a half years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the latter has turned the tables with an incursion into the Russian region of Kursk — once the site of a pivotal WWII battle — that by some estimates has left it with control of more than 1,000 square kilometers.While both countries have now taken territory, there is no equivalence at all: Russia’s attack on Ukraine was wholly unprovoked, whereas Ukraine’s incursion is in direct response to Russia’s attempted subjugation. Russia is in Ukraine’s territory because it intends to annex it as part of some misguided imperial project, forcing full assimilation or else.Ukraine has no intention of annexing Russia’s territory, but instead under President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking to temporarily hold it as leverage over the much larger aggressor, having realized that Russian President Vladimir Putin can keep throwing troops at the conflict and won’t be easily dissuaded without more acute consequences. The Ukrainian troops have targeted Russian forces and caused some Russian civilians to flee, but are not engaged in a wide campaign of terror, morale-breaking and war crimes, as their Russian counterparts have been credibly accused of doing during their invasion.Putin wanted war, he’s getting war. He believed his “special military operation” would have his troops marching into Kyiv within the week and Zelenskyy would fold, and he was dead wrong. These are the consequences; the despot has no ground to stand on to cry foul.Let’s hope that Zelenskyy and his military leadership has gamed out the impact on all the front lines, as this offensive, tactically sound as it might be in its objectives, should not come at the cost of losing ground to Russian advances elsewhere.It’s worth bearing in mind that an offensive of this type, against a far bigger adversary, is only possible because of support from the United States, NATO and other allies.Everything from the Ukrainians’ small arms to drones to artillery ammunition depends in large part on this aid, which is what sustains their ability to keep Russia at bay and strike back. Without these commitments, Ukraine would have certainly lost this war already, and we would all be worse off and less secure because of it.Whatever historic claims to Ukraine Putin claims to have, it’s obvious that this flimsy rationalization would not stop him from looking further afield. He’s always hated the notion of a European mutual-defense pact, and attacked Ukraine in part to stick it to NATO. What’s to stop him from continuing on this project if he were to succeed with Ukraine?If anything, he’d be far more emboldened, though would have a diminished military with which to actually pursue these ends; despite his projected attributes, though, the man is clearly not all too strategic.The tides of the war have appeared to have shifted enough that no one can say with any measure of certainty how things are going to go. This Ukrainian taking of Russian territory certainly marks a shift, both in momentum and strategy.How significant, we’ll have to see, but one thing is for sure: Ukraine needs us and its other allies, and is proving that it can effectively use the tools we give it.

philinquirer_2024_10,"Arresting people who commit crimes is only the beginning of the city’s responsibilities to its citizens.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker has put public safety at the top of her agenda as Philadelphia’s new mayor, declaring apublic safety emergencyand vowing “to restore a sense of lawfulness in the city” inher 100-day action plan. But we are still waiting to hear her proposals for the part of the city with arguably the highest concentration of lawlessness: the sprawling jail complex on State Road.The public safety emergency that exists for both incarcerated people and staff in Philadelphia’s jails should be clear from the brutal litany of headlines in the first month of Parker’s term. Most recently, 59-year-old Mike Osborne was murdered after a much younger man,who prison officials knew to be violent, was placed in his cell.Hours earlier, a 70-year-old man who had been locked in a cell with a 32-year-old was taken to the hospital after a fight. And just days before those attacks,two incarcerated men were stabbed in a fight, with one being hospitalized for wounds to his head and neck. Those incidents fit into a grim pattern in city jails: During a one-year period ending in September, people in the custody of the Philadelphia Department of Prisons took about 100 trips to the emergency room per month.Since 2020, at least seven people have beenmurdered in Philadelphia’s jails. To put that number in context, before that, there had been no homicides in the jails forabout three years. If we are to bring back respect for the rule of law, can we allow this barbaric reality to be the status quo in what is supposed to be our most heavily supervised and secure environment?What is less obvious, but no less real, is how the safety crisis behind bars affects those of us on the outside. It’s not only threats like those posed by the four people who escaped from confinement on State Road last year, including a man charged with four homicides whose flight with a fellow incarcerated personwent undetected for 19 hours.Far more significant are the potential long-term consequences of the trauma endured by incarcerated people when they eventually return home, as nearly every one of them will. On any given day, more than 40 people are discharged from the jails back into the community. Some will leave with symptoms ofpost-traumatic stress disorderthat make it difficult to readjust to society.As a court-appointed monitor put it in herlatest reporton efforts to address unconstitutional conditions in the jails, “the trauma experienced by incarcerated people is profound and clearly observable to all who work in, enter, or reside in PDP facilities. Exposure to extended periods of isolation, institutional violence, squalor, and neglect breach all standards for humane confinement and is certain to have lifelong effects for many.”Parker has yet to say how she will address the systemic issues underlying the public safety emergency in jails, from the growing shortage of corrections officers to the stubbornly high jail population. By Prisons Commissioner Blanche Carney’s own admission, at current staffing levels, the jail population would need to be reduced from4,500to3,500 to adequately ensurethe safety of incarcerated people and staff.Instead, the mayor’s rhetoric and policies lean heavily on “tough-on-crime” strategies that threaten to swell the overcrowded jails further. At the same time, the jails are admitting people from other counties, including the man the authorities said killed Osborne.Parker’s first order of business should be to hire a new prisons commissioner with a bold, actionable plan to address the crisis in the city’s jails. Such a plan should include urgent measures to recruit and retain more corrections officers while using existing resources to ensure people in custody are kept safe — as well as working with the courts, and other agencies, to reduce the jail population.Increased oversight of the jails is also needed to hold our leaders accountable for change. Instead of relying on the failed policies of the past, Parker should offer her full-throated support to legislation in City Council for an amendment to the City Charter to create a new jail oversight board with real teeth.The mayor should also task justice system stakeholders with decreasing the jail population by at least 500 people, which would permit the jail to reduce its use of the Detention Center and reassign staff to the jails experiencing the most severe personnel shortages, easing many safety concerns. The Detention Center is an old, decrepit facility without air-conditioning and has the smallest population among the city’s four jails.Parker’s vision for a safer Philadelphia must take a more holistic view of criminal justice, one in which arresting people who commit crimes is only the beginning, and not the end, of the city’s responsibilities to its citizens.Claire Shubik-Richards is the executive director of thePennsylvania Prison Society.

minnpost_2024_157,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The 1,400-page plus omnibus bill that the Minnesota Legislature passed in the closing days of the session is likely unconstitutional. The reason is that it violated the single subject rule of the Minnesota Constitution.Article four, section 17of the Constitution declares “that no law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.” This clause refers to the single subject rule, which is similar across other state constitutions in the United States. The single subject clauses were adopted in the 19th century; the purpose of them was to address what some people call legislative mischief. Specifically, they were meant to address situations where legislation was jammed together in one bill, forcing individuals to vote for provisions in the bill that they might not otherwise support because they wanted other provisions.The single subject rule is in many ways ananti-logrolling measure. But it is more than that. It is as the Minnesota Supreme Court said in the leading case on this clause,Associated Builders v. Ventura, that the purpose of the clause is to address mischief and abuses of legislative power and to make it possible for the public to know what the Legislature is doing by forcing legislation to conform to its title and not use trickery to hide or embed legislation under some generic or vague title. It is all about transparency and openness in government and to prevent corruption.If we look at what was contained in this big omnibus tax bill, it perfectly fits the description of what the single subject rule was meant to prevent. It calls for the creation of new State Patrol headquarters; for health plans to cover abortion; and to regulate straw purchases and binary triggers with guns. It addresses traffic light cameras, motorcycles, and a host of other revenue and policy provisions. These are hardly topics that address a single subject.The Democrats in the House, by their own admission, put all these provisions together out of frustration that the Republicans were slowing down the process. The Democrats wanted to short circuit Republican debate. They jammed all these provisions together in an effort to get it passed and to do so quickly as the clock was running out in the session.The DFL justifies this action to overcome or counter Republican dilatory tactics. For some, the argument would be that were the Republicans in the same position they would have done the same thing. Perhaps they would have, but that does not make what the Democrats did correct or constitutional.It may be about power politics. It may be all about winner-take-all politics. But it’s certainly not good legislating. It also sets up for the Republicans to do exactly the same thing if and when they eventually take control again. It sets bad precedent and does nothing to dampen the inflamed polarization of politics in Minnesota. All of these reasons are the reasons why single subject rules were adapted.In Associated Builders versus Ventura, the Minnesota Supreme Court debated what to do when there’s a violation of a single subject clause. One argument would be just to excise off a topic that was not related to the title. Justice Paul Anderson argued, instead, that the court should invalidate everything that was in the bill. It is not the job of the court to pick and choose what is the main versus ancillary subject. Moreover, by allowing some of the provisions to become law it still rewarded the Legislature for its bad behavior. Voiding the entire statute would send the appropriate signal to the Legislature that it needs to adhere to this constitutional provision.Since the Associated Builders case, the Minnesota Supreme Court has not vigorously enforced the single subject rule. However, if there was ever a case or a situation where the court should do so, this is the one. Should someone challenge this 1,400-page legislation, past precedent suggests this law is unconstitutional. However, one wonders if a majority-appointed Minnesota Supreme Court would enforce such a rule against a DFL-controlled Legislature.David Schultz is a distinguished professor at Hamline University.

minnpost_2024_100,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Staring straight at the camera, with a grave expression on his face, the president uttered these famous words: “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president.”Lyndon Johnson made that announcement at the end of his nationally televised address on the Vietnam War on March 31, 1968. Those words now echo loudly, as pundits recall them in the wake of Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election.Like Biden, Johnson was a sitting Democratic president who was eligible for another term. Both men understood the odds against reelection, and both opted out. Their decisions shape their legacies as presidents who compiled impressive records yet failed to sustain their power across a longer span.As the author of “The Men and the Moment,” a short narrative history of the presidential election of 1968, I have reflected on these parallels, too. But I think we can learn more from the differences in the circumstances of Biden’s and Johnson’s withdrawals. They illustrate the high hurdles that thepresumed Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, now must clear, while also sounding a note of hope for the Democratic Party.One important distinction between Johnson and Biden was the nature and timing of their decisions.Johnson arrived at his decision not to run for a second full term on his own, five months before the Democratic National Convention. It surprised everyone. No one expected this larger-than-life president – the force behind a massive slate of liberal government programs known as theGreat Society,as well as the escalation of the Vietnam War – to voluntarily give up power.But Johnson suffered as communist forces launched theTet Offensiveagainst U.S. troops in Vietnam. At home, critics on both the right and left blasted him. He realized that he could no longer forge a consensus in Congress. He rationalized that he could serve his final year in office by crafting peace in Vietnam.That choice allowed other candidates to compete for delegates, from his loyal vice president,Hubert Humphrey, to anti-war senatorsEugene McCarthyandRobert F. Kennedy.Biden, by contrast, renounced his nomination well after the primaries and just one month before the convention. Moreover, he succumbed to external pressure from donors and party leaders to leave the race, stemming fromhis disastrous performance in the June 27, 2024, debate.Biden’s prolonged candidacy appears to have dictated that the party anoint Harris as his successor. Can she craft a message that resonates with voters? Can she win their trust and respect?Running in the primaries would have provided answers. Instead, for now, those questions linger.Another divergence between 1968 and 2024 was the process of delegate selection.In 1968, only a handful of states had binding primaries, where all delegates pledged their vote to the election’s winner. It wasmore common for party insiders to choose delegatesthroughstate conventions and other bureaucratic means.Humphrey campaigned through the spring and summer of 1968, but he avoided primary elections. McCarthy and Kennedy battled in those primaries, each trying to claim the mantle of the popular anti-war challenger. ThenKennedy was assassinatedin June, and McCarthy failed to rally a viable coalition. Humphrey captured the nomination by winning the support of most Democratic officials.By the next election cycle, the party had enacted reforms for choosing delegates,including open primaries and caucuses. That system remains in place now.Yet this year’s extraordinary turn of events means that Harris has bypassed that system. Unlike Humphrey, she has to overcome voters’ doubts about whether she is the genuine preferred candidate of the Democratic Party.If these distinctions from 1968 illustrate the obstacles before Harris, a final difference suggests one of her greatest assets: She has the support ofalmost the entire Democratic Party,including the sitting president.Humphrey could not say the same. His own president kept hanging him out to dry.To attract voters seeking change, Humphrey needed to articulate his own position on the Vietnam War, but Johnson was unwilling to make concessions as a prelude to peace.He bullied Humphreyinto supporting his tough stance, which included a reluctance to halt bombings in North Vietnam.Johnson didn’t respect Humphrey. Early in the race,LBJ privately beseeched Republican Nelson Rockefeller to run. By the general election, Johnson seemed more politically aligned withRepublican nominee Richard Nixonthan with his own vice president.Vietnam was cleaving the party, and Humphrey could not heal the wounds. Finally, at the very end of September, Humphrey cast his independent stance on the war, pledging to halt the bombing of North Vietnam“as an acceptable risk for peace.”But it was too little, too late.McCarthy, his fellow Minnesotan, offeredthe limpest of endorsements, and not until one week before Election Day. In the end, Humphrey could not unite Democratic voters, and Nixon triumphed.Now, for all the ideological differences among prominent Democrats, the party looks unified in its ambition to negate the threat they see in Donald Trump. Biden will almost certainly exhibit more political generosity than Johnson.In addressing the monumental task of a late presidential run against the polarizing figure of Trump, Harris faces challenges that are unique in American political history. If she can overcome them, she might avoid the fate of Humphrey.Aram Goudsouzianis theBizot Family Professor of History at the University of Memphis.This article is republished from The Conversation."
philinquirer_2024_47,"In Philadelphia, people in wealthy areas live 18 years longer than those in poorer areas. Community care can close that gap.There’s a lot to love about Philadelphia — our culture, people, and sports. However, there are times when it’s hard to fully appreciate all the city has to offer knowing it is ranked as one of theworst in the country for health outcomes.For instance, compared to other large cities, Philadelphia has higher rates of premature death (including among children , diabetes, HIV, and frequent mental and physical problems.Those Philadelphians who are most impacted by our city’s health disparities are Black men, women, and children who don’t have the privilege of living in communities that have adequate access to quality health care — this, despite making upclose to half of the city’s population. The result is appalling: the average life expectancy in most Black and Latino areas such as Nicetown/Tioga is18 years shorterthan in majority-white areas such as Center City.We suspect that at least part of the explanation for that wide range in lifespan between neighborhoods is that Black Philadelphians aremore than twice as likelyas their white counterparts to be hospitalized for conditions that could be prevented with primary care. That doesn’t mean that Black Philadelphians don’t prioritize their health; in fact, when we engage in the Black community, it’s clear to us that the opposite is true. They just have less access to it.» READ MORE:Don’t use Colin Powell’s death to bolster anti-vaccine sentiments | OpinionIn Philadelphia, neighborhoods with more Black residents havefewer or no accessible health care centers or providerswho can offer screenings, vaccinations, and thorough education, prevention, and treatment for conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and maternal health conditions, with both patience and empathy.These disparities come at a tremendous cost to our economy and — most importantly — to the many Black children and adults in Philadelphia. We deserve better.To bridge the health-care gap and create positive health outcomes, quality care must be more accessible. But these neighborhoods need more than just health clinics — these centers mustprovide care that is culturally sensitiveand integrated into our city’s Black communities. Because trust starts from within communities, a place of comfort and familiarity that we must place at the heart of care delivery. With many hospitals and academic institutions not reflective of our community, these localized centers are a crucial bridge.Notably, last year, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health released itsfive-year plan for addressing Health and Racial Equity. A key tenet of this plan is community engagement.How can we effectively engage and mobilize a community-based approach? To create an enduring solution that actually serves Philadelphia’s residents of color, the city must develop a three-pronged approach.First, to build on the department’s plan, we must identify the specific health resource gaps a community is facing. This requires an integrated and intentional strategy that brings together multiple stakeholders, including health-care providers and community members and organizations.For instance, North Philly’sCenter for Health Equity, which was founded by one of us (Ala Stanford , isin the heart of the community— near a high school, a church, and residential housing. What’s more, most providers look like the patients they serve and provide holistic, compassionate care regardless of their ability to pay. In addition, they have implemented a model of care that encourages involvement from all community members: educators, coaches, and faith leaders assist residents of all ages with scheduling and obtaining preventive care, working side by side with nurses and doctors.While not in Philadelphia, there are similar efforts underway in other regions such asMary’s Center, which has served 65,000 people in the Washington metro area for 35 years. The center integrates health care, education, and social services to offer individualized care.Second, we must invest inbuilding a more diverse health-care workforceinclusive of community members and local leaders. We should focus our efforts on recruiting, training, and upskilling these individuals who often have an intimate understanding of the community’s distinctive needs and challenges and have earned residents’ trust. Furthermore, Black and Brown patients are more apt to articulate their health-care challenges and follow medical advice when receiving care from a provider who looks like them.We are partnering with universities, hospitals, and health-care organizations to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their talent pipeline and workforce, promote culturally conscious care, and help support innovative health-care solutions that aim to improve health outcomes for communities of color. Such strategic partnerships can be implemented at the community level and are key to cultivating inclusive and accessible health-care solutions for Black Philadelphians.Third, entities like the one where one of us (Howard Reid works, Johnson & Johnson, must continue to invest in all community-based health care providers and organizations. As the burden of diseases continues to rise and more people leverage their local resources, long-term investments will increase the permanence of community-based organizations and ensure Black residents have access to proper health care regardless of where they live.The support must come from everyone who loves the city as much as we do, including local officials, health-care companies, benefactors, and community members who live within and outside of the impacted communities. We all have a role to play.Everyone deserves the right to accessible, compassionate, and high-quality health care. It’s time that we take steps to widely implement long-term solutions for historically marginalized communities.Ala Stanford is a pediatric surgeon, founder of Black Doctors Consortium, former presidential appointee regional director, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and author of “Take Care of Them Like My Own: Faith, Fortitude, and a Surgeon’s Fight for Health Justice,” forthcoming in August 2024.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_97,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Steve Bannon, the relentless right-wing operator and provocateur who’s dedicated his career to advancing the cause of an American version of fascism, has been ordered by a federal judge to serve out his four-month prison conviction.The sentence is from years ago when a jury convicted Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress, but Bannon managed to tie things up in appeals. Now, he will have to join fellow former Trump aide Peter Navarro in serving the same sentence for defying Congress.It really does seem that many of these people simply expected not to have to face any consequences for their actions. The possibility of an actual criminal process and penalties up to and including incarceration for their conduct seemed impossible, because they believed themselves to be special, untouchable by something as pedestrian as the laws that constrained everyone else.This belief didn’t come out of nowhere, reinforced as it was by decades of getting away with everything and then having their proudly unaccountable leader in the Oval Office.Bannon, charged in a scheme to rip off Trump fans who thought they were contributing to building a border wall, was pardoned by Donald Trump on Jan. 20, 2021 — Trump’s last day in office and two weeks after the insurrectionist mob that Bannon and Trump had sack the Capitol. It was Congress’ effort to investigate that attack that led to Bannon’s conviction on contempt charges, after he refused to honor a congressional subpoena.Congress had good reason for the request; Bannon has long prided himself for being something of an ultra-right organizer and agitator, and had a direct hand in strategizing on the push to invalidate the election. His assertion of executive privilege is laughable, and both Congress and a jury were right to reject it.MAGA-in-chief Trump himself has now of course also joined the ranks of the convicted, having been found guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for his efforts to cover up his affair with an adult actress in the run-up to the 2016 election.It turns out that he, too, was not untouchable, although it’s very likely that these are the only charges that voters will get to see through before they cast their ballots in November. The multiple other cases related to Trump’s mishandling of classified documents and attempts to subvert American democracy have been delayed and derailed.There’s a tendency to describe this as due to procedural issues, and while that may be technically true, this makes it sound like these are natural and unavoidable obstacles as opposed to intentional meddling. Case in point, inexperienced Trump appointee Federal Judge Aileen Cannon, whom the former president got the good fortune of having assigned to his classified documents case, has been all too happy to lean on bizarre legal maneuvering to keep delaying the trial.It’s clear that, MAGA rhetoric aside, voters do care very much about these criminal proceedings. New polls have shown that more than half of independents now think Trump should end his campaign in the wake of his conviction. This is the impact of accountability, and the clearest evidence that holding Trump accountable won’t make the sky fall or give him more power.

eugeneweekly_2024_19,"We ve got issues. This year, Oregon Wild marks 50 years of working to protect our state’s wildlands, wildlife and waters. At Oregon Wild’s founding in 1974, newly minted environmental laws and protected areas were just hitting the books (think the Wilderness Act in 1964, Wild & Scenic Rivers Act in 1968 and Endangered Species Act in 1973 . Ancient forests were falling fast and hard. Scientists were just starting to grasp the idea of global warming and what it could mean. Iconic species like wolves were absent from Oregon’s lands after being hunted to near extinction. It would take grassroots organizations to breathe life into new laws and stand up for the environmental values that mattered to Oregonians. The Oregon Wilderness Coalition (Oregon Wild’s first name was founded to do just that. A passionate group of outdoor-loving enthusiasts, including tree-hugging hippies from Eugene and elk hunters from Eastern Oregon, united to save Oregon’s forests from the rampant clearcutting that had all but decimated the state’s public forests. The coalition saw success in the 1980s, securing protections for 850,000 acres of Wilderness and 1,400 miles of Wild & Scenic Rivers — from the North Fork John Day to Drift Creek. In the decades that followed, we changed our name twice (to Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC in 1982 and Oregon Wild in 2006 ; gained additional Wilderness protection through bills passed in 1996, 2009 and 2019; fought for roadless area protections throughout the late ’90s and into 2001; protected Portland’s Bull Run watershed; advocated for wolves as the keystone species returned to Oregon; and fought innumerable timber sales targeting old-growth forests and wildlife habitat. Most of our staff members would much rather spend a day in the woods than in meetings in D.C., but we understand the critical need to engage in the politics of the environmental movement. In Salem and Washington D.C., we’ve worked to apply pressure and find common ground with the politicians who share our values — from congressmen Jim Weaver and Peter DeFazio to Sen. Ron Wyden. Political setbacks come with the territory, including dealmaking and compromises in Congress that whittled away at proposed protections, and Bush and Trump administrations that worked actively to undo progress for forests, public lands and endangered wildlife. But we’re still here. From our small, scrappy beginnings in Eugene 50 years ago, Oregon Wild has grown to meet the challenges facing the natural world. We’ve been at the center of every major public lands and wildlife conservation battle in the state, and we’ve carved out a well-earned reputation as fierce advocates for the wild. We’ve doubled the amount of public forest lands reserved from logging and development. Protected waterways have swelled. And we’ve helped keystone species come back from the brink and set aside habitat for wildlife threatened by our rampant development. In our 50th year, Oregon Wild isn’t slowing down. We’re leading a national effort to finally secure protection for all mature and old-growth forests on public lands for the vital role they play in fighting climate change. We’re leading a local coalition to Wild & Scenic River designations for over 3,000 miles of waterways across the state. We continue to fight against illegal actions that harm our forests and the wildlife that depend on them. And we are dedicating ourselves to diversifying the Oregon conservation movement to ensure that everyone who loves and benefits from Oregon’s wild places has a voice in how they are protected. We need your voice to keep us strong.

I’m aware that many readers will say, “So what else is new?” But in so doing, you’re letting Trump benefit from the soft bigotry of rock-bottom expectations, not holding him to the standards that should apply to any presidential candidate. A politician shouldn’t be given a pass on nonsense because he talks nonsense all the time.But in a way the most interesting thing about Trump’s latest awful policy idea is the way his party responded, with the kind of obsequiousness and paranoia you normally expect in places like North Korea.What Trump reportedly proposed was an “all tariff policy” in which taxes on imports replace income taxes. Why is that a bad idea?First, the math doesn’t work. Annual income tax receipts are around $2.4 trillion; imports are around $3.9 trillion. On the face of it, this might seem to suggest that Trump’s idea would require an average tariff rate of around 60%. But high tariffs would reduce imports, so tariff rates would have to go even higher to realize the same amount of revenue, which would reduce imports even more and so on. How high would tariffs have to go in the end? I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation using highly Trump-favorable assumptions and came up with a tariff rate of 133%; in reality, there’s probably no tariff rate high enough to replace the income tax.And to the extent that we did replace income taxes with tariffs, we’d in effect sharply raise taxes on working-class Americans while giving the rich a big tax cut — because the income tax is fairly progressive, falling most heavily on affluent taxpayers, while tariffs are de facto a kind of sales tax that falls most heavily on the working class.So this is a really bad idea that would be highly unpopular if voters knew about it.But here’s the kicker: How did the Republican National Committee respond when asked about it? By having its representative declare, “The notion that tariffs are a tax on U.S. consumers is a lie pushed by outsourcers and the Chinese Communist Party.”Now, economists have been saying that tariffs are a tax on domestic consumers for the past two centuries or so; I guess they’ve been working for China all along. Yes, there are exceptions and qualifications, but if you imagine that Trump is thinking about optimal tariff theory, I have a degree from Trump University you might want to buy.Anyway, look at how the RNC responded to a substantive policy question: by insisting not just that Dear Leader’s nonsense is true but that anyone who disagrees is part of a sinister conspiracy.Don’t brush this off. It’s one more piece of evidence that MAGA has become a dangerous cult.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.Forecasters say Tropical Storm Gilma is rapidly weakening."

Sure, it rains a lot. Sometimes people complain and vent. There’s pilikia.But, most of what I experience on a daily basis is people from all over the island sharing smiles, helpful hands, kind words, good deeds, hearts of aloha and. of course, ono grinds!Mahalo, Akua, for the privilege to live in this beautiful land. Mahalo nui, Big Island kanaka, for your open hearts of aloha. You are appreciated beyond words.Laurie ConnableHiloMaking the case for ‘third candidate’My name is Jay Failing. I have lived on the Big Island since 1989. I own land here and have an orchard. I am no one special.The thing which will be remembered about me is I worked hard, and with skill.I love the Big Island and hate to go away. I love and respect many people here.I am about as far from politics as one can be. I view them as a necessary evil. Like money.I am in my 70s and starting to think about retiring, if that is even possible, and dying. So, I speak straight from my heart and mind. I do not want anything like money or a position. Even agreement.However, in these trying times, and with an election coming up, I have a dilemma: Not real excited about either of the two main offerings. Both have positive attributes and negative aspects, which we will not delve into. They are well-known. Just the fact I am not excited about either. I am not alone.But one thing for sure, I grew up in an amazing period of history and have paid careful attention. I am sure I am not alone in being disturbed by the present events and apparent decline, unraveling of harmony and order, and sickness of our overall health and strength as a people.Violence, drugs crime, fear, hunger, homelessness, immense national debt — the list is long. We have come too far to let the blood, sweat and tears paid by those before us be wasted. Thus, we look for strong leaders to help us exit this quagmire.I stumbled on a short video about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We remember his father, who was assassinated, and his uncle, John F. Kennedy, also assassinated. As a young teen, I was inspired by JFK, in particular his physical fitness program, which whipped us chubby teens into shape.He had his downside, like anyone, but was inspiring to many of us, and it crushed me to lose him.You are quietly trying to figure: Is this guy, Jay, a Dem or a Republican, right? I am not. I am an Independent.Like many. I drift right in some ways, like being free, left in others, like taking care of our kids and elderly, veterans, education.I stumbled onto someone who rings a bell, in my distrustful and alienated world, so I am hoping you can maybe view this short video to learn about the “third candidate.” Our world is controlled by media, who can distort and manipulate our perception of persons not favored by the powers that be.I have arrived at the fact he is smart, has heart, physically strong and loves his nation. I have differences with some of his stances, for sure. I will vote for him.If you have an open or curious mind, watch the video: “The Robert F. Kennedy Movie” narrated by Woody Harrelson. Then you may understand this man, sans all the lies and character defamation.A close friend I look up to commented, “We had 12 years of Republican rule and 12 years of Democratic rule, and I don’t like where our nation is at. My wife and I are voting for RFK.”I am willing to give this man a try. You will, or already have, come to your own conclusions.

minnpost_2024_93,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.On Monday evening, just hours before newly-minted Democratic nominee Kamala Harris named him as her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz spoke of practicing “the politics of joy.”That was almost certainly a deliberate echo of another Minnesota Democrat, Hubert Humphrey, whose use of that phrase helped get him nicknamed “the Happy Warrior.”Joy is a rare commodity in our current political culture, but it was in Humphrey’s day, as well. The maelstrom of a short-notice national campaign, and particularly one featuring the vitriol Donald Trump habitually spews, will certainly challenge the cheerfulness of any candidate, and we wish Walz well in his ambition to be a happy warrior.But residents of Mankato and North Mankato, regardless of their partisan preferences, can justifiably take pride in Walz’ ascension to the Democratic ticket. He is very much “one of us,” a geography teacher and football coach at Mankato West High School before jumping into politics. If it is possible to have a stunningly ordinary origin story, it would be his.Harris had a truncated timeline in which to choose a running mate. Her reported final six — Walz, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — all fit a specific demographic profile: white men from the Midwest or a swing state. Any of them would have balanced Harris, a woman of color from a safe Democratic state.And any of them probably would have been acceptable to the party at large. All are reliably mainstream Democrats, practical politicians as opposed to ideologues.But Walz seemed during the selection period to stand out as widely acceptable to all factions of the Democrats’ “big tent.” While union officials sniped at Kelly and critics of Israel’s war on Hamas were skeptical of Shapiro, few if any voiced discomfort with Walz.It is a truism that people vote for the head of the ticket, not for the running mate. Walz arguably made his greatest contribution to Harris’ campaign by sticking the “weird” label on Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance.But merely by not being objectionable to any faction of the party, Walz now helps maintain party unity. As progressive leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez commented after Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, once probably the most conservative of national Democrats (now an Independent , joined her in praising the Walz pick: “Dems in disconcerting levels of array.”"
suffolknewsherald_2024_91,"Published 5:13 pm Tuesday, January 23, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy: Former Del. Bob Marshall (Represented Virgnia’s 13th District from 1992 to 2018 One of the most concerning actions taken by Democrats during the 2023 General Assembly elections was their announcement to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to establish abortion as a constitutional right. Unfortunately, they followed through by introducing identical Reproductive Freedom Constitutional Amendments (RFCA : Del. Charniele L. Herring’s House Joint Resolution 1 and Sen. Jennifer Boysko’s Senate Joint Resolution 1.The RFCAs contain 174 words, and their legal implications hinge solely on the text within the RFCA itself—not on speeches, press releases, or Planned Parenthood briefings. The scope of these amendments extends far beyond what I discuss here.North Carolina Congressman Robert Harper, born in Caroline County, stated in 1796, “Courts, when called upon to interpret acts of Legislatures, do not resort to the debates that preceded them, to the opinions of members about their meaning, but rather inspect the act itself, and decide based The first sentence of the RFCA declares, “Every individual has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”The term “individual” logically encompasses males, females, minors (under 18 , and adults. The Democrats could have modeled their RFCA after the VA Constitution Article 2, Section 1, which stipulates that only persons 18 and over may vote.However, the Democrats’ RFCA does not specify that reproductive rights begin at age 18. Consequently, minor children could legally obtain and use birth control, abortion, sterilization, or undergo sex changes by their own consent. This amendment would render parental notice or consent illegal for these practices, effectively abolishing the age of sexual consent.Under this framework, Virginia’s laws protecting minors from predatory adults in cases of sexual trafficking would become unenforceable, as minors would have the legal capacity to “consent” to any sexual behavior. The same adult privileges to legally purchase pornography, films, sexual devices, etc., would extend to minors. Furthermore, laws prohibiting prostitution would be seen as unconstitutional restraints on “reproductive freedom” since individuals, including minors, would possess a fundamental right to sexual relations.Parents would lose any legal means to prosecute adult predators targeting their children, as the RFCA states: “…nor shall the Commonwealth penalize, prosecute, or otherwise take adverse action against an individual who aids or assists another individual, with such individual’s voluntary consent, in the exercise of such individual’s right to reproductive freedom.”If you are concerned about protecting the innocence of your children or grandchildren, demand that your delegate and senator vote No on HJR1 or SJR1.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_122,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported Thursday that another farmworker has been infected with H5N1, an avian flu virus. Alarmingly, unlike earlier cases, he has respiratory symptoms. This means the virus is in his lungs, where it has a better chance to evolve into an airborne form that could easily infect others.Viruses often hit a dead end when they cross from one species to another, getting stuck at their first victim. For example, H5N1 has been around since the 1990s, but most patients have had extensive, direct contact with sick poultry and almost never pass it on to other humans.The pathogens that have the greatest potential to set off a pandemic often have a deadly combination of airborne transmission and frequent mild cases, allowing them to spread widely and stealthily. That’s a key reason there hasn’t yet been an Ebola pandemic. The disease causes severe illness and kills most victims, and it mainly spreads through close contact with infected bodily fluids. It has fewer chances to spread widely than another disease might.The United States is certainly giving H5N1 many, many chances to adapt to spreading easily and quietly among humans.Cows started getting sick with H5N1 in the winter, but unlike birds with H5N1, they weren’t dying. It took dogged investigation by Dr. Barb Petersen, a veterinarian in Texas, to determine that they were afflicted with a form of avian influenza. When we spoke, she told me that whenever cows fell sick on farms she monitored, an unusual number of people also became ill.In April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a farmworker in Texas had been infected with H5N1. This month, state health officials in Michigan found two more human cases (including the one reported Thursday . Even so, public health officials have largely been slow to establish the sort of widespread testing and data sharing that would give Americans the best chance at stopping an H5N1 pandemic.This month, Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the CDC, told The New York Times there were no immediate plans to make testing mandatory. But if we don’t test for H5N1, we won’t find it.As Rick Bright, an expert on the H5N1 virus who served on President Joe Biden’s coronavirus advisory board, told me: “We are missing additional cases by not testing. We are missing evolutionary patterns of the virus by not sequencing more. We are also losing the trust of people by not being completely timely and transparent with data and information as it becomes available.”This virus may never evolve to spread dangerously among humans, but if it does, this particular avian flu pandemic will go down as one of the most avoidable slow-motion disasters in history.© 2024 The New York Times Company"
philinquirer_2024_84,"The city must learn from past mistakes, have the courage to tackle the root causes of Kensington s problems, and cocreate solutions with the community. Otherwise, we could be facing another danger.I have lived across the street from McPherson Square in Kensington for more than 20 years. I’ve also spent 25 years developing, evaluating, and implementing ideas of how to help my neighborhood, and have worked on almost every major problem it’s facing.In that time, I’ve seen the same thing happen over and over: When the neighborhood is in the spotlight, people in power enact plans to displace the unhoused, crime, and drug use taking place,without addressing the root problemsof poverty, disinvestment, and racism.So after a period of time — usually around five or six years — all the problems of Kensington return.Now, in 2024, with a new administration and new faces on City Council, we’re about to embark on a new cycle of ideas and proposals to “fix” Kensington.In recent weeks, the latest plans have begun to take shape, and include clearing unhoused encampments and arresting peopleusing drugs on the street.Some of these measures may temporarily displace the problems. But unless we can work together to find a plan to tackle the root causes of Kensington’s problems, in a few years we could be facing another danger brought on by new obstacles.It doesn’t have to be this way. The city has a chance to forge a new path if it can learn from its past mistakes.The last major attempt to “fix” Kensington came in April 2017, whenMehmet Oz visited the encampmentsat “El Campamento,” alongside the Conrail railroad tracks. There was an explosion of national attention on Kensington, and a few months later, thecamps were cleared out.But with no clear path toward solving the actual issues that led to the camps,many relocated to underpasses along Lehigh Avenue, to the El stop at Kensington and Allegheny Avenues, and to McPherson Square Park. The librarians at the McPherson Square Branch of the public library becametrained in administering the overdose antidote Narcan, exemplifying the intersections of suffering between children, families, and addiction. The situation for residents became even more untenable than ever, and over the next year, the city declared a citywide emergency and launchedmajor cleaning and policing efforts.These effortspledged to include resident input, so I reached out to the city’s managing director spearheading the effort to ask if I could assist. I also expressed my skepticism about the effort, born from years of witnessing countless programs and initiatives come and go in the area.He responded right away, saying the first two weeks were earmarked to work with the community to define what “fixing” Kensington should look like.Two weeks later, after the defined community engagement period had ended, without hearing from him again, I wrote back. “As I said in my original email I can only assume that the usual players have been engaged in a similar process to ones in the past so that similar results can be achieved. I will save this thread for 6-7 years from now when the next initiative is launched after the success of this one.”Here we are, exactly as I predicted: six to seven years later, attempting to recover from the failed efforts of 2017-2018, and about to launch a new effort.When it comes to Kensington, the new administration haspromised to succeed where those in the past have failed.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker has suggestedcutting nearly $1 million in fundingfor Prevention Point, an organization that provides sterile syringes to people who use drugs.City Council has enacted a curfew, and sentmore police and outreach workersto the neighborhood, informing people about housing and treatment options, and posting notices letting people know they plan to clear unhoused encampments.Many in our community are excited for these coming “successes” because we are all so exhausted and desperately deserve change. But these efforts will only reduce the chaos to a level that is less embarrassing for the city so national attention will dissipate.Without a greater plan, the community will return to its previous status: a poor, divested neighborhood quietly being mined for the resources that do exist here — particularly, real estate.What’s more, many of the newly proposed “solutions” to Kensington have been tried already.Yet, unlike in 2017 when Oz came to town, we face different challenges, which present new obstacles. They include:Development is firmly at the gates with gentrification from rising home and rental costs, increased property taxes, andnewly proposed incentives for private development along the El.Overdoses and deaths havedrastically risen for Black and brown Philadelphia residents and dropped for white residents.Thesymbolic dismantling of harm reduction(such as syringe exchange through government defunding will lead to privately funded efforts. With that may come less incentive or need to coordinate with the city or long-term residents. Without clear coordination with the community, there will be less say in where these resources are placed or how they operate.There is no clear plan for the impactdisplacing the unhoused populationwill have on other neighborhoods once displaced. Are other communities prepared to handle the pressures Kensington has been facing for decades?Without clear plans from the city, state, and federal governments that are cocreated with the community to identify resources for the long term, Kensington will be turned over to privatization and the free market, neither of which have ever been kind to people of color and those with limited means.As a consequence, Kensington residents already face another danger, which hasn’t been discussed nearly enough: displacement through gentrification.The last wave of “progress” in 2017-2018 sawmassive investment by prospectors and developers, who are now giddy with the opportunity of finally seeing their investments come to fruition.Any effort to “fix” Kensington should not just be about eliminating the drug economy or ending Kensington as a containment strategy for the city; it should be about preserving a community.While we are focused on what we will be told are the solutions to clearing the streets, we also should expect answers as to how theestimated $1 billion drug economy— which permeates all corners of the community — will be replaced, what the workforce development efforts will entail, how the improvements to education will look, and when the hundreds of millions of funding for housing stability will arrive.If none of these answers exist, the second stage of displacement — this time of long-term residents — is already underway.Without a greater plan that deals with thecore causes of how we got here in Kensington, after the initial “successes” fromcleaning,curfews, andpolicingare celebrated, the crime, drugs, and encampments — which relocated for a time — will return. And without a greater plan to address the long-term needs of residents that’s cocreated with the Kensington community, my neighbors and I could be cheering our own demise.But it doesn’t have to be this way. As plans are designed for Kensington, the city can — for the first time — connect its resources to atransparent, robust, and engaged community network.As a direct result of the failures of the past, a stronger civil society has emerged in Kensington. Decision-makers can plug into a participatory framework that centersmeaningful engagement and cocreation with the community. For the first time, the city can really work with us, rather than simplyinforming, placating, and, in the end, manipulating us as they have in the past.We also have an abundance of organizations that operate throughtrauma-informed frameworks. We have a police commissionerwho is well-versed and committed to these principles, a deputy police commissioner who is well-respected by the community, and a mayor espousing transparent community participation. What better time to make good on the promise that solutions to our most complex problems can be cocreated by those most impacted by the outcomes and that community participation is the engine that drives sustainable, positive change?I recently met with a newly appointed cabinet-level city official to discuss Kensington, and at the end of the meeting, they said: Please, just remember we just got here, so all I ask is for some grace.I reminded them that I am a resident now entering the fourth plan to “fix Kensington” over the last 20-plus years, amounting to an entire generation for this community. And each time a new plan arrives, someone asks me and my neighbors to please be patient and give them time and grace. I responded: If you accept my grace, you have to accept my advice.I think grace for advice is a fair deal for all residents who have been eager to participate in a cocreated process so we can sustainably address Kensington’s challenges, together.Bill McKinney is a Kensington resident and the executive director of New Kensington Community Development Corp."
suffolknewsherald_2024_29,"Published 5:56 pm Tuesday, June 11, 2024ByStaff ReportsQ. How do I make sense of what I am feeling after losing a loved one?A. When you lose something or someone close to you, it is natural to feel pain or grief. Grief is anatural response to death or loss. The grieving process is an opportunity to appropriately mourn a loss and then heal. There are specific stages of grief, and they reflect common reactions people have as they try to make sense of a loss. An important part of the healing process is feeling and accepting the emotions that come because of the loss. Let’s review the common stages of grief that some people go through.Stage 1 is called Denial, and you may experience numbness and shock. Numbness is a normal reaction to a death or loss and should never be confused with not caring because you aren’t showing any outward emotion. This stage of grief helps to protect us from experiencing the intensity of the loss, which can be useful when we must take some action, such as reviewing important papers, notifying relatives, or planning a funeral. As we move through the experience and slowly acknowledge its impact, the initial denial and disbelief fades.Stage 2 is called Bargaining and is marked by persistent thoughts about what “could have beendone” to prevent death or loss. Some people become obsessed with thinking about specific ways things could have been done differently to save the person’s life or prevent the loss. If this stage isn’t dealt with and resolved, a person may live with intense feelings of guilt or anger that can interfere with the healing process. Stage 3 is called Depression. In this stage, we begin to realize and feel the true extent of the death or loss. Common signs of depression in this stage might include trouble sleeping, poor appetite, fatigue, lack of energy, and crying spells. Some people also experience self-pity and feel lonely, isolated, empty, lost, and anxious. Stage 4 is called Anger. Please know that anger is very common and happens when we feel helpless andpowerless. Anger can stem from feelings of abandonment because of the death of a loved one(i.e., you left me . Sometimes, we are angry at God (i.e., how could you let this happen , at thedoctors or nurses who cared for our loved one (i.e., you could have done more , or towards life in general (i.e., she was so young . Stage 5 is called Acceptance because, in time, we can come to terms with all the emotions and feelings we experienced when the death or loss happened.Healing can begin once the loss becomes integrated into our set of life experiences. The grieving process is helped when you acknowledge grief, find support, and allow time for grief to work. It is important to note that throughout our lives, we may return to some of these earlier stages of grief, such as depression or anger. You may also experience high emotions when you are reminded of them on their birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays, as well as by a smell in the air, the empty side of the bed, or simply the thought of the one you love. Since, in my opinion, there are no rules or time limits to the grieving process, everyone’s healing process will be different.Lastly, I believe our loved ones would want us to remember them rather than to grieve them.They might say, “Remember my life and not my death, remember my laugh, remember our talks, and remember the good times we shared. Simply remember me.”Dr. Carletta ArtisOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

leoweekly_2024_33,"I’ve got a couple of things to say about freedom and about family, and those who want you to believe they hold a moral high horse on two things ruled by the choices and morals of the individual.First, America has never had a single morality, religion, or system. Since Europeans stormed the banks of this land, the societies that existed and operated on collective morality and communal care, were removed. The very act of colonialism destroyed any idea that America was a thing of such singular action or thought. The hubris of taking someone’s land, murdering their people, then setting up systems that routinely cost the life of those whose land was stolen, and those who were stolen from their land to build this nation — and then asking those very people to accept and live by a set of rules that are never followed by the asker— is amazing. The distortion in Republican thinking is peak cognitive dissonance. The party of Christianity.The history of white Christianity is a bloody one. The amount of blood spilled in the name of Christ is astronomical. Probably more so than any other religion. This morality is artifice, a performance, because (en masse the practice of Christianity has not been one for salvation, it has been the practice of superiority and a desire to claim superiority.For weeks now, we’ve seen clips of JD Vance dogging childless women and anyone who hasn’t brought a child directly into the world. In the same span of time we learned that former KY Governor Matt Bevin abandoned one of his adopted Black children in Haiti. This is the pro-life, pro-family party. They are on the same side.One, Vane, condemns our nation because, as he claims, it is being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs, and “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.”But his party has a troubled history with family, and the other, Bevin, highlights this in big gross detail.First, family-making is a choice. You have kids if you desire. You have pets if that’s more your speed. It’s the beauty of freedom. You’re free to decide.However, should you decide that family is a thing you want to have, abandoning that family when it gets tough for you is reprehensible, and highlights a need for children, particularly in cross-cultural adoptions, to have access to a community like their own. It gives the parents support and the child support and the cultural reference points they need to understand themselves better.Bevin’s abandonment of “Noah,” puts this into glaring perspective. Bevin should have built this child a network while he was having his powerpoint presentations for Kentucky and crying about the mean ladies who tweeted about him.While it is unknown why Bevin or his ex-wife left the child in an abusive boarding school, it is clear that they were ill-equipped in their family-making to offer a healthy home to this child. It certainly makes their decision making ability come under question. What risks do they pose to their other adopted children?Now, I’m not passing that judgment but it does give pause.It’s here that we zoom in on the idea of freedom and choice. Bevin, Vance and their fellow Republicans want you to believe that family is a duty and that the only choice is the one that fits the imaginary family structure that serves to churn out workers for the next generation. However, Republicans frame this duty as somehow linked to good Christianity.Basically, Republicans are in a full panic about having more children because having children means having more workers and consumers, and that, in turn, keeps capitalism fed and happy.The tricky thing about freedom is that it works in a couple of ways. It isn’t just a slogan. It means that if you want to have freedom, you need to be able to handle it responsibly. Freedom doesn’t exist without responsibility. That’s recklessness.To continue calling ourselves free, we need to see that our duty to children is to love them through their struggles and not to leave them abandoned. We need to see our duty to each other to both mind our own business and be of service if we can. Both can exist at the same time. Our freedom cannot come at the expense of the rights of others to live as they wish.To raise a cross over the idea of family is to imagine that somehow your idea of family is superior to the myriad of ways that humans have and do make family.Whether these values line up with your own is none of your concern. As Minnesota Governor and prospective VP Tim Walz has been saying on the campaign trail with VP Kamala Harris, “Mind your own damn business.”Bevin should have minded his and that of this abandoned child. Vance should and Trump should.None of these people hold any moral high ground and it’s time to squash these arguments about good or bad “family” values because fiction is best on the bookshelf for reading but not as policy for human lives.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_175,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°MAGA Republicans say that America is in crisis: The economy is collapsing while the nation is being overrun by hordes of violent immigrants. Not true.But if that’s what you believe, you should be laser-focused on fighting the clear and present danger, right?Instead, they’re focused on the menace of woke washing machines.On Tuesday, 205 House Republicans (joined by seven Democrats voted for the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act, intended to limit the ability of the Department of Energy to set energy efficiency standards. In April, Republicans planned to vote on a series of more specific bills: the Liberty in Laundry Act, the Refrigerator Freedom Act and more. These votes were delayed but may still happen.If all of this sounds absurd, that’s because it is. But as I noted the other day with regard to the crusade against lab-grown meat, the deep silliness of one of our major political parties is itself a serious issue. If you can get past the silliness, there are also some substantive policy questions here. Should the government be trying to limit home energy consumption? If so, should it do so with efficiency mandates for appliances, or in some other way?The case for trying to reduce home energy consumption is simple and overwhelming. Electric power generation does significant environmental damage. Not only does it emit greenhouse gases, adding to the risk of climate catastrophe; it also has more immediate effects on air pollution, including raising levels of particulates and ozone that have measurable adverse effects on human health. These costs will fall as we increasingly turn to renewable energy, but we’re still in the early stages of that transition. So when you use more electricity than necessary, you are imposing real costs — including a higher risk of death — on other people.That said, nobody is suggesting that Americans give up the convenience of modern life. The goal, rather, is to deliver that convenience more efficiently — to heat our homes, wash our clothes and dishes, and so on while using somewhat less energy.How should that goal be accomplished? Textbook economics — my own textbook included — generally says that the government shouldn’t try to limit pollution by dictating the technologies businesses and households use. It’s normally better to adopt a more flexible approach by providing a financial incentive to limit pollution — putting a price on it, either by taxing emissions or by requiring that polluters buy permits.The classic example is the cap-and-trade program that helped control acid rain. Power plants were issued a limited number of permits to emit sulfur dioxide and allowed to buy or sell these permits to one another. This gave them an incentive to limit emissions, which they did at surprisingly low cost.But there are good reasons to take a more hands-on approach when it comes to home appliances. I’d stress two in particular.First, an attempt to induce households to conserve power by raising its price just isn’t going to fly politically. And there’s nothing shameful about taking political reality into consideration when formulating policy. Health and wellness writers constantly tell us that the best diet or exercise regimen is the one you’ll actually follow; similarly, the best environmental policy may be the one you can actually get implemented.Second, people have lives to live and families to raise — expecting them to make detailed calculations about how much money they’ll save by buying an energy-efficient refrigerator or dishwasher is just unrealistic. Do you carefully read the EnergyGuide labels when you’re out shopping for appliances? I don’t. Regulations ensuring that the appliances on offer are reasonably efficient reduce people’s cognitive burden — you might even say they increase our freedom.Why, then, are Republicans so furiously opposed to such regulations? Part of it is surely the influence of the fossil fuel industries, whose dollar donations overwhelmingly go to the GOP.Probably more important, however, is the way energy-efficient appliances have been caught up in the culture war and conspiracy vortex that has swallowed American conservatism.One nice illustration of the culture war aspect was a 2019 petition circulated by FreedomWorks, a Koch-linked group, titled “Make Dishwashers Great Again.” The petition claimed that “crazy environmentalist rules” had drastically reduced dishwashers’ effectiveness — a claim disputed by dishwasher manufacturers themselves.But it seemed pretty clear that what really bothered conservatives was the very suggestion that American consumers should take into account the adverse effects their choices might have on other people. That sort of consideration, after all, is what the right mainly seems to mean when it condemns policies as “woke.”And as ever, there are the conspiracy theories: No, the Biden administration isn’t planning to ban gas stoves.So yes, it’s funny that Republicans are trying to pass something called the Liberty in Laundry Act. But the silliness is a symptom of political sickness that isn’t funny at all.© 2024 The New York Times Company"

If there wasn’t such an unmet gap in our medical care, it wouldn’t be needed.In 2002, we noted my orthopedic patients were having a hard time getting in to their primary care physician, PCPs. Our community docs were aging, retiring, leaving … and replacements were thin. Those left standing were overwhelmed with patients.If sick or lightly injured, patients might not get an appointment for many days, leaving the ER as the only alternative. Hilo Medical Center ER is the second-busiest ER in Hawaii, second only to Queens. Wait times can be very long. It’s costly to have resources and skills available 24/7, 365 days a year, for saving lives, severe trauma, so every ER visit is expensive. Very expensive.(Physician shortages have increased since, making the need worse. Last year’s annual University of Hawaii Hawaii Physician Workforce Assessment shows the Big Island short 206 docs, up from 183 in 2022, increasing its entire history. Why are the docs not here anymore? Because they work too hard and get paid too little to be here. In 2002, urgent care clinics were starting to pop up on the mainland. So, we also started one, initially with a few docs, just evenings and weekends, taking care of minor illnesses and minor injuries, lacerations, and X-rays that busy PCP docs couldn’t see immediately. Things requiring prompt attention, but not the severe emergencies only suited for the ER.We promptly handed the patients back to their PCPs, as a one-and-done treatment visit goal. Continuity of care is essential to optimal health care. That’s what primary care is all about: monitoring, advising and keeping folks healthy their entire life (as opposed to urgent care .Within a year, Hilo Urgent Care expanded to every day, all day. It’s been helping folks ever since. During COVID-19, when some offices were shut or restricted, it never closed, always saw patients face-to-face, and was an early designated testing site for travel.In 2008, the Puna population was 50,000.

eugeneweekly_2024_35,"We ve got issues. Summer is in full bloom, and for local food lovers that means trips to the farmers market to stock up on crunchy green beans, juicy tomatoes, fragrant basil, tangy berries and so much more. Here in Eugene, the farmers and vendors selling at our local markets do a superb job of showcasing the bounty and variety of our southern Willamette Valley soils — but the unsung heroes are the people behind the scenes that pull the market together each week. Spanning thousands of years and cultures across the globe, farmers markets are rooted in our past, present and future. This August 4 to 10 is the 25th anniversary of National Farmers Market Week, coordinated by the Farmers Market Coalition. Oregon has a strong culture of buying local and supporting farmers. The Oregon Farmers Markets Association (OFMA estimates there were 3.5 million visits made to markets in 2022. As a farmers market lover, I always try to incorporate a market visit into my weekly routine. For me, farmers markets are public spaces that build bridges: between farmer and eater, grower and chef, neighbor and neighbor. As our society becomes increasingly polarized, having community spaces where people with different viewpoints can interact has become more and more rare. When I’m traveling and trying to catch the non-touristy vibe of a town, I seek out the local farmers market. I know I’m guaranteed to learn something new, meet some local characters and eat some damn good food! Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. The best farmers markets uniquely represent their community and its values. No two markets have exactly the same vendors, produce varieties, value-added products, layouts, music or activities. Don’t believe me? Visit each of Lane County’s farmers markets (Oakridge Community Market, Lane County Farmers Market, Spencer Creek Growers Market, Veneta Downtown Farmers Market, Whiteaker Community Market, South Valley Farmers Market and Florence Farmers Market and observe the differences! Behind all of this local flair are the magicians themselves: market managers and staff. Yes, that’s right, farmers markets don’t just happen! They take people, organizations, budgets, supplies and a lot of sweat to come together. The job of organizing a farmers market isn’t always a glamorous one. It involves being a Jack/Jill of all trades; waking up at the crack of dawn to meet vendors at the market site; lugging tents, tables and totes around; mitigating the myriad of problems that arise with any event; and then coming back the next week to do it all over again. The market staff I’ve met are some of the most passionate, driven and creative people I’ve known. Yet despite all of the skill involved in pulling together a farmers market, market staff continue to be underpaid and undervalued. If they’re good at pulling the strings to create a magical market experience, it often means no one notices the work they’ve put in. A recent census from OFMA found that many markets are run by volunteers, part time or seasonal staff. Even when they are paid, it can be as low as $14 per hour with no benefits. Organizations running farmers markets are often small, lean and very grassroots by nature. Relying on stall fees, small grants and business sponsorship leaves most Oregon markets with operating budgets under $50,000. So who supports the people who make farmers markets happen? In our state we are fortunate to have the OFMA. A testament to Oregonian’s love for farmers markets, OFMA was created in 1987 and (much like the markets it supports was fully volunteer run for its first 20 years. Today, OFMA serves an important role in supporting our state’s 140-plus farmers markets through resource collection and creation, network building, advocacy, data collection and statewide promotion. OFMA also keeps an impressive directory of farmers markets, making it easy to find one near you whether you’re staying local or traveling across our great state. As we come together to celebrate the 25th annual Farmers Market Week, remember to take a peek behind the welcome tent when you visit your local market. Get to know the people and organizations that organize vendors to offer you the freshest, tastiest food for your family’s table. Buy them a special treat, write a thank you note, drop a donation, or just give them some sincere gratitude this week and every week!

minnpost_2024_6,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Upon watching a fence erected following the closure of a homeless encampment, and the one tree nearby cut down, an elder with a home nearby remarked, “Don’t blame the tree.”Having spent nearly 30 years working with homeless families, youth and single adults throughout Minnesota, I am often asked about the myths and realities of homelessness. As we await the U.S. Supreme Court decision on whether a person can sleep outside when there is no emergency shelter option available or face criminal consequences, allow me to share my experienced reality.Myth:There is enough shelter for people to access.Reality:Hennepin County recently reported that 4,000 women, youth age 18+ or men were turned away from shelter in 2023. Family shelter is overflowing. Duluth operated a parking lot this winter where people could park and sleep safely in their vehicle. Shortly, the annual spring ritual will occur where scores of Minnesota shelter beds will close because winter is over.Myth:We should think about homeless people and winter.Reality:We should think about homeless people and toilets. Question: How many months of the year do you need access to a toilet? And which hours of the day? When we focus on providing space for people to be inside November-April or 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., we are creating an expensive public health concern.Myth:Homelessness in the Twin Cities doesn’t cost the rest of Minnesotans.Reality:Do residents of Ham Lake care if their state tax contributions went to MnDOT paying $84,885, according to a Data Practices Act request, for the fence that was installed to close an encampment along I-94 near downtown Minneapolis? Do residents of Prior Lake care if they contributed to the $72,990 for the fence along Robert Street outside of downtown St. Paul?Myth:Those homeless people won’t go inside.Reality:This statement is common, including when Minnesota’s largest encampment, the Wall of Forgotten Natives, existed in 2018. Then a shelter was opened and 175 people went inside. It’s said, “People won’t come off the light rail trains” or the news may interview someone who says they won’t go to a shelter yet people come inside when we create shelter programs that meet their needs.While the goal is housing, and we have data to show that the Housing First programs initiated in 2005 in the Twin Cities work for many, and treatment works for others, we are so many years behind in housing development that the best we can do is prevent homelessness where possible and make sure people can get inside somewhere in the meantime.If I could wave a wand to address an immediate need, it would be immediate access to a place to be inside for people, whether we call it a safe site, respite, village, healing center, navigation center or a shelter.Myth:Homelessness is too expensive to fix.Reality:Funding for housing makes up less than 1% of the state’s annual general fund budget. What is a waste of money? Minneapolis spent at least $500,000 to close four homeless camps last year. Anti-homeless architecture like rebar under bridges, piles of stones under overhangs, eradicating bushes and using city streets as storage for public works concrete is the new sanctioned litter we must drive past. Is this the type of community we want to build?While children and youth make up half of Minnesota’s homeless population, they are the most invisible among us. People living with untreated trauma and addiction are the most visible.Maren Hardy, White Earth band and co-founder of Spirit Care Services, has been a street outreach advocate since 2011. Hardy notes, “We have to teach people who are living with untreated trauma and addiction how to live again. All we addicts know how to do is survive, not live. People need life coaches who they see multiple times per week, not a couple of times per month by phone. We also have to let the police department be allowed to do their job when it comes to issues of people breaking the law.” The tremendous impact that encampments have had on children and adults living nearby should have the same level of being unacceptable as having people sleeping outside.Whether the situation is going to get better or worse is the reality we face. I am heartened to observe public and private sector efforts to have people sleep safely inside and hope they meet the need. Until then, people will seek shelter under the trees that still stand.Monica Nilsson is board chair at Peace House Community and collaborated with Maren Hardy, co-founder of Spirit Care Services, on this piece."
minnpost_2024_50,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.More than five years ago, the Minnesota Task Force on Housing declared with urgency the need to act on modernizing the state’s housing ecosystem. The task force declared that Minnesota was 50,000 housing units — homes, condos, townhomes and apartments — short of demand and that a surge in construction would be needed to address the deficit by 2024.Here we are in 2024, and that deadline has come and gone. Minnesota is now staring at a housing deficit of 106,000 units, three-quarters of which fall within the greater Twin Cities metro area.For years, legislators and community leaders have spoken about the need for more affordable housing, workforce housing, senior housing and starter homes. They have been right, of course, yet the problem is much larger than that. Minnesota does not have enough housing — period. It is harder to build homes in Minnesota; it takes longer; it costs more; and, frankly, many of the most affordable options are simply not permitted here due to overly restrictive local zoning rules and NIMBY resistance.With 15 years of underproduction and a growing population, existing housing prices and rents have soared. Construction costs in Minnesota are higher than in any neighboring state, and our median new home price is $100,000 higher than the national average and $124,000 higher than in Wisconsin. No wonder our state has one of the widest homeownership equity gaps in the nation.We need to act on a bold vision that can simultaneously increase housing affordability, access and supply. As seen in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Bloomington, Richfield, and red and blue states across the country, that roadmap exists: legalize more housing options and enable more inventory, including more modestly dense housing in residential areas. We need to bring back the starter home that built communities across Minnesota.Remove costly mandates imposed by local government, such as parking and luxury finishes. They are exclusionary in nature and drive-up costs. Establish guardrails on environmental reviews so that needed new housing can be built without being pocket-vetoed by time-consuming, duplicative and costly reviews.Together, this will ensure that safe, affordable, dignified and durable housing can be built. The demand for housing and the critical lack of supply are at the center of our state’s housing crisis.Many in local government will be unhappy with these reforms and some will cast doubt on their effectiveness. But it’s clear that more housing is the best way to combat out-of-control housing costs. Study after study has demonstrated that local housing policies over the past 30 years have failed to meet the moment and deliver the housing our state so desperately needs.And while a handful of cities have adopted meaningful changes, these represent a small fraction of the over 850 communities in Minnesota. We cannot afford to wait for each community to attempt to address the housing supply. This has been the policy for over half a century, and the results show us that it has not worked.The good news for state leaders is that the public supports this approach. Poll after poll has shown that legalizing more housing options and removing barriers to supply and affordability are popular with voters.While last year’s historic investment in housing was a critical first step in the right direction, money alone cannot tackle this challenge if local communities can continue to deny new housing. We need to replace housing policies that intend to block or increase the cost of housing with those that embrace needed, new, affordably priced housing.This session presents the best opportunity to modernize our housing approval framework in over 50 years. The Minnesota Legislature must take bold action to modernize our state’s housing policies, so they work for all Minnesotans.James Vagle is the CEO of Housing First Minnesota. Josh McFall is the CEO of Minnesota Realtors."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_42,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Immediately after Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, I urged Israel to think about how to respond by asking itself one question: What does your worst enemy want you to do? Then do the opposite. Iran and Hamas wanted Israel to rush headlong into Gaza — without any plan or Palestinian partner for the morning after — and unfortunately, Israel did just that.At this moment of incredible importance for America and the Democratic Party, I would urge President Joe Biden, his family and his party’s leadership to ask the same question: What does your worst enemy, Donald Trump, want you to do now? Then do the opposite.Trump is salivating at the prospect of Biden staying in the presidential race so he can pummel him from now until Election Day with 15-second television and radio ads — not to mention memes on social media — of Biden’s incoherent responses in last week’s debate, each ad asking: Is this the man you want answering the phone at 3 a.m. if the Russians or the Chinese or the Iranians attack us?That is a campaign the Trump GOP cult is surely confident it can win. I suspect that the cultists have known all along that the only reason Trump was leading in many key polls was because so many potential Biden voters were not worried about price inflation, they were worried about age inflation — Biden’s. And if the Republicans could make that the issue, the election would fall into their laps.So, what keeps Trump up at 3 a.m.? My guess is a scenario where Biden turns to his family and his top advisers and pulls out a line from the musical “Hamilton”:George Washington: I’m stepping down. I’m not running for president.Alexander Hamilton: I’m sorry, what?Washington: One last time. Relax, have a drink with me. One last time. Let’s take a break tonight. And then we’ll teach them how to say goodbye.Yes, what Trump fears most right now is that Biden will teach the country how to say goodbye.He fears that Biden will demonstrate the difference between a leader and a party who put the country first and a leader and a party who put themselves first, namely Trump and the Republicans who enable him despite knowing how many of Trump’s former advisers say he is unfit for office, despite knowing that Trump tried to overturn the last election, despite knowing that Trump has articulated no real plan for the country’s future other than “retribution” against all who crossed him and his followers.How might Biden do what is best for the country and worst for Trump — a small man at a big time who is so unwilling to say goodbye that he will not even admit he lost the election in 2020 fair and square? Not by scrambling to shift a few panicky donors to his side to tough it out until November, insisting that he just had one bad debate night. And not by daring the party to remove him. He should elevate himself and the party above the whole fray.That would entail declaring that he will release the delegates who vowed to vote for his nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August and work with the party to set up an orderly process between now and then for the next generation of Democratic candidates to make their cases to the public, and for the convention delegates to choose a new nominee. (By the way, a convention vote is how Lincoln and both Roosevelts got nominated — and that worked out pretty well for the country. Biden could, if he wishes, endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, or he could remain neutral. But he should make clear that the nomination must be decided by an open competition. For the six weeks leading up to the convention and at the convention itself, everyone in America will be listening closely as the best of the next generation of Democrats present a hopeful vision for the country. What a contrast with a Republican convention whose only platform is the whims of their dear leader. Will it be messy? Sure, it will. But every alternative is messy now.Biden could add that once an alternative Democratic ticket is nominated, he will use his bully pulpit — and the credibility and admiration that this gesture will surely earn him from Americans of all political stripes — to ensure that they defeat Trump.Instead of having to defend himself from a tsunami of attack ads about his diminishing mental capacity, Biden could bombard the airwaves with a set of arguments that could answer Trump’s lies while reminding voters that the reason they elected him in 2020 was they knew that America can only stay great if it is led by a unifier, not an avenger.One ad could begin with one of Trump’s most outrageous lies trotted out in the debate last Thursday, about how the U.S. economy has been a disaster since Biden entered the White House. To which Biden could say:“You know, Donald, I read that you have to pay $88.3 million in damages for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll. I just did some back-of-the-envelope calculations: If you would have put $88.3 million in an S&P index fund the day I was inaugurated, it would be up roughly 40% right now. That’s about 35 million bucks, Donald. Some disaster! Think of the legal bills you could pay!”Another ad could quote Trump’s remarks about how he could work with Russian President Vladimir Putin in ways Biden never could. To which Biden could say:“Donald, do you know why, if Putin could vote in our election, he’d vote for you? It’s because he knows one thing about you: that you could never organize the kind of alliance that I put together to push him out of Ukraine and contain China. You’d just throw those alliances away because you can only envisage transactional relationships. A lasting alliance, Donald,like a lasting marriage,is not a transactional relationship. It’s cemented by shared values. You treat our allies as if they are all shoe stores in some Trump Tower lobby who are just not paying enough rent. Well, not only have you lied about how much our allies have contributed to Ukraine — massive amounts — you also have no clue about how much they amplify American power and values.”These kinds of rebuttals of Trump would be the best parting gift Biden could give to his party and to all Americans.Gautam Mukunda, a presidential scholar and the author of “Picking Presidents,” pointed out to me the other day that “in 1783, when George Washington announced that he would surrender his commission, King George III of England — the man whose empire he destroyed — said that if he did this ‘he would be the greatest man in the world.’ Fourteen years later Washington did it again, leaving the presidency willingly when he could easily have made himself president for life. The father of our country sealed his greatness by showing that sometimes the best thing a president can do for his country is give up the presidency. Today, in the face of the worst threat to our democracy since the Civil War, Joe Biden can cement his legacy by following Washington’s example.”Biden, besides being a good man, has been a truly consequential president. He deserves to be remembered as the leader who saved the country from Trump in 2020, lifted us from the dark days of the COVID-19 pandemic, passed critical legislation to rebuild America’s infrastructure, renewed the dignity of work, promoted the transition to a green economy — and, in the end, knew when and how to say goodbye.© 2024 The New York Times Company"

They raped, violated and killed women in horrific ways beyond anything “me too” has ever spoken of.The protesters don’t understand that this is what “from the river to the sea” means.Compare maps of the West Bank from 1967 to today, and it is clear that Israelis have been taking land and killing Palestinians with impunity for the last 57 years.

leoweekly_2024_25,"Across the U.S., the race to end necessary Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI programs — including scholarships and educational programming — is heating up in states with Republican-led legislature. This puts student access to education at risk while undermining the work of faculty members of color. The bills seek to end any discussions of diversity, along with educational instruction or debate about race.This week, it was reported thatIndiana governor Eric Holcomb refused to meet with civil rights and education leadersin Indiana over the proposed Senate Bill 202 (SB 202 . Similar to other DEI bills across the nation, SB 202 focuses on the tenure of university hires and replaces the term “diversity, equity, and inclusion” with “intellectual diversity.”According to Indianapolis’s MirrorIndy, the governor’s spokesperson said the governor did not refuse to meet and that the group was connected with the legislative director on Friday, as is the typical process for the office.“Proponents of SB 202 and copycat legislation in other states argue that they are protecting the rights of DEI opponents in danger of being silenced in university communities that value diversity,” The Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. “But those who have lost their jobs and been driven from their communities as a result of the anti-DEI campaign have not been opponents of Critical Race Theory (CRT , but advocates for cultural diversity and racial justice.”The repercussions of these bills are being feltacross the countryfrom Florida to Texas whereeducators have come under fire and lost their positions for supporting diversity and actively speaking out against these measures.These measures seek to protect a very specific class of anti-diversity loud-mouth who fears their antiquated colonialist rants aren’t being heard — the death knell of a dying majority.SB 202 was sent to Governor Holcomb’s desk this week for signature. On Wednesday, Mar. 6, faculty at Depauw University made a formal opposition statement to SB 202, markingthe first time a private university has entered the debate on this bill.Faculty stated that, “In solidarity with our colleagues at public universities across Indiana, DePauw University faculty oppose Senate Bill 202: dangerous legislation that limits academic freedom, undermines tenure and promotion policies, chills campus speech across the political spectrum, and defunds crucial DEI initiatives.”At the time of this writing, Governor Holcomb had yet to sign SB 202.Kentucky has House Bill 9 (HB 9 which more blatantly states its purpose in the fight against diversity, equity, and inclusion.In Kentucky HB 9 would prohibit postsecondary educational institutions from:Providing differential treatment or benefits on the basis of an individual s religion, race, sex, color, or national origin;From influencing the composition of the student body or scholarship recipients on the basis of religion, race, sex, color, or national origin; from implementing a student housing assignment plan on the basis of religion, race, color, or national origin with designated exceptions;From expending any resources on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the promotion of discriminatory topics, or bias incident investigations;From soliciting statements on an applicant s experience with or views on religion, race, sex, color, or national origin;From requiring a course or training on diversity, equity, and inclusion or discriminatory concepts as a program requirement;From permitting credit from a course dedicated to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion or discriminatory concepts to count towards the total number of credits required for a degree or certificate, or disseminating or profiting from any research, work product, or material that promotes or justifies discriminatory concepts of diversity, equity, and inclusion; establish exclusions;Kentucky is another state with a Republican supermajority in the state houses making passage of these bills likely even with a veto by the governor.Kentucky seeks to institute these measures by the end of June.Republican shenanigans continue to cloud the people’s government houses with bills that work only to sooth the egos of tender white men and women who are afraid that a diverse country renders them obsolete. Instead of realizing that it is their narrow-minded vision of a nation that makes them useless, they are attacking marginalized groups from all spaces using the cloak of “lawmakers” under which to hide. They aren’t working for us, they are creating laws to salve their exposed racist, homophobic, transphobic and backwards underbellies.For students, educators, parents and other workers in Kentucky and Indiana’s educational systems, these bills present a very dangerous precedent.The federal dollars that are being spent in these institutions, the parents funding, should have all stakeholders furious.

Close behind was Mower County with 11.1%. Foreign-born residents made up 4.9% of Freeborn County’s total population.Freeborn County saw a 55.1% increase — or an increase of 537 foreign-born people — from 2010 to 2022, while Mower County saw an increase of 67.8% or 1,801 residents in the same period.Specifically, the American Community Survey estimated Freeborn County in 2022 had 1,512 foreign-born residents, while Mower County had 4,459.That is not insignificant.The Department of Employment and Economic Development went on further to illustrate how the foreign-born population as a whole right now has a younger age distribution than the overall population, with 61% of the immigrant population falling in the prime working age range of 25 to 54. When looking at the total population, only 36% is within that same age range, especially with the retirement of Baby Boomers.We have seen some area businesses take advantage of this opportunity to attract these workers by making an extra effort to reach out to these communities, and we urge others to join in.These workers are filling a gap in workers in the area, and they will only continue to do so in the coming years. These individuals have a variety of backgrounds, and with that can bring in diverse knowledge and skill to the workforce."
eugeneweekly_2024_23,"We ve got issues. In a campaign ad titled “Money and Power,” a woman supporting Monique DeSpain’s candidacy for Congress declares: “I do think career politicians are part of the problem.” DeSpain, who is seeking to replace Val Hoyle as District 4’s congressional representative, follows this statement by asserting that “I am not a career politician.” Underscoring the point, DeSpain makes this assertion behind a background picture of Hoyle labeled “career politician.” I have long been fascinated by this line of political argument. For example, we don’t hear denunciations of “career doctors,” “career teachers,” or “career plumbers.” In most cases we appreciate the dedication, experience and competence that people develop over the course of an occupational career. However, having a career in politics does not receive similar respect. How do we explain attempts to discredit political opponents by labeling them as career politicians? The term reflects a deep-seated popular distrust of government, which many see as inherently intrusive, wasteful or corrupt. People who have embraced politics as a career, especially those who serve multiple terms in office, are painted with this brush. In the eyes of detractors, their longevity inevitably causes them to lose touch with the needs and concerns of ordinary people. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Often, the charge of corruption reflects the belief, as DeSpain’s ad suggests, that veteran politicians are only in it for money and power. As one person declared in the ad, “politicians are lining their pockets while people are struggling at home.” Candidates branding their opponents as career politicians typically portray themselves as virtuous outsiders untainted by association with an entrenched and unresponsive system. They propose to use the special insights they have gained in fields such as business, sports, the military or other non-political occupations to repair the dysfunction that permeates our politics. I certainly recognize the value of people bringing different career experiences to the practice of politics. And I understand the legitimate concern that some long-time politicians (a small percentage in my judgment can become disengaged, self-interested or fail to represent their constituents effectively. However, there is much to be said for the benefits that come with making politics a career. Many career politicians learn valuable skills such as the art of negotiation and compromise, listening carefully and adapting to meet the needs of constituents, developing productive working relationships with colleagues, and crafting solutions that improve the lives of people and their communities. I can see these qualities in prominent Lane County officials with long political careers, including former Congressman Peter DeFazio, former Eugene mayor Kitty Piercy, current County Commissioner Pat Farr and retiring state Rep. Paul Holvey. Each of them compiled impressive records of achievement rooted in their decisions to make politics a career. It’s time to retire the use of the term “career politician” as a line of attack in electoral politics. It only serves to fuel public cynicism about politics as a corrupt or dishonorable enterprise. Instead, challengers who aim to oust long-serving incumbents should explain their motivations for seeking public office, highlight the values and experiences that have shaped their attitudes, and promote the superiority of their policy proposals. After all, they have decided to pursue a career in politics. They should treat the practice of politics with the respect it deserves.

So, enjoy the color that birds bring to your yard. All you have to do is look out the window and keep a few feeders clean and full; before you know it you will be hooked on bird watching. If you do a few simple things, you will make some birds happy, healthy, and safe, and elevate your own happiness and health.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA estimates that there are roughly 45 million bird enthusiasts nationwide. That works out to be about one third of the population falling into the category we lovingly call “Birds Nerds”.The birdies need all the help they can get from their human friends. Goodness knows humans have done our share of damage to our feathered friends.Their numbers are decreasing at a mind numbing rate. Cornell University estimates roughly 3 billion (yes, billion! have disappeared since 1970 due to habitat loss, cat attacks, glass collisions and insect loss due to harmful pesticides. We urge you to visit their website:https: www.birds.cornell.eduto learn how you can mitigate this terrible loss.We’re lazy bird watchers compared to real birders who get up before the sun to go out to watch birds in the wild. Most of the time the birds are gone before we can adjust the binoculars and get them in our sights. Of the numerous birds we do see, most of them come to us. The good news is that your backyard is their natural habitat, too. With a bird identification book and not too much effort, you will be seeing all kinds of birds from the cozy comfort of your kitchen window or any window that suits you.During these cold temperatures birds love to visit backyard feeders. Feeders aren’t the only attraction. Water is attractive to birds, too. Especially in the winter it is important to put out fresh water and watch that it is replenished if it freezes.If you want to see specific kinds of birds, learn what foods they like. In general, we have the best luck with black oil sunflower seeds; they seem to be popular with many local birds. There are lots of mixes out there of varying price points; beware of the ones that have a high percentage of millet. The millet always seems to be the last to go… our squirrels even turn their noses up at it. Suet cakes are well loved in winter for their high fat content. Peanuts are a big hit, especially with the blue jays and red bellied woodpeckers. Even the little birds like Tufted Titmice, Carolina Chick-a-dee, and Cardinals love the tidbits that are left after the big guys are done. Bluebirds love freeze dried mealworms. Mealworms are expensive, but if you love bluebirds it is worth it. Keep your feeders clean and full and everyone will be happy; especially you.The National Audubon Society is holding the 27th annual Great Backyard Bird Count February 16-19, 2024. Visit the official website atbirdcount.orgfor more information. Anyone can join the fun, it’s free, and you can report the birds you see in your backyard.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_134,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Of course Nikki Haley now says she’ll vote for Donald Trump. The blink of an eye ago she called him “unstable and unhinged,” an individual who’s “just toxic” and “lacks moral clarity.”She follows the same beaten path of Marco Rubio, who became a big fan of the man he’d labeled a “dangerous” “con artist”; Ted Cruz, now an enthusiastic backer of a person he called a “sniveling coward”; and Lindsey Graham, now a leading apologist for the man he’d branded a “race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.” In the political class, there are dozens upon dozens of other such examples amid rare exceptions like Mitt Romney.Republicans who run for office speak the obvious truth about Donald Trump until they realize he’s got them beat and, if they want to win more elections in a party where Trump and Trumpism remain dominant, they have no choice but to turn obsequious and pretend that they never had a brain or a conscience. Trump proceeds to treat all these former rivals like something grosser than gum stuck to the bottom of his shoe, and that’s appropriate, because the rivals-turned-sycophants disrespect themselves.When politicians so brazenly change their tune on such matters, it’s little wonder the public treats them with contempt; that contempt, ironically, is one of the things that in 2015 fueled the rise of a supposedly more authentic personality named Donald Trump.The Republicans far more worth our attention these days are those who were up close and personal with Trump in his first term, who saw the way he operated as president, and who now warn at the top of their lungs against him becoming president again.There’s former Vice President Mike Pence, who Trump tried to turn into an accomplice in his plot to overturn the 2020 election.Former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, who emerged from the cauldron of the White House calling Trump “a person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators” who “has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.”There’s Bill Barr, once Trump’s attorney general, who calls Trump “a consummate narcissist” who “constantly engages in reckless conduct.” There’s chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, who called Trump a “wannabe dictator.”Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who calls Trump a “threat to democracy” based on his attempt to send as many as 250,000 troops to the U.S. Mexico border— as well as his apparent interest in launching missile strikes on Mexico. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who called Trump the “first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try.” That’s an unmistakably consistent pattern from those who saw him play commander-in-chief.None of these people are seeking political office. All of them align with Trump on many key policy questions. All of them know that being honest about Donald Trump will make it harder for them to thrive professionally in a Republican Party where Trump has overwhelmingly positive approval ratings. Yet none can deny seeing what they saw: an immature, craven, self-serving, out-of-his depth individual who abused the power of the presidency for four years — then tried to steal a second four-year term — and is salivating at the opportunity to do it again.—New York Daily News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_3,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Details are still emerging about the attempt to kill Donald Trump — about the shooter and how it was possible, and also what it says about America.The first is obvious: Political violence has no place in America. No matter our politics, Americans should never resort to violence to settle our differences. We may have many differences, but the only answer is speech, speech, and more speech.Except, those on the political left don’t believe that for a second, not after years of Big Tech censorship and other anti-speech activities.For eight years, leftist political leaders and cultural elites have done nothing but stoke outrage and anger, encouraging increased lawlessness and hate. Anti-Trumpism — “Orange Man Bad” — has become a religion with crazed, fanatical adherents. The “crying liberal” meme from January 2017 personified millions of people in this country.What happened in Butler, Pa. — with one victim dead and two critically injured — was not an isolated act. It didn’t just happen out of the blue, without rhyme or reason. It is the latest in a long list of examples of leftist violence meant to silence Republicans and tear apart America’s social fabric.The examples are endless. The 2020 “Black Lives Matter” riots across 140 cities ended up costing the economy billions of dollars, thousands of damaged businesses, and dozens of lost lives. Radical Antifa activists claimed entire neighborhoods in once-great cities like Portland and Seattle, declaring “autonomous zones” free of police intervention and other government oversight.And the Democrats in power refused to act, cheering them on.Then there are the pro-Hamas protests tearing apart colleges and universities, with rioters preaching antisemitism and promoting a terrorist group at the expense of law and order. Once again, left-wing administrators refused to act.Are we honestly surprised that a former president who has been called a Nazi, fascist and war criminal happened to be shot while giving a stump speech? Is it shocking that a man denounced as “evil” time and time again became target practice by someone who saw absolutely no consequences — and no small amount of glorification — for outrageously violent leftism? Of course not.What happens if (when Donald Trump wins re-election in November? Will the left sit idly by? Or, based on everything we’ve seen for the last eight years, will the left allow them to burn half of America to the ground rather than enforcing the rule of law? And afterward, it’ll be another “Russian collusion” witch hunt —or worse.If any good-faith actors are on the left, now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to hold radicals accountable for the political violence that has reached such a boiling point rather than encouraging and rewarding bad conduct. If the “temperature” is to drop, that clearly needs to start with the anti-Trump crowd.It’s the most basic lesson: If you punish bad action, you get less of it. If you don’t, you get more. And, if you reward it, you get way more.Consider the debacle on our southern border, with the Biden administration refusing to take illegal immigration seriously and states subsidizing illegals with more money than we spend on our homeless and veterans. When you don’t punish unlawful activity and go so far as to encourage it to win votes, you get millions of migrants coming to America with no checks and balances. Where is their incentive to stop?Schools that punish disruptive protesters with expulsion don’t get more disruptive protesters. Rioters don’t riot where they will be shot. Conversely, when bad behavior is encouraged by radicals in faculty or other leadership positions, the bad guys tear down more to get their way.Today’s left has abandoned our most basic principles — personal responsibility, civil discourse and social tolerance — while ramping up the vitriol about “literal Hitler” and “words are violence” over today’s progressive mental disorder du jour. And so, we get more political violence.The temperature isn’t too hot in America; it’s too hot on the left. Until the left takes responsibility for that and stops coddling the mob, there will only be more and more political violence — until the next horrific event._____ABOUT THE WRITERShaun McCutcheon is the successful plaintiff in the 2014 Supreme Court case McCutcheon v.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_15,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°(Dreamstime/TNS The history of medical diagnosis is a march through painstaking observation. Ancient Egyptian physicians first diagnosed urinary tract infections by observing patterns in patients’ urine. To diagnose diseases of the heart and lungs, medieval doctors added core elements of the physical examination: pulse, palpation and percussion. The 20th century saw the addition of laboratory studies, and the 21st century of sophisticated imaging and genetics.Despite advances, however, diagnosis has largely remained a human endeavor, with doctors relying on so-called illness scripts — clusters of signs, symptoms and diagnostic findings that are hallmarks of a disease. Medical students spend years memorizing such scripts, training themselves to, for example, identify the sub-millimeter variations in electrocardiogram wave measurements that might alert them to a heart attack.But human beings, of course, err. Sometimes, misdiagnosis occurs because a doctor overlooks something — when the patterns of illness fit the script, but the script is misread. This happens in an estimated 15% to 20% of medical encounters. Other times, misdiagnosis occurs because the illness has features that do not match known patterns — they do not fit the script, such as when a heart attack occurs without telltale symptoms or EKG findings.Artificial intelligence can help solve these two fundamental problems — if it’s given enough financial support and deployed correctly.First, AI is less susceptible to common factors that lead doctors to make diagnostic errors: fatigue, lack of time and cognitive bandwidth when treating many patients, gaps of knowledge and reliance on mental shortcuts. Even when illnesses conform to scripts, computers will sometimes be better than humans at identifying details buried within voluminous health care data.Using AI to improve the accuracy and timeliness with which doctors recognize illness can mean the difference between life and death. Ischemic stroke, for example, is a life-threatening emergency where a blocked artery impedes blood flow to the brain. Brain imaging clinches the diagnosis, but that imaging must be performed and interpreted by a radiologist quickly and accurately. Studies show that AI, through superhuman pattern matching abilities, can identify strokes seconds after imaging is performed — tens of minutes sooner than by often-busy radiologists. Similar capabilities have been demonstrated in diagnosing sepsis, pneumonia, blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism , acute kidney injury and other conditions.Second, computers can be useful for illnesses for which we haven’t developed the right scripts. AI can, in fact, diagnose disease using new patterns too subtle for humans to identify. Consider, for example, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a rare genetic condition in which the heart’s muscle has grown more than it should, leading to eventual heart failure and sometimes death. Experts estimate that only 20% of those affected are diagnosed, a process that requires consultation with a cardiologist, a heart ultrasound and often genetic testing. What, then, of the remaining 80%?Researchers across the country, including at the Mayo Clinic and UC San Francisco, have demonstrated that AI can detect complex, previously unrecognized patterns to identify patients likely to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, meaning AI-driven algorithms will be able to screen for the condition in routine EKGs.AI was able to recognize these patterns after examining the EKGs of many people with and without the disease. The rapid growth in health care data — including detailed electronic health records, imaging, genomic data, biometrics and behavioral data — combined with advancements in artificial intelligence technology has created a major opportunity. Because of its unique ability to identify patterns from the data, AI has helped radiologists to find hidden cancers, pathologists to characterize liver fibrosis and ophthalmologists to detect retinal disease.One challenge is that AI is expensive, requiring large-scale data to train computer algorithms and the technology to do so. As these resources become more ubiquitous, that can make the associated intellectual property difficult to protect, discouraging private investment in these products. More generally, diagnostics have long been considered unattractive investments. Unlike their therapeutic counterparts, which see around $300 billion in research and development investment a year, diagnostics receive a modest$10 billion in private funding.Then there’s the question of who pays for the use of AI-based tools in medicine specifically. Some applications, such as detecting strokes, save insurers money (by preventing costly ICU stays and subsequent rehabilitation . These technologies tend to get reimbursed more quickly. But other AI solutions, such as detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, may lead to increased spending on costly downstream therapies to treat newly identified chronic illness. Although the use of AI may improve quality of care and long-term outcomes in such cases, without financial incentives for insurers, reimbursement and thus adoption may be slow.Life sciences companies have on rare occasion agreed to subsidize development or reimbursement of AI-based diagnostics. This will help bridge the gap, but the federal government may need to play a greater role. Federal support for COVID diagnostics during the pandemic drove rapid development of critical tests, and the cancer moonshot project has helped drive R&D in screening and new treatments.It is usually tough to marshal funding at the scale needed for new medical frontiers. But the National Academies of Medicine has estimated that tens of billions of dollars and countless lives could be saved from improving diagnosis in medicine.Artificial intelligence offers a path toward that. It should complement, rather than replace, the human expertise that already saves so many lives. The future of medical diagnosis doesn’t mean handing over the keys to AI but, rather, making use of what it can do that we can’t. This could be a special moment for diagnosis, if we invest enough and do it right.Gaurav Singal is a computer scientist and physician at Harvard Medical School and was previously the chief data officer of Foundation Medicine, a cancer diagnostics company.

With schools now holding organized practices, student-athletes and coaches alike are excited to be back on the field of competition, whatever that may be.We hope these seasons are successful in terms of whatever goals are set by the teams and individuals involved. It’s inevitable that some of these goals might not be reached just as it’s inevitable that many will be.With that in mind, we urge spectators to understand that underneath it all — the school spirit, the drive to win, the hope for something more — these are games and those competing are just kids.As spectators, we want to see these teams and athletes succeed and have fun doing it, fully understanding that there will be parts of athletics that are no fun at all. That includes the fact that teams and individuals will lose.That is the reality of athletic competition and as part of that reality we in the stands are here to support and cheer. Never demean or put down. Far too often, spectators get caught up in the idea that winning is not only the ultimate goal, but the only goal.Anything less can be seen as failure, but in the end these are just kids doing the best they can. Nobody wants to lose. Nobody wants to fail. Unruly spectators who put undue pressure on these kids does not help.Getting upset and frustrated will happen, but always keep in mind that the youth can succeed when they know that adults have their best interest in mind. It’s often said, but paradoxically not said enough, that just as much can be gained from a loss as a win.Through a loss, kids learn resilience and perseverance, but broadly speaking they learn. There are just as many lessons to losing as there are winning and ultimately, that is what school is about.At the end of the day, there are likely no professional athletes in the making in our area and only a few that will play college athletics. For a large majority of athletes this is a chance to play a game and to do it with friends.This coming fall and into the winter and spring sports seasons we remind you that the players are kids and when mistakes happen reaffirm and support. Lift them up and urge them to try again.Falling will happen. Don’t be the reason that an athlete stays down."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_135,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The United States is founded on the principle of equal opportunity for all. Getting an education, finding a job and getting married are traditionally viewed as crucial steps for escaping poverty and ascending into the middle class, regardless of one’s economic starting point.For example, each additional year of educational attainment is associated with 3% reduction in mortality risk for adults aged 18 to 49 years. Individuals who are employed show up to 29% decline in risk of mortality over a long period of time. Finally, married individuals are 16% protected against mortality, compared to those not married.But education, employment and marriage do not uniformly lead to upward mobility.Over the past decade, I have been studying the economic and health benefits of education, employment and marriage across diverse groups. I’ve found that, systemically, Black and brown people gain fewer benefits compared to white individuals in these areas. In fact, my research and research by others show that racial disparities are often more pronounced when looking at higher earners.For instance, across education levels, Black individuals are more likely to work in more strenuous jobs, live in resource-starved neighborhoods and earn less than their white counterparts. As a result, highly educated Black individuals report more occupational stress. This partly stems from the fact that, even after surmounting numerous hurdles, Black families relocating to predominantly white, affluent neighborhoods face heightened discrimination.This reality consistently places highly educated, employed and married Black and brown individuals at risk for multiple economic, behavioral and health issues across their lives, from childhood to older age. For example, Black boys from more affluent families tend to be more depressed than those from lower income families, particularly if they live in proximity to whites.This research shows us that merely narrowing the economic divide across groups is inadequate for eliminating inequalities between them. Closing racial gaps in health and wealth is far more difficult than many policymakers realize.We cannot rely on education as “the great equalizer,” as it may actually increase these inequalities. The racial health gap is not just a result of poverty, but also a direct consequence of racism.Based on these findings, the recommendations are clear.Our political leaders, in passing legislation, should acknowledge the potential for unintended consequences, particularly when those laws focus solely on enhancing education and employment without addressing broader systemic challenges. Indeed, they must analyze not only the overall effects of the new policies but also their influence on widening existing disparities.We need a strategy that tackles disparities in education, labor, policing, banking and beyond. Only by addressing these larger, interconnected systems can we make meaningful change.Due to historic racism, the United States has offered more and better opportunities to white individuals than to people of color. The conventional wisdom on gaining education, occupation and marriage is not a universal solution for escaping poverty and reaching middle-class status for Black and brown Americans. It’s time to think more broadly about how we can dismantle systemic racism.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."

Such episodes are completely anathema to American principles of nonviolence, fairness and justice.Proponents of assault weapons state only a small percentage of such weapons are implicated in gun deaths annually. However, this ignores the reality that mass killings are most frequently associated with assault weapons!The capability of these weapons is exceptional firepower and volume to do maximum destruction to human life in an abbreviated space of time.A popular statement volleyed is: “Guns arenotthe enemy, it’s the person.” However, this assertion still “fires over” the primary question: How is it assault weapons are so accessible to disturbed and criminal minds? History shows that iconic legends as Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett never took lives out of wanton desire or pleasure!It is critical to distinguish between guns/firearms and weapons. To many, the use and art of firearms, as embedded in the Second Amendment, is a bedrock part of American culture. Marksmanship was a skill to refine and respect. It was played out in an annual biological harvest of large and small game.The artist’s reward was a single shot to game that touched ground never knowing it had expired! Not known among those who did not hunt was a deep regard and affection by the hunter towards the magnificence of the game harvested.At present, only nine states prohibit the manufacturer and sale of assault weapons. Hawaii stands in the middle, only prohibiting assault pistols. It is disconcerting on the national level that the attraction to assault weapons, particularly the AR 15, has taken on cultish dimensions.Primarily, the current generation is enamored with the weaponry. Popular declarations are: “I feel more powerful, stronger and more protected” or “having an AR 15 offers a sense of complete freedom.”Thus, it remains doubtful the popularity of assault weapons will diminish, with their quick spray of firepower that doesn’t require an Izaak Walton journey of marksmanship.Regardless, what can occur is much more stringent background checks and enforced consequences to the social pathology of those ignoring those legal requirements.Jim BarkerKeaauPlease don’t setoff fireworks earlyPeople, this is what can happen when you choose to set off fireworks earlier than the Fourth of July.My friend on Komo Street in Mountain View has successfully kept her cats indoors and her dogs outside for eight years.

Before legislators leave the halls of the Capitol — unlikely to return until 2025 — the Senate should make time to vote on two historic confirmations.The highly qualified leaders running the Department of Natural Resources and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency have yet to be confirmed by the DFL-led Senate. Doing so would fortify the commissioners’ positions at the helm of their agencies and provide a moment to celebrate the role of women in leadership positions.When appointed in 2019, Commissioner Sarah Strommen made history as the first woman to lead the DNR, a widely and deservedly celebrated moment. After many years of service at the DNR, the Board of Water and Soil Resources and Minnesota Land Trust, Commissioner Strommen was recognized for her leadership abilities with an appointment to oversee the critical agency as the state embarked on a bold vision for preserving and protecting Minnesota’s natural resources for future generations.Since Strommen’s appointment, Minnesota has made incredible progress toward protecting our climate and environment — and has made historic investments to preserve and enhance our great outdoors. Now is the time for the Senate to act and confirm Commissioner Strommen.Over at the MPCA, Katrina Kessler has led with remarkable vision since her more recent appointment in November 2021. With a combined 15 years of experience at the agency before her appointment, Commissioner Kessler has used her knowledge to guide MPCA through some difficult challenges.Kessler has helped the agency take on the threat of PFAS, known as “forever chemicals.” Under her leadership, new PFAS policies have made Minnesota a national leader in addressing this growing threat. The agency has also taken many steps to address the state’s increasing solid waste problems, working to help Minnesotans reduce waste, increase recycling and dig out from the literal mountains of trash in our landfills and incinerators that pollute our air and water.While both commissioners have shown true leadership, neither has received a confirmation vote on the floor of the Senate. The current DFL majority should vote to confirm them both this session. A notable reason to do so is the opportunity to make Commissioner Strommen the first woman confirmed by the Senate to lead the DNR. This is no small matter, and the majority party should consider it seriously.Now is the time for the Senate to do its part and officially confirm these two accomplished and qualified public servants to their roles. Both have proven that they are more than ready to meet the moment to tackle some of Minnesota’s biggest climate and environmental issues.Paul Austin is the executive director of Conservation Minnesota, a statewide nonpartisan organization."

suffolknewsherald_2024_69,"Published 6:11 pm Tuesday, February 27, 2024ByStaff ReportsIt’s sign up time for many spring sports in Suffolk… youth soccer and baseball, to name a few. Kids need to get out there and practice their skills and compete. It’s the same in the natural world. We watched two juvenile bald eagles most of a morning recently using their newly acquired skills.The first young eagle flew in low over our quiet section of lake Meade with a fish in its talons. It landed in the top of a tall pine to enjoy breakfast, when suddenly, another but slightly larger juvenile, came along to challenge the first for the fish. A kerfuffle occurred over the water between the two and the fish was lost to both. Stealing another animal’s catch is an eagle skill acquired over time.We’ve seen adult eagles around for a number of years. Several years ago we saw a mama eagle teaching her fledgeling some fishing skills and tree top landing practice. It was a messy business… lots of splashing and wet feathers… and a lot of awkward moments for the young eagle.This time we did see an adult in the area but it is hard to tell if there is a relationship with these young birds. We suspect so… but there is no way to know for sure. Adult eagles will continue to feed their young outside the nest for a while after they have fledged, until they learn to forage on their own, usually around 4 -10 weeks after leaving the nest. It is pretty hard to tell how old these juveniles are because young eagles are basically brown all over for a few years.Juvenile bald eagles don’t look anything like their adult parents with one exception…they are huge. They are brown with a brown beak and feet. Trying to identify ages and stages of the young birds by their coloring is a mixed bag for a few years. Older juveniles or sub-adults as they are called, have some mottling of white on the underside, but they don’t start getting the distinctive white head and tail until they are around 4 or 5 years old.After their dispute over the ownership of the fish our young eagles came to rest in separate trees in our yard. A bit more time passed and they were a few branches apart in the same tree. We guess that maybe they are from the same brood, but again it is hard to know for sure because young eagles will hang out together. For the first four years of their lives young eagles are basically nomadic. They tend to prefer areas with quiet water, like lakes.Thankfully, eagles are no longer a rare sight, although we still get a thrill when we see them. We can remember when the pesticide DDT almost wiped them out along with the brown pelican on the east coast. We always feel honored to see the wildlife that is present in our lives but especially when they give us a glimpse into their ways as these two young eagles did.The rivers and lakes here in Suffolk are just the kind of environment that eagles, young or old, seek.

Child abuse and neglect are complex issues with root causes deriving from social conditions (e.g., poverty, lack of adequate housing and impacts from discrimination and historical trauma and individual family histories (e.g., abuse, mental health issues and alcohol/substance addiction. Effective child welfare reform goes far beyond changing agency policies and procedures. We must effectively address the social issues impacting families and ensure that our child welfare workforce has the expertise, training and resources necessary to tackle these difficult issues.Over the years, our state has enhanced our child welfare system by supporting programs such as “Blueprint for Change,” family group conferencing and adopting a differential response system, which provide a strong foundation — a foundation which we must continue to build upon.We also need to acknowledge challenges inherent in the system. Investigating and intervening in child abuse cases often means making potentially life-changing decisions to remove or not remove children. That decision, often made within days and sometimes within hours of receiving a report, is predicated on information gathered in a short period, in compliance with state and federal guidelines, and is made only after carefully balancing the needs of ensuring safety of children with the inherent rights of parents.We must support this critical work by adequately funding staff training and resources such as parenting classes, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and housing so that Child Welfare Services’ workers have the necessary “tools” to ensure families can provide safe homes for their children.In my career, I have never had a CWS worker say that they did not care about the needs of the children whose interests he/she was committed to protecting. I have, however, seen firsthand that there are often not enough hours in the day for them to complete their work, and how difficult it is to access services and resources needed for families in need.I am always amazed at how social workers manage all they do — meet with children/families, attend court hearings and write court reports, meet with service providers to monitor family compliance and progress, transport children to appointments, etc. I have also seen how many sacrifice time with their own families because of their commitment to their work.Finally, it is important to know that child welfare workers may only intervene if and when they receive a report of alleged abuse. Sadly, the general public is often reluctant to report child abuse. This may be for a host of reasons — fear of wrongly accusing someone, fear of retaliation, or feeling that family issues should be handled within the family. Child welfare reform must include educating our community that the safety and well-being of children is paramount, and that we must all do our part to support safe, healthy families.There may always be a need for child welfare reform, and constructive dialogue from myriad perspectives will only help the process. But improvements to our system will be most effective if we all take ownership of the problem and are willing to work collaboratively and cooperatively to develop viable solutions.Terri Lum is a licensed social worker in Hilo.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.The Island of Hawaii YMCA is expecting its biggest crowd yet for its upcoming dance party for adults ready to have a good time for a good cause."

Earlier, there were redos with William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan (McKinley won both in 1896 and 1900 and Grover Cleveland vs. Benjamin Harrison (in 1888, Harrison defeated the incumbent Cleveland, who then staged a comeback victory in 1892 .In the pre-Civil War days, before the GOP existed, when there were Whigs and such, Martin Van Buren beat William Henry Harrison in 1836 and lost to him four years later. The same for John Quincy Adams besting Andrew Jackson in 1824 and falling to Jackson in 1828 and way back in the beginning, John Adams was victorious over Thomas Jefferson in 1796 and was ousted by Jefferson in 1800.All the losers accepted the outcomes (although Jackson’s bitter 1824 defeat in the House of Representatives was known as the “corrupt bargain” and such good sportsmanship is something we can’t count on this year from one of the candidates. Something else that all these prior repeats shared was that none of the competitors ever face off against each other on stage, as presidential debates only started in 1960.That also will change on June 27, when Joe Biden and Donald Trump, a pair of presidents, current and former, have a one-on-one on CNN, with a second debate, on ABC, on Sept. 10, the day after Labor Day. There are many good things here in this arrangement, which was sealed yesterday via social media (Twitter/X for Biden and Truth Social for Trump .Even though neither man is formally yet their party’s nominees (the Republicans gather in Milwaukee for their convention in mid-July, while Chicago welcomes the Democrats five weeks later this election has been well underway since Trump closed down Nikki Haley’s challenge in March, so there is no reason to wait until the fall.The Commission on Presidential Debates, created by the two parties, and which has run the debates since 1988, is being boycotted by both campaigns. Just as well, as the commission’s debates were to be on Sept. 16, Oct. 1 and Oct. 9. That calendar just doesn’t work with early voting starting on Sept. 20 in Minnesota, South Dakota and Virginia.Besides having the debates before balloting starts, we also like they are keeping out spoilers like Bobby Kennedy Jr., who cannot win. We were likewise pleased when Ross Perot was excluded from the debates in 1996 with our headline, “Ross toss no loss.”It’s also helpful that there will be no audience to applaud and boo. Let the contenders duke it out sans cheering sections.Biden only wants two debates, Trump wants more. We wouldn’t be opposed to a third, as two or three have been the norm since debates became a regular feature starting in 1976. They did debate twice four years ago, so that’s four in total.

leoweekly_2024_24,"Women need to stop being concerned with likeability.It is Women’s History Month and I’ve been thinking a lot about being a woman in a position of authority. My role is small in the scheme of women at the head of organizations but there are times when I realize that my being a woman makes my interactions with men a source of comedy and unnecessary tension.Men can be comical when confronted by strong women, but as a somewhat assertive woman who will ask for what is necessary — and needed — for my team to be at its best, I am amused when men seem even remotely put out by something I’ve said. Add to that being a Black woman, and I’m sure that the “angry Black woman” trope comes across really big to some guys.I am what I am, and what you will get is always honest and true to what I believe. I take my job seriously in that I feel a duty to my community to offer the best version of LEO that I can, and though there have been difficulties in doing that, I’m more focused than ever on returning LEO to its place of being a strong voice in Louisville.Since the LEO readership leans female, I’m writing this, in particular, to other women to say something very simple. You are capable. Trust yourself.One, if you are in a position where you make decisions, make them without apologies, and make them without the need to take care of other adult’s feelings in the process. I’m not saying to be cold and heartless but know that your decision can be and should be for the health of your role, your company, or your family — and you should never second guess or doubt your ability to make the best decisions.Too often, I find myself questioning why I’m in this role and nitpicking myself about everything I do. In the last few months, big decisions are so much of what I have been doing that I’ve learned something big about myself. I’m capable.I’ve picked a team, so far, that is also capable and I hope that as I grow in feeling empowered in my role that I can lift them up and help them feel that way too.LEO has such a legacy in this city as well, that I’ve hesitated to change aspects of the paper even if I found them tedious or outdated. But, just because something has always been doesn’t mean that it should always be. LEO needed to grow up with its years and someone had to be there to make that happen.It’s funny that this seems like such a simple thing to say to other women — “you are capable and trust yourself” — but sisters, we do need to hear it. We need other women to tell us and we need to tell other women because there are days when the “boys” club certainly doesn’t take us seriously and underestimates our skills and decision-making abilities.I’ve realized that the more I get stung by the slight sexist comment or response — even when the person doesn’t realize what they’ve said has crossed a line — the stronger and more “in-your-face” I tend to grow. It becomes a challenge and instead of feeling defeated, I do what men do. I puff out my chest and dig in my heels a bit more. Maybe it’s the right thing to do, maybe it puts me in the crosshairs, or the unemployment line but if I feel something is right, I’ll stand up for it. I learned from a long line of really amazing and stubborn women.You with me?*** ."
minnpost_2024_47,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Nineteen years ago, my daughter Julia died as a consequence of diagnostic error. She was 15-years-old. Admitted to the hospital with a mistaken diagnosis of cholecystitis (gall bladder disease , she experienced a series of inconclusive tests and counterproductive care over six days, prior to her death four hours after an ill-advised surgery.Nothing can dislodge the grief that we feel, still today, in the loss of our daughter. But we seek ways to channel this grief with our passion for patient safety — in particular, the avoidance of diagnostic error. With a passion for the cause, and the privilege of a platform to share our story, we believe we can make a difference.This is Patient Safety Awareness Week, a campaign sponsored by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement, so it seems like a good time to review what we know — and where we need to go.Twenty-three years ago, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine, or NAM challenged assumptions about medical care by publishing “To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.” The report dramatically exposed the issue of patient safety in health care and began a quiet revolution in the way in which health care organizations address the safety and quality of care. Much has changed for the better over 23 years, but the statistics are stubbornly consistent: studies estimate upwards of 400,000 preventable deaths annually, and 10-20 times that number in cases of serious harm, resulting from medical errors.A significant percentage of these totals result from diagnostic error. Another NAM report published in 2015, “Improving Diagnosis in Health Care,” promoted changes in medical education to improve clinical reasoning. There are cognitive diversions, distractions and traps along the path to an accurate, timely and effectively communicated diagnosis.In Julia’s case, the team locked in on the initial — and incorrect — diagnosis and never looked back. Imaging results and conflicting labs were rationalized to justify the assumed diagnosis. When doubt was expressed by one specialist, it was discounted, and Julia proceeded to surgery.The facts are not in dispute. Leadership at the hospital where she died acknowledged its failure within days of her death. They said the right things. They made procedural changes immediately to minimize the risk to others, and they have continued to keep Julia’s story alive as a cautionary tale for current and succeeding generations of providers.But this isn’t the case everywhere, even today. It takes courageous and consistent leadership at the very top of health care institutions to embrace and impose a culture of disclosure.Fortunately, there are examples of successful reporting systems that rise above the shame-and-blame culture of the past. But the power dynamics in any institution — inter- and intra-professional — can be a stubborn reality.The front lines of quality and safety will continue to be the thousands of providers in clinics, hospitals and other care facilities. At the point of care, providers need to remember that the patient is the expert on their own body and health. Reflexive certainty about “what’s wrong” is often, well, wrong. Confidence is a flawed predictor of diagnostic accuracy. By acknowledging uncertainty when it exists, the physician can engage the patient in additional history taking, leading to a better differential diagnosis.I’ve had 19 years to think about it: what will make for safer diagnosis in health care? I believe it will require a world where providers consistently lead above all with humility and curiosity; where they value uncertainty as an invitation to slow down and dig deeper; where they acknowledge any uncertainty to their peers on the medical team, revisiting the initial diagnosis if needed; and where they communicate clearly and honestly with the patient and family. Expressing uncertainty with care and reassurance can be a trust-building practice.Julia was, in most ways, a normal 15-year-old, alternately engaging and distant, delightful and maddening. She had a fairly normal childhood experience with medicine: a few stitches here, an infection there, a shard of plastic in her eye, and assorted athletic injuries. In adolescence, she experienced depression. She worked hard in therapy and became an outspoken mental health advocate at school and among her friends. She had much left to give.Julia trusted her doctors and was a compliant patient throughout her week in the hospital. She wanted to come home, and surgery was seen as the ticket out. Tragically, the inflamed gall bladder was only a symptom of an overlooked Epstein Barre infection — mononucleosis — and internal bleeding post-surgery was fatal.My wife and I do what we can to shine a light on diagnostic safety. There is movement, but there must be more — with patients, families, educators and professionals on the same page — to make health care safer for all.Dan Berg, of Minneapolis, is an advocate for patient safety."
eugeneweekly_2024_22,"We ve got issues. As a woman of color raised by a single mother in Eugene in the ’80s and ’90s, I would like to reintroduce myself to my hometown from my adopted hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. Per your request for letters from unheard voices — consider this someone who is speaking up and speaking out. It is sad but true, I didn’t realize I was a woman of color until I moved to New York City at the age of 19. It is a sweet and short story, but it is an interesting fact and allows me to reflect on my upbringing in our beloved unique Eugene. Growing up, I attended Waldorf School, Roosevelt Middle and South Eugene High. Due to the make-up of Eugene families, I never felt singled out for being raised by a single mother or poor. Oddly enough, those weren’t distinctive characteristics. However, being a person of color was. It would take me years of life experience and therapy for me to realize how much I was marginalized in Eugene as a person of color. It was unnecessary and sad. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. As we know, Eugene is an ethnically homogeneous society — you can argue with me on this, but it is a simple fact. As a child and teenager, I was always singled out by my friends’ parents and educators about my distinctive personality. Although I was raised by a single Latina, I was not raised with my native Peruvian parents. In Eugene, having an “odd” name was never an issue; however, being an “odd” person and outspoken woman of color came with consequences. Often, I was punished for my behavior, scolded by “respected” community members and even teased and heckled by adults and teachers. It wouldn’t be until my life in Georgia — after a decade in Los Angeles and New York City — that I realized how harmful my formative years were. As a minority in a majority minority city, Atlanta, I have a new perspective on my ethnicity and gender. Not only is it refreshing, but it is welcomed. Albeit, as an Indigenous Latina I am still the minority and at the bottom of the pay scale — I seek to be a beacon of light to other youth who suffered in silence as I did. This past fall I took the first steps of making these memories into actionable and productive social justice. In typical Eugenean fashion, I was raised in a socially conscious household with icons such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta and John F. Kennedy. I was raised on protests of the central American civil wars and taught that peace and love are always the right path. With this foundation of thought and history of oppression, I have taken my high school friend Pete Tripp’s advice: “Take your anger and put it into positive action, Ada.” I have been professionally involved with public policy, politics and issue-based campaigns for almost 25 years. What is the most actionable thing I can do to channel this anger? Well, Pete, I am running for office and seeking to flip a seat from red to blue in the Georgia State House of Representative for House District 56. I write this to let those other little brown boys in girls in Eugene who are suffering in silence know that they are being seen and heard. To these children: You will find your place in this world. I hope my running for office inspires you to reach for the moon, and you might fall amongst the stars. I hope my running for office allows you to know that youdohave a seat at the table, that your thoughts and opinions matter. You are magical. Never let anyone take that away from you, and shine your light — inside and outside, for better or worse. Thank you for listening to me."

You still with me?A chain of events that led to an unwinding of a curious Wall Street trade that spooked markets and prompted Donald Trump to make wild accusations about who was culpable for the volatility; accusations filled with standard fare red herrings and ad hominem attacks directed at his rivals—attacks, mind you, that ignored or outright obfuscated the real catalysts and culprits of the market turmoil.At first glance, a discussion about foreign currency valuations, interest rate hikes and DJT embellishing for political points for the trillionth time may sound like a snooze.

By the end of the trading day, the Nikkei would drop 12.4% after losing 5.8% the previous Friday.According to theWall Street Journal, this “once-in-a-generation free fall” was Japan’s largest single-day sell-off since Oct. 20, 1987, the Tuesday after the infamous 1987 “Black Monday” U.S. stock market crash that sent the Dow Jones Industrial average tumbling 22.6%.Subsequently, on Monday morning here in the states, 13 hours behind Tokyo, the contagion would hit lower Manhattan after spreading throughout Asia — South Korea’s KOSPI fell 9%, Taiwan’ Taiex dropped 8.4%, while India’s Sensex closed down almost 2.7% down.The S&P would open down 3.5%, “with fewer than 50 stocks in positive territory, while the Nasdaq slumped more than 5%,”as reported byBusiness Insider.Worse yet, at 8:30 AM, an hour before the bell in premarket trading,the VIX, an important volatility indicator, also known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” which had remained depressed for months due to an unrelenting bull market, spiked dramatically from Thursday-afternoon’s low of 15.71, shooting to a high of 65.73, “the highest level since the pandemic market plunge in 2020,”according to CNBC.Importantly, 8:30 AM would also prove to be a key technical pivot point, as buyers from big institutions, using complex (and opaque algorithmic trading technology, jumped back into the market on heavy volume.From this time stamp forward, stocks would rebound throughout the day and never let up — a key fact no one in legacy media cared to mention. Moreover, the buying momentum would carry over into Tuesday’s trading session, as stocks and indexes closed in the green, while the VIX would conversely fall back below 25, asThe Fearquickly subsided.But by now, Trump, like a rabid dog, had tunnel vision. Ignoring the signs of a reversal, after having devised a newalliterative nicknameto pigeonhole yet another political opponent, at 10:02 AM Trump posted again to Truth Social, this time to brand Vice President Kamala Harris, “KAMALA CRASH”!Following suit, fifteen minutes later, the House GOP Judiciary Committeetweeted, “If you look at your 401k today, remember that it was brought to you by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.”Even Trump s running mate Sen. JD Vance, got in on the action. The multi-millionaire author of the 2016 memoirHillbilly Elegy, and former venture capitalist, whose senate campaign was partially financed (to the tune of $15 million dollars by his former boss, the conservative Silicon Valley billionaire andself-professed monopolistPeter Theil,wrote:“This moment could set off a real economic calamity around the globe. It requires steady leadership — the kind President Trump delivered for four years. Kamala Harris is too afraid to answer media questions and cannot lead us through these troubled times.”But nowhere in these reductive broadsides,describedas “toddler tantrums” by oneNew York Timeseditorial, did Trump or his underlings provide any data or context around current market conditions, the cause of Japan’s crash, or the real saga hiding in plain sight: Wall Street’s latest leveraged scheme.Background on Market Dynamics and Yen Carry TradeDespite high interest rates and sticky inflation numbers, serious fears of a recession at the start of the year were averted due to both a strong labor force and soaring Big Tech stocks, fueled by an exuberant, if not propagandistic, AI innovation narrative that helped propel an indefatigable rally in all three major U.S. stock indexes.The market-cap-weighted S&P hit new all-time highs31 times in the first six monthsof the year, led by the “Magnificent Seven” mega-cap tech stocks — Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon — but especially by the semiconductor Nvidia, which gained nearly 150% in the first half of the year.Nevertheless, because the pump was so unbridled and narrowly focused around AI euphoria, Wall Street analystshave been predicting for some time, while not raising alarm bells about when, a healthy correction to the bullish buying mania would come. Last month that correction came, as bears at least temporarily took back control, while the “smart money” from large institutions began “rotating” out of overbought growth stocks.But overbought mega-caps wasn’t the only factor weighing on traders and investors minds that contributed to selling pressure.On July 31, at the Federal Reserve’s news conference, Chair Jerome Powell announced, to some surprise, the Fed would keep interest rates elevated for yet another month — between 5.25% and 5.5%. While Powellsignaledthey would finally make their first rate cut in September, concerns the central bank was cutting too late, and thus getting behind the curve, reinvigorated new fears of a recession and led to further selling.The weight of the Fed’s decision was also compounded two days later by the Friday’s jobs report released on August 2. Although the labor market was still adding jobs, the rapid pace coming out of the pandemic had slowed, and July’s unemployment numbers grew to their highest levels since 2021,as reportedby the Labor Department.Furthermore, July kicked off the second quarter earnings season. Multiple big tech companies — from Google to Microsoft to Amazon — issued results that according to theFinancial Times,“underwhelmed investors.”Each of these catalysts played a role in recent market volatility, and one could tangentially try to link them to the White House.But they weren’t THE story. The flash global selloff and sharp spike in the VIX last Monday had less to do with traditional stock rotation, the Fed’s intransigence, lackluster employment numbers, spotty tech earnings, or for that matter, Biden’s and Harris’s policies, and more to do with Wall Street’s latest Big Bet, in the world’s largest casino, that finally went bust.A widely made bet across Wall Street but fairly shrouded from Main Street’s gaze, which once uncovered, would explain the symbiotic relationship between the tectonic rise of Big Tech stocks and subsequent rapid crash of Japan’s stock market.The Yen Carry TradeSince the 1990s, after a Japanese asset bubble burst, and followed by a period of deflation, Japan made it a priority to keep interest rates at hyper low levels for decades.Even coming out of the pandemic, when many central banks around the world began to raise rates to fight rampant inflation, Japan stayed the course and kept rates suppressed, even in negative territory.According toBusiness Insider, this created “a divergence in monetary policy that affected the Japanese yen, which sank to a near four-decade low against the strong US dollar last month.”This currency divergence created a trading opportunity, known as the carry trade that became in vogue among large Wall Street institutions, especially in the last several years amidst U.S. rate hikes that on the one hand made borrowing expensive at home, and on the other, helped turn Japan into the largest creditor nation in the world.Investment banks, hedge funds and currency traders, all hunting for value and/or ways to manufacture money out of thin air, found a magical haven in Japan, and began borrowing vast sums — no one knows exactly how much, some estimates are upwards of a trillion dollars — of the devalued yen at or below zero percent interest rates.Once the money was borrowed, these institutional players then “carried” the interest-free cash over, pouring it back into other asset classes that could produce a sizable return, i.e., U.S. treasuries, the Mexican peso, Big Tech stocks, as well as riskier assets like Bitcoin.The banks and hedge funds were BETTING that both the Japanese currency would continue to flounder or fall in relation to the strong dollar, while Japan’s central bank would continue to keep interest rates at near zero levels. If the levels stayed the same, they could continue to leverage the capital they’d borrowed with little risk while dumping the money into high flying equities like Nvidia for a handsome return.But — there’s always a “but” — on July 31, the same day as the Federal Reserve announced its decision to hold interest rates steady for one more month before beginning to cut, the Bank of Japan raised its interest rates from .1 percent to .25 percent to stop the slide of the yen against the U.S. dollar; this change came just four months after Japan raised rates above zero for the first time in 17 years.These small but noticeable rate hikes had a profound impact on the yield on the yen, which increased in value 7.5% at the beginning of last week. That might sound good on its face. Yay! The price of yen is going up baby! Let’s pop some bottles of Cristal!But for Wall Street whales banking on the currency to stay depressed and interest free, it was the worst-case scenario.When the price of yen in relation to the greenback jumped, those who had borrowed now owed far more than the purchase price they bought in at, which led to margin calls, requiring borrowers to put up a larger amount of collateral if they wanted to remain in their loans that had now ballooned in cost, or be forced to immediately pay them back.Because a healthy portion of the money that was borrowed was sunk into U.S. tech stocks, investors began unrolling their trades in those stocks to pay off their debts owed in borrowed yen.Worst yet, because these traders began selling viciously stateside and buying-back viciously abroad, it both sullied the momentum of our stock market (as well at the price of Bitcoin , and conversely pumped Japan’s currency, which led to a currency SHORT SQUEEZE.As more borrowers realized they were under water in their loans, more began paying them back, and as the currency debt was paid off, the more the yen increased in value, which created a nasty cyclical effect that ultimately led Japan’s stock market to crash.DénouementThough Harris and Biden are intimately connected to Wall Street interests, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a fool or a liar, the yen carry trade and subsequent selloff — albeit modest and temporary — is not of their doing.(Of note, both the U.S. and Japan’s stock markets ended this past Friday at the same levels they were the previous Friday before the sell-off, while the VIX fell below 20 to close out the week, as if Monday’s flash-crash never happened .It’s also important to point out: you should never associate the strength of the stock market with how everyday Americans are doing — I understand this reality all too well personally.Inflation is too high. Wages aren’t keeping up. Credit card interest rates are criminal. The housing market is inaccessible to most working-class Americans. And no matter what the talking heads and analyst worms on CNBC proclaim, for many Americans, life is more economically challenging now than it was five years ago.Not because Trump was The Messiah, but because exiting the pandemic companies realized they could gouge customers on products we need, like groceries and gas, and there was very little we could do about it. A reality that’s unlikely to be curtailed under either a Trump or Harris administration.Nevertheless, the stock market is the primary economic indicator DJT has pointed to time-and-again, in and out of office as proof of economic strength; ergo, if Trump were in office right now, he’d be gloating to hog heaven about how strong the stock market is.Furthermore, the main takeaway is: no matter who is president, Wall Street and its house of cards is always up to some new gimmick, that’s always the same old gimmick, just with a slightly different twist.Like heroin junkies they cannot help themselves. Every five to ten years like clockwork their speculative bets break America’s piggy bank—for which they should be held accountable—but are not by a congress that fails to provide proper oversight and regulation — WHICH OF COURSE THE GOP DEFINITELY DOESN’T WANT.Generally, The Insiders get their own money out before everyday folks are left holding the bag. In the bag is a recession, layoffs, housing crashes and other excrement.We’ll have to see if the unwinding of the carry trade is over.According to some analysts, it’s only 50 to 60% unwound.Kit Juckes, a global strategist imparted his stance on the unfolding saga, in a message to his clients last Monday, as reported by CNN, writing:“You can’t unwind the biggest carry trade the world has ever seen without breaking a few heads.”*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_174,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°About a year and a half ago, I became one of Those People who track how many steps they walk each day. I know there’s nothing magical about the daily 10,000-step target, but it’s a fun little pastime, made more fun by the fact that I surpass 10,000 most days without really trying.That’s because I live in Manhattan, with a dog to walk, errands to run and a commute that usually consists either of a subway ride and then a walk across Central Park, or a bike ride mostly through the park during which I occasionally go slowly enough that the steps app on my phone thinks I’m running. (It also doesn’t hurt that the nearest coffee here at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters is half a block away from my desk. Away from home, hitting 10,000 has proved much harder. There have been exceptions, such as visits to San Francisco and Mexico City during which I walked even more than I usually do in New York. But stays in the Vermont and California countryside, the suburbs of San Francisco and Washington, and the islands of Hawaii and Oahu all dragged down my average (10,506 steps a day since I started; 11,300 over the past year .It’s not just me. Most Americans don’t live in places like Manhattan, and they walk a lot fewer than 10,000 steps a day. A study published in 2010 found that US adults averaged 5,117 steps daily and that this was lower than the averages found in similar studies in Switzerland, western Australia and Japan. Another study from 2017, using smartphone activity data from 111 countries and territories, found that US participants averaged 4,774 steps a day, which was below the global average of 4,961 although not by much (Hong Kong was tops at 6,880, while El Salvador came in last at 3,370 .This is definitely a lot less than people used to walk. The pre-Industrial Revolution norm has been estimated at 10,000 to 18,000 steps a day, and data from the US Census Bureau hint that Americans used to get in a lot more steps six decades ago, with the share of workers who commute primarily by walking falling sharply since 1960 (the percentage getting to work by public transportation, which often involves a lot of walking, is also way down, from 12.1% in 1960 to 3.2% in 2022 .Statistics on walking and biking to school, from the Federal Highway Administration’s National Household Travel Survey, are spottier and less reliable but also show a big decline since 1969, when 42% of schoolchildren mostly biked or walked, and a mostly flat trajectory over the past couple of decades, with 10.4% biking or walking in 2017. A comparative study published in 2020 found the US to be among the countries where kids were least likely to use “active transportation” — walking, bikes, scooters, etc. — to get to school, and that was using a different US survey that found a much higher percentage than the NHTS. (I’ve included countries with data that seemed most comparable to that of the US in the chart; there are many more in the study. The explanation for the decline in walking since the 1960s and Americans’ below-average international showing seems clear: It’s cars. During the second half of the 20th century, almost all new development in the US was oriented around automobiles, and the US became one of the most car-dependent countries on the planet. If you live or work or both in a place built for cars, walking more than short distances tends to be something you have to set out to do intentionally. It’s exercise, not a way of getting from point A to point B. So most people do less of it, with likely implications for obesity rates, life expectancy and other measures that have been headed in the wrong direction in the US in recent years.A key metric tracked in that 2017 smartphone-based study of walking around the world was what the authors, a group of Stanford University computer science, engineering and medical researchers, called “activity inequality.” This measured how widely dispersed the number of daily steps was among a population, and was according to the authors “a better predictor of obesity prevalence in the population than average activity volume.” Some people will exercise a lot no matter where they are, but places where even those at the low end of the walking scale get in a respectable number of steps are likely to have better health outcomes.The US had the fifth-highest activity inequality among 46 countries for which this was measured, behind only Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada and Egypt (Hong Kong’s was lowest . Among US cities for which the study had data, activity inequality was highest in Arlington, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Fort Worth, Texas; Virginia Beach, Virginia; and Cleveland; it was lowest in New York, Boston, Jersey City, Washington and San Francisco.Over the past few decades these low-activity-inequality cities all experienced revivals, returning to growth after decades of decline. As the first chart above shows, the share of people walking or biking to work also rose slightly in the 2000s (as did the public transportation share .The urban revival began to fizzle in the mid-2010s. One reason was simple demographics, as members of the gigantic millennial generation began to age out of their urbanophile 20s and into their more suburb-oriented 30s. But it was also that cities and walkable older suburbs failed to add much new housing even as demand revived, while communities on the fringes of metropolitan areas continued to build: 78% of US housing supply growth from 1980 to 2018 was in low-density suburbs.Then came the Covid-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down many of the activities that make cities attractive and brought what seems to be a permanent shift toward remote work. This has brought declines for all modes of commuting, with public transportation experiencing the steepest drop-off and the percentage declines for biking and walking roughly similar to those for cars. Big cities also lost population while the suburban fringe and some scenic rural areas and small towns gained.Some remote workers are using the time they save by not commuting to exercise more. Transportation data provider StreetLight found, for example, that average daily biking trips in the US rose 37% from 2019 to 2022 even as bike commuting fell. But StreetLight also registered a 36% decline in average daily walking trips over that period. Overall, I would assume that the decline in commuting and the population shift from cities has resulted in Americans getting even less physical activity than they did before the pandemic, with activity inequality rising. Thanks to the arrival of weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, this may not translate into rising obesity, but it still seems bad.Turning around the activity decline would probably require another urban revival, which seems like a tough sell right now. When it comes to where people choose to live, I think many in the US exhibit what Marxists call false consciousness — they’ve been so brainwashed by car culture that they don’t understand they’d be healthier and happier living someplace where they didn’t always need to drive. But it’s also true that the places in the US that are most friendly to pedestrians often aren’t so friendly in other ways. Housing can be extremely expensive, the schools often underperform, there are issues with crime and public disorder.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_55,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°I watched the Biden-Trump debate alone in a Lisbon, Portugal, hotel room, and it made me weep. I cannot remember a more heartbreaking moment in American presidential campaign politics in my lifetime, precisely because of what it revealed: Joe Biden, a good man and a good president, has no business running for reelection. And Donald Trump, a malicious man and a petty president, has learned nothing and forgotten nothing. He is the same fire hose of lies he always was, obsessed with his grievances — nowhere close to what it will take for America to lead in the 21st century.The Biden family and political team must gather quickly and have the hardest of conversations with the president, a conversation of love and clarity and resolve. To give America the greatest shot possible of deterring the Trump threat in November, the president has to come forward and declare that he will not be running for reelection and is releasing all of his delegates for the Democratic National Convention.The Republican Party — if its leaders had an ounce of integrity — would demand the same, but it won’t, because they don’t. That makes it all the more important that Democrats put the country’s interests first and announce that a public process will begin for different Democratic candidates to compete for the nomination — town halls, debates, meetings with donors, you name it. Yes, it could be chaotic and messy when the Democratic convention starts on Aug. 19 in Chicago, but I think the Trump threat is sufficiently grave that delegates could quickly rally around and nominate a consensus candidate.If Vice President Kamala Harris wants to compete, she should. But voters deserve an open process in search of a Democratic presidential nominee who can unite not only the party but also the country, by offering something neither man on that Atlanta stage did Thursday night: a compelling description of where the world is right now and a compelling vision for what America can and must do to keep leading it — morally, economically and diplomatically.Because this is no ordinary hinge of history we are at. We are at the start of the biggest technological disruptions and the biggest climate disruption in human history. We are at the dawn of an artificial intelligence revolution that is going to change EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE — how we work, how we learn, how we teach, how we trade, how we invent, how we collaborate, how we fight wars, how we commit crimes and how we fight crimes. Maybe I missed it, but I did not hear the phrase “artificial intelligence” mentioned by either man at the debate.If there was ever a time that the world needs an America at its best, led by its best, it is now — for great dangers and opportunities are now upon us. A younger Joe Biden could have been that leader, but time has finally caught up with him. And that was painfully and inescapably obvious Thursday.I had been ready to give Biden the benefit of the doubt up to now, because during the times I engaged with him one on one, I found him up to the job. He clearly is not any longer. His family and his staff had to have known that. They have been holed up at Camp David preparing for this momentous debate for days now. If that is the best performance they could summon from him, it’s time for him to keep the dignity he deserves and leave the stage at the end of this term.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.Mahalo for quick response by HECO"
eugeneweekly_2024_34,"We ve got issues. Right now Black women are focusing on the greater good in no other way or direction that we have ever had in the history of this country. Black women have factually driven all social rights movements to success, have held and healed the pain in our own communities and offered guidance to every other community. Black women have continued on from the naysayers, misogyny, systemic, institutional, personal racism to being the highest educated group in the U.S. for the past five years — dominating with grace and even humility. Having a woman run the very institutions designed to maintain her position as subservient is uncomfortable. It’s uncomfortable for white folx, it’s uncomfortable for Black folx. There is uncertainty of loyalty, of the damage endured through the positions Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has held. I see that she centers herself within two cultures that are not white. There are conversations and approaches to life she has had as she grew up that were only conversations of excellence about how to be 10 times better just to get half the recognition. This mentality has to be deeply ingrained as it shapes your identity. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Harris was taught and groomed in extremely Black institutions and in every level of her education her identity was enriched. After this, her accomplishments throughout her employment as an attorney, a DA, and the vice president of the U.S. are all indications that not only does she understand white supremacy culture but can navigate it without losing her grounding. That is remarkable. There are no institutional establishments within this country that aren’t working diligently to prevent this level of accomplishment for women of the global majority, for women who are non-white. To their distress, the people of the global majority have awoken and are rightfully occupying positions that can help our communities. We are all trying to work around or through the institutions that uphold the privileged for first place in opportunities they could grow in. I believe that supremacy, by nature, lacks dimension. The lack of creativity, cultural exposure, humility, mental and spiritual balance, discipline and drive aren’t synonyms with privilege. However, to survive white supremacy those very traits are what not only help you survive it, but dismantle it and recreate a community of belonging. Black women know this. Black women not only teach it, share it, but exude it, and just by the evidence of nothing ever being shared or handed to us, we’ve created it. To this day, we will still make sure the youngest, weakest, most frustrated are heard, seen and included. There is no question that being Black matters. There is no question that being an aware Black woman is a force to be reckoned with, but this force is not the same you are used to. It doesn’t come in the form of oppression, it comes in the form of expectation — the expectation is that we, as a collective community, can do hard things. To people who doubt the ability of Black women, there’s no need to apologize. Even if we make it to the end of this election cycle and are able to help curate a new direction for this country, it will be difficult. Just commit to yourself, to do better. Work on deconstructing old beliefs that haven’t served you. It’s not because someone is Black or a woman or non-binary, disabled, or an immigrant as to why they have a position or a ranking. Nothing has beengivenaway. It is because they forgave, they ignored, they focused on a bigger picture and persisted anyway. Things you’ve never seen, things we’ve collectively only dreamed of, can be done with a dedication to what is best for the greater good of humanity. This is a Black woman’s motto. We can love through hate, and if Black women haven’t shown you anything else, I’m willing to bet, it’s that.

minnpost_2024_7,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As we debate what constitutes a livable wage in Minnesota – with the current $15.57 an hour minimum wage in Minneapolis and St. Paul considered by many to be inadequate to cover living costs here — be aware that there is a group of workers earning far, far less.Minnesota has the dubious distinction of having the second highest per-capita rate of people with disabilities earning wages that are below the federal minimum. This is legal because of Section 14c of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which allows employers to pay workers with disabilities less than minimum wage. Created to boost employment for people with disabilities, today it keeps many in poverty, without opportunities for advancement. It is time to phase out the use of the 14c Special Wage certificate. We don’t need this relic of the past.Today, approximately 40,500 workers with disabilities around the country are paid under this certificate, including approximately 3,100 in Minnesota, according to theU.S. Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division. Other states with high rates of people with disabilities earning subminimum wages include Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.For nearly a decade, I worked for a service provider and managed a team of direct support professionals (DSPs . In 2017, we let go of the 14c Special Wage certificate to focus solely on community employment at or above minimum wage. There was anxiety during this transition, from people receiving services, their parents and guardians, and from other members of their support teams. We approached our business partners and were able to re-negotiate our contracts and bring people’s wages up to the minimum. Some of the employers we had contracts with were not aware that some individuals doing the work were paid below minimum wage. The response from our business partners was overwhelmingly positive, with some choosing to hire folks directly. One business decided to end their contract with us, and my team used a person-centered, customized approach to find every one of those workers competitive jobs in their community. Change is scary and the transition took time and planning, but the sky did not fall. No one lost services or found themselves sitting at home, and our doors did not shut.Minnesota benefits in several ways by making sure people with disabilities have opportunities to find competitive jobs in the community. Competitive employment is one way out of poverty, and it expands people’s skills, which creates new workers who can fill jobs as labor shortages continue. Work provides people with and without disabilities more opportunities to expand their social networks. When I think about the friends I’ve made at work over the years, I realize I probably never would have met them elsewhere. Having a job that you enjoy and are good at benefits your mental health.Advances in assistive technology and training are helping people with disabilities find and keep jobs in the community they enjoy. Phasing out 14c Special Wage certificates alone won’t remove all the barriers to employment for people with disabilities. According to Minnesota’sDepartment of Employment and Economic Development,there is a large gap in employment rates for people with and without disabilities. And even entry-level jobs paying minimum wage – as advocates have pointed out – don’t truly provide a living wage, but it’s a start.Legislationhas been introduced in St. Paul this session that will phase out 14c Special Wage certificates in Minnesota by 2028. It’s up to us to let our elected officials know these certificates are outdated and harmful, and that better options exist for people with disabilities to live full lives in the community.Brian Begin is an education program specialist at the University of Minnesota’s Institute on Community Integration.

minnpost_2024_51,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As we reflect on nearly 79 years since the Victory in Europe and nearly 80 years since the historic event of D-Day, it remains crucial to uphold the memory of World War II. This pivotal period not only signified the triumph of allied forces but also highlighted the resilience and bravery of ordinary individuals who rose from the challenges of the Great Depression to defend freedom.As part of the five-member team of the American Battle Monuments Commission World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, I collaborated often with World War II veterans to design and build the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., which wasdedicated in 2004. The memorial honors the 16 million — including more than 350,000 women — who served in the armed forces of the U.S. during World War II, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war effort from home.Symbolizing the defining event of the 20th Century, the National World War II Memorial serves as a testament to the spirit, sacrifice, and steadfast commitment of the American people to defend their nation and uphold the universal values of peace and freedom. Today, it is a perpetual reminder of the nation’s enduring gratitude to the “Greatest Generation.” Through their unparalleled sacrifice, courage, dedication and unwavering determination, they not only safeguarded the cherished freedoms of Americans but also secured the nation’s future and played a pivotal role in fostering global peace.However, as time marches on, the memorial is beginning to show signs of wear and tear, necessitating repairs and maintenance to ensure its continued reverence and dignity.This is why the passage of the Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Act in 2022 is so significant. By authorizing the U.S. Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the National World War II Memorial, this act not only honors the brave Americans who fought to defend our nation but also provides vital support for the upkeep of the memorial itself.The Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin program from the United States Mint will showcase and honor the National World War II Memorial through gold $5, silver $1 and clad $.50 coins, each with its own unique and storied design. Importantly, the mint’s programs are self-sustaining and operate at no cost to the taxpayer.Proceeds from the sale of the coins will go to theFriends of the National World War II Memorialto support the National Park Service in the care and maintenance of the memorial and to ensure educational and commemorative programming remains robust and substantial. The Friends of the National World War II Memorial play an integral and vital role in educating the American public about World War II, preserving and maintaining the memorial as a treasure for the American people and facilitating key commemorative programs at the memorial.I am immensely proud of my work to help the memorial take its rightful place on the National Mall. Almost 80 years after the end of the war, we must continue to capture and archive the memories of our WWII veterans and honor and preserve the legacy and lessons of our “Greatest Generation.”Retired Brig. Gen. Evelyn “Pat” Foote, of Woodbury, was part of the American Battle Monuments Commission World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee and was the founding president of the Alliance for National Defense."

As the years passed, it’s gotten too small for her and her mom, and the cracks have started to show. Even with the windows closed, you can feel a breeze. No matter the season, it’s the same temperature inside as it is outside, regardless of how hard the heaters and air-conditioners work. The plumbing has broken several times, and the landlord — without fail — opts for a Band-Aid fix that only solves the problem temporarily. To do it right, Luna and her mom had to pay for repairs themselves.» READ MORE:Philly teens have become desensitized to the epidemic of drugs, homelessness | OpinionLuna’s mom has been searching for anywhere else to live for months. From online listings to calling the numbers on “for rent” signs, the outcome is the same: too expensive.The only thing keeping them in the same apartment is that the landlord doesn’t and hasn’t raised the rent in years. They feellucky for that. That’s the only reason they’ve been able to afford everything they needed and a little more. The day they move is the day all of that will change.Rent in Philadelphia hasreached astronomically high levels, especially with the post-COVID-19 boom of people looking for new housing after being cooped up during the pandemic. Not to mentionthe cost of buying a house these days, which is impossible for many because of the income requirements and high mortgage rates.Those unable to find housing within their budget are stuck spending more than they can afford just to have a roof over their heads.More than54% of Philadelphia renters are “cost-burdened”— meaning they spend more than 30% of their household income on housing costs. That’s about 800,000 people. On top of that,nearly one-quarter of Philadelphia residents live in poverty.Many residents feel lucky when they are able to find affordable housing. But they soon realize that a large number of these residencesare in a state of disrepair.We can relate to this personally. Here are only a few things both of our families have had to repair since we each moved into our abodes, with or without landlord help: faulty plumbing (the shower, the washer and dryer, the toilet, and almost every sink , the hot water and central heating/cooling system, the roof (on several occasions , the screen door, garage door, and front windows (none would open , and the entire bathroom (three cheers for broken porcelain .This is not to say the government doesn’t help at all; the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Philadelphia Housing Authority have been working to help low-income families with housing vouchers. Last year, HUDcreated a new plan to increase the value of housing vouchers, based on the fair market rent for the zip code, so they cover 70% of the cost of housing.But when it comes to vouchers,the demand is still much higher than the supply. Last year, the website for the PHA — which administers the voucher program — crashed right after it reopened, due to overwhelming demand. Because of limited funds, thousands remain stuck on the waiting list. In March 2023, the PHA stated itonly supported around 18,405 households with vouchers— this, in a city where around one out of four households live in poverty.The demand is still much higher than the supply.And even though it is illegal, many landlordsrefuse to accept housing vouchers— to the point where the PHA startedoffering bonuses to landlordswho take vouchers and may even pay the security deposits of these households. What’s more, many landlords’ rent prices arehigher than fair market rent pricesas defined by the HUD, so the voucher won’t be enough to cover costs.Housing vouchers are a good solution, but they need to be fixed. We need more funding so vouchers can be handed out with more money and to more people, hopefully cutting down the waiting list. In order to give renters who rely on vouchers better options for housing, landlords refusing to accept these vouchers must be heavily penalized.In addition, there should be some incentives for landlords to abide by fair market rent prices, which will make it easier for voucher recipients to find a home.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker’s 2025 budgetdoes address some of our concerns — such as adding 30,000 housing units and allocating funding to housing repair — but it doesn’t go nearly far enough. We believe the Philadelphia government and the PHA — thefourth-largest housing authority in the nation, and the largest landlord in Pennsylvania — can do far more to help low-income renters.Housing is a right and should be accessible to everyone regardless of economic status. We hope one day that becomes a reality.Gianna Luna is a senior at Central High School desperate to move out of her neighborhood. Anna Cadogan is a senior at Central High School."
suffolknewsherald_2024_28,"Published 5:57 pm Tuesday, June 11, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy Jason StumpWould you like to be loved and supported by an entire community of people?Not long ago, I was eating a late lunch or early dinner in the Publix seating area on Godwin Boulevard. As I recall, it was Wednesday, which meant $5 sushi. When I am out and alone like that, I enjoy the quiet time. I also tend to observe, especially people.More often than not, I find good in this world. Maybe my mind has to reach for it, but I find it—I guess because I am actively looking for it. The bad, disturbing, and frustrating stuff will find its way to us all on their own.This day I didn’t have to reach far to see good. There were two young children and two adults at a table. I assumed one to be their parent or grandparent. The other, whatever role they had, was assisting the little boy with math work. Not just helping him but also helping him learn. As a former middle school math teacher at King’s Fork Middle School, this made my heart happy. Not just the fact that they were together doing this but also the manner in which it was being done. The tutor was encouraging but kept expectations. She assured her student that he absolutely would be able to do this, but of course, it’s hard to learn to do a new thing— sometimes very hard. She was as much a mentor and motivator as an academic tutor. The caregiver, the adult, and the other child remained present but not distracting while the little girl completed her assignments.That young prince was polite, diligent and persistent. The whole scene was impressive and good for my heart. Alone, at Publix, there was so much human good being displayed. It was lovely!I felt like perhaps I was watching too closely and worried that I’d come off in the wrong way. Then, as I was leaving, I apologized for interrupting and then told the young man how very impressed I was with him. I used to be a math teacher, and I would’ve loved to have him as a student. Their understandably initial shock turned to smiles. I also shared a compliment with the rest of that familial team, also praising his sister for her diligence.I know it was a random thing to do, perhaps even risky these days, but it was also the kind of thing that I’ve found so very important in life — important for me, and important to do for others.Leadership and inspiration guru Simon Sinek says something: we all need people who will support us, with accountability and unwavering encouragement. Someone to tell us we are on the wrong path and someone to be right beside us when we go down that path and right off the cliff. We all need that.Research shows that. In the book Give and Take, Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, cites several studies. In one case, elementary school students are given a test. After the test, the teachers are told of the 20% who are most likely to show the most cognitive growth that year. At the end of the year, another test is given. Amazingly, that 20% turns out to do exactly that.Here’s what makes that really, really amazing. The students who teachers believed scored in a way that would indicate their potential for growth were actually chosen at random. The test didn’t actually measure what the teachers were told it did, nor could it have done that.What they did find is that the teacher’s belief in these students resulted in: offering those students more positive reinforcement, calling on those students more, and other behaviors that boosted the children’s belief in their own abilities and positive feelings about school. Grant went on to cite similar research supporting the same positive results from those behaviors.Wouldn’t you like to know you are loved and supported by an entire community? That people you don’t even know are rooting for you? That they believe you are created for good and have the assumption that you will do your best to do good with your life? Wouldn’t you like that? Even if, for some reason, it doesn’t result in concrete outcomes, at the very least, your well-being, self-esteem and self-respect are improved.I’ll make a deal with you, Suffolk. In fact, it’s not even a tit-for-tat thing. I want you to know that God loves you, supports you and is rooting for you, and that you are created for good purposes. So do I.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_123,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, is done with his state Senate’s GOP shenanigans when it comes to this year’s presidential ballot. The governor called a rare special session for the legislature to pass a bill ensuring Joe Biden appears alongside Donald Trump on the November ballot after much foot-dragging by his own party.Very basically, Ohio has a ballot deadline of Aug. 7, which comes before the Democrats’ mid-August convention to officially renominate the president. The legislature put itself in this predicament and has resolved it easily before, but in this case, Republican senators are demanding that the bill be tied to an effort to further restrict the possibility of foreign cash in state ballot elections.We appreciate not only DeWine’s efforts but his exasperation; in calling the special session, the governor said that failing to get Biden on the ballot “is simply unacceptable. This is ridiculous. This is an absurd situation.”DeWine should push to have a clean bill, and his is the right attitude to have; the constant political machinations around voting and elections, predominantly infecting today’s GOP, are now so common as to seem pedestrian. Yet we can’t lose sight of the consequences: voter disenfranchisement by design, which strikes right at the core of the American democratic project.Free and fair elections are what precedes all else, what enables our system to exist at all. After chipping away at things like campaign finance limits and disclosure requirements, antidemocratic actors are increasingly targeting the ability to vote itself.Ohio’s Republican state senators can argue that this whole kerfuffle isn’t about disenfranchisement one or another, but about their push to (apparently redundantly ban foreign money advocating on state ballot questions — a mission that seems to have become rather urgent for them in the aftermath of the decisive victory of an abortion rights amendment.But that doesn’t really matter, and neither do the merits of this legislation. Keeping the sitting president off the ballot on a technicality is never appropriate, as a bargaining chip or otherwise. At least the governor has intervened to put a stop to the nonsense, unlike Republican brass in other states, who have embraced the approach.In Texas, where the party has become a laboratory for red-meat, own-the-libs policy under Gov. Greg Abbott, the official GOP platform approved this past weekend would — among planks calling abortion “homicide” and reinstating the names of traitorous Confederates to military bases — essentially guarantee that Republicans cannot lose statewide office. This would be achieved by requiring that all candidates for statewide office carry a majority of the state’s 254 counties, despite the fact that huge swaths of the population live in a comparatively tiny number of urban counties.As the Texas Tribune pointed out, in the 2022 governor’s race, Abbott won 235 counties — 92.5% — while winning the actual vote by only 55% to Democrat Beto O’Rourke’s 44%. Rather than arguing to voters that they’re the superior choice, the state Republican Party seems keen on simply removing that choice altogether for offices like U.S. senator, state attorney general and governor. This is something the American public, regardless of affiliation, should never accept.—New York Daily News/TNS"
suffolknewsherald_2024_90,"Published 5:14 pm Tuesday, January 23, 2024ByStaff ReportsDrew VarnerIn an unprecedented move, the Texas State Guard, bolstered by roughly 10,000 troops, along with roughly 1,000 from the Florida State Guard, has assumed control of a vital point along the Texas border at Shelby Park. This operation, commencing on Jan. 10, signifies a major escalation in the ongoing dispute between state and federal authorities regarding immigration policies and border control.Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, a known hotspot for migrant crossings, has emerged as the epicenter of this intensifying conflict. The intervention by the Texas and Florida state guards has effectively barred Border Patrol access to this area, starkly opposing the objectives of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS and the federal government.Remarkably, the National Guard’s deployment seems to have drastically impacted migrant crossings. Reports suggest a plummet from around 13,000 daily crossings to merely a handful, highlighting the complex nature of border security and immigration enforcement.The recent alteration of the Title 42 border policy, initially a public health order during the COVID-19 pandemic enabling rapid migrant removal and blockade, is a key factor behind Texas’s stance. The policy’s termination has shifted from a ‘catch and release’ approach back into allowing migrants to seek asylum in the heartland of the United States. This change, reportedly accompanied by Border Patrol agents aiding in asylum efforts, marks a significant deviation from earlier practices and has heightened concerns among Texas officials and residents about potential increases in illegal border crossings and associated criminal activities, particularly those involving cartels.The White House has issued a stark warning in response, indicating, with the support of the Supreme Court, to allow board patrol to remove barbed fencing. This pronouncement suggests a possible rapid escalation in the conflict between the federal government and the state of Texas.This confrontation transcends mere border security concerns, reflecting deeper, long-standing issues between federal and state authorities over immigration policies and national security. The tension underlines the contentious nature of these issues across multiple administrations.Observers express concern that without a prompt and diplomatic resolution, this standoff could mark a critical turning point in federal-state relations, especially concerning immigration and border security, increasingly regarded as national security crises. Even to the extent that independent journalist are reporting on migrants crossing who are eluding that the American people “will soon know who we are”, and presumed to threaten the journalist.The revised policy, moving from expulsion to asylum assistance, has been a significant shift, provoking Texas to take a proactive role in border security, leading to the current impasse with federal authorities.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_96,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have captured most of the public attention when it comes to thinking about U.S. foreign policy, and rightly so, given the devastating human consequences. But there is another issue that cannot be ignored if we want to secure the future of life on this planet — a new nuclear arms race.The Pentagon has committed $2 trillion to producing a new generation of nuclear weapons over the next three decades, and Russia and China are in the midst of their own buildups. Most of the nuclear arms control agreements that helped stave off a nuclear confrontation during the Cold War lie in tatters, and the last major U.S.-Russia accord — the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty – is hanging by a thread.These developments, along with Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats in connection with the war in Ukraine, have prompted the expert group assembled by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to set their Doomsday Clock— a measure of the risk of a nuclear war — at just 90 seconds to midnight.But Congress and the Biden administration have a chance to reverse the momentum toward a conflict no one wants, and few if any could survive. They should rethink the U.S. commitment to the most dangerous weapon in our arsenal — intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs . Experts like former Defense Secretary William Perry have pointed out that ICBMs are particularly high risk because a president would only have a matter of minutes to decide whether to launch them amid threat of an attack, greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm.Despite these dangers, until now, ICBMs have been politically invulnerable due to a combination of a misguided nuclear doctrine and the power of the corporations and members of Congress that benefit directly or indirectly from the billions we spend building and maintaining them.That may be about to change. Huge cost overruns on the new ICBM, known as the Sentinel, have forced the Pentagon to review the program. The estimated procurement cost of the system has jumped by a hefty 37% in the last few years alone, with lifetime costs of at least $315 billion. The cost growth has triggered the Pentagon review, which could recommend anything from canceling the program to going full speed ahead at the expense of other defense priorities.Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin should take advantage of this moment to rethink, and ideally terminate, the Sentinel program as a first step toward removing ICBMs from the arsenal altogether. The United States has more than enough nuclear warheads on bombers and submarine-based missiles to dissuade any adversary from attacking us. Getting rid of ICBMs would make us safer by reducing the risk of accidental war, and curbing the mindless rush toward new nuclear weapons of all types could help create a better atmosphere for global reductions.Congress, which controls the purse strings, has a critical role to play in eliminating ICBMs, a move that would reshape our nuclear arsenal to make it both cheaper and more effective. In a recent press conference held by the Congressional Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group, former Rep. John Tierney of the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation offered a blunt indictment of ICBMs:“Not only are intercontinental ballistic missiles redundant, but they are prone to a high risk of accidental use … They do not make us any safer. Their only value is to the defense contractors who line their fat pockets with large cost overruns at the expense of our taxpayers. It has got to stop.”The choice is clear. Eliminate dangerous and costly ICBMs, or keep building them, not to mount a better defense, but to serve the financial needs of the companies and politicians that directly or indirectly benefit from their existence. When it comes to ICBMs, it’s time to put the public interest above special interests. There’s too much at stake to do otherwise.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt."
eugeneweekly_2024_18,"We ve got issues. Ward 1 needs a city councilor who will put the community first. Despite Ted Coopman’s short time in Eugene, his outsized influence over the Jefferson Westside Neighborhood (JWN has allowed us to witness his brand of leadership firsthand. Coopman moved toEugene in 2016 and soonbecame chair of the neighborhood association. Today, as he runs for one of the most powerful positions in local government, it is crucial that voters understand how he has abused his power in that position to promote his personal agenda and self-interests. Many will be surprised to learn that,last year, before the Oregon Legislature, Coopman claimed to speak on behalf of theentireJWN to express “enthusiastic support” for constructing the Ems stadium at the Fairgrounds. This washis own personalsupport. However, it was offered in his official capacity as “elected Chair” on official JWN letterhead. Coopman’s testimony before the Oregon Legislature was particularly stunning given the Ems stadium has been a significant source of controversy for the neighborhood. Residents have expressed deep concerns, including themore than $100 millionin public subsidies proposed to benefit Elmore Companies, anout-of-state for-profit corporate conglomeratethatowns, among other things,miningandtimbercompanies, and that is free topack up and leaveanytime. Among other concerns are the impacts of traffic, noise/light pollution, and crime on the thousands of surrounding homes (with games, concerts, and other events projected for100+ daysper year ; the environmental impacts on wildlife in the Amazon Creek, home togreat blue heron, river otters, beaver and turtles; and the privatization and demolition of community spaces. A 2022 survey showed 65 percent of neighbors adjacent to the Fairgroundsopposed the proposal, with only 8 percent in favor. A 2023 survey foundtwo-thirdsof JWN respondents in opposition. Despite thenational attention, no systematic outreach to the neighborhood has occurred. Many neighbors have received little to no information.TheNew York TimesandTheRegister Guardreport that the JWN board — a group of just seven people, including Coopman and hiswife— already voted to support the stadium, but the JWN website assures usotherwise. The webpage states, in boldface, “The JWN Executive Board has not voted to support an Ems sports facility.” Coopman’s March 2024newslettersays that JWN will merely “continue to help facilitate the public process.” Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Why would Coopman lobby for a project that so many residents oppose without consulting most (if any residents? And why conceal that support? One clue may be found in Coopman’s financial relationship with Allan Benavides, thegeneral managerof the Emeralds. Notably, Benavides has donated thousands of dollars to support Coopman’s policy agenda. Benavides istiedforlargest donorto Coopman’s City Council race (as of the time of writing .

That donation amounts to more than all the other GoFundMe donors combined. Given Benavides lives in neither JWN nor Ward 1, his generosity may raise a few eyebrows. Because we are not mind readers, we cannot say withabsolutecertainty whether Coopman’s advocacy is motivated by personal enrichment or simple paternalism — a sense that he knows better than his neighbors. In the end, it makes little difference: Coopman has deprived JWN residents of a meaningful voice in one of the most consequential development projects that the neighborhood has seen in decades, and which will have impacts reverberating throughout Ward 1 for decades to come. If elected to City Council, he will exert his will over not only his constituents but the entire city. Some may try to reframe this discussion to make it about whether or not you like baseball. But that’s what pitchers call “spin.” Let’s keep our eye on the ball: The real question here is whether Coopman will represent his constituents — not himself, out-of-statemining and logging barons, or the$3.6 billionSan Francisco Giants (Emsaffiliate .

But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, doctors are effectively banned from owning hospitals. At a time when the rapidly consolidating hospital market needs more competition, not less, keeping this poorly conceived provision on the books makes little sense. Congress should repeal it.America’s first hospital was owned by a doctor, and physician-owned facilities were fairly common through the 1930s and 1940s. It wasn’t until the mid-20th century that the concept began to recede — partly thanks to new laws that provided federal funding for public institutions and tax-exempt community hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals re-emerged decades later in response to growing demand for specialization. They took off in the early 2000s, roughly split between specialty hospitals that focus on a limited set of procedures and full-service community hospitals.Large hospital systems weren’t exactly thrilled with this development. The industry lobbied aggressively against physician-owned specialty hospitals (known as POHs , alleging that they cherry-pick healthier patients — foisting sicker ones onto publicly funded community hospitals — and refer patients internally to boost profits.Concerned by these reports, Congress in 2003 imposed temporary restrictions on the establishment of new specialty POHs. Government investigations and congressional inquiries followed. (Their findings were mixed. Subsequent studies have shown that, relative to traditional hospitals, POHs often deliver better care at lower or comparable costs. For example, patients who’ve undergone orthopedic surgeries at specialty POHs received more conservative therapies before invasive procedures and experienced shorter stays with lower complication rates.To address worries about cherry-picking, regulators in 2007 added an adjustment to hospital payments to account for sicker patients. Yet the issue didn’t subside. When Congress started drafting the ACA — which expanded health insurance to millions of Americans — the idea of a more permanent “ban” on all POHs became something of a bargaining chip. Big hospitals reportedly agreed to accept billions of dollars in reimbursement cuts in exchange for restrictions on POHs. The industry touted the provision as one of its biggest achievements from the ACA negotiations.It’s fair to say the ban has worked: The number of POHs, at roughly 250 facilities nationwide, hasn’t budged since the ACA’s passage in 2010. In the meantime, the market has rapidly consolidated, with hospitals in a health system outpacing those that aren’t by a ratio of about 2-to-1.Decades of research has shown that consolidation is often associated with higher costs.The issue of self-referrals, meanwhile, has merely shape-shifted: Similar practices have been reported at vertically integrated health conglomerates in recent years.Doctors have many strengths as entrepreneurs. Not only do they interact directly with the “customer,” but often have smart ideas about how to save time and money. (For example, knowing the most efficient way to set up an operating room might minimize the time needed between surgeries and reduce errors. Labor productivity, an important measure of innovation, has been stagnant or falling among private community hospitals for the better part of this century.As in any profession, there will always be bad actors — yet it isn’t a stretch to say that cases of avaricious doctors endangering their patients and risking their careers to make an extra buck are outliers. And while it’s hard to predict whether POHs would be able to withstand the larger forces of market consolidation, the fact that the remaining 250 institutions have retained independent ownership should offer some hope. Not every small hospital wants or needs to be acquired.Competition is the antidote to high prices and poor quality, which characterize too much of the US health-care system today. Removing barriers to entry is an obvious first step toward restoring some much-needed efficiency.— Bloomberg Opinion."

Here comes the Democratic Party with two scandals, and in a presidential election year.The first has to do with U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, whose bribery trial started this week. The second one involves U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who was indicted earlier this month on federal charges of bribery and money laundering.Each man deserves to have his day in court, and both dispute the charges. Several Democrats have called on Menendez to resign, though Cuellar’s indictment has largely been met with silence. Democrats shouldn’t treat these credible allegations as headlines to be lamented and then forgotten. The party that has decried Russian interference in our democracy and ethical failures by Republicans should reflect on behaviors in its own house that may have invited unscrupulousness.It will accrue to Democrats’ favor to vociferously denounce all corruption, not just the kind that makes the other party look bad.The sprawling Menendez corruption case is eye-opening. Federal prosecutors say the senator and his wife accepted bribes in exchange for Menendez using the power of his office to aid Egyptian and Qatari officials, an Egyptian American entrepreneur and a New Jersey businessmen. A 39-page indictment alleges that Menendez tried to interfere with fraud investigations, disclosed nonpublic and “highly sensitive” State Department information to help the Egyptian government and pressured a U.S. official to protect a halal meat monopoly.In exchange for all these political favors, Menendez and his wife were showered with gifts ranging from gold bars to mortgage payments and car payments for a Mercedes-Benz, the indictment alleges. The New York Times reported that part of the senator’s defense is to blame his wife for withholding information and misleading him.That’s rich. Menendez, a septuagenarian, has been in public office since the 1970s, and it’s on him to manage his finances responsibly and ethically. If you are letting someone other than your family help you pay for a house or a luxury car, then you shouldn’t be in public office.The federal indictment against Cuellar and his wife alleges that he used his political influence to shape U.S. policy in favor of Azerbaijan’s state-run oil company and to advocate for slackening American anti-money laundering rules to help a Mexican bank. Prosecutors accuse the Cuellars of taking bribes disguised as consulting payments for Cuellar’s wife. The couple has pleaded not guilty to the charges.The behavior outlined in the indictments is plainly illegal, but it would be a mistake to think of the charges, if corroborated in court, as mere failures of individual moral character. Loose campaign finance rules contribute to a toxic environment where public servants of all political leanings become enamored with the trappings of wealth, seduced by junkets and extravagant gifts and parties thrown by their donor friends or ideological allies.All of this gray may happen within the margins of the law, but it tempts officials to cross red lines.If Democrats want the moral high ground, they’ll take stock of what they have been willing to tolerate and raise the bar for their own.—The Dallas Morning News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

The House of Representatives, with bipartisan support, passed the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21 , a bill that will establish a market structure for the regulation of digital assets. Further, a bipartisan House and Senate passed a resolution to nullify the regulatory overreach of a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting guideline over concerns about its harmful impact to consumers and financial institutions. This bipartisan support underscores the importance and necessity of FIT21 to provide clear rules and standards for this burgeoning industry.There are a few key areas where legislation is critical for the crypto and blockchain industry.First and foremost, consumers must be protected. Cryptocurrencies and transactions can be complex, leaving them open to fraud. Rules protecting consumers from scams will ensure this new sector can be used confidently for legitimate purposes.Second, clear delineation is needed between the regulatory authority of the SEC and Commodities Futures Trading Commission to create a streamlined and effective regulatory environment to foster innovation and regulatory certainty in the digital asset space. The act’s provisions for registration, compliance and oversight help enhance market integrity by ensuring that digital asset exchanges and custodians operate under robust — that is, clear — standards. In addition to protecting individual consumers, regulation that supports cybersecurity more broadly will ensure that users and institutions are protected from cyber-attacks when utilizing this new technology.FIT21 and the regulations it outlines are not just about regulation; they are a critical part of maintaining America’s global competitiveness in this new sector. A robust framework of clear and well-established regulations will not only protect consumers and institutions, but also attract talent and investment to our country. This, in turn, will support continued innovation and entrepreneurship, fostering jobs and economic growth in America.To realize these benefits, FIT21 needs to make it over the finish line, and the next step is passage in the Senate. I hope Minnesota Sens. Tina Smith and Amy Klobuchar will see the benefits of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology and throw their support behind FIT21. This bill will ensure that America remains a leader in technological innovation.Alexander Cutchey is the manager of government affairs forMarathon Digital Holdings in St. Cloud."
minnpost_2024_101,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Shocking (extra jazz hands .According toone study, “About 30% of patients do not respond to (ADHD stimulants or cannot tolerate their side effects.”Since I started taking Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder meds in second grade, I have had a common reminder that my meds were just kicking in — a tingle sent down my spine and later through the rest of my body. This tingle gives me a sense of unease, thoughts of worry and, at times, depression. Throughout my decade-long experience with ADHD medication, I have been transient, hopping from one medication to the next in hopes one of them won’t leave a similar tingle.I no longer want to have the side effects. I no longer want to shake while the water of my morning shower hits me. I no longer want to sacrifice my sanity and well-being just so professors’ words won’t fly past me like a speeding car. Yet, I still roll out the covers in the morning and am subject to the same ghostly reminder.Studies on naturalistic methods of medicating ADHD have begun to pop up. The goal is to reel in the side effects and keep the positive aspects. The Persian spice, saffron, might just be the solution. However, traditional ADHD stimulants, like the side-effect riddled methylphenidate I take, still dominate the market due to Big Pharma’s influence on research and the news.In 2019, 50 patients were randomly given 20-30 milligrams of saffron or methylphenidate. The six-week double-blind study in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology concluded that saffron had the same efficacy as methylphenidate.Methylphenidate is the most-used medication for ADHD worldwide, prescribed more than17 million timesin the U.S. alone in 2023.According to the Mayo Clinic, methylphenidate addresses ADHD disorder by lowering distractibility, impulsivity and restlessness. The list of side effects noted on Mayo’s methylphenidate page is longer than this article; they include anxiety, robotic-sounding speech, hot flashes and trembling or shaking, just to name a few.Clinical studies have also found that saffron, packed with antioxidants, has other benefits. According to a study published in the National Library of Medicine, mild to moderate depression can be treated daily with only 20-30 milligrams. It was also believed to ameliorate anxiety and improve memory functions.Outside of the ones mentioned in this article, there are few studies on the efficacy of saffron. While some may think that nails the coffin for tackling ADHD herbally, I disagree. In fact, this strengthens the argument for saffron and similar methods still being studied because it shows that there is fear in the air.It’s an industry where research and development reports are, above all else, studies fueled by money. Hence, large pharmaceutical companies fund the majority of all research.Fueled by a market of more than $100 billion, these large companies producing stimulants like methylphenidate have ad-making departments and appeal to those whose children are suffering.While, yes, manufactured ADHD medication provides many benefits, drugs should not be blindly placed into countless hands like M&M’s. There is great nuance to treating people, something doctors often understand and something large companies want us to forget. They want to be our only option. Let us ask ourselves: who provides doctors with their information and research? Not us, them — the studies and research papers funded by large companies, which have even larger hidden interests.And we listen. We pay attention to their studies and take them at their word because it’s easier that way; it’s easy to ignore issues outside our own. The question is, when is enough enough? When will there be enough anxiety, depression and pain for people to be willing to look the problem in the eye?Some may still see no need for intervention in this industry, but it’s our failure to allow others to restrict our choices. We must remember that it is reckless to be enamored by tradition and obsessed with complacency. Otherwise, my generation, our children’s and theirs will be at risk for little kids shaking in the shower.

philinquirer_2024_46,"At Lakeside School in North Wales, the focus is on healing students trauma. More schools should follow their example.Three and a half years ago, Sebastian Fink-Locke was having a hard time. As a ninth grader at North Penn High School, he was misbehaving to the point where his school said he would no longer be allowed to attend.He was told he had to go to an “alternative” school — Lakeside School in North Wales, Pa., roughly a dozen miles north of Philadelphia. He had no idea how different his experience would be.Lakeside operates from a premise that is deceptively simple, but rare in education circles: every student sent there is dealing with something heavy, which is affecting their behavior and ability to learn. To break that cycle, the school centers its curriculum around how trauma affects the developing brain, and helping students process unresolved feelings.So when Fink-Locke would act out, he wasn’t handed a detention; he was given afinger pulse oximeter, which measures your heart rate. He was told to use it, and figure out ways to get his heart rate down. There were many options — he could do some deep breathing, play with a fidget toy, or leave the classroom (yes, even in the middle of a lesson for a cardio break, to ride an exercise bike or walk an outdoor track. And once he had calmed himself down, he could meet with his counselor to talk about what was behind his behavior, and how to handle those feelings differently next time.At first, “I hated it,” Fink-Locke told me.But over time, something clicked.He started following the program. His behavior softened. He began focusing on his schoolwork. He spent a lot of time at the school’s greenhouse, learning tolandscape the campus’ 40 acres, as well as selling flowers and offering landscaping services to the public.I spoke to Fink-Locke last month on a beautiful spring day in the school’s greenhouse, surrounded by a sea of flower starter trays and the woodsy aroma of mulch. He’s about to graduate, and has enrolled in the Army. Afterward, he wants to get into farming, inspired by his time at the greenhouse. “This school definitely helped me put my life on a very good path,” he told me.For Fink-Locke, Lakeside’s distinctive approach to the challenge of educating students with disciplinary problems worked.As I walked around Lakeside, I saw what Fink-Locke was talking about. I watched students who were once too disruptive to remain in traditional classrooms walk the halls of Lakeside at a normal pace, speak to each other at a normal volume, and direct their attention to their teachers. Yes, some were standing, or rocking, or wrapping themselves in a weighted blanket. But to my eyes, they were learning.Leaving Lakeside, I had one thought: They’re on to something here.As adults, we like to tell ourselves that kids are resilient. That may be true — but only to a point.Lakeside’s executive vice president,Kathy Van Horn, decided to revamp the school’s curriculum roughly 10 years ago after noticing over the course of her 40 years at the school that most of the students transferred there had experienced some type of trauma. According to school officials, one quarter of Lakeside students have a history of abuse or neglect, nearly one-half are (or have families that are struggling with drugs or alcohol, and more than 40% have a history of depression or suicide attempts. Some have experiences with homelessness, have been in foster care, or have a parent who is incarcerated.It makes sense that many of the students who are struggling most at school are having problems at home. But let’s get real: What young person you know isn’t dealing with some type of stress or trauma right now?This is especially true in a place like Philadelphia, where children areshot and killed nearly every other week, creating aseemingly constant cycle of trauma and grief. More thanhalf of the city’s school-aged children are in poverty, living withconstant worryabout access to basic needs like food, shelter, and electricity.But almost every child deals with something heavy at some point — maybe their parents split up, a sibling got sick, or abeloved grandparent died from COVID-19. Call it stress, call it adversity, call it trauma — most kids have feelings they don’t know how to process, which get expressed in all sorts of ways.With so many children in Philadelphia dealing with so much hardship, it should come as little surprise thatmost public school studentsdon’t meet state standards in math, science, and reading. That’s because research shows children who have experienced trauma or some other heavy stress aremore likely to struggle to learn, get lower grades, or exhibit behavior problems that get them suspended or expelled.I realize there are many explanations for why so many students in Philadelphia are falling behind,including decades of underfunding, massive social disparities, andproblems with standardized testing.But there’s one explanation that doesn’t get nearly enough attention and resources at most of our schools: student stress and trauma.Most schools can’t afford what Lakeside offers: a roughly 3:1 ratio of students to staff (all trained to handle trauma , therapy dogs that greet students when they arrive in the building, counselors for everyone, an outdoor track, and a pool. Even thetrauma-informed workshops, training, and coachingthe school provides is probably out of reach of many districts.But many of the tools Lakeside uses to help students soothe their stressed brains, such as the pulse oximeters (less than $20 each , are affordable. And perhaps the most important aspect — the understanding of how childhood stress affects the brain, and how stress/trauma can interfere with learning — is free.The walls of Lakeside are lined with poster-sized diagrams of the human brain, with different sections highlighted in different colors. Here, students learn that acting out is often an expression of a brain that’s been exposed to stress or trauma, which then overreacts to a trigger. To a non-traumatized brain, losing a favorite writing utensil or getting a side-eye from a classmate is annoying, but to people with unresolved trauma or stress, that can lead to an explosion of feelings and behavior.Using the pulse oximeters, students learn to figure out what helps them slow down their heart rates (a proxy for stress . For some, it’s the primal tools that often work for babies, such as rocking, swinging, swaddling, or deep breathing; others may benefit more from physical movements, big and small — walking, cardio, doodling, or gardening. Classrooms include rocking chairs, standing desks, and weighted blankets. Piped into every space is the faint sound of instrumental music at exactly 60 beats per minute, which research suggests canlower heart rate and blood pressure.Once the school added these tools, Van Horn told me she noticed a difference right away. There were fewer student fights; traditional schools who accepted students back after a stint at Lakeside noticed other improvements.After a few months at Lakeside, Fink-Locke learned that when he starts to feel agitated, he needs to remove himself from the situation — maybe take a loop around the outdoor walking track, or go to the sensory room, a staffed room for students to cool down that includes fidgets, hammocks, and an exercise bike. “If I get frustrated, I take a 10-minute cardio break, then go back to class.”For Jimmy Galeana-Bruno, now 20, who went to Lakeside in 2019 from Wissahickon School District due to issues with his grades and behavior (skipping class, for instance , it was the pulse oximeters that made the difference. “That was a really good way to just kind of acknowledge to myself that, you know, I am really agitated at the moment.” When his pulse rose, he’d ask to take a walk. Eventually, “I stopped wanting to engage in activities like misbehaving.”Galeana-Bruno has since graduated and now works as a landscaper (but hopes to start welding , and told me he still employs some of the tools he learned at Lakeside when he feels agitated. “Passing through Lakeside helped me a lot.”According to data I got from Lakeside from the 2022-2023 school year, students’ GPA increased by an average of 0.26 from what they received at traditional schools (Fink-Locke told me he’s now trying for As and Bs . And 76% of Lakeside seniors graduated — notable, because most thought they would never earn a diploma. What’s more, 90% of the parents and guardians of students said they believed Lakeside was helping their child deal better with problems.(That doesn’t mean Lakeside is a problem-free utopia. During my visits to the campus, I watched students file into the “resolve room,” where they go for help from counselors when their usual calming tools aren’t working. During my first conversation with Van Horn, we were interrupted by a PA announcement for all staff to come to the parking lot; a van transporting students had a behavior incident and needed some help. There aren’t many schools like Lakeside, Van Horn told me, even though it has conducted trainingknown as NeuroLogicat other schools in our region and throughout the U.S. (and in other countries as well . Even if other schools have implemented other tools to help kids deal with trauma, “I do not know of any schools who are doing things to the extent that we are,” she said.Unfortunately, too many schools don’t understand how the traumatized brain works, and use outdated thinking to manage kids and their feelings,Sandra Bloom, associate professor of health management and policy at Drexel University, told me.That includes not letting kids take physical activity breaks (or cutting recess to only minutes per day , and punishing kids for not sitting still, said Bloom, who isnow working with Lakesideto manage the online training she provides to organizations to help them become more trauma-informed.But research shows that letting kids fidget — play with a fidget toy, doodle on their papers, or click a pen, for instance — canhelp them focus and learn. And giving them “brain breaks” — where they can dance, go outside for a few minutes, or just be silly —boosts blood flow to the brainand learning.“I think it’s wonderful what they’re doing, and I just wish it would become universal education,” said Bloom.Jayme Banks, the deputy chief of prevention, intervention and trauma for the Philadelphia School District, has visited Lakeside, and told me she thought it was “wonderful,” but that there is no one way all schools should look. “I think we have to have variety, because our kids are all different.”She estimated that Lakeside has conducted training in roughly 50 to 60 district schools, and 25 to 30 schools have taken part in the more detailed NeuroLogic training.Philadelphia school officials are also trying to adopt some of the same tools Lakeside uses, such as creating calming corners, or swapping some traditional desks with flexible seating that enables students to move around. Her office also works with other departments in the district to help teachers identify their and their students’ triggers, and incident responses that work best for each child. “Maybe Johnny needs a walk,” she said.Not all schools are doing this work.That said, not all schools are doing this work, Banks noted — in some, a few teachers have really embraced it, but there are likely only a “handful” of schools that are integrating trauma healing system-wide. For teachers and administrators who already feel stretched thin by the basic tasks of teaching reading and writing, Banks reminds them that healing from trauma is part of that, too. “Johnny will never be able to read if we do not incorporate all of this,” she said.Crystal Edwards, principal of William D. Kelley School in North Philadelphia, told me that she agreed that just about every student in our city has something heavy on their minds. “We’re talking about all students, at all schools, being affected by some type of trauma,” she said, which “distracts from the learning that they need to be able to do inside of their school.”Her school is one of three working with Temple’sPhiladelphia Healthy and Safe Schools (PHaSeS programto help teachers address their own traumas, and do the same for their students — by, for instance, journaling, drawing, using fidgets, or counting their breaths. She told me she “definitely” believes it’s helping her students’ academics, because “it allows teachers to be able to do their job: to teach.”To Edwards, programs like this should be used across the district. “Every school needs it.”"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_271,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°There are more than 700 Asian American elected officials across the country, including the presumed Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris and 20 members of Congress.Since the data show a leftward bent among Asian Americans Gen X and younger, one might expect that representation to be entirely Democratic. But Asian Americans have long had an energetic presence in the Republican Party. It’s worth asking how attractive the GOP might look to them come November.George H.W. Bush won this voting bloc 32 years ago. So did Bob Dole in 1996. In recent years, Elaine Chao, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and now Usha Vance have become household names. Although Haley and Ramaswamy failed to win the GOP presidential nomination against Donald Trump, they snagged speaking slots at the 2024 Republican National Convention to show their commitment to conservatism (however defined these days . They, along with California U.S. Reps. Vince Fong, Young Kim and Michelle Steel and Asian American politicians elsewhere, underscore the growing visibility of this demographic within elite GOP circles.The long history of Asian American activism from the right started with Hiram Fong, who was born to Chinese immigrants in Hawaii. He became a U.S. senator from the newly admitted state in 1959 and during his 18-year tenure built a reputation as a moderate. Fong secured funds to improve the islands’ infrastructure, helped remove immigration barriers and backed sweeping civil rights legislation. He was also an ardent supporter of the Vietnam War and President Nixon, even after the fallout from Watergate.The year Fong left office, S.I. Hayakawa, a Canadian-born Japanese American, began his term as U.S. senator from California as a somewhat inscrutable Republican. A self-proclaimed supporter of racial minorities, he nonetheless opposed the establishment of ethnic studies in 1969 as president of San Francisco State College (now University , a position he was appointed to by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. Hayakawa did not hide his Japanese heritage, yet he also promoted assimilation and wanted to make English the official language of America. In the late 1960s and 1970s, Hayakawa’s brand of identity politics was palatable for a Republican Party becoming increasingly conservative thanks to the “Southern strategy” (a GOP tactic that used race to attract aggrieved Sunbelt white voters and a burgeoning evangelical movement.There were also Asian American bureaucrats, diplomats and lobbyists influencing the right from behind the curtain. These efforts included Anna Chan Chennault, a journalist-turned-socialite whose political and military ties through her husband, U.S. Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, provided access to Republicans such as Richard Nixon. In 1968, amid the race for the White House, Anna Chennault served as an intermediary between Nixon and South Vietnam.Though the lore remains disputed, experts have claimed she helped stall peace negotiations between embattled Democratic incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson and South Vietnamese leaders, as she and fellow Nixon supporters feared a deal would help Democrat Hubert Humphrey clinch the election. Nixon won. Well after the “Chennault affair,” she remained a reliable GOP ally, fundraising for the party and mentoring Asian American Republicans.In the 1980s and 1990s, the Republican Party made significant inroads with Asian American voters thanks to the efforts of former Nixon, Reagan and Bush administration officials invested in improving U.S.-Asia relations, particularly with China. Moreover, outreach to specific demographic groups as promoted by Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater — who, paradoxically, also encouraged the use of dog whistles on the campaign trail — brought Asian Americans into the tent.But by the mid-2000s, despite the prominence of figures including Matt Fong, Bobby Jindal, Jay Kim and Pat Saiki, Asian Americans’ support of the GOP and their overall presence within the larger party apparatus declined. Targeted appeals from Democratic Party operatives put Asian Americans solidly in the blue column. Democrats’ positions on education and healthcare, and the party’s overall image as more racially and religiously inclusive, attracted recent immigrants and younger voters. By the time George W. Bush finished his first term, it appeared the GOP had all but abandoned the Asian American electorate.Then there was another turn. In 2013, following Mitt Romney’s failed presidential bid and tepid election results for the party, the Republican National Committee came out with the Growth and Opportunity Project (a.k.a. the “RNC autopsy” that suggested a renewed focus on people of color. The RNC hired dedicated staff to assist with Asian American outreach for the next election cycles — albeit inconsistently — to boost turnout in swing districts and states where these votes were crucial. This includes Georgia, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, among others. State and local parties have also tried direct outreach and placing Asian American Republicans in leadership roles.Some of these efforts seem to have worked. Since 2020, despite the Trump administration’s rhetoric labeling COVID-19 the “China virus” and a subsequent uptick of anti-Asian violence, there’s an emerging conservative element within Asian America.Not all are registered Republicans, and these conservative activists are more common in areas with larger Asian American and Pacific Islander populations. Many have gotten involved in local politics, such as ousting progressive district attorneys and recalling liberal school board members. The Democratic Party’s increasingly progressive priorities have scanned to some Asian Americans, particularly immigrants and refugees, as reminiscent of socialism or communism, ideologies often associated with violent regimes and restricted freedoms in the homeland. Furthermore, some Asian Americans argue that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives overlook Asian Americans or teach anti-American-ness; some oppose affirmative action and similar programs or think authorities have not strongly enough countered anti-Asian violence, pushing them rightward.Indeed, in the 2020 and 2022 elections, Democrats won Asian Americans’ votes in national elections by noticeably smaller margins than in years past. November will give us some sense of whether this trend will keep moving in the GOP’s favor — or swing back toward stalwart Democratic support.James Zarsadiaz is an associate professor of history at the University of San Francisco and the author of “Resisting Change in Suburbia.” He is working on a book about Asian American conservatism since the Cold War.KAILUA-KONA — After a seven-year hiatus, Ke Kula ‘O ‘Ehunuikaimalino girls volleyball is back in business."

There are any number of things that are amusing about the obsequious fawning, but let’s focus on the Thursday, July 25, front page.The big headline is “Biden is ‘passing the torch.’” Well, Joe Biden is passing the torch the way a man being mugged is passing his wallet.There was nothing voluntary about this action. He was told to do it, much against his will, apparently, and he did it. But there was nothing “passing” about it. It was wrenched from his hand.The other press release tells us how Kamala Harris took command of the Democratic Party in only 48 hours. The woman who has apparently been unable to accomplish anything in three years of vice presidency managed to secure the ramparts quickly and efficiently. She is truly amazing. On what matters, at least.And then there’s that mean Donald Trump. “Attacking” Harris. Who chose the verb attack? He called her a radical, which she is. She happily calls herself one, though she uses the word progressive. If there’s a difference, please let your readers know what it is.This is all on the front page.I have no hope that coverage will improve as the election approaches.

His Washington-born younger sister also studied there and finished her undergraduate and master’s degrees. They are two years apart, by the way.After college, both worked with the AmeriCorps program for two years at different places in Virginia. A non-profit organization in DC employed him, and she became a middle and high school counselor in VA public schools. He has taught IT to the underserved population in DC, besides acting/performing in theatres there and Maryland. So talented, having appeared in a number of heavy dramas like Shakespearean plays, he has also performed musicals, like in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, at Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts and another musical at Little Theater in Smithfield. He’s also into radio shows and puppetry, too. Likewise, he has done reading interpretations, collaborating with audio book authors. Happy birthday, Andrew!Now, on to my wife, whose birthday is April 5. When I immigrated to the US to join with my folks in the Bay Area in late 1983, Freny and I were not on good terms. But we both believe in second chances. After working in the Bay Area for a year, I went on vacation to the Philippines and patched up my relationship with her. At that time, she had finished her Master’s degree in Education. She enrolled in several doctorate courses while continuing to teach college Chemistry at UNP (University of Northern Philippines ’s College of Arts and Sciences, where I was a college instructor then.While busy pursuing and then graduating in naval training and Hospital Corps education in the U.S. Navy in 1985, I was able to win her back with my frequent letter-writing to her. Prior to reporting to my first duty station at Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA, I decided to marry her in late 1985. Our church wedding in her hometown in the Philippines was one of the best things that ever happened to me, besides my first trip abroad to Rome, Italy, in 1980.When she joined me here in the U.S. in 1986, she had to make life and career adjustments. Volunteering with the American Red Cross and working at the Pharmacy Department at NMC, San Diego, she learned fast about life in the U.S. Putting her teaching profession on hold so she could take care of our two schoolchildren, she persevered in driving them to their schools.As parents who valued the importance of education, we decided to send our children to private schools, aware of the financial responsibilities we’d incur. We did financial budgeting and sacrifice to give our two children the best education we could afford. Sacrifice and determination played a big part in our decision to raise and educate them. We believe nothing is impossible because of our trust and faith in God. And we made it through thick and thin.As the lone Asian American chemistry teacher in Hampton Roads public high schools, Freny earned another master’s degree (Education Specialist , this time at George Washington University in DC, while busy teaching. One thing she should have accomplished in her education career: To be an assistant principal in the public school system here. Though fully qualified for the position, having a number of certified endorsements, she was very cognizant of the employment environment. She continued to be a classroom teacher, having written and revised curriculum chemistry instructions and mentoring new teachers.After over two decades of teaching Chemistry in one of the public high schools in Hampton Roads, Freny retired two years ago. (If there’s one deserving of recognition, a public service award in education, I’m honored to recommend my wife, who worked so hard to educate our students, our future.

As part of ongoing efforts to center ethicalstewardship of our collections, laying these individuals to rest represents a reckoning with our museum’s colonial past and an act of reconciliation with our local community.At the time of their deaths, some 200 years ago, these individuals’ crania were unethically collected by physician Samuel G. Morton as part of the infamous Morton Cranial Collection, the largest collection of human skulls in its day. Morton was attempting to demonstrate the superiority of Europeans and provide a scientific basis for racism.The names of these Philadelphians are unknown — Morton did not record them. Originally housed in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Morton Collection wasrelocated to the Penn Museum in 1966.When Iarrived at Penn in 2021, the museum was embroiled in controversies involving its holding of human remains of African Americans. We were one of many museums confronting legacies of colonial collecting practices, which included the acquisition of remains of enslaved and Indigenous people. To address the future of the remains of the Black Philadelphians in the Morton Collection, some of whom were likely born enslaved, I convened a committee of 14 West Philadelphia community and religious leaders in June 2021 to help find a path forward.Our community partners insisted that these individuals did not belong in museum storerooms. After nearly 200 years of exhibition and scientific study, they should be laid to rest without delay; doing so would prioritize their human dignity and restore their personhood. Together we built a plan to lay these Philadelphians to rest at Eden Cemetery and to commemorate them with an interfaith ceremony.Critics have argued that these Philadelphians should remain in storerooms until research leads to identification and claim by a descendant or members of a tribal community. There is, however, no guarantee that 19th-century archives will allow conclusive identification of individuals and descendants. While research over the last several years has shed some light on the circumstances of some of these individuals, these efforts have not yielded a single new name that can be definitively used for identification.Nor has this research resulted in a claim from a descendant or a federally recognized tribe, as required by the federalNative American Graves Protection and Repatriation Actfor individuals with possible Native American ancestry. Continuing this research without laying these Philadelphians to rest would prioritize the search for lineal descendants over their immediate human dignity.Museums too often delay or avoid repatriations by claiming that more extensive research and conclusive evidence are warranted before taking action. Indeed, the new Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act regulations — the only legal framework available to guide repatriations — are aimed at undercutting such dilatory tactics. They require museums to rely on “the information available,” stressing that “cultural affiliation does not require exhaustive studies, additional research, or continuity through time.”It’s my hope that continued research will successfully restore the identity of at least some of the Black Philadelphians in the Morton Collection. Importantly, our plan included interment in an aboveground mausoleum, so that if future research leads to an identification and a claim, the remains can be retrieved and entrusted to descendants. But given the nature of the 19th-century records available, it is unlikely that most of them will be identified with certainty.To wait without a foreseeable end for research that may never be conclusive would be tantamount to doing nothing at all — which is ethically unacceptable for our museum.It will be a happy day if these obstacles are surmounted, and we can return at least some of these Philadelphians to their descendants. For now, while research continues, let them rest in peace and with dignity at Eden Cemetery, rather than in the storerooms of the Penn Museum.Christopher Woods is the Avalon Professor in the Humanities at the University of Pennsylvania and the Williams Director of the Penn Museum.

minnpost_2024_156,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.I first met Gov. Tim Walz in 2005 on the farm of former state Sen. Ted Suss, at the legendary DFL Senate District 15 Corn Feed. A short drive from Redwood Falls, Suss strategically held this event during Farm Fest, a sort of kickoff for statewide politics. In addition to visiting with neighbors and enjoying sweet corn and savory hotdishes, you could expect to see a Who’s Who of Democratic statewide and national office seekers.On that day, an unknown Walz gave his first stump speech. He was seeking Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District seat. His speech is the only one I remember. He spoke about America and American democracy with total authenticity. When he spoke about citizenship, he mentioned the rightsandthe responsibilities. For Walz, democracy survives and thrives when we all work for the common good. It is that work that makes us free.Like any good educator, Walz had become skilled at the lessons he shared. I left the corn feed thinking Walz would flip that congressional district and one day might become president. His ability to speak optimistically about the promise of democracy was simply phenomenal.Since that day, I have followed his career with care. In 2018, as Walz was seeking the DFL nomination for governor, hesought the endorsement of my union. Speaking to our board of directors, Walz immediately put us at ease by noting that, like us, he had been a union educator for many years. He then went on to tell us why he decided to seek office in 2006.He recounted a now well-known story of a rally he attended when George W. Bush visited Mankato in 2004.As I recall the story, Walz was recently back from deployment with the National Guard and had invited two students to join him to see the president of the United States. While in line he noticed that one of his students was getting some pushback from Bush campaign security for having a John Kerry sticker in his wallet. Walz approached the security person and said that the young man was his student, that he would be sitting with him, and there would be no trouble. The security guard was unimpressed and refused the student entry, and then refused Walz entry.Walz asked security if they wanted the headline in the next day’s paper to be “Command Sergeant Major denied entry to see his Commander and Chief.” Upon further reflection, Walz was let in, but his students were denied access. The next day, Walz’s students asked him what he was going to do about that, and it was during that conversation, in a public-school classroom, that he decided to run for Congress.He then shared with my union his decision to attend Camp Wellstone, a kind of bootcamp for politically minded citizens. There he learned the Wellstone way of politics: focus on authenticity and on improving people’s lives. His trainer was Peggy Flanagan, now his lieutenant governor and the country’s highest ranking Native American woman elected to executive office.After his presentation, we were sold and became the first union to endorse Walz for governor.Like so many skilled educators, Walz has an uncanny ability to read the room he is in and to shift effortlessly from deeply held identities as a teacher, coach, soldier and father with perfect sincerity.There is nothing fake about him.He isdeeply rural, having grown up in sparsely populated Nebraska and then moving to a regional center in Minnesota some 90 miles from the nearest significant airport. Deep down, Walz has rural roots and is comfortable living in small towns.And yet, Walz is also profoundly cosmopolitan. As a young man he received a fellowship from Harvard to become one of the first K-12 teachers from the United States to spend a year in the People’s Republic of China. Walz’s experience in rural China led to a lifelong fascination with that nation. He started an organization that sent dozens of Minnesota students to live in China. His National Guard service took him to Europe and elsewhere. This cosmopolitanism helps explain why this son of the plains taught world cultural geography in addition to social studies.Tim Walz believes in government. Like most Americans, government has worked for him. He was educated at public institutions, served in the military and worked as a union teacher in public schools. His lived experience is an antidote to right-wing assaults on public schools, teachers, and government in general.Walz is now a candidate to be vice president of the United States. He has earned this distinction through his decency, intelligence, hard work and perseverance and by taking advantage of an infrastructure of opportunity created by “We the People.”"

Many motorists wait at the stop line while the next car or two behind you want to make the same turn as you.When the way is clear and the light turns yellow, and a driver is at the stop line, many drivers are hesitant to proceed and then end up waiting for the traffic lights to recycle again.By moving up into the intersection and waiting to make your turn, this would also free up some cars behind you in the intersection wanting to make the same turn.This often occurs at such intersections as the makai- and mauka-bound lanes on Puainako Street at Kanoelehua Avenue.However, keep in mind that is not allowed at “left on green arrow only” type of intersections.Rick LaMontagneHilo"

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_119,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The historic felony conviction of former President Donald Trump marks a meaningful victory for the beleaguered American legal system and a win for truth over falsehood.Three other criminal trials involving Trump have bogged down for various reasons. Two impeachments by the House of Representatives ended in partisan votes against conviction in the Senate. But in an ordinary New York courtroom, 12 men and women considered the evidence, weighed Trump’s various defenses, and concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he was lying.Trump has gotten away with lying to an extent unmatched in US history, and he may get away with it again in the November presidential election. In the courtroom, however, truth prevailed. That matters.Understanding why Trump was convicted can tell us a lot about how the criminal justice system differs from large-scale electoral politics — and why the former is more resistant to the problem of lies and misinformation.In court, Trump’s lawyers adopted a strategy of brazen falsehood, denying every element of the prosecution’s case, up to and including the allegation that Trump had a sexual encounter with adult film actress and director Stormy Daniels.As any lawyer could tell you (and many legal commentators did, as the trial played out , this was a legally risky strategy. Trump had a better option: He could have admitted the affair and the cover-up and asserted that he was simply trying to avoid personal embarrassment and never knowingly intended to falsify records. That would have given his legal team a better chance of undercutting the basis of the felony charges against him: that he falsified the records to interfere with the 2016 election.It seems pretty clear that the reason Trump’s lawyer went with the deny-everything approach is that it represented the essence of Trump’s entire (and largely successful strategy throughout his political and business careers. Trump has come to learn that he can forcefully and regularly assert things that are patently untrue, and that plenty of the public will still vote for him.Some of his supporters believe his lies literally, accepting, for example, that he really won in 2020. But much of the Trump-supporting public — it’s hard to say exactly how much — believe Trump’s lies in a more metaphorical fashion. That is, they believe there are forces out to get Trump and that in some grand sense those forces cost him the presidency in 2020. Either way, his supporters don’t have to test his lies against any concrete evidence. They can vote and act on the basis of a general feeling.Not so in a courtroom. There, the authority figure of the judge (notably absent in the political context tells the jurors what counts as evidence, spells out what law they should apply, and specifies what conclusions they should reach depending on what facts they believe after hearing the evidence.Then, prosecutors trained in presenting facts lay out the evidence and propose reasons to believe that evidence. Crucially, the jurors have no choice but to listen, again unlike the domain of politics, where you can choose what information you’re willing to hear and from which sources. The defense gets the opportunity to question the prosecution’s factual assertions, to be sure. But the fight in the courtroom is supposed to be a fair one, with each side entitled to equal time. If the prosecution’s case is convincing beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant gets convicted. The rules of the game are designed to expose the truth.Under these idealized courtroom circumstances, Trump was sure to be convicted. It’s no exaggeration to say that, if charged and tried in this way, he very likely would have been convicted in any court in the land, even in a venue dominated by Republican voters. He simply didn’t offer a defense that would function plausibly in a court of law, as opposed to the court of public opinion.To be sure, the overwhelming majority of criminal cases never go to a jury at all. There is much to be said about the failings of the criminal justice system when it is all plea-bargaining. In Trump’s case, however, the jury trial embodied exactly what is supposed to happen in a criminal case: The facts were tested and the truth won.If the criminal justice system were on trial alongside Trump, and came through with flying colors, the next test is our system of electoral politics. Now, we voters are on trial. Are we capable of accepting the factual truth that Trump is now a convicted felon? Can we translate that into the political truth that the president of the United States should not be a liar who has been criminally convicted in a court of law? That is a much different, and much harder test for us to pass."

Now, with drugs like Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Ozempic, new vistas of exploitation have opened up.It’s not a conspiracy theory that food addiction is a tool of corporate profiteering. Consider that tobacco companies, upon being regulated out of addictive smoking, turned their sights onto addictive eating.“In America, the steepest increase in the prevalence of hyper-palatable foodsoccurredbetween 1988 and 2001 — the era when tobacco conglomerates Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds owned the world’s leading food companies,” Washington Post health columnist Anahad O’Connorwrotelast year. “The foods that they sold were far more likely to be hyper-palatable than similar foods not owned by tobacco companies.”Many of these ultra-processed foods are speciallymarketedto children, which in turn canchange their brain chemistryto desire those foods for life. Today we would be appalled at the idea of marketing tobacco to children, but thesame companiespushed addictive foods onto kids. And even though Big Tobacco is no longer in the business of food, its practices remain widespread.As obesity rates have risen, there’s an all-too-familiar blame game that individualizes the harm being caused by a system that thrives off addiction.Doctorswarnpeople struggling to manage their weight to restrict their calories and do vigorous exercise. Reality shows likeThe Biggest Loserhave cemented the narrative that obesity is the result of individuals not managing their urges to eat. And American pop culture’s obsession with unattainablethinnessgenerates shame spirals and further fuels the idea that people are fat simply because they’re too weak to control themselves.Meanwhile, there are few, if any, governmentregulationson unhealthy foods in this country. Instead, the solutions being offered are individualized, often spawning lucrative industries of their own.Alongside the aggressive marketing of hyper-palatable foods is amassively profitable weight loss industrythat preys upon individual shame to the tune ofmore than $60 billion a year. In fact, some of thesame companiespushing high-calorie foods are in the business of weight loss.Today, the manufacturers of weight-loss drugs are clear winners in the changing landscape of food consumption and weight, charging tens of thousands of dollars for a year’s supply — and ensuring thatonly the wealthyhave access to the thinness our culture celebrates.Ozempic, for example, could costonly $57 a yearand its manufacturer Novo Nordisk would still reap a profit. Instead, it’s being sold in the U.S. for a whopping $11,600 a year. Not only do these prices keep these drugs away from low-income people struggling to manage their weight, but also out of the hands ofdiabetics, whom the drugs were originally meant for.Anticipating that prices will come down once the elite market is saturated, drug manufacturers are busy ensuring their future market share by pushing doctors to prescribe the drugs widely.One obesity expert named Dr. Lee Kaplan, who received $1.4 million from Novo Nordisk,toldhis fellow physicians: “We are going to have to use these medications … for as long as the body wants to have obesity.” What he doesn’t say is that there will be obesity for as long as food manufacturers market and sell junk foods.Ultimately, our individual appetites and waistlines are pawns in the highly lucrative game of profit. The ultra-processed food industry is becoming symbiotic with the weight-loss drug industry. The former ensures we eat poorly and the latter is there to feed off our shame.Sonali Kolhatkar is the host of“Rising Up With Sonali,”a television and radio show on Free Speech TV and Pacifica stations.This commentary was originally published byOtherWords.org."

Throwing people off the ballot based on obscure technicalities that New York used to specialize in, like using the wrong color of paper, is dirty pool deployed by party machines to squash insurgents.That is not the situation with independent presidential contender Robert F. Kennedy, a former New Yorker who moved to Los Angeles years ago and now is falsely claiming his actual residence is in a friend’s home in Katonah, in northern Westchester.Sorry, Bobby, no dice on that one and yesterday Albany state Supreme Court Justice Christina Ryba was wise to agree, rejecting his false assertions and removing him from the ballot.When RFK Jr. filed his candidacy forms with the Federal Election Commission, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump also did, he gave his real L.A. address on his documents.But when he submitted his signatures to put his slate of electors on the New York ballot this fall, he used Katonah. And he doesn’t live in Katonah.According to testimony from the trial held last week before Ryba, Kennedy has slept in the Katonah home once in the last decade. Some home.Ryba was right to bounce him and his electors from the ballot.Under the standard most recently set down by the state Court of Appeals, New York’s highest court, in the 2001 case of John O’Hara, state Election Law defines residence as “that place where a person maintains a fixed, permanent and principal home and to which he, wherever temporarily located, always intends to return.”An unslept-on couch in a spare room in Katonah is not fixed, it is not permanent, it is not principal and Kennedy has no intention to live out his life on that couch.The pro-Democratic ticket lawyers who brought the lawsuit got it wrong in saying in their complaint that, “the Constitution provides that when a Presidential Candidate and Vice Presidential Candidate on the same ticket are residents of the same State, the ticket is not eligible for any of that State’s Electoral College votes. Here, both Respondent-Candidate Kennedy and his Vice Presidential pick are residents of California, placing California’s 54 Electoral College votes — the largest number of any State — out of their reach.”That is incorrect. The 12th Amendment, ratified in 1804 says that “The Electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.”So if RFK Jr. wins the California popular vote, an impossibility over both Harris and Trump, his slate of 54 California’s electors can vote for him, but not his running mate, Nicole Shanahan. If no VP candidate gets an Electoral College majority, the Senate picks the winner.But that assumes that RFK Jr. and Shanahan are on the California ballot. If RFK Jr. used the Katonah address when seeking a ballot spot in other states, he filed a false instrument, as a New York judge has ruled Katonah is not his address. So should Ryba’s ruling be upheld, as we expect it will be, officials in 49 other states and D.C. should boot RFK from their ballots as well. Which would be a very good outcome.— New York Daily News"

Whether it’s a sudden storm, a heatwave, or a cold snap, being informed about the weather can make a significant difference in how we prepare and respond.Weather awareness isn’t just about avoiding inconvenience; it’s about safety. For instance, knowing about an impending severe storm can give you the time needed to secure your property, plan an alternate route, or even evacuate if necessary. As we found for much of July, during heatwaves, being aware of the temperature and humidity levels can help prevent heat-related illnesses by encouraging hydration and limiting exposure to the sun.Moreover, staying weather-aware fosters a sense of community. When we’re informed, we can share that information with others, particularly those who might be more vulnerable, such as the elderly or those without access to reliable news sources. This collective vigilance can help reduce harm and build resilience within communities.In our digital age, there’s no excuse not to be informed. Weather apps, alerts, and news broadcasts are readily accessible and provide real-time updates. By taking a few moments each day to check the weather forecast, we can make smarter decisions, protect our loved ones, and contribute to our overall well-being.Staying weather-aware is not just a good habit; it’s an essential part of being prepared for whatever nature might throw our way.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_80,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Last week, the nation dodged a bullet with the Supreme Court’s 9-0 decision tossing a lawsuit that had sought to end the decades-old FDA approval of the drug mifepristone, which is used in medication abortions. The trouble for the plaintiffs was that they could not point to any specific harm that they or anyone else suffered from the approval of a drug that is safer than most over-the-counter drugs.In truth, this case should have never gotten go far. A divided high court’s unanimity here makes clear just how ridiculous this effort was, particularly since the court never gets above the fundamental issue of standing. Of course the plaintiffs here — doctors who maintained they’d suffer practical and personal hypothetical injuries from having to treat patients suffering from the exceedingly rare complications of mifepristone — had no right to challenge this federal regulation.Any first-year law student could have answered that question right on the exam, yet this had to go up to the Supreme Court for the simple reason that the plaintiffs could rely on sympathetic lower court judges to move things along. The case was first heard by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who just so happens to be the only federal judge at the courthouse in Amarillo, Texas; wouldn’t you know it, he gets a suspiciously high volume of right-wing agenda items before him.Kacsmaryk is a poster child for the practice of judge-shopping given his historically reliable role as triggerman for far-right causes. It’s no surprise then that Republican senators railed against a recent policy change by the Judicial Conference — a sort of intra-judicial regulatory body — to limit the practice.The new policy would have lawsuits that seek an immediate ruling or injunction on state or federal regulatory or executive actions be assigned to a random judge in the district, instead of letting interested parties basically pick their judges.All of the legal and procedural questions around this case, while worth dissecting, shouldn’t obscure the base reality of what has happened here: a group of dark-money funded conservative doctors attempted to upend one of the most reliable tools for abortion access in this country.Had they been successful, the result would have been that abortion care would have been completely cut off in large swaths of the country, in which all other forms have collapsed under heavy state bans. The result would have been more girls and women would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term, to suffer through potentially permanent or even life-threatening complications and in some cases to die.While we’re happy that the court reached the decision it did, we can’t commend them too much given that they unleashed this in the first place through their ideologically-driven overturn of Roe v. Wade, including the votes of several justices who had said in their confirmation hearings that they viewed it as settled law.The attacks will keep coming, against abortion drugs and procedures and even birth control and IVF, because the ideological opponents are committed to taking away any choice that the people might have in their reproductive health. It can’t be left up just to the courts.

minnpost_2024_84,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Last spring, Minnesota passed the most comprehensive PFAS law in the country, banning all non-essential uses and requiring disclosure of all uses of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances to the state. The Legislature passed this law in part due to the advocacy of Amara Strande, who lived near a 3M PFAS plume and developed a rare form of cancer at 15 that ultimately took her life days before her 21st birthday.Advocates, legislators and Amara’s family listened to industry defend the use of PFAS, cloaking themselves in a new organization called Sustainable PFAS Action Network (SPAN . Their chief lobbyist, Kevin Fay, flew into Minnesota trying to convince legislators to accept his argument that some PFAS are safe. Thankfully lawmakers didn’t agree.After Amara’s Law passed, Fay boarded a plane and left Minnesota but we knew he’d be back. Last week, SPAN and Fay showed up again withthis Community Voices commentary.As the Minnesotans who fought to pass this law, and astaxpayers are projected to spend between $14 and $28 billion dollars over 20 years to clean up PFAS from our water, we take issue with Fay’s commentary.First and foremost, Fay is not a Minnesota community member. His organization is based in Virginia. Moreover, the assertions he made in his commentary about some PFAS being safe are completely false.The chemicalindustry knew as early as the 1940’s that PFAS were toxic. Internal documents show they knew exposure to PFAS was linked to birth defects, cancer, thyroid issues, preeclampsia and more. They marketed these dangerous chemicals to consumers anyway. PFAS is now found in 99% of humans, arctic ice, whale blubber, soil, air, cord blood, breast milk and our food.Fay stated, “Scientists agree that not all PFAS are the same, and not all PFAS present risks to human health and the environment.” This is incorrect; scientists do not agree. Linda Birnbaum, scientist emeritus and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, stated in written testimony that, “Since all PFAS are forever, and all that have been studied have shown to have adverse effects, the entire class should be eliminated from intentional production.” Dr. Birnbaum is one of many scientists warning of the dangers PFAS pose.Fay’s commentary claimed PFAS are needed to protect the environment. The fact is that PFAS polymer production emits climate super-pollutants such as HCFC-22 and HFC-23, which are 5,280 and 10,800 times, respectively, more potent at warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, on a 20-year timescale. The emissions of these two compounds from just a single PFAS polymer manufacturing plant are the equivalent of the annual carbon dioxide pollution from 750,000 passenger cars. HCFC-22 also destroys the health-protective stratospheric ozone layer.SPAN and other industry representatives have been flying across the country, repeating claims that people will lose access to healthcare and medicines and that the work to tackle climate change will be thwarted if we reduce or end the use of PFAS.Here are the facts.On Jan. 1, 2025, PFAS will be banned from cosmetics, juvenile products, dental floss, textiles, ski wax, cookware, fabric treatments, menstrual products, upholstered furniture, and carpets or rugs.Beginning on Jan. 1, 2032, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency will be able to deem other uses of PFAS as non-essential if the uses don’t contribute to the health and safety of society. The bill also requires disclosure to the MPCA if a product being sold in Minnesota contains PFAS and it addresses PFAS in firefighting foam.The advocates, scientists, environmental lawyers and other experts who worked on passing Amara’s Law have been clear from the beginning; when safer alternatives to PFAS exist, they must be used and only allow PFAS to be used in cases where it’s use or the product it is in is essential for the health and safety of society.The good news is, the state isn’t flying blind.Many industries already use the GreenScreen for Safer Chemicals system to find safer alternatives to hazardous chemicals, including PFAS. Researchers and chemical formulators alike rely on GreenScreen, which uses an open and transparent standard for assessing chemicals. The goal of GreenScreen is to avoid the use of chemicals that have negative impacts whenever possible and, when it isn’t possible, to commit to continuous improvement and reduce harm as much as possible.For too long, chemicals have been regulated one at a time, forcing regulators to play whack-a-mole when one toxic chemical is substituted for another. The intent of Amara’s Law is to take a class-based approach and regulate all PFAS since all PFAS that have been studied persist in the environment, cause harm to biological systems and endanger public health.We encourage Minnesotans to support Amara’s Law and support its goal of protecting our water, our land and our loved ones.Avonna Starck is the state director of Clean Water Action Minnesota, Jennifer DeJournett is the president of Ballot Box Strategies and Andrea Lovoll currently advocates for environmental justice on behalf of the Minnesota Environmental Justice Table."

Bush, who famously continued to skydive into his 90s, is a poignant example of how adventure knows no age limits. Bush’s jumps were more than just stunts; they were declarations of an undying zest for life. Patel embodies this same ethos, proving that age is not a barrier but a backdrop against which we can paint our boldest strokes.There’s a unique courage in embracing adventure later in life. The stakes feel higher, the risks more pronounced. But perhaps this is exactly why it’s so important to push against the grain, to step into the unknown, even—or especially—when society expects us to step back.Patel’s experience also highlights the profound connection that shared adventures can foster. For her and her family, the skydive wasn’t just an adrenaline rush; it was a moment of unity, of creating memories that will outlast any fear or doubt. It’s a reminder that adventure, at any age, is a bridge that connects generations.So, why let the number of candles on a birthday cake dictate the size of your dreams? Whether it’s skydiving, traveling to a new country, or learning a new skill, the only limits are the ones we place on ourselves. As Patel wisely advises, “Don’t be scared, just do it!” Her words aren’t just encouragement—they’re a rallying cry for anyone who thinks their time for adventure has passed.In the end, it’s not about defying age but embracing life fully, regardless of the years behind us. Let Saroj Patel’s story be a beacon for all who feel the pull of the unknown, reminding us that the sky is quite literally the limit, no matter how many birthdays we’ve celebrated.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_267,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°In an election cycle that can only be described as stranger than fiction, things have just gotten impossibly weirder.Longtime Democrat-turned-independent candidate for president Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed none other than Donald Trump.The move wasn’t totally unexpected; both campaigns have been hinting at it for days.Trump’s running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance, said that communication between the campaigns has been ongoing, and on Friday, it culminated in one of the strangest political marriages we’ve seen in some time.In a weird way, though, it’s a very American-looking union.Aside from being a member of one of the most famous political dynasties in American history,Kennedy is far from a ne’er-do-well or grifter.He made a name for himself as a prominent environmental activist and attorney, working as a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an organization known for being a thorn in the side of the Environmental Protection Agency during Republican administrations.But his assertions that common childhood vaccines are dangerous, his skepticism of government in general and his outspoken opinions on the COVID vaccine in particular attracted support from government cynics on the right, growing a base of supporters as motley as one could imagine.Indeed, his campaign platform is an amalgam of both left- and right-leaning policies: strength on the border, dovish foreign policy, populist economics, and support for the Second Amendment, abortion rights and legalizing marijuana.While Kennedy and his running mate, Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan, have deep roots in the Democratic Party (Shanahan donated $25,000 to the Biden campaign in 2020 , it seems things have changed.Kennedy’s platform is predicated on challenging what he deems a corrupted two-party system.Early polling showed that his candidacy would siphon away enough support from Joe Biden to give Trump the edge in the election.Now that Kamala Harris is the new “joyful” Democratic nominee, that edge may be less certain.But it’s probably not non-existent.Undecided voters will need to go somewhere, and if the two divergent campaigns pool their resources and work together they could build enough voter support over the next three months to secure a Trump-Kennedy conservative-populist-progressive victory, if you will.In a weird way, you could say Kennedy’s endorsement of Trump is how politics should be done.Parliamentary democracies (of which America is not one, but arguably should be rely on alliances between otherwise divergent parties to secure victories.At least on issues that send voters to the polls, the Venn diagram of Trump and Kennedy supporters is promising.And while political parties like to talk about unity and compromise when it suits them, it’s rarely done in reality because politicians once in office tend to primarily serve their bases.In this way, we could be entering new territory in modern American politics.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
philinquirer_2024_50,"Philadelphia needs a cultural shift among SEPTA riders to restore the social contract that has eroded.TheSEPTA Bus Revolutionaims to modernizePhiladelphia’s aging bus system, which has stagnated for decades. Its goals include increasing ridership, enhancing reliability, improving speed, and expanding service hours. Despite three years of community engagement and planning — including dozens of public hearings, transit talks, open houses, community conversations, and pop-up events — the initiative is now being delayed after amember of City Council requested additional public hearings. While this move incurred costs, there’s hope it will lead to positive changes, rather than mere political posturing.During the delay, SEPTA is focusing on other system improvements, such as station branding,enhancing wayfinding, and installingnew fare gatesto combat fare evasion. Yet, these efforts alone cannot fully address Philadelphia’s transit challenges. Fixing SEPTA is not just SEPTA’s responsibility.What’s needed is a cultural shift among SEPTA riders — a “BusRiderRevolution” — to restore the social contract that has eroded.The social contract, asphilosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau defines it, essentially represents collective will aimed at the common good. In that sense, the SEPTA rider social contract is clearly lacking.Fare evasion alone costs SEPTA up to $40 million annually, according to recent reports. Whilefederal grantsprovide much-needed funding, smoking, drug use, littering, and disruptive behaviors persist.SEPTA has ramped up enforcement and support systems likeSCOPE— which stands for safety, cleaning, ownership, partnership, and engagement — a system-wide approach to connect vulnerable individuals with social services and provide a safe, clean transit system for riders and employees.But without a shared commitment from riders to the social contract, these efforts are limited. Many passengers fear confronting rule-breakers or being seen as interfering, perpetuating a cycle of individualism and dissatisfaction.To initiate a Bus Rider Revolution, riders must reclaim ownership of the transit system. Recognizing that SEPTA serves diverse needs — from commuting to leisure — we must collectively ensure its safety, cleanliness, and inclusivity. Relying solely on gates and officers isn’t enough; every rider must prioritize the collective experience.I encourage people to speak up about an incident or disruptive passenger. While it can be daunting to do so, we all have a responsibility to ensure safety and well-being on SEPTA. Options for reporting incidents, such ascontacting SEPTA Transit Police, using the “text-a-tip” line (215-234-1911 , or utilizing theSEPTA Transit Watch App, are available.Efforts are in progress to integrate these features into SEPTA’s main app for enhanced convenience. If you don’t have time to report an incident in the moment, make a note or send a message to yourself so that when you do have time, you can share.Maintaining cleanliness is also essential for fostering a pleasant transit environment. This involves both actively picking up trash and promptly reporting any issues. Riders should responsibly dispose of their personal trash when they leave the bus or train.Inclusivity is another key aspect, which includes respecting designated seating arrangements, such as Americans with Disabilities Act-designated spots, and willingly yielding to fellow passengers who need them when necessary. Being mindful of actions, like refraining from playing loud music without headphones, contributes to creating a welcoming atmosphere for all commuters.By fostering a culture where everyone respects the social contract and prioritizes the enjoyment of all passengers, SEPTA’s progress can accelerate.In the 1990s,SEPTA’s slogan was “We’re Getting There.”Though SEPTA has since distanced itself from that iconic slogan, maybe it should be revisited and refined to embody a journey toward a more cohesive, respectful transit community.This journey requires active participation from every rider. Because it is not just SEPTA that needs to “get there.” We all need SEPTA. It’s how students get to school so they can grow and learn. It’s how parents and guardians get to work. It’s how visitors experience the Greater Philadelphia area. It’s how communities thrive.SEPTA is more than just a transportation system; it plays a pivotal role in shaping our daily lives.While infrastructure upgrades are vital, true transformation hinges on the collective actions of all riders. If we adhere to the social contract and a shared commitment to fostering a positive transit environment, Philadelphia can embark on a new era of public transportation.Tariem Burroughs is a sociologist who has spent much of his career working at the intersection of public health and community advocacy.

minnpost_2024_117,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The ruling last week by a Trump-appointed Federal judge in Texas halting a national prohibition on non-compete agreements shows that “judge shopping” is alive and well.Theorder by Judge Ada Brownof Amarillo in the Northern District of Texas temporarily stopped the Federal Trade Commission (FTC from enforcing an edict it promulgated this spring to go into effect next month. While not final, the judge’s ruling portends it will soon be converted into a permanent bar, triggering a lengthy appellate process that might lead to the Supreme Court in a couple of years or so.The lawsuit by business groups, commenced the day after the FTC rolled out its proposition in April, was not unexpected. They have been battling with the Biden administration’s aggressive head of the FTC, the 35-year-old Columbia University law professor, Lina Khan, over a variety of efforts by the agency regulating and reining in business practices deemed antithetical to the interests of consumers.This one was high on her agenda and that of President Biden dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign. It seems to be in harmony with a growing sentiment limiting or barring use of these restrictive devices that restrict future employment or start-up activities by employees that compete with their current jobs.Minnesota became the fourth state last year to bar most non-competes, jointing an eclectic group of California, North Dakota, and Oklahoma, and it went a step further this year with legislation banning non-solicitation arrangements with independent contractors, too. That quartet is among about three dozen states that impose some limitations on non-compete agreements, compared to about two dozen that allow them with few or no restraints.The ruling by the Trump-appointed Texas judge came about due to the practice known as “judge shopping,” a device used occasionally by litigants but elevated to a recurring — and effective — strategic maneuver by the MAGA movement.The prohibition of the FTC noncompete ban is hardly the only exercise by MAGA litigants of bringing cases before hospitable jurists aimed at restricting policies or laws of wide-ranging national impact.Last year, anti-abortion advocates chose the same federal courthouse in Amarillo to file a lawsuit before Matthew Kaczmarek, a notoriously right-wing Trump-appointed judicial colleague of Judge Brown, to halt availability of the widely-used mifepristone pill to induce abortion that had been approved decades ago by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA . His ruling was slightly modified by a federal appellate court before it was reversed this spring by the Supreme Court. The high court did not address the merits but threw out the case on grounds that the physicians bringing the lawsuit lack standing, which leaves the FDA-approved pharmaceuticals available but subject to further litigation challenges by proper parties, possibly before that same Texas jurist, hoping for the same outcome.But wait, there’s more.In Mississippi earlier this summer another Trump-appointed judge, Luis Guirola Jr. curtailed the Biden administration’s regulation permitting federal funding for medical care for gender identity and sexual orientation matters.That case, like the two others, was “shopped” around to a jurisdiction known to be unfriendly to the Biden administration and likely to produce the very result that occurred.That makes it a clean sweep — 3-for-3 — in high profile successful MAGA “judge shopping” lately, in addition to several others earlier like the ones overturning the Biden administration’s student loan debt forgiveness program and invalidating its COVID-related travel mask mandate.But “shopping” for friendly jurists, to be sure, is not confined to MAGA lawsuits. Liberal-leaning litigants have on occasion filed suits with national overtones, especially consumer class actions, in particular forums known to friendly to those claims as have some intellectual property claimants in pursuing trademark and copyright suits.The MAGA movement has taken that practice to such new heights that it’s drawn the attention of the Judicial Conference, the body of leading federal jurists that establish policies for the federal tribunals.After the furor over the mifepristone ruling by the Texas judge, the Judicial Conference devised a lukewarm proposal that newly-filed cases be assigned on a random basis consisting of all judges in the broader judicial district, one of 94 in the country, rather than from the particular courthouse within the district where the case is filed. The protocol is intended to broaden the pool of prospective jurists who might be assigned to the case.But it’s a rather lame prophylactic because there are numerous districts in red states where a substantial majority of the jurists are ideologically-inclined to favor MAGA interests or, for that matter, liberal causes in some others like here in Minnesota.The “judge shopping” tactic is less prevalent in the Minnesota state court system, where litigants can automatically remove a judge once from a case regardless of reason as well as the general requirement that suits challenging state laws or governmental practices be filed in Ramsey County, the seat of government. Those two protocols limit the use and effectiveness of “judge shopping” in cases involving state law issues here.Absent closer scrutiny of the procedures for filing federal lawsuits in light of the gaping and growing ideological divide within the judiciary, bringing lawsuits affecting national interests is prone to be pursued in jurisdictions friendly to the party initiating the case.Not only is the process that has curtailed the FTC’s non-compete bar a continuation of MAGA “judge shopping,” but its success bodes well for its increasing use in the future by litigants espousing conservative-oriented positions as well as those at the other end of the ideological spectrum, too.It creates another taint in a judicial system already reeling from far too many of them these days.Marshall H.

philinquirer_2024_3,"While I feel joy for the families whose children have received this miraculous treatment, a hot coal of grief remains lodged in my throat: For my family, this happy news came too late.Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved thefirst gene therapyto treat a fatal childhood inherited brain disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD .You might expect that I — the mother of a child who died from MLD before this treatment became available — would be bitter.But you would be wrong.On July 5, 2012, a neurologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia told my husband and me that our 2-year-old daughter, Calliope, was dying.Genetic testing confirmed she had MLD, a rare neurological disorder that destroys the brain’s white matter.That day marked the beginning of my crash course in one of the worst diseases you’ve never heard of. If ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease and Alzheimer’s created an offspring that targeted toddlers, it would look something like MLD.Babies with MLD are born with a faulty gene that leaves them unable to produce an enzyme needed to break down fatty substances called sulfatides. The buildup of them eventually becomes toxic to nerves, leading to progressive loss of cognition and movement.By the time symptoms appear, it is already too late.Soon after developing symptoms, babies with MLD lose almost all function. In Cal’s case, it took her only two short months after her diagnosis to lose the ability to walk, speak, feed herself, or sit unaided. From there, the disease progresses quickly, causing children to lapse into a vegetative state.The diagnosis came with no hope. Not only was there no treatment for MLD, but we learned that Cal would suffer terribly as her neurons died. And she was unlikely to live past her 6th birthday.The only tangible thing our doctor could offer us wasa Make-A-Wish vacation. We went to Martha’s Vineyard; Cal loved the ocean.Just a few days short of the one-year anniversary of Cal’s diagnosis, a team of researchers in Milan announced that they had successfullytreated three babies with MLDusing a gene therapy. The doctors wiped out the babies’ immune systems, then infused them with stem cells that had been “infected” with a working copy of the faulty gene.Even as I watched my darling daughter slowly die, I found my purpose: Iestablished a foundation in her honorand began raising money for MLD, one cupcake sale at a time.If I couldn’t save Cal, I was determined to save as many other children as possible.Over nearly a decade, theCalliope Joy Foundationhas sold 45,000 cupcakes and raised nearly $1 million. We used that money to send 20 children with MLD to Italy to receive the gene therapy. The first patient we sponsored is now a beautiful, healthy 10-year-old who has no idea she was supposed to become paralyzed, nonverbal, and dependent on a feeding tube.For me and other families of children who have MLD, the news of the FDA’s approval of the new treatment, Lenmeldy, is cause for rejoicing. For the first time since this disease so cruelly reshaped my family, I can say these words aloud:There is an FDA-approved therapy for MLD.Andwhat Lenmeldy does is nothing short of miraculous. In a trial of its effectiveness, all children who received Lenmeldy were alive at 6 years of age, relative to only half of those who didn’t receive it. Most of the treated children could walk without any help and had normal language skills.And yet, while I celebrate with the families whose children have received this miraculous treatment, a hot coal of grief remains lodged in my throat: For my family, for my daughter, this happy news came too late.The FDA approval of Lenmeldy coincides almost precisely with the two-year anniversary of Cal’s death. If only she had been born just a little bit later, she would still be alive.If only she had been born just a little bit later, she would still be alive.At this strange juncture, I find myself overcome with a range of emotions. It seems odd that a grieving mother can hold so many paradoxical feelings. And yet, when you champion a cause because you have lost a child, you find solace in strangers’ miracles.Since losing Cal, I have dreamed of meeting a 14-year-old girl with curly brown hair and brown eyes. She adores Taylor Swift and wears Nike Air Jordans. She teases her older brother and sister and drives her mother crazy. She has a huge, exciting life ahead of her.I have accepted that this girl is not my daughter Cal. It is enough to know that this girl lives because of my Cal.Maria Kefalas is a professor at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. She is the founder of the Calliope Joy Foundation andCure MLD.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_288,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a recent op-ed that there’s “no rational reason” why Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs — almost three times more than their peers overseas, according to a recent analysis.One rational reason is that, until recently, the U.S. was the only developed country that didn’t negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry. Lawmakers eager to lower Americans’ health-care costs should stay focused on getting those negotiations right.In most rich countries, one buyer — the government — bargains with manufacturers for bulk purchases of medications. In the U.S., that task falls to the private sector, largely through pharmacy benefit managers.PBMs bundle the buying power of employers and other providers of health benefits and negotiate on their behalf. The industry, which oversees prescriptions for 80% of the U.S. market, says it saves beneficiaries hundreds of billions of dollars a year.Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that PBMs haven’t been doing their job — at least, not consistently — and in some cases may be driving prices higher. For all their heft, PBMs still aren’t as effective as national governments at delivering discounts.According to recent reports, the Federal Trade Commission is preparing to sue the three largest PBMs for inflating prices, and several states have already done so.Troubled by recent trends, lawmakers have been scrutinizing the industry. Their investigations have uncovered business practices that could lead to higher prices, as well as a supply chain governed by opaque contracts and potential conflicts of interest. Legislation to address these problems has advanced through several congressional committees. It’s worth pursuing. Yet absent more evidence, it’s hard to see how these proposals will significantly lower drug prices.Fortunately, there’s a better approach. In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which authorized Medicare to bargain with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the first time. The provision, starting with 10 medications and expanding gradually, is expected to save $100 billion over five years. Biden has proposed expanding the number of medications to 50.Broadening negotiations is a good idea, so long as lawmakers recognize — and try to mitigate — the inevitable trade-offs. Drugmakers have voiced legitimate concerns that a single buyer will depress prices, discourage investment and stifle innovation.To their credit, drafters of the IRA included provisions that aimed to preserve incentives to innovate, largely by exempting most drugmakers from negotiations. If the government’s list expands, lawmakers will need to give thought to improving such protections.The law also subjects drugs with the same active ingredient — say, a liquid dose and a tablet — to negotiations even if they treat different conditions and have been filed under separate applications with regulators. These drugs should be negotiated on their own merits.For too long, the fragmented U.S. health-care system has inflated drug prices. A single government negotiator is a promising remedy. With the right incentives, lifesaving medications at reasonable prices should be an achievable goal.— Bloomberg OpinionRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.NEW YORK — Coco Gauff’s U.S. Open title defence ended in a 6-3 4-6 6-3 loss to fellow American Emma Navarro in the fourth round on Sunday, the reigning women’s champion becoming the latest big name to make an early exit at Flushing Meadows this year."
minnpost_2024_160,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Memorial Day, Father’s Day and the Fourth of July are ahead on the summer holiday calendar. Mother’s Day is now behind us for 2024. But becoming a mother isn’t about a single day — either the delivery date or the holiday. For millions of women each year, the biggest challenge about becoming a mother is the year-long mental health struggle that begins during pregnancy and continues as postpartum depression. And we are only just coming to terms with it as a society.Maternal mental health is an old problem that only recently has received recognition. We understand much more today about women’s mental health than we did even a generation ago. “Hysteria” as a condition was only formally removed as a medical diagnosis in 1980. Before we knew it as “maternal mental health,” it was the “baby blues” or even just a nameless problem chalked up to hormonal swings that one had to “shake off.”Only, too often, women haven’t shaken it off. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in eight women experience postpartum depression, and the cost is enormous. Tragically, the leading cause of death of mothers between six weeks and 12 months after birth is suicide, and about two-thirds of those deaths are among women without a previous or existing mental health condition.Other people suffer, too. Children bear the brunt, because postpartum depression interrupts the bond that women and children form, and that is so important for infant health and to lay a foundation for child development. Sadly, all too many cases of child abuse are linked to mothers struggling with their mental health. Human tragedies defy easy measurement, but statistics gathered by the non-profit Maternal Mental Health Alliance begin by putting the cost to society at over $13 billion yearly.Fortunately, we’ve made enormous progress in the last decade. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved brexanolone, a drug specifically targeted to postpartum depression. Even more important, lawmakers have put money behind outreach to women, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, signed by President Obama, in order to help get women to treatment. Medicaid has a role to play in reaching the neediest women, though this is a problem that knows no boundaries.We have only just begun to address the problem. We have begun to talk about it, yes. And we have begun to connect women to treatment, yes. But we have just scratched the surface. For one, there are too few psychiatrists, social workers and counselors out there, and it will take years for our professions to catch up to the need.But the problem was never just medical, but the American way of bearing children. If the problems were simply wild hormone swings, a pill would be enough. But it isn’t enough, not for a new mom who needs to work but can’t find child care for a newborn. It isn’t enough for new moms who cannot find a therapist in their city or town. It isn’t enough for a new mom who simply doesn’t have a network of family or friends to be there through the ups and downs. Our crisis of maternal mental health is not a unique problem but a general alarm for a society that has failed to build and maintain strong communities to support one another and especially its most vulnerable.What can be done? The first step is to keep the pressure on legislators. When the spotlight was put on maternal mental health, they were quick to respond. Moms, like apple pie, are an All-American favorite. But too many programs, like family medical leave and adequate child care, have languished. They must be seen not as luxuries, but as essential parts of a caring society.Not everyone finds that compelling, but a caring society is also a stronger society. Is it any wonder that many are concerned about declining birthrates in the United States, which leaves us an aging, less productive society? One cannot just urge people to have bigger families without doing more to support them. We must support what we value, and that begins — literally — with mom.So, no, you’re not reading this on Mother’s Day. Other holidays are right around the corner. But let’s not stop thinking about, and caring for, moms.Lea Anne Schmidt is a graduate student in social work."
philinquirer_2024_27,"Ms. Delores survived so much in her life, then met such a tragic end. Society needs to do much more to protect older people, and their right to feel safe in their own homes.I had known Delores Robinson for close to 30 years before she wasmurdered on Valentine’s Dayon the front porch of her North Philadelphia home, where she had lived for more than 40 years. When the police found her, they saw she had BB gun pellets in her head and hands, a stab wound on her neck, and cuts on her face.Her next-door neighbor, Isaiah Rahatt, 47, was arrested the next day and charged with her murder.At 83, Ms. Delores was retired, recovering from cancer, and looking forward to continuing one of her favorite pastimes of sitting on her beloved porch, conversing with neighbors and family.I met Ms. Delores a few years after graduating with one of her daughters fromMurrell Dobbins Career and Technical Education High School(alsoattended by North Philadelphia basketball icon Dawn Staley . I needed a desk, and her daughter knew Ms. Delores was trying to offload some furniture and told me to come by.I was struck by her candor, warmth, and love for the many antiques in her home, including the beautiful desk (which I gratefully accepted . It was chilly that day, so we talked inside, but it was obvious her comfortable porch was usually the headquarters for such exchanges.I was struck by her candor, warmth, and love.Like many people who relish in exhibition art, fine pieces of furniture, watches, and clocks, Ms. Delores loved collecting items that moved something in her only she could explain.My desk was an inviting and intimate piece of furniture. For years, its drawers kept everything — my diplomas, passport, and memorabilia ranging from pictures of my grandkids to personal letters from friends and family.As far as I know, Ms. Delores was not overly concerned with the matters we assume preoccupy the elderly: a walk-in shower, slip-on shoes, a stair elevator. But I know she did long for — and deserved — a life where she didn’t have to worry about being killed by her next-door neighbor.People in their 70s and 80s have lived through some of the most turbulent times in our nation’s history — from the civil rights movement to the Vietnam War, college protests, and Watergate. But for their legacy of activism, scholarship, and institutional knowledge, they have now become boiled down to the people casually dismissed with “OK, boomer,” a demographic most noteworthy for its value as a major consumer of targeted goods — a walk-in shower, slip-on shoes, a stair elevator.Rarely is it noted that violence, neglect, abuse, andpoverty are major everyday concernsof a significant percentage of the elderly in America.According to a worldwide study on elder abuse released last month by the World Health Organization, there are roughlyone billion people aged 60 and older, and one in six experienced some form of abuse during the past year; two out of three staff at nursing homes and long-term care facilities say they have abused someone in the past year. As the number of older adults rises to two billion by 2050, the WHO said it expects the problem of elder abuse to only increase over time.Prevention strategies, according to the WHO, include policy changes to protect older people, educating law enforcement about their specific needs, mental health and social workers to the unique vulnerabilities of the elderly, and even emergency shelters to shield them from financial, emotional, and physical abuse until those issues are resolved.» READ MORE:Empire of neglect: How a N.J. real estate family profited off the devastation of a Philly senior housing complexAfter Ms. Delores died, Philadelphia Police Inspector Ernest Ransom, the commanding officer of the Philadelphia Police Department’s homicide unit, said investigators believed there were issues between Rahatt and the entire block. On the day Ms. Delores was killed, police believe Rahatt followed her into her home, where they struggled, then moved to the porch. There, police said,he stabbed her in the neck and shot her with the BB gun. The neighbors called the police at 8:15 p.m.In Ms. Delores’ case, violence literally came to her door.Now, her family and friends — including me — are left wondering what could have been done to save her, and what can be done to save other people her age who may also be at risk.I was encouraged to see Mayor Cherelle L. Parker’s recent announcement ofa new post — the director of public safety— whose office will coordinate how the city responds to crime. But I haven’t seen any mention of new or creative initiatives to protect older Philadelphians, and no sense of urgency to address this growing issue of violence against them.The fact that Ms. Delores survived so much in her life, then met such a horrific end, shows how much more society needs to do to protect the elderly, and their right to feel safe in their own homes.All of us should have the right to sit on our porch in peace, and not be victimized by the kind of violence that sends ripples through entire families, neighborhoods, and a demographic that deserves better.Joseph Blake is the founder of Trestle Communications.

suffolknewsherald_2024_65,"Published 6:20 pm Tuesday, March 5, 2024ByStaff ReportsMardi Gras Sunday is one of our highlights of the year at the church I pastor. While it’s always good to worship God together, there’s just a different feel about this one. The music of the Olde James River Jazz Band, the beads, hats, extra food on the hospitality table. It’s truly something to be caught up in. A bit of “transfiguration” itself. There’s just a different way The Spirit shows up that day.With all the joy, brightness and uplifting of the singing, the photo booth and the decorations, there was an unexpected moment this year that lingers with me more than anything else. The kind of thing that doesn’t come from planned liturgy or rehearsals, but shows up when God’s spirit is present. It’s a gift to behold.We had a lot of children that day for our worship, more than usual. We actually had to add a person to our nursery care team to keep us within our ratios of adults to children. At our church, we provide nursery care, but we welcome families to participate in worship as they are most comfortable. There’s no encouragement to use the nursery care, it’s just available for those who choose it.During the worship I heard the babble of a baby a few times. It’s such a wonderful sound to me, especially in church. It was a little boy brought to church for the first time by his mother who grew up in our church. Handsome fella for sure!Just at the time in my sermon I was encouraging folks to “listen to the children” you could hear him babble just enough to be noticed. Then he did it again, as if to be sure I heard him. Thankfully, I did not miss hearing his voice, or God’s, in that moment.I paused and asked the congregation to just take that sound in for a moment. Our little friend got a little more vocal actually, and some of us chuckled at that.His mom, as moms do, was afraid he was a distraction. She got up to take him to the back of the sanctuary. It’s then I did a thing a pastor shouldn’t really do. I called attention to her. I couldn’t help it really. I wasn’t trying to do that. I just made a personal, desperate plea, “oh no, please don’t leave!” She indicated she didn’t want him to be a distraction. My heart connected to this moment, and her feelings of worry, from experience and compassion, but also from my own desires and needs as a pastor and grown man. It’s then that I said, “I need that baby in here, and that sound, more than you know. That baby gives me hope.”I instantly felt the entire congregation agreed with me. There are moments like that you just know.I learned early in seminary that one of the most important things churches do is to create hope. We live in a world that needs hope like it needs each breath. At their best, churches do that for those of their faith, other faiths, lost faith, and no faith at all. Somehow, in this moment, God’s presence interrupted through all that may have been planned for the day, in that baby’s sacred breath and voice.All that we had created with the best of intentions paled in comparison to the hope that the babbling of a baby created.Now, it’s up to us, as a church, a community and an evolved society to nurture that baby, and that hope.The next time you hear a baby babbling, even crying, give yourself a moment to process that gift. To just be in that moment. Then invite God and your spirit to a conversation. What might their dreams become? What might they need to be successful and do good in this world? What does God want us to do about that?Life begins for all of us as a babbling baby. Maybe not understood, even helpless, but certainly precious. Then we grow, and hopefully, are nurtured well along the way. Hope does the same.Mark 10:16: “And he took the children in his arms, placed his hands on them and blessed them.”The Rev.Jason Stumpis pastor of Oakland Christian United Church of Christ in Suffolk.

After reading the article, “Day for world peace” (Tribune-Herald, April 25 , the $95.3 billion package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan isn’t anything about promoting world peace, as President Biden has stated.Instead, this monetary package deal is actually funding the war machines that make the corrupted leaders of these countries enrich themselves by further lining their own pockets.America needs to wake up and start using these monies to stay in the U.S. in order to combat the nationwide problem of homelessness, critical crumbing infrastructure, and states that are affected by natural disasters.However, our leaders in the White House are currently in a state of confusion, because plain, common sense says you take care of your own people at home first before you try to solve and tackle other nations’ problems abroad.Prentiss MorenoHiloPairing homelesswith animalsHow about we offer all of the homeless people in Hawaii County safe camping facilities on public or donated land, and offer them employment in every job the community needs done? It could have an apprentice/work-study sort of experiential learning approach.And then, collect all of the unwanted, homeless dogs and cats from the island’s cat colonies and shelters and have a special program where the people care for the animals and provide very much-needed services for “animal control” at the least expensive cost possible.Cats with “cat people,” dogs with “dog people,” each previously homeless — but not any more.I call this model “Camp K-9,” as it originally was developed for homeless populations and shelter dogs facing being “put down” in shelters.Answers to our problems are right in front of us. All we need to do is reach out to choose them.One year from today, we could have a dozen or more such Camp K-9s and Camp Felines around the island, and no homeless on the street, no cat colonies, and only mercy killings at our animal “shelters” — meaning that 95% of the dogs and cats your tax dollars pay to kill every year would be saved.The choice is yours!

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_18,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°As communities along the Gulf Coast begin the cleanup from Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall Monday as a weakened Category 1 storm, they should find comfort in knowing that help is coming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is well schooled in disaster recovery and has been on the ground since spring, when some of those same areas suffered flooding in uncommonly heavy rains.However, at a time of extreme weather that causes extremely costly disasters, the federal agency is already concerned about running out of money before the Atlantic hurricane season ends. Congress has a responsibility to provide the funding necessary for FEMA to provide adequate assistance to victims, and to do so without allowing the issue to be mired in political infighting.It will be some time before the nation knows how severely Beryl affected the Texas and Louisiana coasts, but the early reports are not good. At least eight people are dead, more than 2.5 million residents lost power, and flooding inundated cities such as Houston, causing considerable damage.Before Beryl’s arrival, the United States had recorded 11 billion-dollar disasters this year. These include tornado outbreaks across the Midwest in April and May, severe rain that caused historic flooding in Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa, and winter storms that pounded the Pacific Northwest and the southern U.S.Those events come on the heels of a year in which the country experienced a record 28 billion-dollar weather disasters that collectively cost at least $92.9 billion. And with the Atlantic hurricane season projected to be among the most active in history, the nation could well set another record for both the number of disasters and their collective cost this year.Per FEMA administrators, the agency expects to exhaust the Disaster Relief Fund next month. Using estimates based on a 10-year average, officials project the fund will run a $1.44 billion deficit by the end of August and $6.28 billion in the red by Sept. 30.As many area residents know, assistance from FEMA can be a lifeline of support in troubled times, but the program isn’t designed to help victims recover all they have lost. On average, households only receive about $8,000 from the agency, leaving state and local governments and insurance companies to pick up the rest of the tab.This is emblematic of the country’s backwards approach to disasters, which emphasizes cleanup and recovery rather than preparation and resilience.That has begun to change in recent years as the perils of extreme weather become more obvious, but it’s a transformation that needs to gain steam — and quickly. It’s not only a task for the feds. The looming disaster relief shortfall is a reminder that municipal and state governments have a responsibility to invest in resilience and prepare communities long before disaster strikes. It’s a dereliction of duty to show up, mop in hand, after a storm has passed rather than to make strategic investments before it hits.It is also incumbent upon Congress to provide FEMA’s disaster relief efforts with the funding it needs to confront our new reality while also expanding its capacity to ready communities for extreme weather. This cannot be a battleground to score partisan points, but an area that demands cooperation.— The Virginian-PilotDENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.CHICAGO — Vice presidential candidate Tim Walz led fellow Democrats in a political pep rally on Wednesday night, vowing that he and presidential running mate Kamala Harris would triumph over Republican Donald Trump in November’s U.S. election."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_139,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°If you’re not already concerned about bird flu, you should be. The virus has now been found in at least 51 dairy herds in nine states as well as on countless bird and egg farms in the U.S. At least two humans have been infected in the U.S.Yet just weeks after the Biden administration announced plans to work with 50 other countries to prevent zoonotic (animal-borne diseases, Alabama and Florida passed laws making it illegal to produce meat that comes from cells grown in labs rather than from animals confined on filthy, disease-ridden farms and then slaughtered. Other states are considering similar legislation. This is a giant leap in the wrong direction.Intensive animal factories — where most animals used for food are confined — not only cause immense suffering and environmental destruction but also are hotbeds for zoonotic diseases. Sickness proliferates when animals are crowded into feces-filled sheds, cages, crates and stalls and are slaughtered on killing floors covered in blood, vomit and other bodily fluids. Meat grown in labs — aka “slaughterless meat” — meanwhile, is created in clean, controlled conditions in which diseases don’t flourish.Scientists estimate that there are 144 strains of bird flu. The H5N1 variety that’s aggressively spreading kills the most birds and is deadly to humans, killing about 60% of those who catch it. The World Health Organization recently warned that the mortality rate for humans who catch bird flu is “extraordinarily high,” noting that we’re already in the midst of “a global zoonotic animal pandemic.”Humans coming into contact with infected animals have become sick and can catch the virus just by touching a contaminated surface, such as an eggshell, and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.Consumers Union suspects that bird flu may have spread to cows because they’re routinely fed chicken litter. It typically consists of manure, feathers, feed and bedding materials as well as bacteria, viruses, antibiotics, heavy metals, pesticides, dead rodents and more. It’s often mixed with hay or corn to make it more appealing to hungry cows.But bird flu isn’t the only zoonotic disease we have to worry about. In 2009, before COVID-19 circled the globe, swine flu swept through the U.S. after hundreds of sick pigs died on a massive farm in Mexico. Swine flu thrives on pig farms, where tens of thousands of animals are crammed into damp sheds that reek of urine and feces.Health officials are quick to point out that humans can’t get swine flu from eating pork, but they rarely emphasize this important detail: The practice of raising pigs for food puts us all at risk of contracting it.Vegan foods, meanwhile, have never caused an animal-borne disease and can even protect people from pandemics. A Brazilian research team, for example, found that people who ate predominantly vegan foods had a 39% lower risk of becoming infected with COVID-19. And while slaughter-free meat isn’t widely available yet, delicious vegan meats and other cruelty-free foods are everywhere.Wouldn’t it make sense for everyone to stop eating animals before another pandemic emerges? Choosing vegan nuggets instead of ones made from ground-up birds doesn’t just save animals’ lives — it might save yours, too.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Debbie Arita, an office manager at a supermarket in Hilo, took stock of the conditions. Tropical Storm Hone was approaching the region, but the scene Friday was far from chaotic — no frantic rush for supplies, no desperate boarding up of windows."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_247,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°If you’ve ever caught a fish, you know that keeping hold of them is hard.Now imagine taking a syringe and injecting that fish with antibiotics — not just a difficult task, but a strange one. This is exactly what some large-scale fish farms do, along with dumping antibiotics into densely packed pens or mixing drugs into feed. Like concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs on land, industrial fish farms administer antibiotics to stem the outbreak of diseases that fish contract from living in such cramped spaces.But solving one problem creates another. Factory farms on land and at sea have become breeding grounds not just for livestock, poultry and fish, but also for drug-resistant microorganisms such as Salmonella and E. coli. The World Health Organization has criticized CAFOs for this reason. Some estimate that more than 70% of the global supply of antibiotics are used on animals in these kinds of operations.This arrangement benefits pharmaceutical companies like Merck, which employs hundreds of lobbyists each year to convince consumers and policymakers that factory farming is a necessity. Its subsidiary, Merck Animal Health, is an officer company of Stronger America Through Seafood, an industry group pushing for the development of intensive finfish aquaculture in U.S. waters, which would export the factory farming model from land to sea.Despite the Food and Drug Administration prohibiting the use of antibiotics to promote animal growth, there was a 12% increase in animal antibiotic sales between 2017 and 2022.The truth is, neither farming nor fishing need to be done this way. We both come from families with farming and fishing traditions centered on treating animals with respect. When you operate on a smaller scale, it’s more feasible to use holistic practices, and you don’t need the same industrial solutions — like intensive antibiotics use — as you do for factory-style food production.Legislation currently being debated, namely the Improving Agriculture, Research, Cultivation, Timber and Indigenous Commodities Act and the Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption Act, would create opportunities for community-based fishing and farming families like ours to provide high-quality, drug-free food to local markets.Both bills include provisions to improve processing, which is often a bottleneck when it comes to keeping food supply chains localized and transparent. The Improving ARCTIC Act creates pilot grant programs to strengthen domestic seafood processing and working waterfront economies in coastal communities. The PRIME Act allows small farmers and ranchers to slaughter and process their livestock at local, custom slaughter facilities. In expanding processing options and infrastructure, both acts allow small-scale food producers to better plug into local markets and get more nutritious local food to consumers.Let’s do what we can to keep fish, and other animals, off drugs. An important step in achieving this is to empower traditional and small-scale food producers that have holistic, stewardship-based relationships with the animals, lands and waters they work with. The legislative tools are there, that is if our lawmakers want to care for the health of our shared lands and waters, our food supply and us.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.A 22-year-old Hilo man accused of a series of violent assaults on his 23-year-old girlfriend has been released from custody by a judge without posting cash bail.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail."

philinquirer_2024_70,"Just as our city was the center of the celebration for the bicentennial, let s all come together to create a series of events in 2026 that are truly of the people, by the people, and for all people.Nearly 250 years ago,Philadelphia was at the center of a global change, and the beating heart of a brave and humbling experiment: the birth of America and one of the world’s first representative democracies.Now, 248 years later,we stand on the precipice of a grand anniversary of that experiment, with American democracy in the crosshairs at the same time we’re gearing up for the semiquincentennial in 2026. And as it was 250 years ago, America’s survival, growth, and continued prosperity are up to us — the people.As the former mayor of America’s birthplace and governor of our pioneering commonwealth, I am proud to lend my support to the People’s Commemoration for the 250th Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, led byPhiladelphia250.Created to celebrate the city we love as the birthplace of America, the fundamental importance of democracy, and the value of local engagement, the People’s Commemoration is of the people, by the people, and forallpeople.As a city of neighborhoods, there are so many stories to tell. So many people who have wisdom and insights to share. So many treasures and hidden gems within our neighborhoods that people don’t know about or haven’t seen.We want every Philadelphian — and that meansyou— in every corner of the city to be able to participate through activities that go beyond the traditional historic district, that highlight the diverse people and places of Philadelphia.To help make sure of that, we’ve created an advisory committee composed of civic and community leaders representing neighborhoods across the city, who will spotlight what makes each area distinctive and ensure a broad range of voices are heard.The year 2026 will be filled with big and exciting and wonderful events. And this special occasion also must celebrate the stories, the icons, and the multilayered histories that make Philadelphia — and America — so remarkable.We want to welcome everyone — those of us lucky enough to live here and those who will come and visit — to all the destinations within our destination. But we cannot do it alone.Just as Philadelphia was the center of the celebration for the bicentennial and the bicentennial of the Constitution, so it is with the 250th. And we look to the city, the commonwealth, and Washington to step up and help us ensure a year of success for 2026.Philadelphia’s history is American history. It is not all worthy of celebration. These 250 years were fraught from the beginning with contradiction and injustice — toward Black and brown people, toward Native Americans, toward women and the LGBTQ community — and those transgressions have lingering consequences that still resonate today. That reality must be recognized.So, while there is much to celebrate, there is still much more work to do, challenges and inequities to overcome. The only way to make that happen is to participate and to make your mark on this once-in-a-generation opportunity for our city and country, to make changes that will ensure the nation will be a more perfect union, and that our democracy will survive and flourish.Ed Rendell served as the 96th mayor of Philadelphia (1992-2000 and the 45th governor of Pennsylvania (2003-2011 .Here are just a few ways to add your voice to the semiquincentennial celebration.

minnpost_2024_137,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.I am an artist who spent a decade working in grant writing and economic development in the Twin Cities community development, public art and small business advising world. My belief in the transformative power of public art and space stems from many years living and working in Latin and South America, studying urban planning and practice, and attending international conferences like the Salzburg Global Seminar Cultural Innovators Forum and the recurring International Public Markets Conference.I recently spent four months in La Paz, Bolivia, and came away energized by new friendships and an agreement to translateAyer el Fuego, the latest short story collection byRodrigo Urquiola Flores. Urquiloa Flores is an award-winning, 37-year-old Bolivian author of Aymara descent from La Paz whose work has been translated into five languages, excluding English.I was keen to apply for anIndividual Artist Equity Grantto help support this transnational artistic collaboration given thatMinnesota is home to 499,000 Minnesotans that were born abroad— 9% of all residents. An additional230,000 U.S.-born Minnesotans under 18 are the children of immigrants, and many thousands more are the adult children and grandchildren of foreign-born Minnesotans. Still others, like myself, have made our homes as immigrants or refugees in other countries that remain important to us and the art we yearn to make and consume. Together, we make up at least 15% of the population, many of us eager to read more literature translated by Minnesotans from or with deep ties to Mexico, Laos, East Africa, Burma, Palestine and myriad other lands.With the belief that everyone could benefit from public resources supporting Minnesota artists working to translate literature, theater and film, I reached out to my local Arrowhead Regional Arts Council with questions about eligible budget items for the grant.I learnedvia email that the project would not “fit into the funding goals” and was provided the following explanation: “ … there’s kind of two hiccups, the main one being that the “artist” (the person creating the main work and unique ideas is not based physically in Minnesota. I know the State Arts board had more specific language on derivative work and we probably should clarify that further on the website.”I was alarmed by the art of translation being framed as “derivative” and hope to open a dialogue (hopefully multi-lingual about the dangers of Minnesota’s taxpayer-supported arts boards and councils codifying translation in this way and excluding the practice from public funding.Translation is an art form that also serves a pro-social purpose of intercultural communication, exchange and invention; translated work pushes back against dangerous, in some cases lethal, flattening stereotypes we hold about other humans and places.Minnesota’s artist-supporting funding system arose in response to, and a rejection of, an exclusionary and elitist system of patronage by a few wealthy donors commissioning art that suits their tastes. When the organization charged and trusted with democratizing access to arts funding finds it appropriate to invalidate translation as “derivative,” without allowing the grant committee to evaluate it for its beauty and ability to illuminate universal truths, the council replicates hierarchies and stifles artistic innovation and evolution.Despite the transnational lives of many Minnesotans, this is not the first time I have observed resistance while attempting to secure taxpayer-financed or facilitated funding for a Minnesota artist looking to create ambitious art with a transnational component.Five years ago, I worked with colleagues at Seward Redesign to assemble funding for a site-specific, outdoor public artwork by a wildly talented Indigenous artist and curator who designed a gorgeous glass mural that she wished to be installed byFranz Mayer of Munich, a 180 year-old, family-owned art glass studio in Germany with additional offices in New York City, where their public artcollaborations delight millions of everyday subway riders.However, I found the Metropolitan Regional Arts Council staff and reviewers hostile to the plan to work with a firm outside of Minnesota. I am still astonished at the sense of entitlement to question a celebrated Indigenous woman artist’s vision and choice of collaborators by these and other members of the Minnesota arts funding community. The work was never fully funded or installed. To see examples of the artist’s large-scale glass or ceramic art, Minnesotans must travel to private property in Madison, Wisconsin, or the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.Because of this pattern, I feel the need to publicly ask: Why the discrimination against Minnesotans living transnational or unbordered lives? Why the gatekeeping of public funds? Why the obedience to the slippery and horrid dualistic concepts of “derivative” and “original?”All art builds off of other art and ideas. How is photography or landscape painting that seeks to capture nature less “derivative” than fiction translation? Are the indigenous weavers and painters that employ thousands of years-old patterns and symbols guilty of unoriginal art? Such framing is wrong and offensive and misses the rich messiness of cultural production. These retrograde attitudes stifle Minnesotan creativity and push artists that don’t fit this narrow mold to seek community and commissions out of the state.There are ways to distribute art funding equitably and with a spirit of respect for artists and their audiences. It requires an abundance mentality and deep respect for artistic vision. It requires trust in human creativity, openness, curiosity and humility. The rewards are well worth that tiny leap of faith.Shaina Brassard is a writer and community and economic development practitioner who lived in Minnesota for 14 years (in Minneapolis, then Duluth . She is moving back to the Hudson River Valley of New York to be closer to family and nurture new creative projects."

When you hear words like that you begin to think the worst, especially in the media with a paper that’s spent a lot of years struggling while still trying to bring news and events to our community. There was a lot of frustration and tears in the last year trying to help LEO survive, because for us, it matters and we definitely think it matters to you, Louisville.Back in the late summer, I wrote a long proposal and hoped that we’d go in that direction instead of being made something that we very much are not. With that idea in mind, and being asked to slow down when we were already crawling, was a scary, scary prospect. Thankfully the proposal, and what Chris had in mind were very much in sync.We decided as a team to trust the vision — which isn’t fully realized yet, but visible — and to take a step back, make some tough decisions, and look toward the LEO that could be. We know there is life in this paper and in our community to protect one of its greatest assets and institutions.Now, we’re all seeing the benefits of that trust and the vision of our team. Y’all, it really has been a labor of love, full of real blood, sweat, and tears.Bottom line, we love LEO and our media group sees that there is potential for the paper, and for Louisville.Thank whatever deity you believe in.Our relaunch has been happening in stages. We got a new logo, designed by our production team in Detroit. With the launch of the new logo we discovered that a local rapper, also named Leo, shared our love for the same simple clean font. It was the weirdest of coincidences but one that gave both of our new logos some pretty hilarious attention.We’ve launched a new web experience. Certainly, new websites come with kinks and minor issues, so when you see something, let us know so that we can smooth out the wrinkles. Regardless, what we’re getting with the new site is improved graphics, load time, and a really clean space to present the work of our new team which includes, a lot of freelancers, the same grumpy Editor-In-Chief — me — and (so far our Digital Media Editor (and data dynamo Sydney Catinna and AE/Culture Writer Aria Baci, who will be exploring so much of the local landscape with a finely tuned lens to unseen and underseen stories. We are in the process of interviewing and finding a news writer to shine a spotlight on important local issues like government, policing and housing. The news writer will give LEO the final piece of a basic foundation upon which we intend continuing to rebuild our house.With our new print edition in your hands, you’ll notice that the new logo also comes on the cover of a fully redesigned book. Sexy, ain’t it?There is more to come with our regular events, new events and other initiatives to grow your LEO Weekly into the paper our community deserves and needs.You’ve hung with us this long, Louisville.

eugeneweekly_2024_2,"We ve got issues. The former president credits God for saving him from assassination, claiming, “God was on my side.” I actually agree, in part, and I am thankful that he was not killed that day. No, I have not had a sudden conversion to the MAGA cause. Rather, I believe his assassination would have been worse for democracy than his election and likely the beginning of a wave of political violence. (Think of all those assault-style weapons in the hands of less than reasonable people. Rather, I believe God was on his side in that moment, just as God was also on the side of Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Gabby Giffords and every other victim of an assassination attempt. Reagan, Giffords and now Trump fortunately survived. In what theological universe does it make sense that God protected the latter and not the other three? Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. It is an entirely different thing to claim God is on the side of a victim of violence than to claim that God saved someone from that violence. To suggest that God physically altered the path of a high-velocity bullet to protect Trump and apparently did not alter the path of the bullet that killed his supporter, former fire chief Corey Comperatore, is absurd. I do not know how anyone could believe in a God who chooses one over the other, as if this life is worth saving but that one is not. In seminary the theological term I learned for such thinking is “scatology,” more commonly known as “bullsh**.” For anyone paying attention to history and especially for people of faith, the notion that God intervenes physically to save people from violence died in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. This realization came to me when I was at Auschwitz 35 years after those chambers of death were destroyed. Sitting with a group of 60 German young adults seeking to come to terms with the Holocaust, a group leader read the story told by Elie Wiesel in the concentration camp. Three inmates had been caught trying to escape. To make an example of them, the Nazis hung them in the camp square and forced everyone to watch. Two died quickly, but the third was a young boy. Not being as heavy as the others, his neck did not break when he was hung and he struggled for what seemed an eternity as the horrified crowd watched. Someone cried out, “Where, oh where, is God?” A voice inside of Wiesel responded, “God is there, hanging from the gallows.” In 1998, my mother was stabbed to death by her deranged nephew. Some tried to comfort me by saying it must have been God’s will. I was not comforted. Rather it was Wiesel’s story and the story told to me by the sheriff at the scene that night of the pesky little dog guarding Mom’s body that gave me comfort. The dog was a Lhasa apso and his name was Wicket. After spending time with my newborn daughter several years before, Mom felt the need for something to cuddle. Wicket was the answer and Mom loved the little bugger dearly. When I learned about Wicket, covered in Mom’s blood, I knew that God had not abandoned her in that horrible moment, but was there, by her side. So yes, I have no difficulty believing that God was at Trump’s side in that moment through those who came to his aid and in those rendering aid to Comperatore and the other victims of the shooting. But ask me to believe that God chose to save former President Trump’s life and not Mr. Comperatore’s, let alone the lives of the Holocaust victims and other genocides, the 1,143 victims of the Hamas raid in Israel, the 30,000-plus victims of the war in Gaza — or the life of my mother — is to ask me to either hate God or to believe theological nonsense. Credit the officer who caused the shooter to hurry his shot, or maybe the rifle team that did not allow him to improve his skill, but to credit God for saving Trump is to make a mockery of all the innocent not saved by God throughout history, creating a false image of a partisan God who listens only to prayers of one particular group. Thank God for good fortune, sing “God Bless America,” but please do not make claims for God that many good believers and non-believers alike find offensive or heretical. Or as I call it, scatology.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_181,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°For his 10th violation of Acting Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan’s gag order — this time for complaining about the supposed political affiliation of the jury — Donald Trump must pay another $1,000 fine. Yet in his order, Merchan put Trump “on notice that if appropriate and warranted, violations of the court’s lawful orders will be punishable by incarceration.”Merchan was even more forceful from the bench: “It’s important you understand that the last thing I want to do is put you in jail.” But Merchan is going to have to stop making threats and act, or accept Trump will continue to break his rules. Another threat, another fine without a trip to the lockup will mean this is just another thing that Trump has gotten away with, as he has all of his 77 years.This isn’t just a question of whether staffers or jurors being merely uncomfortable about being called out by Trump, but having real safety concerns about what might come. It was his direct incitement, after all, that riled up a mob to ransack the Capitol, a mob that was fully prepared to attack members of Congress and even hang the vice president at Trump’s command.Rather than prove Trump is getting railroaded, as he and his supporters argue, Merchan’s unwillingness to apply some time behind bars shows the extent to which the former president is getting off easy.There is no way a less prominent defendant would be walking away from 10 substantiated gag order violations with some pesky fines. The gag order does not curb Trump’s free speech. It is a tailored prohibition against specifically commenting on witnesses, jurors, court staff, prosecutors and family members, including of the judge himself.There is no legitimate need for Trump to attack these people, and there are very legitimate reasons for him to be barred from doing so, not least of which the former president is at the very least unwilling to rein in his supporters’ violent impulses.It’s worth noting that only one of the four contempt claims brought by prosecutors this round were substantiated by the judge, with the other three — about witnesses Michael Cohen and David Pecker — being deemed inconclusive. That includes Trump’s winking assertion that “David’s been very nice. A nice guy,” a veiled threat right out of a bad mob movie. That was, according to the ever-careful Merchan, not enough to constitute a violation.The kid-gloves treatment has, for the near-decade that Trump has loomed so large over our political system, never worked. The odds that after all these years — and after Trump has all but directly said that his biggest takeaway from his first term was an excess of respect for the rule of law — he will keep himself in check without real consequences are, practically speaking, nonexistent. He will not stop until he is forced to stop. Every other outcome only reinforces his Pavlovian impulse to belittle, attack and dominate.We all know where this ends. It won’t be enough to simply jail Trump on contempt charges, but showing that he is not actually immune from the rules that govern everyone else will go a long way towards breaking the spell and exposing this domineering as just one more of the con man’s frauds.—New York Daily News/TNSBOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

minnpost_2024_121,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Being a defensive or cautious driver is admirable and a good quality to have, but it does not guarantee your safety or immunity from road mishaps. You may trust your driving prowess, but you can’t vouch for everyone on the road driving. Not every driver has it together; some are pensive, absent minded, spaced out or troubled. Such drivers can get you into an accident, whether you are a defensive or cautious driver or not.I consider myself a very careful and cautious driver, but it was only by God’s grace that I am alive today to tell the story of my involvement in what could have been a ghastly car accident.It was the afternoon of June 24 when I left my residence in southeast St. Cloud to pick up some exigent groceries at Sam’s Club in Sartell. It was a pleasant and enjoyable drive. Once at Sam’s Club, I wasted no time picking up the items I needed and was on my way to a Goodwill thrift store on Second Avenue South in Waite Park.Coming from the north on Second Avenue, I headed south to the store. Upon crossing the intersection of Second Avenue and Division Street while the traffic light was green, a speeding car heading west on Division Street T-boned my car with a crash that sounded like the detonation of an explosive.Thank God we had our seatbelts on! I opened my door on the driver’s side and got out. Leaning over next to the rolled-down window of the other car, I said to the driver: “Now you are no longer in a hurry!” Immediately, a young man stopped, got out of his vehicle, and came over to both drivers involved to ask if we were all right. His was a gesture that conjured up the story of the biblical Good Samaritan in my mind. It was the Good Samaritan, I believe, who called the Waite Park police.As we stood near our wrecked cars, the first police officer to arrive asked us to go to the side of the street lest we might be hit by other vehicles. We did and were standing next to an electric grid pole. A random woman came up and told the police officer that the other driver had run the red light. We both presented our licenses and insurance cards to the police officer. Isolated from each other, we told the police officer what had happened to the best of our knowledge. The police officer asked if I needed an ambulance and learned that I did not.Two tow trucks arrived shortly. The tow truck drivers helped clear the street of debris littered all over from both cars. While we were still standing by the side of the road, the other driver asked me if my family was all right and if I was all right. I told him I thought so, but wondered why he had asked if my family was all right. Unless my family was made up of invisible people, he saw me get out of my car with no one else. He told me he was all right himself, as well. He extended his hand to me for a handshake and told me he was sorry.The police officer asked the other driver to come over to him, which he did. Next, I noticed the police officer subjecting the driver to a sobriety test, which seemed very difficult for him to do. Immediately, I recalled the driver’s question about whether my family was all right.The sobriety test gave me the possible clue as to why he “saw my invisible family.” The picture of the driver was taken by the police officer, and I noticed some police officers searching the man’s car for something. As the tow truck with my car was about to take off, I informed the police sergeant that my groceries were in the trunk of my car. Let me point out at this time that the Waite Park Police were very professional and respectful. The tow truck driver agreed to give me a ride to my residence. Sensing that I could use a helping hand, he helped me carry my groceries to my front door when we got there. I thanked him and he drove off with what was left of the car that was in excellent condition earlier that day in the morning.I received the police report in the mail June 26 and learned later that my car was totaled. I can only credit divine intervention for the fact that all I seem to have sustained were bruises on my elbows and left knee and pain in areas around my left and right shoulder blades. To God be the glory!Anthony Akubue is a resident of St. Cloud."
philinquirer_2024_66,"Joe Sestak, a former U.S. congressman and a retired rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, writes there is no one better than Tim Walz to have the back of working men and women in the White House.Gov.Tim Walzis the right vice presidential choice for our divided nation.He didn’t spend a quarter of a century focused on crafting a rising political career. Instead, he mastered his craft as working men and women often do: by handling several jobs at once — as an enlisted service member, a high school teacher, and a football coach. Each was a working man’s profession of service.At the end of those 25 years, Walz entered Congress, where his best salary until then — about $40,000 per year — was suddenly quadrupled. His working-class experience and roots mean he’s probably theleast wealthy vice presidential candidate in history, with a net worth less than the median for citizens his age.Why is this important? Because working-class citizens innately understand their too-often underrecognized achievements are as important as high salaries or elite positions.Take the enlisted, the military’s working service members.When Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of the Soviet general staff, visited America in 1988, his U.S. counterpart, Adm. William J. Crowe, took him on a tour of military installations and ships. At the end, Crowe asked what most impressed the Soviet marshal about America. His reply: “Your enlisted men — we don’t have them.” Crowenoted that Akhromeyev“thought it was remarkable that enlisted people were not afraid to speak out and were not intimidated by their officers.”Walz wore the cloth of our nation for 24 years, and was selected by merit to rise to one of the top ranks available toour military’s treasure: its enlisted men and women. Who better to have the back of working men and women in the White House?I entered Congress with Walz, both of us representing mostly working-class districts that had been Republican for most of a century. Trusted by his constituents, he was always reelected.As fellow veterans, we’d sit around after votes, swapping stories from our pre-political careers. Mine included sailors who had saved my tail: just one example was how a young enlisted petty officer grabbed my elbow firmly as we sailed in a fog bank and commanded me, “Turn now, Captain!” after I had failed to heed him the first time. We just missed going aground, thanks to his willingness to tell me I was wrong.Some have questioned this working man about inartful or wrong statements regarding his working career. In answering, I believe that a politician complaining about political attacks is like a sea captain complaining about the sea. It’s better to put them into perspective.First, the attacks Walz is experiencing may seem minor compared with thedishonorable swift boatingof John Kerry, who had been awarded several Vietnam combat medals, including the Silver Star. Or the attacks on Adm. Mike Boorda, the first enlisted man and first non-Naval Academy graduate to be the chief of naval operations. Accused of having at one time inappropriately worn Vietnam combat medals, he walked out of his office and died by suicide — despite his then-commander in Vietnam, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, insisting he had verbally authorized Boorda’s medals.Nevertheless, the attacks must be addressed.Walz used “retired” in front of his last Army rank, and he said once that he’d been “in war.” The military’s tradition is one of accountability — answering for what you have done — so Walz owned his mistake and corrected his misstatements.As for Walz saying he had served in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, he is justified in doing so. There were routinely five to nine support veterans serving outside Afghanistan for every military member who was deployed inside the war zone itself. His medal was for the support he provided.Finally, in terms of the timeline of his decision to enter politics rather than deploy toIraq, a careful reconstruction of dates — deciding to run for Congress, rumors that the unit would deploy, and actual orders to deploy — shows that he had decided to serve his country as a congressman before his unit received the actual orders to deploy.One of our finest officers, Gen. Colin Powell, often said: “Your responsibility is to tell me what you know. Tell me what you don’t know. Then you’re allowed to tell me what you think. But you always keep those three separated.”This maxim should be adhered to today by those still making unproven claims about an enlisted leader who served with full honor.Joe Sestak is a former U.S. congressman (PA-07 and retired U.S. Navy rear admiral."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_251,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Nearly 60 years ago, on Oct. 20, 1964, Kamala Devi Harris was born in Oakland, California.That day, at the very moment she took her first breath, the future vice president of the United States became Black.Harris was Black when she was a kindergarten student in Berkeley, Calif., where she was bussed to a white neighborhood as part of the city’s desegregation program.Harris was Black when the woman who ran her daycare center decorated the walls with pictures of abolitionists Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth.Harris was Black when she enrolled at Howard University, an HBCU in Washington, D.C., and she was Black when she became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country’s oldest historically Black sorority.Harris was Black when she became San Francisco’s district attorney, Black when she was California’s attorney general, Black when she was elected to the U.S. Senate, Black when she was Joe Biden’s running mate and Black when she was sworn in as vice president of the United States.And she will stay Black until she dies.“My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters,” Harris wrote in “The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,” her 2019 memoir.“She knew her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.”Any doubts about her Blackness are the wicked work of Donald Trump. For years, Trump promoted the lie that Barack Obama was born abroad, an evil, racist conspiracy theory aimed at undermining the nation’s first Black president.Trump has resurrected the strategy, suggesting — to a group of Black journalists, of all people — that Harris only recently began to identify herself as Black.Harris, the product of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, took the high road.“Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America,” Harris’ campaign said in a statement. “So he attempts to divide us.”Harris’ Indian heritage allows her to identify as Southeast Asian, proof that in America, many people check more than just one box.There’s even dual citizenship, as demonstrated by NBA stars like Joel Embiid, the Philadelphia 76ers center born in Cameroon who holds French and U.S. passports and is a member of Team USA in men’s basketball at the Olympics.You can be more than one thing, and you don’t always have to choose. You can be French and Canadian. You can be a Jew and a U.S. citizen. You can be Black and a journalist.That leads us to our other latest Trump controversy. Before Trump ignited a firestorm at the NABJ convention, which wraps up on Sunday, members were divided over whether the former president should have even been invited.The convention’s co-chair, Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, even quit her convention chair post in protest over the invitation.That seems counter to our mission as journalists, which is to hold Trump accountable — as we would any candidate — and expose the lies.Mission accomplished."
suffolknewsherald_2024_24,"Published 7:06 pm Wednesday, June 26, 2024ByStaff ReportsChris QuilpaLack of trust is a lack of faith. If we trust someone, our spouse, or partner in/for life, we have faith in them. If we have trust and faith, our belief is strong and grounded. And Love exists. When we say, “I believe in you,” we can also say, “I trust and have faith in you.” I love you because I trust and have faith in you. Love exists because we have trust and faith. This Love can symbolize Jesus Christ.Proverbs 3:5-6 states, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not unto Thy understanding. In all Thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct Thy path.” The word that strikes me most in this Biblical passage or statement is trust- Trusting in Jesus, our Lord and Savior.Trust is the foundation of our faith in God. Having faith in God is trusting Him who we believe will love us and not abandon us, no matter what situation we are in, even in our moments of darkness, disappointments, and/or despair.The dictionary defines trust as a firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something. Synonymous to trust are belief, faith, confidence, sureness, and freedom from suspicion/doubt.Trust in the Lord that everything will be alright in your life. He takes care of you if you believe and trust in Him, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.Problems abound in life. They’re aplenty for as long as we’re alive and well, sick, injured, or ill. Having faith and trust in Jesus assures us that we can manage even the most difficult situations that come into our lives.Trust is one of the hallmarks of a strong relationship, like our relationship with God and with one another, and we can experience joy and happiness, security and confidence, and peace.The world is not ours. We’re just inhabitants, wanderers, vagabonds using and abusing and wasting all the earth’s resources. We’re just consuming what Mother Nature has provided us since time immemorial. Depletion of natural resources has yet to be vigorously addressed with loving concern and care. We all reap the benefits of Earth’s most precious, non-renewable natural resources, with a fortunate few amassing wealth from these exploitation and exploration. Once used, they’re invaluable and irreplaceable. But, our trust in the Lord will care for our worries, no matter what kind of life we’ll have on earth.Though life is simple yet complicated because of crises, challenges, and changes taking place, as long as we trust in the Almighty God through His begotten Son, Jesus Christ, we’re hopeful that we’re going to be okay. There are no worries or troubles if and when we have faith and trust in Jesus. He directs us to be upright and lawful. He guides us to a life of holiness with our prayers of thanksgiving, humility, and forgiveness.Trusting in the Lord makes our life easier to handle and to live. It should be our guide in our everyday life if we’re believers and followers of Jesus. In all we do, in all we have and don’t have, trust in the Lord, Jesus Christ. He is always there for us, sinners and saints, waiting for us to welcome him into our life. He loves us for who and what we are. Just trust Him. He’ll direct your life of faith, hope, charity, peace, and love.Having a problematic situation in life, a relationship that does not working for both parties, a sort of a failed marriage or broken family, going through a tumultuous on-and-off relationship without a sign of good, peaceful resolution, the only thing that matters now for you is to trust in God or put your trust in Him completely, believing that He’ll take care of you. He won’t abandon you and let you down because He loves you, no matter your situation.Simply, silently say and pray, “Jesus, I trust in you.” Always.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_59,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°United Airlines passenger aircrafts are lined up on May 11 at O Hare International Airport in Chicago. (Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty Images/TNS Summer air travel is in full swing, and people are getting ticket shock at what it costs to fly.Airlines use a complex system to price their tickets. This complexity means that it is highly likely that the prices paid for most tickets on any given flight are different.Such price differences are a consequence of the hub-and-spoke system used by legacy airlines such as Delta, United and American and dynamic pricing models that squeeze every last dollar out of every seat to make it more likely for airlines to stay profitable.This economic pricing model is part of a larger yield management system, which prices tickets based on route competition, seat availability, anticipated demand and time until flight departure.One consequence of this model is hidden-city ticketing, sometimes referred to as skiplagging. Hidden-city ticketing exploits the economic model employed by airlines. Airlines must compete on every route that they offer tickets for.If a person wishes to fly from Roanoke, Virginia, to O’Hare International Airport, they can purchase a direct flight on United. Alternatively, they can purchase a connecting ticket on United from Roanoke to Madison, Wisconsin, with a stopover at O’Hare, and not use the Chicago-to-Madison segment. In doing so, they may save a little money.For some people, this makes no sense. Why would someone buy more flying? Because direct flights, particularly out of or into hub airports, are valued by flyers and can be priced at a premium compared with connecting itineraries.Airlines are not pleased when travelers exploit this loophole in their economic model. United’s contract of carriage explicitly forbids such practices, threatening penalties that may affect a person’s frequent flyer accounts and ability to fly in the future. Even legal action is proposed as a possible response and remedy.Yet the concept of hidden-city ticketing has parallels to pricing models used in other service industries.Cellphone, television and internet providers offer bundled packages that may include a collection of channels and services, some of which customers are not interested in. If users decided to individually purchase only those services they would like, they would find that their total cost may be higher. For these providers, it is considered a smart business strategy to be a one-stop service provider.Certainly, there are differences between cellphone, television and internet providers compared with air travel. However, the principle of using less than what you purchase to pay less for what you want is the common thread woven through both.So should hidden-city ticketing be banned?As in most things in life, there are risks, and there are rewards. If a traveler wishes to exploit this loophole in air ticket pricing, they may be rewarded with a lower cost to travel. They will also be assuming some risk that their planned stopover airport gets changed due to a flight cancellation or disruption. Airlines have no obligation to deliver the same route that was purchased, just the same destination.Airlines should be happy that some travelers have deciphered the intricacies of hidden-city pricing. It provides evidence that their yield management models are working and that they are reaping the benefit of the economic model that produces the most revenue from their full schedule of flights.Moreover, the number of people employing hidden-city ticketing is likely small compared with the total number of travelers they carry. This means that the economic impact of hidden-city ticketing is also negligible, even if the optics of people using the strategy may be what is at the core of the airlines’ dislike of the practice.Airlines have even attempted to sue travel websites that facilitate hidden-city ticketing. Ironically, such tickets can be purchased directly on airline websites. The only requirement is knowing what city to set as your final destination, while passing through a hub airport, which is your ultimate objective. With practice, finding such cities becomes quite easy.Airlines can end hidden-city ticketing by pricing tickets linearly, with more travel costing more dollars. They could also price all direct-flight tickets based on the lowest possible hidden-city itinerary. In both cases, the revenue lost by the airlines would be so severe as to threaten their solvency, something that hidden-city ticketing will most certainly not do.Hidden-city ticketing is not going away anytime soon. There is nothing intrinsically illegal about it, even if it gets under the skin of airlines. It is also a self-inflicted wound (and cost of their highly successful economic model.Congress recently reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration. If the FAA really wants to help passengers, it should work across all airlines to create a standardized set of principles common across all contracts of carriage that all stakeholders can understand and agree to. It would also be a good time to remove threats against passengers associated with hidden-city ticketing, accepting that it will occur.The most reasonable policy is to place the burden of responsibility on passengers who choose to use this ticketing approach, so if flights are disrupted, they, not the airlines, must accept the consequences of not flying through their connecting city. With such a sensible policy, hidden-city ticketing will likely remain a small fraction of all tickets issued.Hidden-city ticketing elicits the phrase “caveat emptor” — let the buyer beware — but with such knowledge, it may save some a few dollars.Sheldon H.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_178,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°President Joe Biden’s move Thursday to expand two national monuments in California is unquestionably good news for our climate and environment.One proclamation will increase the size of San Gabriel Mountains National Monument by nearly one third, adding more than 105,000 acres of mountains and foothills above communities from Sylmar to Monrovia that were left out when President Obama first designated the area in 2014. The other will add 13,696 acres to Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in Northern California to protect Molok Luyuk, or Condor Ridge.But Biden shouldn’t stop there. His administration should build on these conservation efforts and extend monument status to three other ecologically rich California landscapes with deep significance to Indigenous tribes.The most significant proposal would create Chuckwalla National Monument on more than 600,000 acres of federal land near Joshua Tree National Park stretching from the Coachella Valley to the Colorado River. Another would establish the 200,000-acre Sáttítla Medicine Lake Highlands National Monument near Mt. Shasta. The third would designate Kw’tsán National Monument on 390,000 acres in Imperial County along the border with Mexico and Arizona.Protecting those lands would put California closer to its goal of conserving at least 30% of land and coastal waters by 2030. With Thursday’s proclamations adding 120,000 acres, California now has about 24.5% of its land conserved under its “30×30” initiative, according to the state. But there’s still 5 million more acres to go. And it’s hard to see a realistic path to achieving that without increasing protections on large swaths of federal land.“We believe the time is now,” said California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot, who attended the White House ceremony Thursday where Biden signed the national monument expansions alongside tribal leaders, conservation groups and elected officials.With nearly half of California’s land owned by the federal government, “there’s no way we’re going to hit 30×30 without enhanced conservation measures, enhanced protections on federal lands,” Crowfoot said in an interview.Biden has now invoked the Antiquities Act 10 times during his presidency to designate and expand national monuments. The 1906 law has been used hundreds of times by presidents of both parties to establish or expand protections in places as breathtaking and beloved as the Grand Canyon, Death Valley and Joshua Tree.This authority conferred by the act allows him to bypass Congress, and the Republican-controlled House that is unlikely to advance legislation to protect these areas. With the November election on the horizon, it would be prudent for Biden to act on the three remaining California proposals within the next few months and cement his legacy by conserving more land during his first term than any other president since Jimmy Carter.Boosting federal protection isn’t just the right thing to do; it’s in humanity’s self-interest to set aside wild open spaces that provide an outlet for public recreation, help keep the air and water clean, preserve rare species and provide a protective buffer as we experience the worsening effects of climate change and biodiversity loss. Doing so would set the state and nation on a more sustainable path and leave behind a conservation legacy that will yield benefits generations into the future.—Los Angeles Times /TNS"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_197,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°University campuses nationwide have long been the focus of political debates and battles in the form of protests and demonstrations. In recent weeks, students galvanized by their consciences have been leading an anti-war movement that our nation hasn’t seen the likes of in decades, and it is spreading like wildfire. At last count, at least 100 Gaza solidarity encampments have been launched at colleges and universities.These students are setting up tents, staging sit-ins and raising their voices in solidarity with the people of Gaza. But their courageous actions are about more than protesting the war. They’re about demanding justice, challenging authority, and reshaping and normalizing the conversation around one of the most pressing issues of our time — freedom and liberation for Palestine.The urgency of this moment is spurred by the reality that for more than 200 days, they, along with the rest of the world, have witnessed the Israeli government’s brutal massacring of at least 34,000 Palestinian civilians in Gaza, including more than 14,000 children.On April 30, Haaretz reported that Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who is a member of the security cabinet, called for the “total annihilation” of Rafah and other areas of Gaza. He said: “There are no half measures. (The Gazan cities of Rafah, Deir al-Balah, Nuseirat — total annihilation. ‘You will blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.”This genocide is being waged with American students’ tax and tuition dollars. A growing number of them recognize they have a moral obligation to mobilize swiftly against the Israeli government’s violent, catastrophic rampage bolstered by the Biden administration and Congress.These students feel compelled to act, knowing it’s wrong for their colleges and universities to invest their tuition funds into weapons manufacturing companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing, enabling these institutions to profit off Israel’s military campaigns against Palestinians.They’ve done their homework, and they know that many universities, such as Yale, aren’t obligated to disclose most of their investable assets in SEC filings, and their investment portfolios are often not publicly accessible. This lack of transparency means there’s no way of knowing the actual dollar amount their institutions are investing in these companies.That’s why two of the critical demands of many student protesters launching encampments, such as at Johns Hopkins University, is that their universities disclose financials and divest from weapons manufacturing companies.Student activists courageously leading the charge to demand justice, transparency and accountability are risking their safety, freedom, education, future and even lives. They deserve our gratitude, attention and support. Instead, as one student put it, “We’re often met with tear gas, threats and intimidation.”According to sources, more than 1,200 people have been arrested in college protests. That number has risen as New York officers stormed Columbia University and arrested dozens more people Tuesday.To understand the significance of what’s happening on campuses today, we must first look back at history. In 1970, during the Vietnam War, the world was shaken by the events at Kent State University. Students protesting the war were met with violence, and four students were tragically killed by the National Guard. The Kent State shootings became a symbol of the struggle for justice and a rallying cry for those who refused to accept the status quo.Today, the parallels between Kent State and the Gaza solidarity encampments are impossible to ignore. Just as the students at Kent State were protesting the violence of war, today’s students are protesting Israel’s decades-long violence and oppression of the Gazan people. They are demanding an end to Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestine, lifting the siege on Gaza and an end to violations of Palestinian human rights. Like the students at Kent State, they are too often facing criticism, pushback and violence for daring to speak out.Despite their challenges, these students are determined to make their voices heard. As one student organizer said, “The violence I’m risking here can’t compare to the violence Hind Rajab experienced there.” (Hind was a 6-year-old girl killed in Gaza. They acknowledge that they’re protesting on their campuses while there are no universities remaining in Gaza. They recognize that silence in the face of oppression and genocide is not an option. They believe in the power of collective action and the importance of standing up for what is right. And they’re willing to do what many others lack the courage or conviction or willpower to do: risk sacrificing to fight for a better world.The significance of the current campus activism represents an unequivocal rejection of the politics of fear and division. It’s a reminder of what’s possible when people unite and organize.These students are on the right side of history.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

eugeneweekly_2024_38,"We ve got issues. So I’ve lived in Eugene for 17 years. The entire time, I’ve commuted to work on foot, two miles in the morning and two miles home in the evening. In my seventh year here, I chose to get rid of my car, so now I walk nearly everywhere. I still use Zipcar for monthly grocery shopping, and LTD about once a week for cross-town trips, but as a public service I have five tips for being a power user of Eugene’s sidewalks and shared bike paths. 1. Practice good manners. Eugene does not have a jaywalking crime on its books. You can cross the street almost anywhere you like, so long as you respect three limits. First, you are expected to make a right angle, which means you cross to the closest spot on the opposite side; you don’t wander around in the street. Second, you are expected not to disrupt traffic when you cross. Third, there is a crime on the books for disobeying a signal, so you actually can get cited if you cross in the crosswalk when it says don’t. But that second expectation is really what it’s all about. When you cross a street, check very carefully in all possible directions for oncoming traffic. If there is not a blasted thing headed your way, then walk. Do it if you’re mid-block, do it if you’re in the crosswalk. If you see cars coming, make a reasoned decision whether stepping into the street will force them to slow down. If they just have to get off the gas and coast for a second, then maybe, but if you make them stomp on the brakes, you’re an idiot and need a pipe wrench upside your head. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Assuming you’re considerate of what your choices might make drivers do, you can cross when you like. I disobey crosswalks all the time if nothing’s coming, because I do not let motionless inanimate objects tell me my business. In 17 years, only once have I had one of Eugene’s finest read me the riot act, and she was clearly having a bad day. 2. You have eye beams. When you cross parking lot exits, driveways, spots where your path goes through someone’s right turn, do one simple thing: look directly into the driver’s eyes. You don’t even have to be able to see them clearly; just stare at the spot on the windshield behind which you know the driver is sitting. It turns you into Cyclops from the X-Men. I teach nonverbal communication, among other things, and we talk quite a bit about eye contact. Ever been in public and noticed someone looking at you? We are hardwired to lock on to direct eye contact from other people, so it’s a very effective way to get a driver to notice you. From time to time I walk someplace with a student, and I get a chance to demonstrate the superpower to them: a car comes barreling up to the intersection, and I look directly at the driver, and my student sees the car slow down. Boom, my eye beams stopped a car. The raw, cosmic power is intoxicating. 3. Walk behind them. If your path goes directly in front of an idling car, and you’re not sure if the driver sees you, swerve a little and walk behind them. This can be a pretty cool town for bumper sticker-reading, so stop and smell the slogans. And if it’s a Trump-Vance sticker, whisper to yourself that they’re driving away from you and out of your life forever. 4. Bike paths are freeways. You are the slow traffic, so stay in the right lane. Back when Barack Obama was still a senator, I trained myself to walk very close to the edge of the Ruth Bascom bike path; since then, tens of thousands of bikes have gone whizzing past me with room to spare.That choice is now etched into muscle memory, and in 17 years of twice-daily walks through Alton Baker Park, I have been in zero collisions and not more than a handful of near misses. If you do need to move in from the edge of the bike path, make like you’re changing lanes and look over your shoulder. If nothing’s coming, you’re good. If someone is living out a Tour de France fantasy, give them a second to win the yellow jersey before you make your move. 5. Stand up to the rain like you would any other bully. Every time I tell someone I walk nearly everywhere, they ask, “Even in the rain?” I am dumbfounded at that kind of pusillanimity. It’s Oregon. If you let rain confine you to a building or a car, you’re just paying attention to its tantrum. This town taught me that if it’s just drizzling, go get a little damp. You could probably use some rinsing anyway. For times when it’s more like a Bambi Bucket, I own a good raincoat and pair of rain pants. In fact, I am now on my third raincoat. Back in my home state of Texas, we didn’t know raincoats could wear out. As for hair, I shave my head, so raindrops feel really good on it. Carless by choice is the way to go. I have the advantage of also being spouseless and childless by choice, and I live in a helpful neighborhood, but it really seems like too many people are missing out on the possibilities: I ignore gas prices, never hunt for a parking space, and enjoy droll conversations with people concerned about my car’s extended warranty. Walking is great for physical and mental health, and Eugene is a great town for it.

suffolknewsherald_2024_73,"Published 5:49 pm Tuesday, February 20, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAre traffic enforcement cameras a money grab or about safety? It depends on who you ask.When we spoke with Director of Public Works Robert Lewis to clear some of the public confusion regarding these camera systems, he reiterated what Interim Police Chief James Buie and many others have said throughout this discussion – it is about safety.This is where some of the public and our city leaders part ways on the topic. Lewis sat down with us to discuss the many concerns and shed more light on the topic, and for that, we thank him. The discussions have been ongoing for months, and at this point, it is time everyone comes to grips with the fact these cameras are here to stay. Not only do they deter people from breaking traffic laws, but they also allow Suffolk Police to reallocate manpower to other areas of concern throughout Suffolk, something many of you feel stronger about than whether or not someone was caught running a redlight or speeding through a construction zone.We are likely not going to change everyone’s opinion. Still, we do feel as if these systems have been implemented in part for highway safety purposes and in a way to help offset the cost of needed safety improvements, such as the addition of a crosswalk between Kings Fork Middle and High School that the council has already given the green light to install.We also hope the city quickly resolves some of the documented operational issues with some of the school zones so we can have more faith that they are trying to get it right and not hoping we aren’t paying attention.The overall message is to slow down, obey the traffic laws, and arrive safely at your destination.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_206,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°It seems unlikely that the Supreme Court will embrace Donald Trump’s outrageous claim that as a former president he enjoys absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions that he allegedly took to overturn the 2020 election and cling to power. This is a relief. To do otherwise would allow the office to become, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put it, “the seat of criminal activity in this country.”Ominously, however, some conservative justices during Thursday’s oral argument expressed exaggerated concerns about prosecuting former presidents. That raises the possibility that the case might be returned to the lower courts for a determination of which of Trump’s alleged actions constituted “official acts,” a category Trump’s lawyers have defined broadly.Such a muddled outcome would be a mistake, and not only because it would make it less likely that Trump would be put on trial before the November election. If the justices focus on the allegations against Trump, they can and should rule there should be no protection for criminal conduct just because it is connected in some way to the president’s official duties.Understandably, some questions focused on the future implications of a ruling denying Trump immunity. For example, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch expressed a concern about “future uses of the criminal law to target political opponents based on accusations about their motives.” He noted that the court would be “writing a rule for the ages.”Of course, the justices should think about the consequences of their decisions. But the primary focus in this case should be on whether Trump is entitled to immunity for the specific actions he allegedly took in an attempt to overturn the election.The answer should be no. Allowing the most powerful person in the nation, if not the world, to operate without any fear of prosecution for, say, ordering the murder of a political opponent or throwing out election results is a recipe for a dictatorship.Under questioning from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s lawyer, John Sauer, conceded that some of the actions Trump allegedly took were private acts. But even supposedly “official” acts — such as Trump’s alleged effort to enlist the Justice Department in an attempt to overturn the election — were allegedly part of what former Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben, representing the government, called an “integrated conspiracy,” in which the former president allegedly used his official powers and his private conduct to try to subvert the election.Dreeben discussed the distinction between acts a president seeking reelection takes as an “officeholder” and those he takes as an “office-seeker. (Sauer said he accepted the distinction between a president acting as president versus acting as a candidate. The court should recognize that a president can be acting as an “office-seeker” — or, in Trump’s case, someone seeking to hold on to an office after losing an election — even when his official duties are involved. Dreeben reminded the justices that one of the acts that put former President Richard Nixon in jeopardy was his attempt to have the Central Intelligence Agency shut down the FBI’s Watergate investigation. That is an apt analogy to the allegation that Trump tried to have the Justice Department abet his attempt to subvert democracy.—Los Angeles Times/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
philinquirer_2024_31,"The heroism of West Philly native Waverly Woodson, who was honored with a street renaming Friday, will be a revelation to most. Hopefully, other stories of previously unknown Black heroes will follow.On Friday, Philadelphia honored Waverly B. Woodson Jr. — an Overbrook High School and Lincoln University graduate — by adding his name to a street sign near his boyhood home in the Carroll Park section of West Philadelphia.The heroism of Woodson, a veteran of World War II, will be a revelation to most. African Americans weren’t depicted in war newsreels, nor were they seen in movies about D-Day such asThe Longest DayandSaving Private Ryan.However, about2,000 Black troops landed on Omaha and Utah Beaches.As an amateur historian, I first learned about Woodson’s bravery in 1997, when the Army publishedThe Exclusion of Black Soldiers from the Medal of Honor in World War II. That book highlighted the bravery of multiple individuals whose actionsabove and beyond the call of dutywere “overlooked” in the awarding of our nation’s highest military award for bravery.That omission was corrected in 1997,when seven soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor. Unfortunately, most of Woodson’s military records had been destroyed in amassive 1973 fire(which coincidentally occurred on July 12 . Woodson didn’t receive it.It’s sad America needs to look to Germany to learn how to reconcile the present with history. From 1933 through 1945, Nazi Germany murdered over a third of the world’s Jews, destroyed thousands of synagogues and cemeteries, as well as Jewish schools and community buildings. Immediately after World War II ended, Germany coddled known Nazi war criminals and did little to acknowledge its sins.However, over the last few decades,Holocaust education has become mandatory in German schools. Today, Germany has hundreds ofhistorical markers and monumentsrecalling the official persecution of its Jews. It has rebuilt synagogues that were destroyed. It has installed over100,000 Stolpersteine brass plaquespermanently affixed to the pavement in front of buildings where Jews lived before they were murdered during the Nazi era.Descendants of the survivors of theMiddle Passage, which killed substantially over a million Africans on their horrific journey to the Americas, have suffered from slavery,debt peonage, sharecropping, lynching, state-sanctioned pogroms,redlining, segregation, discrimination, and police brutality. However, until recently, American schools have been reluctant to teach all this shameful history.More than two decades ago, attorneyMichael Coardbegan his campaign to incorporate historical references to the legacy of slavery at Independence Mall. Thanks to his efforts, the stories of how slaveholders Martha and George Washington kept their “property” a stone’s throw from the Cradle of Liberty are included at thePresident’s House Site, which is now a must-see for every school student and tourist.Before 1990, thePennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had erected only two of its distinctive blue-and-gold historical markersrecognizing African American individuals, institutions, or events in Black history.Charles L. Blockson, the noted scholar of Black history, dedicated the next 30 years of his life to getting the commission to erect over 50 African American-themed markers.Today, there are efforts to limit teaching Black history and acknowledging that America has had a racist legacy.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis recently proclaimed thatslaves benefited from slavery.During the race for the Republican presidential nomination, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley didn’t mention slavery when she was first asked aboutthe cause of the Civil War.African Americans weren’t depicted in World War II newsreels, nor were they seen in movies about D-Day.Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stated that historically Black colleges and universities wereestablished to support school choice, conveniently ignoring that many predominantly white institutions barred African American students.Permanently acknowledging Woodson’s bravery brings his story to the fore. Hopefully, other stories of previously unknown African American heroes will follow.The study of African American participation in World War II shouldn’t be limited to Dorie Miller and the Tuskegee Airmen.Over one million Black men,6,500 Black members of the Women’s Army Corps, and500 Black nursesserved in North Africa, Liberia, Italy, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Guadalcanal, Guam, Saipan, Iwo Jima, India, China, Hawaii, Alaska, and in every state.The challenges these brave soldiers faced as they were subjected to segregation and discrimination in the military — while being expected to fight fascism abroad — became the crucible that forged in them a postwar spirit that forever changed America to truly being a country “with liberty and justice for all.” Their stories must be told.Paul L. Newman is an amateur historian of African American history. He has written a miniseries docudrama on the African American civil rights movement of the first half of the 20th century."

This year’s derby offered a record purse payment, fueled in large part by technological advances that have brought new ways for racing fans to enjoy pari-mutuel wagering in Kentucky.Forty years ago, Minnesota voters legalized pari-mutuel betting on horse racing. Once this constitutional amendment was approved, it took time for horse racing to succeed in Minnesota. Thirty years ago, my father and I, along with Dale Schenian, purchased the Canterbury Downs track after it closed, hoping to keep Minnesota racing alive.Today, Canterbury Park is a publicly-traded company with thousands of shareholders, and we attract more than one million visitors to our property annually. For three decades, we have worked closely with the horse industry, our communities, state regulators and legislators, achieving the goals of:As we approach our 30thseason of live racing as Canterbury Park, we continue to work with those same goals in mind.Unfortunately, horse racing has reached a crossroads nationally. States like Kentucky that have adopted strategies to enhance purses are watching their racing thrive, while states that have ignored racing have seen tracks close. We believe that many Minnesotans want horse racing to continue to thrive here and for the economic benefits to increase, but that outcome is threatened unless racetracks are part of a thoughtful plan about how gaming will continue to grow in Minnesota.We don’t believe this is an issue only for racetracks. In fact, Canterbury Park strongly recommends that the Minnesota Legislature develop a plan that includes the needs of racetracks, the twenty-one tribal casinos and the more than 1,000 charities that sponsor games in bars and restaurants across the state. Each of these operators of gaming are providing a unique set of economic and community benefits within Minnesota.Each of these groups has proven to be a trusted operator of gaming for decades. But today, each of these groups is threatened by the same competitive pressures as internet gaming breaks down the walls of state and tribal regulation. Yet the legislative debate is not treating all forms of gaming equally.This session, the Legislature is considering bills that would ban Historical Horse Racing, a form of pari-mutuel betting that has increased racing purses in Kentucky and other states. The Legislature is also considering bills that would exclude the racetracks from owning licenses in sports betting, an ironic result since only racetracks have experience managing betting on live sporting events in Minnesota.Other bills were introduced this year to limit existing card room games at racetracks that have provided critical revenue for racing purses, and changes to charitable gaming in the 2023 session have been criticized statewide as threatening the viability of local charities.This effort to pick winners and losers as gaming expands is unprecedented in Minnesota. We should be approaching this gaming discussion differently, seeking the broadest economic and community benefits from new gaming while providing appropriate regulation to prevent abuse and addiction.A failure by state policymakers to adopt a balanced gaming solution among the racetracks, tribal casinos and charitable gaming will almost certainly result in irreparable damage to Minnesota’s horse/agricultural industry and the employees of the state’s two racetracks — an avoidable consequence that will jeopardize the future of Minnesota’s horse racing.For two years, we have shared this message with legislators:the broadest benefits will come from bringing all of these parties together and setting a clear direction for new gaming in Minnesota. If we are all at the table, working together, Minnesota will get this right.Randy Sampson is the CEO of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_292,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Thomas Matthew Crooks should never have been able to get on a roof fewer than 150 yards from former President Donald Trump, let alone take several shots at him — almost killing him, wounding two rallygoers and murdering a third. The shot was an inch away from a national and international catastrophe, and the institutions tasked with securing the event must be held accountable.Butler County District Attorney Richard Goldinger called the situation “embarrassing,” and that’s the kindest word he could have used. Public statements by law enforcement agencies are already devolving into subtle blame-shifting.Local police have wondered why the Secret Service agents perched above the rally stage didn’t spot the gunman, and the Secret Service has suggested local law enforcement was tasked with securing the area beyond the rally grounds.And now we know that not only bystanders but other law enforcement personnel saw a man with a gun and identified the risk.The one local officer who climbed up to the roof to investigate was unarmed.The Secret Service countersnipers — who did not need authorization to shoot at an active threat —had the responsibility to protect Trump and the people around him.How is it possible that they still hesitated to take their shot until Crooks had already fired?Further, how was that roof not secured by law enforcement to begin with? Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle told ABC News that the sloped nature of the roof made it too dangerous to station officers there.This is ludicrous: It wasn’t too dangerous for a 20-year-old novice marksman.And isn’t accepting danger part of being in the Secret Service? Agents put their body between the president and a bullet.They can take the small risk of sliding off a roof.Indeed, the roof where they did station snipers is steeper than the one where they didn’t station them.In the face of these lapses, Biden has rightly called for an independent investigation into his campaign rival’s security measures on the day of the rally.This must begin at the Secret Service and include all other agencies that were part of the Butler detail, including the Pennsylvania State Police.The investigators must look very carefully at the thoroughness of planning — why was so obvious a threat left unguarded? — and the efficiency of communication during the event itself.Even if the Secret Service had given local or state agencies the responsibility for the rooftop, the entire operation is ultimately that agency’s responsibility.The Secret Service is the highly trained, highly resourced agency the nation depends upon to protect its presidents and presidential candidates. It is hard to imagine how Cheatle can remain the director.Crooks was not a master assassin. He was a young man with inscrutable motives who decided to take a shot at the former president.If all it takes is one novice to get inches from plunging America into a historic political crisis, a crisis of competency in the nation’s security agencies already exists.

eugeneweekly_2024_14,"We ve got issues. Living in a “cooperative”? I never gave the idea much thought, and I sure didn’t think I’d join a co-op housing community. To me, a co-op sounded like a loose-knit commune where people followed certain ideals without question. As it turns out, that’s not the case. Last December, my family and I moved into a new cooperative in Santa Clara called Peace Village, and I discovered that co-ops can have a different purpose. SquareOne Villages is a nonprofit in Lane County with the mission to develop affordable housing while maintaining a self-managed community for people to live in small homes. There are six different sites in Springfield and Eugene, and Peace Village, the newest project, is on River Road. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Before my family of three moved to Peace Village we lived in the Jefferson Westside area for four years. We had a two-bedroom apartment with a bath and a backyard. In 2020, the rent seemed reasonable for two parents with steady jobs. However, as the years passed, so did that stable rent. COVID hit a heavy blow on the economy. Inflation slowly rose in and around Oregon, according to Business Oregon. Between the first quarter of 2020 and the third quarter of 2023, home prices rose 31.4 percent in Oregon. Washington rose 38.9 percent and Idaho 51.3 percent. This may explain the surge renters have seen in the last couple of years. A brief research paper, “Housing and Affordability in Oregon” by Oregon Voices, a project of the Ford Family Foundation, explains that the cost of housing far exceeds the budgets of many Oregon families. Nearly 1.7 million households work without being paid enough to meet basic needs. My family reconsidered our options, and began to look for something more sustainable. We weren’t the only ones. “I was looking for anything, applying for whatever I could possibly get,” says Denise Silva, a Peace Village co-op member who previously lived in Seattle, Washington. “I needed affordable housing. We weren’t getting increases in our paychecks. In fact, income decreased because Medicare costs were going up.” Silva receives Supplemental Security Income related to a disability. She explains that most of it went into paying bills above and beyond housing fees. In 2022, the Peace Presbyterian Church on River Road sold its 3.6 acre property to SquareOne for a marked-down price. In return, SquareOne sold the property to Peace Village for the cost of the construction loan to build 70 units. SquareOne combined a Community Land Trust, which helps protect the properties’ long-term affordability, and a limited-equity co-op (LEC , a home ownership arrangement to give occupants a voice in decision-making. SquareOne established a blanket mortgage — instead of an individual one — that supports both the co-op and repayment of the loan it carries. What that means for my family and every tenant at Peace Village is that each qualified member pays $5,000 as part of the LEC, along with a monthly payment of $450 to $750, depending on unit size. This includes utilities, mortgage payment, maintenance, reserves, insurance and operating costs. “There has to be a change with the ability to have mixed housing,” says Chava Kronen, the housing outreach specialist at Head Start of Lane County. “Most families aren’t going to see a huge inheritance to help them buy a house. There just isn’t that generational wealth.” Back in December, when we were still contemplating our move to Peace Village,a meeting was heldwith City Planner Terri Harding and Housing Implementation Pipeline Analyst Amber Friedman and the Eugene Planning Commission to discuss the severe rent crisis in Eugene. Friedman said the average rent right now in Eugene is $1,287, with a median household income of $55,776. “Decades of housing under-production in Oregon has left the whole state with a shortage of 140,000 housing units, compared to what is needed to house our communities,” Friedman said. She explained that as a result there aren’t enough places to rent, making the market more competitive. With this information, it was hard to look past a five-year-plan for my family. I’m a first-generation immigrant, a citizen who pays taxes, makes a conscious choice to further his education and gets good grades. I believed that the debt my choices generated was the American way to move on up. No? What I have found is a different side to the American dream. Where we as immigrants stand is on the margin, on the edge. Does our salary meet the criteria of the economic median for each household? “If the majority of the culture thinks that’s as it should be, then that’s the culture,” says Sam Roudebush, another tenant that lives at Peace Village with his wife. “Culture evolves in a group and so do values.” The rules of society become socially accepted because of our involvement. That said, at Peace Village a new opportunity has opened, with a post-millennial, generation Z and baby boomer mix. We are hoping to influence the market. The sum of our parts is proving significant in the way that we live.

minnpost_2024_71,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The indispensable line between politics and criminal justice in America is disintegrating. Politicians, pundits, and everyday people — from both sides of the tribal divide — increasingly want their political opponents prosecuted. Winning elections, legislative victories and hearts and minds is no longer enough. Americans now long to see their fellow citizens behind bars. More and more, prosecutors oblige — bringing cases because of one’s political affiliation rather than one’s guilt or innocence.This undermines not just the rule of law, but the nation as a whole.President Joe Biden’s son Hunter is embroiled in numerous criminal matters. And Republicans are doing their utmost to shoehorn Joe into the fray. Donald Trump, meanwhile, faces four separate indictments. And numerous politicians and political operatives have been found guilty of committing crimes this century, includingScooter Libbey,Ted Stevens,Robert Coughlin,William Jefferson,Jesse Jackson Jr.,David Petraeus,Michael Fylnn, andSteve Bannon.Some of these cases represent legitimate law-enforcement work. Some don’t. But the problem is much bigger than just actual cases. Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies saw thundering chants from the crowd to “lock her up,” referring to his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. While president, Trump openly pressured the U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute his political rivals, including Hillary Clinton, Biden, Barack Obama, James Comey and Andrew McCabe. Calls from Democrats to prosecute Trump and his loyalists, meanwhile, have been ubiquitous since 2016 (as have giddy celebrations when prosecutors do so .While some cases are necessary to bring, the pervasive tribal lust to prosecute political rivals is very dangerous. First, mixing the criminal law with tribal passions makes defendants’ politics the focus, not their guilt or innocence. The political obsession with the messenger (as opposed to the message and the actor (as opposed to the action is the opposite of the rule of law’s central tenet — that everyone is inherently equal under the law and only a defendant’s specific alleged misdeeds are relevant.Second, criminalizing politics turbo-charges tribalism. Polarization’s knife has already penetrated deep inside the body politic. Criminalizing politics twists it violently. Instead of treating political opponents like competitive rivals, they’re treated like sworn enemies. America’s political energy should be channeled into winning elections, governing effectively, and addressing the country’s numerous public-policy failures — not sending political rivals to jail.Finally, criminalizing politics deters talented people from serving the country. American government already has a serious personnel problem. Just look at the presidency. Donald Trump was grossly unfit to hold America’s highest office. His successor, Joe Biden, is a welcome reversion toward (but not quite to the mean. Now in his 80s, Biden is neither what he once was nor the best American for the job. The U.S. House of Representatives, moreover, is throbbing with underqualified mediocrities. Americans shouldn’t further dissuade quality people from serving because imperfections or ambiguities in their past might be shoehorned into politically motivated criminal accusations.It’s also true, of course, that entering the government should neither absolve someone from past crimes nor authorize them to commit new ones. So how, then, should these competing concerns be balanced? How should people think about a criminal case when a politician is in the crosshairs?Several guiding principles must govern. For starters, the universal rules of criminal law must be honored. All defendants — irrespective of political affiliation — must be presumed innocent. And they should receive all the robust protections the law provides. This includes the constitutional right to confront their accusers and the rule of lenity, which requires ambiguous statutes to be read in defendants’ favor.Moreover, in determining whether a crime was committed the focus must be on the actions and not the actor. Prosecutors must perform objective, conscientious analysis regarding whether the admissible evidence meets each specific element in a criminal statute. If a prosecutor wouldn’t bring a case against a normal citizen then the prosecutor shouldn’t bring it against a politician.And, finally, prosecutors must recognize both their awesome power and their inherent fallibility. It’s a hazardous combination. As former U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson said, “The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America. His discretion is tremendous.” Yet despite this awesome power, the prosecutor is just as vulnerable to tribalism, bias and misjudgment as anyone else.This particular expression of America’s political dysfunction is more dangerous than most others. For criminalizing politics isn’t just unfair. And it doesn’t just destabilize the government. It’s the logical and inevitable precursor to something much worse. The last step before political violence is having the government eliminate political opponents for you by imprisoning them. And the first step after political violence is war.William Cooper is an attorney and the award-winning author of “How America Works … And Why It Doesn’t.”"

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_154,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°The decision Monday by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants for leaders of Hamas and Israel probably will not result in anyone being put on trial immediately for crimes against humanity. But it does further tarnish Israel’s invasion of the Gaza Strip, add to the isolation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and raise questions about President Joe Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s war in Gaza.It’s no surprise that the prosecutor, Karim Khan, is seeking to arrest Hamas leaders for their rampage of murder, rape, torture and kidnapping on Oct. 7, which clearly constituted war crimes. Those protesters making excuses for Hamas should read Khan’s statement and understand Hamas’ brutality.The allegations against Netanyahu seem to focus on the Israeli government’s decision to throttle aid, including food assistance, to civilians in Gaza and thus cause starvation. The very first allegation listed by the prosecutor against Netanyahu is “Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.”That has always seemed to me a part of the Israeli operation in Gaza that is particularly difficult to justify. My view is that Israel absolutely had a right to strike Gaza militarily after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, to destroy Hamas leadership and to try to recover hostages. I have argued that the military operation should have been far more restrained, calibrated to target Hamas officials rather than to level entire neighborhoods, but bombing targets in Gaza was not inherently wrong or unlawful.What has seemed utterly indefensible has been the constraints placed on aid entering the territory, so that Gaza is teetering on the edge of famine — even as trucks filled with food are lined up at Gaza’s border, waiting to enter. That is what seemed to galvanize the International Criminal Court.A panel of international experts convened by the International Criminal Court unanimously backed the prosecutor. “Parties to an armed conflict must not deliberately impede the delivery of humanitarian relief for civilians, including humanitarian relief provided by third parties,” the experts said.I’m not an expert in international humanitarian law, so I’ll leave it to others to argue about whether a prosecution of Netanyahu is justified. But the court’s efforts underscore the moral stain of the starvation in Gaza, in which the United States is complicit.America’s highest-priority response needn’t be a flurry of legal arguments, but instead could involve a far greater effort — using all the leverage we have — to persuade Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and to ensure that the aid is actually delivered to starving children. Whether or not one agrees that starving children is criminal, it is unconscionable.

He writes in his commentary (“Dear justices: Please keep the lights on,” June 9 : “Hawaii residents rely on coal, oil, and gas for nearly 70% of their power. Petroleum products account for 80% of our energy consumption, the highest share of any state in the union. And even with that we have the highest energy costs in the nation, three times the average. Imagine our energy costs without fossil fuels.”We can and must imagine a future with less dependence on fossil fuels, a more resilient power grid, lower energy costs, and less pollution! That future is rooftop solar on homes and businesses and more power storage facilities. Solar panels are less expensive than using fossil fuels for energy, and they produce all day long, year after year. Localized storage makes the grid more resilient by reducing massive grid failures.Rooftop solar reduces a family’s energy cost, and it’s a good investment! Here’s a personal example. Our solar system cost $28,000, less the 30% federal tax credit, which equals $19,600. The $5,000 state of Hawaii tax credit brings the total cost to $14,600. We will save $200 per month, which is $2,400 per year.If I took $14,600 and put it in a CD and got a return of $2,400 per year, that would mean I would make 17% return on my investment.Andthere are financing programs with banks or savings and loans, or you can use an equity credit line on your home.Hawaii Green Infrastructure Authority has loans at 5%.Plus, no more utility company price hikes, and the value of your home is increased. The monthly gird charge is only $28.66. Your energy costs and impact on the environment are reduced with rooftop solar.A fairer net energy metering program could further reduce costs. This would mean that the Public Utilities Commission would require Hawaiian Electric to nearly triple the net energy rebate to 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Currently, HECO pays only 11 cents for every kilowatt-hour to solar owners that feed back to the grid and charges those same customers 45 kwh.HECO customers are also unfairly billed in two ways: (1 We pay for electricity 100% generated by imported gasoline, with receive no credit for wind, solar or geothermal energy, and (2 customers pay the cost of construction for the wind or solar farms. We don’t need massive solar installations or wind farms that are ugly and require expensive land.More storage facilities could be installed locally and help to decentralize the grid. If the grid went out in Kona, electricity would still be on in Waimea.The time is now to wean Hawaii off of most fossil fuels. Funding from the lawsuit could help build a more resilient grid. If we are to achieve the goal stated in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Transition Initiative of 70% by 2030, significant headway can be made by increasing rooftop solar where it is needed — at our homes and businesses. The Public Utilities commission can increase the net energy metering reimbursement amount and build more storage facilities locally to make the grid more resilient.Deb HechtKailua-KonaDENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler."
leoweekly_2024_1,"It’s the message that’s destroying us. Not literally, but it is the message that’s facilitating the break up of families, and causing people to cry about missing their parents or to threaten civil war if their guy doesn’t win.We’re being broken by “bad” words and sound bytes.The lack of quality discourse in our country’s politics is a disservice to all of us but particularly voters who notoriously are given and attached to poor information.Have you noticed how a certain presidential candidate writes his tweets?Let’s look.We’re looking at nothing but structure and syntax.This person structures his tweet with an “if you do this, you will suffer 100 times the consequences.” There is no mathematical basis for this number, it’s hyperbole, but hyperbole like that of a teenager. “Mom, If he doesn’t like me, I’ll die 100 times.”You get it.Then check the words that are capitalized. Why are they capitalized? Because those are the words that this person wants you to pay attention to. If you ignore that the whole of the tweet is kind of crazy, you might remember “WORSE, SOVIET, EVERY, CASH, TAX, VOTE, TRUMP.” You can imagine these words emblazoned across a billboard, on a sign, or being shouted by a despot trying to fire up his supporters.It’s kind of weird, and it’s a pattern with this person — one that should alarm you, but not because it means that this wacky prediction might come true. It should alarm you because the person instead of giving you a policy that sets him apart, and explaining how they will be different, is jumping on your fear nerve with abandon. It’s him or it’s annihilation, basically.If you’re scared enough, it won’t matter if he plans to use the United States to pay his legal bills. Don’t believe me?Just ask where all your donations have gone (if he’s your guy , and ask the venues that he can no longer use what happened to their payments.Remember this is your billionaire, and yet he can’t pay his debts.If common sense and logic apply, he’s not really good at math. Billions of dollars in the bank means, theoretically, your debts should be covered. You’re rich, right?Now during an election both sides of the spectrum offer somewhat grim pictures of the other side but some try to temper it with data that makes a modicum of sense. For instance, Bill Clinton citing 50 million jobs created under Democratic leadership and only on million under Republican. A real fact.Or, for instance, a real number of immigrants crossing the border instead of millions of people storming the border, like zombie hordes in scary TV shows.Can you imagine many millions of folks storming the border in a year? No really, think of the rate of crossing that would be, and explain how this strangely-tinted fellow found the only quiet day on the border to have his press conference. I’m joking, but seriously, where are these millions? He said it.The truth is, again, this person is talking to his supporters using hyperbole.According to the Customs and Border Protection Agency’sJune 20 report, “Since the expiration of theCDC’s Title 42 public health Orderon May 12, 2023, to May 31, 2024, DHS has removed or returned over 775,000 individuals, the vast majority of whom crossed the southwest border, including more than 115,000 individual family members. Total removals and returns over the past year exceed removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010.”That means, under the current administration, more people were returned across the border than at any time under that guy. So his hyperbole, in this instance, is just a lie. In addition, the agency reported that the rate of border encounters was lower in May than in April, by 9%.The Southwest border is the main area of crossing but the United States has a northern border which also sees a fair amount of crossings. Mainly the discussions of borders centers only on the Southwestern one that leads to Mexico.Fear, hyperbole and lies are powerful.Let’s look at one last tweet.This one comes with a video that includes such hyperbolic hits such as calling for a gun buyback program, “confiscation” and an attention to improving the diet of Americans as “banning meat consumption.” It’s so ridiculous. The whole tweet is ridiculous.The way the right uses the word radical is in itself radical, when to most of us, policies that take care of children, healthcare and old people, seem like common sense.Too many families have been split up not over guns, not over religion, but over thisoneperson and his insane rhetoric. Based solely on his own language, he s the radical, and not in any ways that touch logic or common sense.What we re seeing in his words and his followers is how a malignant narcissist succeeds. but don’t believe what I tell you.Look up what a narcissist does, and how they desperately need those who will worship them above anything else. It helps them to create and justify their assaults on their perceived “enemies.” Enemies are usually any that don’t like or support the actions of the narcissist. Again, don’t believe me. The information is free and available to everyone.Breaking the cycle of the narcissist’s spell is the hard road that America is on. The road where this guy s bad words have crept into the fabric of private homes. It s a spell that needs to be broken.Not breaking the spell risks more families being split because parents would turn their backs on their children for this man, and the children are forced to ignore their parents so they won’t be inundated with bad information and their parents parroting the narcissist’s words. It’s deeper than a deviation of beliefs. It s a split that risks throwing away the nation we ve bled to build.It s a critical rift that needs to be repaired.We have to move on from bad words. We have to demand proof, facts, and the exit of wild hyperbole from our leaders mouths.*** ."
minnpost_2024_26,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.It’s no secret that the cost of living in Minnesota is becoming a burden for working-class families and seniors living on fixed incomes. Inflation acts as a hidden tax, reducing your purchasing power, making the cost of living more unaffordable. Real household income has fallen by 2.3%, according to theU.S. Census Bureau, with Minnesotans needing nearly$13,000more to pay for the standard of living they enjoyed just a few short years ago.Food, energy, and housing costs are all up year-over-year. And, according to theInternational Monetary Fund, food and energy prices in particular have helped drive the surging inflation we have seen over the past several years. This should come as no surprise because everyone requires energy to heat and cool their homes, drive to work, and run to the grocery store to buy food.Yet, food, too, requires energy. Natural gas is used to produce fertilizer and dry crops, electricity powers irrigation systems, and farmers rely on significant amounts of gasoline and diesel — about 6 gallons per acre just for corn production — to bring crops to market. As a result, fuel and electricity account for about15%of farm operating costs. All of which is priced into the food you buy at the grocery store and when dining out.The hidden tax of inflation is everywhere. And, if some in the Minnesota Legislature have their way, this hidden tax will be paltry in comparison to the hidden tax on gas and diesel they want to enact on families, farmers and small businesses across the state.Modeled after California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the Clean Transportation Standard Act (SF 2584 introduced in the Minnesota Legislature — as currently drafted — could increase fuel prices significantly. Last year, the California Air Resources Board (an official agency of the State of California analyzedthe California policy this bill is modeled on. CARB determined California policies could “potentially increase the price of gasoline by $1.15 per gallon, potentially increase the price of diesel by $1.50 per gallon and fossil jet fuel by $1.21 per gallon.”In fact, anindependent analysishas estimated that Minnesota’s proposed bill would see gas prices increase up to 94 cents and diesel prices increase up to $1.05 by 2030. Consider, a conservative 50 cent increase would cost Minnesota drivers upwards of $425 per year.Is this something you can afford? Is this something your friends and neighbors can afford?Because the impacts do not affect everyone equally. It disproportionately impacts those living in rural areas who depend on their vehicles for daily tasks and lack alternative transportation options. And, it disproportionately impacts low-income families who already spend a larger share of their income on transportation, consuming over 10% of their household budget.Inflation is hard enough on Minnesotans. Why do some legislators want to make it even harder just to get by? There are better ways to achieve our goals than S.F. 2584. Let’s learn from California’s failed policies.Chris Ventura is the Midwest executive director of the Consumer Energy Alliance."

(Gina Ferazzi/Los Angeles Times/TNS It’s alarming that only a few weeks into the summer we’ve already experienced a prolonged heat wave that has put about 36 million Americans under excessive heat warnings and shattered temperature records across the West.Palm Springs hit 124 degrees Friday, an all-time high. Redding reached a record 119 degrees Saturday. And on Sunday, Las Vegas got to 120 degrees, breaking its previous record by three degrees. Globally, June marked the 13th straight month of record-setting temperatures.But all the attention on the numbers can overshadow the larger, frightening context: We are living in a dangerous new era of more frequent, more destructive and deadlier disasters fueled by humanity’s continued spewing of greenhouse gas pollution.Chief among the threats is extreme heat, killing more Americans than wildfires, hurricanes, floods or tornadoes. Heat waves caused an estimated$7.7 billion in economic impacts over the last decade in California alone, including lost wages, agricultural disruptions, power outages and infrastructure and health damage.But even as Americans die from preventable heat-related illness, officials aren’t using all the tools available to them to respond. We need an urgent change in trajectory, not only by ending the burning of fossil fuels but also by doing much more to keep people safe.While state and federal officials have made some strides with new efforts to warn people of the dangers from extreme heat and protect workers from heat illness and death, they’re still not doing everything they can to respond to this growing threat.Case in point: No U.S. president has ever issued an emergency or major disaster declaration for extreme heat. President Carter rejected a request from Missouri in 1980 after nearly 400 people died in a heat wave, and President Clinton rejected a declaration for the heat wave that killed more than 700 people in Chicago in 1995.In 2022, President Biden rejected a major disaster declaration request from Gov. Gavin Newsom for the 10-day heat dome that killed an estimated 395 Californians, caused more than $3 billion in economic damage.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied all such requests on the grounds that the conditions haven’t been of such “severity and magnitude” that an effective response is beyond the capacity of state and local government. That is the threshold set under the Stafford Act, the law that governs federal disaster relief.The federal government must revise its outdated view of what constitutes a disaster now that the planet is about 2.5 degrees hotter than preindustrial times and the 10 hottest years ever recorded have been in the last decade.The Biden administration should seriously consider a petition filed last month by environmental, labor and health organizations that asks FEMA to recognize extreme heat and wildfire smoke as major disasters. They say that federal disaster relief funding could pay for life-saving infrastructure such as cooling centers with air filtration systems, and community solar and storage systems to help vulnerable communities stay cool and safe when the power grid is strained. It’s appropriate to include wildfire smoke because this intertwined climate-fueled health threat is also causing widespread illness and early death.The Extreme Heat Emergency Act, introduced last year, would amend the Stafford Act to spell out that extreme heat is a type of major disaster. But it shouldn’t require legislation for FEMA to get with the times.The law already applies to “any natural catastrophe,” and environmental, labor and health advocates say that is broad enough to include heat and any other kinds of disasters even if they aren’t listed — such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even FEMA acknowledges there is nothing specific in that 1974 law that precludes a declaration for extreme heat or wildfire smoke.There are few areas where modernization of disaster response is more pressing than with heat waves. The old ways just aren’t cutting it anymore. Americans deserve a robust approach that’s befitting of our new climate reality.—Los Angeles Times"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_103,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Monetary policymakers around the world are beginning, cautiously, to edge off the tight-money policies they imposed in an effort to cool inflation. Most important, the European Central Bank just cut the interest rates it controls by a quarter of a percentage point — a small number in itself but a signal of future normalization. And the ECB is a major player, setting policy for an economy around four-fifths as large as America’s.But few people expect the Federal Reserve, which will hold a policy meeting next week, to follow suit. And that poses a puzzle. By the numbers, the case for rate cuts in America and Europe is almost identical. So either the Fed or the ECB is getting it wrong.I think the ECB is right, and the Fed is wrong. Why?First, the case for declaring inflation yesterday’s problem is equally strong on both sides of the Atlantic.This point can be obscured by the fact that we measure consumer prices somewhat differently. Normally the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its own version of Europe’s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but the BLS is, at an inconvenient moment, having some kind of technical difficulties. The big difference between Europe’s measure and ours is that theirs doesn’t include “owner’s equivalent rent,” which is most of the shelter cost component of the consumer price index. So we can get a more or less apples-to-apples comparison by using a number the BLS is still releasing, consumer prices excluding shelter.U.S. inflation has generally led inflation in Europe, both rising and falling sooner, but both cumulative inflation since 2019 and current inflation are similar — maybe somewhat above the long-run target, but central banks are supposed to get ahead of the curve. It’s hard to see any clear reason the Fed and the ECB should be following different paths now.But who’s right? So far the U.S. economy has remained remarkably strong despite high interest rates. But there are signs of softening in various data. Notably, the ratio of unfilled job openings to the number of unemployed, which was widely cited as evidence of an overheated economy, is now all the way back to its prepandemic level and may be trending lower.Central banks are supposed to get ahead of the curve. And it looks to me as if the ECB is doing that, but the Fed isn’t.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2024_49,"Published 7:12 pm Tuesday, April 16, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy Charles QuallsOver the years, I’ve heard the scripture found in Luke 24: 36-48 now and then. Possibly, many of you have, too. I’ve always been fascinated by one aspect of the little story. Possibly you have, too.We have this powerful moment that could start off sounding very much like the exact same story we had last week. If you only look at it on the surface. You know, the odds are that we’re not going to look at it like that.No, although Jesus does come and stand in the midst of his disciples here after the Resurrection, this is not the same episode. Nor is the specific action, and therefore, the lessons we could draw are the same at all.But one part of this has always caught my attention. Jesus appears to have been hungry, and Luke bothers to tell us that He ate something here after he came back to life.My fuller title today quotes from the text and says “While they rejoiced, Jesus was hungry.” You know what? Turns out, that probably wasn’t the case at all. So why did he eat? Why does it even matter? This is what captured my attention, though I never could quite put my finger on why.What I found might be the heart of this week’s message because it does matter. You see, much of what ensues in this week’s scripture was Jesus actively trying to prove that he wasn’t a ghost.Because if he were a ghost, it would also mean he was dead. The apostle Paul, among others, points out that this would void our entire faith. Now you see where we’re headed?Mark Hoffman gives us some helpful insight in his writing on today’s scripture. Here are some examples of what some people of Jesus’ time believed could prove definitively that one was a living being and not a ghost.One could check extremities where bones were evident, namely, hands and feet. Or make sure that a person’s feet are touching the ground. One could show their teeth because ghosts wouldn’t have teeth. To an extreme, eating food would be viewed as ultimate proof since a spirit wouldn’t eat.That’s right. In our scripture right here before us, Jesus was actually clicking nearly all of the known boxes in his part of the ancient world that would prove one to be a living human being to someone who was convinced that they were seeing, instead, a haunting. Luke is laboring here with these details because he substantiates a case where Jesus wasbodily resurrected.In a world that had zero acquaintance with a person coming back to life, Jesus was alive. Luke wants us to know that.Now, that’s all fascinating. It helps me understand a little better why these specific details were given. But then something else happens. Something is spoken here that runs chills up my spine.More significant than his hands and feet or his supposed hunger is Jesus’ theophanic statement in Greek. Jesus said, “Ego eimi.”In English, we know that as “I am myself” or simply “I Am.”He was saying the same thing Moses was told by God the Father in Exodus 3 to respond when the Pharaoh asked on whose authority the Children of Israel should be let go.Here is where attention to Scripture is important. Scriptural fulfillment may be interesting and informative and may help confirm what we believe about Jesus.What is more significant, however, is how the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus help us understand what God has been accomplishing throughout all human history. In the victory of Jesus, the reality of God’s plan is revealed.You see, Jesus’ life does not simply help us comprehend ancient Scripture’s true meaning. It also moves us forward into the future.That’s why Jesus concludes here with the charge to his disciples to be witnesses, proclaiming repentance and forgiveness to all nations in his name.Jesus ate fish to prove he was alive. Now, he wasn’t empty. His calling upon his disciples’ lives, including upon ours, likewise leads us toward being more alive.Jesus did all this in Luke 24 to show us that he had defeated death, sure. But also to reveal what God was doing in our world. To show us that there was still ministry and mission left for all of us to do. Jesus did all this to show us what life was like after the Resurrection.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

Mendis is a former American diplomat and a military professor in the NATO and the Indo-Pacific Commands of the Pentagon. Now living in Washington, D.C., he served in the U.S. departments of agriculture, energy, defense and state during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations and as a commissioner to the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO.Patrick came to the United States from Sri Lanka as a high school exchange student in Perham, Minnesota. Later “adopted” by Minnesotans when the civil war broke out in Sri Lanka, he went on to graduate from the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. He went on to a life of public service that began with a staff position in Minnesota’s House of Representatives.Another example is Afro Deli founder Abdirahman Kahin, the National Small Business Person of the Year for the United States. Kahin immigrated to Minnesota from Djibouti in the early 2000s and initially ran a media production business, making films and recording weddings and other events for East Africans living in Minnesota.With a growing interest in the food industry, he left his production business behind to open a restaurant. When his first Afro Deli & Grill opened in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, he never imagined being celebrated at the national level. That day came last year at the White House when President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris awarded him with the national title. Minnesota’s diaspora community is central to the success of our economy, and this special award is just one example of our leadership in the economic sector that comes from our inclusive approach to the creation and nurturing of new diaspora-inspired businesses.Basil Ajuo arrived in the United States from the Central African country of Cameroon 10 years ago, a bit accidentally. On a flight from California to Texas that included a stopover at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, he found himself stranded in Minnesota — and the rest is history. Among his many community leadership roles, he served on the board of MnSCU, now known as Minnesota State, to which he was appointed by Gov. Mark Dayton. In 2016, he pulled together a coalition for all African diaspora communities in Minnesota — called Minnesota Africans United, or MAU. With representation from nearly all African countries, MAU’s work centers on closing opportunity gaps in education, healthcare, the economy and employment. Their work connecting African diaspora-led companies in Minnesota with business and investment opportunities throughout the African continent has been incredibly effective before, during and, now, after the COVID crisis.Nisha Botchwey, dean at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs, is a relatively new arrival in Minnesota, but not to the United States. Dean Botchwey migrated to the United States from Jamaica with her family and has devoted her life to public service in many roles and careers. Botchwey holds a master’s degree and Ph.D. in urban planning from the University of Pennsylvania.

But since the defendant is troubled First Son Hunter Biden and the case is prosecuted by a special counsel appointed by the U.S. attorney general, the world is watching.So begins a proceeding that will no doubt feature intense media and political interest, but which ultimately has little bearing on the actual president beyond his relation to the defendant, something that cannot be said about the former president who has been personally convicted of 34 felony charges.Joe Biden has professed his unconditional and support love for his son, and otherwise stayed out of the prosecution. We don’t really have to worry about him interfering; the odds that the president would exercise any of his considerable power over the proceedings (including a presidential pardon are about as slim as the odds that Donald Trump wouldn’t do so in a similar position.Like all criminal defendants, the younger Biden is presumed innocent and the government must prove its charges. While the case may very well harm Joe’s reelection campaign, Hunter’s father has not been charged with any wrongdoing.The case was brought by Special Counsel David Weiss, who was Donald Trump’s U.S. attorney for Delaware, and alleges that Hunter Biden filled out the federal paperwork, known as an ATF Form 4473, and lied on the legal document in order to get the handgun in October 2018, when his father Joe was not on public office.Weiss says that Hunter was a drug addict at the time.Weiss has also indicted Hunter in California for not paying at least $1.4 million in federal income taxes between January 2017 through about Oct. 15, 2020, which also is the period when Joe was a private citizen during the four years between being vice president and president. That trial is due to start in September, even worse timing for dad’s campaign.Hunter is being prosecuted on the merits of his own case for his own actions, for an alleged crime that did not involve anyone else, especially his father. Whether he is convicted or acquitted, his father’s political opponents will try to use the case to harm Joe Biden’s electoral prospects and governing agenda. That is fair game in politics.What was terribly wrong was when Republicans tried to concoct evidence for conspiracy theories about the elder Biden’s supposed efforts to cover up his son’s dealings in Ukraine. To date, they have not found any incriminating materials for their various impeachment fantasies.The truth is, this gun and drug case has very little to do with Joe Biden, who seems mainly to have gently tried to nudge his wayward son back into a straighter path and otherwise let the latter make his own decisions. We imagine that a lot of the MAGA opportunists would see this a lot differently if their own children were dealing with addiction and related issues, which isn’t to say that Hunter’s behavior should be excused away, but that it’s disgraceful to use it as a mere arrow in the political quiver.—New York Daily News Editorial Board/TNSSomething incredible happened four years ago.

suffolknewsherald_2024_9,"Published 6:42 pm Thursday, July 25, 2024ByStaff ReportsLauren BradshawLet me immediately cut to the chase (pun intended and answer the question you’re all wondering. TWISTERS is a fun and entertaining summer blockbuster, but it in no way holds a candle to its predecessor, TWISTER (1996 . Still, the CGI is intense, the sound design is loud and immersive, and the lead performances – especially from Glen Powell – are sure to wow.Following a horrible tragedy, meteorologist Kate Carter (Daisy Edgar-Jones has spent years out of the storm-chasing business. She now lives in the largely tornado-less New York City, using her innate understanding of storm systems to direct weather alerts. But when her old friend Javi (Anthony Ramos begs her to join his privately-funded startup, designed to use military-grade radars to learn more about tornadoes and save communities in Oklahoma, she agrees to give him a week of her time. It’s not too long before “tornado wrangler” influencer Tyler Owens (Glen Powell enters the scene with his ragtag group of weather enthusiasts, creating a competition between scientific research and entertainment. Each group races to be the first on the scene, with Kate and Javi seeking to model the tornado and Tyler trying to get the most likes on social media. But can the two groups find a way to work together, or will the competition be more vicious than the tornadoes?I admit to judging myself for caring too much about a summer blockbuster’s plot because that’s not really what any of us sign up for with these films. However, the encounters with tornadoes begin to feel slightly repetitive and create pacing issues, making a two-hour film feel like its runtime. And for some reason, it seems like something is missing when it comes to portraying the sheer terror of experiencing F5 tornadoes, unlike the original film; the main set pieces were not as memorable.The film does little to make you care about whether the characters live or die, relying on Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones’s chemistry and natural charisma to do the heavy lifting. The second Powell steps out of his gigantic truck, with his cowboy hat and belt buckle sparkling in the sun … sorry, I just lost my train of thought … and that’s what TWISTERS hopes. Powell’s magnetism is sure to knock you off your feet and distract you from the film’s middling plot. And while Edgar-Jones’s performance is more muted, due to her character’s battle with PTSD, she brings an important level of humanity to the film and a character to both see yourself in and root for. More than that, her chemistry with Powell is off the charts and will certainly leave you wanting their relationship explored more in a sequel. The supporting characters are not given much to work with and as such, don’t really engender much concern when they are in deadly situations.One element of TWISTERS I liked more than TWISTER is it showed the emotional and financial toll tornadoes ravage on communities. Of course, that is an element of the first film, but TWISTERS does a great job showcasing the speed in which tornadoes can overtake and devastate a community, both in loss of life and loss of property. This, juxtaposed with the “fun” in chasing storms brings a real human element to the film. I also want to give a shoutout to the movie not having any sad animal scenes (apart from a possible run-in with a chicken . So for all of you sickos excited to see another flying cow, this isn’t for you.TWISTERS is the exact kind of movie you need to see in a theater so you can get the full experience.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_34,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Fire damage is pictured from President Joe Biden s motorcade on Aug. 21 in Lahaina, Maui in the wake of Maui s wildfires. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images/TNS Last month, 13 young Hawaiian plaintiffs were set to take the state’s Department of Transportation to trial for failing to make real headway on reducing planet-warming pollution. Instead, on the eve of their court date, the youths inked a groundbreaking settlement with Hawaii’s governor and ushered in a new phase of climate litigation.The resulting deal will accelerate Hawaii’s progress toward a zero-emission transportation system, and it could serve as a road map for other advocates looking to gain ground on urgent climate goals.Several states — including Alaska, Florida, Utah and Virginia — face similar lawsuits by young people over their alleged failures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike their red-state counterparts, officials in ocean-blue Hawaii have tried to lead on climate. They have crafted ambitious laws to mitigate climate change, setting long-term targets for reducing greenhouse gas pollution.In addition to a statewide 2045 carbon neutrality target, the state Legislature enacted a 2030 emissions reduction goal and aimed specifically to decarbonize the transportation sector, the largest source of climate emissions in Hawaii. The state’s 2050 sustainability plan promises a transition of the entire state fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2035.But ensuring implementation of such promises is hard — and made that much harder by a lack of intermediate targets along the way to distant goals. The Hawaii plaintiffs argued that state officials have ignored their own goals by failing to take meaningful steps to reduce climate emissions from transportation sources. They contended that the state thereby breached its constitutional duty to protect natural resources from climate change and disasters such as last year’s unprecedented Maui wildfires. Their lawsuit alleged that the defendants “impaired and infringed upon youth plaintiffs’ right to a clean and healthful environment, including the right to a life-sustaining climate system.”In that way, the Hawaii lawsuit focused not on a wholesale failure to adopt meaningful climate policies but on nitty-gritty questions about follow-through. The issue at trial would not have been whether officials made good laws but rather what happened after they did. In an age of proliferating climate pledges in liberal-leaning states such as California, New York and Hawaii, it’s a profound and important question.The resulting settlement answers that question by providing benchmarks for a greenhouse gas reduction plan that will be overseen and enforced by a court through 2045 or until Hawaii achieves its zero-emission goal, “whichever is earlier.”Under the agreement, the state must set interim decarbonization targets for the transportation sector in 2030, 2035 and 2040; report annually on its progress toward those targets; reform elements of the Transportation Department’s planning and budgeting to align them with the state’s climate goals; and spend millions of dollars in the short term on low-carbon infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging stations and bike lanes. The settlement also creates new leadership positions within the department charged with addressing climate change.The settlement is far from a panacea. For example, it saves for another day the question of exactly how ambitious Hawaii’s interim decarbonization targets should be.Nevertheless, the deal is trailblazing in a few ways. First, “it shows other governments the benefits to working with youth, not against them,” said Andrea Rodgers of Our Children’s Trust, one of the public-interest law firms that represented the plaintiffs. “This is the first time a government has decided to do that.”As their lawsuit noted, the plaintiffs — surfers, divers, spearfishers and regenerative farmers among them — have suffered climate anxiety, disruption of traditional ways of life and, in some cases, destruction of their homes. Without even stepping foot in court, they more or less won the measure of justice they were seeking.By deciding to settle with the youths rather than go to trial, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green (yes, Green is his real name! set a higher bar for what can be accomplished by a state leader who takes climate change and its consequences seriously. It’s a dramatic contrast with climate change deniers such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.The outcome also offers a template for others seeking to ensure that climate pledges are realized. That can be hard work. As Hawaii’s government maintained before the settlement, long-term climate goals provide few footholds for today’s litigants. A 2045 carbon neutrality goal, for example, creates a host of challenges by failing to specify which sectors must reduce emissions, by how much and by what dates. But the big-picture question of how to ensure that long-term climate goals have teeth could not be more important.Democratic-controlled states such as California have acted as climate policy bellwethers partly by enacting ambitious climate goals. Now we have an example of how to turn such lofty pledges into court-enforced action to decarbonize a critically important sector.This case serves as a resounding endorsement of the courts’ capacity to address climate change.Many defendants facing climate lawsuits — notably including Hawaii officials in the earlier stages of this case — often protest that climate change policy should be made by legislatures, not judges. This landmark settlement demonstrates that the courts can hold decision-makers accountable if they fail to live up to their promises.Cara Horowitz is the executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_284,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°With the Democratic presidential nomination all but delivered for Kamala Harris, speculation has turned to who would best compliment her as the vice-presidential nominee. There are certainly several interesting possibilities but there is one who, like Harris herself, draws stark and strategic contrasts with the Trump-Vance ticket: Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.Kelly, the son of two police officers, offers considerable star quality as a former astronaut who rode the Space Shuttle into orbit on four occasions. As a Navy pilot who flew 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm (for which he received two Distinguished Flying Crosses and a fistful of additional honors , he would add valuable military credentials to the ticket.JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, plays up his Marine service, but it is worth noting he was a correspondent. Vance is the guy who shows up with a laptop to write a story about the combat achievements of pilots like Kelly.Vance rose from an impoverished youth, went to Yale Law School, became a venture capitalist and wrote a book about his Appalachian roots; now, like Donald Trump, he professes empathy for the working class but embraces tax policies that enrich hedge fund managers.Kelly went to the Merchant Marine Academy and has written books about the inspiring struggles of his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, after a devastating assassination attempt, and about the need for responsible gun policies. Kelly’s leadership for gun reforms supported by over 70% of Americans is likely to generate broad enthusiasm, especially among younger voters.Kelly has built strong support in a purple state by working across the aisle, like his predecessor, John McCain. Kelly reveres McCain, whom Donald Trump demeaned for having been shot down over Vietnam, captured, imprisoned for 5½ years and undergone years of torture rather than leave his fellow POWs behind. “I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump callously remarked.A veteran, Kelly also draws a sharp contrast to Trump, who has cold-heartedly denigrated those who died in defense of the country. “Why should I go to that cemetery?” Trump reportedly said when refusing to visit the graves of World War I casualties. “It’s filled with losers.”Immigration is sure to be a topic hyped by Trump this fall. As an Arizonan, Kelly brings border experience to the issue. He served in the Senate when bipartisan immigration reform was torpedoed by Trump, with Vance’s help. In response, President Joe Biden initiated executive actions that have slashed unauthorized crossings by half. That is quite a contrast to Trump’s failed family separation policy. We are still waiting for Mexico to “pay for” the billions of dollars Trump spent without congressional approval for the ineffectual expansion of his wall.Kelly uniquely has a military background, a record of bipartisanship, a personal story as an astronaut and the husband of a gravely wounded congresswoman who himself is unexpectedly projected into politics. Kelly’s appeal is national and his electoral strength in purple Arizona could help elect another Democratic senator to replace him. All these reasons should compel Harris to give Kelly very strong consideration to fill the job she currently holds."
minnpost_2024_67,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.At present, one in five children in Minnesota have a diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition, and close to half of them receive little or no care; most of them are from underserved communities with limited access to mental health services. The state’s long-standing mental health professional shortage doesn’t help, with 74 out of 87 counties in Minnesota regarded as mental health shortage areas by the federal government. As a result, school-aged children in need of mental services have to endure prolonged wait times to see a community mental health provider.As an aspiring child and adolescent neuropsychiatrist and someone who lost a close friend to suicide as a consequence of an unresponsive student counseling service, I see a school-based mental health service model (SBMH as the best solution to address this problem. An SBMH program will bring mental health services to students where they are, eliminating significant barriers to access.A recent study led by professor Ezra Golberstein of the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota shows that SBMH programs, when implemented, improve access to mental health services to students by 8% and reduces the attempted suicide rate by 15%. Not to mention, SBMH serves as a primary source of mental health services for children from underserved communities. Approximately 50% of children receiving school-based mental health services have never accessed mental health services in the past, with 45% of them having a significant mental health concern. Thus, given how effective an SBMH model is in improving students’ access to mental health, why isn’t it implemented in all schools in Minnesota?The SBMH program receives significant funding from the federal and state governments. Yet many schools report significant challenges adopting it, pointing to provider shortage as a major obstacle. Some schools even report having unfilled vacancies for mental health providers. Minnesota ranks 10th in states with the most considerable shortage of mental health professionals.The state currently has only 250 child and adolescent psychiatrists, which results in an approximate ratio of one psychiatrist to 1,000 youths with significant mental health concerns. The workforce shortage is even more pronounced in rural Minnesota, which has 27 child and adolescent psychiatrists — making access to comprehensive mental health services in rural Minnesota unattainable for most. But how can Minnesota address the long-standing mental health provider shortage?The healthcare system historically responds well to financial incentives. Therefore, an upfront tuition scholarship program for aspiring mental health professionals would be very effective in developing a robust mental health workforce in Minnesota. Some states have even developed initiatives that offer full-ride scholarships to students accepted into a masters-level program for mental health professionals. Washington State’s BehavioralHealth Workforce Development Initiative, which grants up to $51,000 scholarships to students accepted into a Master of Social Work program, has been pivotal in addressing the state’s long-standing mental health workforce shortage.Minnesota has made laudable efforts to make education affordable for its residents; the recently passed North Star Scholarship Program makes college free for young adults from low-income families.The government can look back on the success of previous higher education investments and confidently commit to funding a government-sponsored education program to train students who have demonstrated a strong commitment to becoming mental health professionals. By eliminating the financial barrier of an expensive clinical training program, qualified students from all walks of life can enroll in a mental health graduate program, thereby strengthening the number and diversity of providers in the state, which will facilitate tailored mental health services that meet the needs of each patient.Key stakeholders have questioned the practicality of the SBMH model. Parents will argue that schools should be schools, school administrators will say that they lack the capacity and time to provide such services to their students, and community providers can make a case for the potential duplication of services.All of these are rational arguments, but there is compelling evidence that an SBMH program, even when partially implemented, significantly improves students’ access to mental health services. Therefore, an SBMH model fortified with a solid mental health service workforce will help all scholars across the state build the mental resilience and well-being they need to excel academically and navigate the challenges of growing up.Praise Emukah-Brown is a physician and a graduate student at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health."

(Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images/TNS It took almost no time at all for the ACLU and other civil liberties groups to file federal suit against the state of Louisiana after GOP Gov. Jeff Landry signed a bill that would require state-funded schools at all levels — from kindergarten on up — display a poster of the Ten Commandments, along with a so-called “context statement.”Once again, it’s time for this song and dance, where public officials waste everyone’s time and judicial resources by attempting to trample the separation of church and state for none other than some political rabble-rousing.Lawyers for Louisiana will likely try to roll out a variety of highly technical arguments around why this directive is not a violation of the Constitution’s Establishment Clause, probably centering around the idea that the document is being used in some permissible educational capacity. They will present this argument in court in bad faith, knowing full well it is a pretext, and we hope federal judges won’t let them get away with it.There’s no need to so thoughtfully consider evasive legal maneuvers when state officials including Landry himself have been crystal clear about the religious motivation of the law, having said that respecting the rule of law requires starting “from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.”Well, Moses wrote in Hebrew, not English and this is not an educational effort but an ideological one, and one that clearly puts the conception of the Ten Commandments above the foundational rules of other religions, which is in exact contravention of the Constitution’s requirement that the government not prioritize one religion over another.If this all seems a little bit familiar to you, it might be because the Ten Commandments in particular has become a go-to symbol for Christian conservatives to try to push the envelope. Over and over, they have tried to put up Ten Commandments displays and crosses in schools, courthouses and other public buildings, and been almost unanimously slapped down by the courts.Even with the sharp rightward turn of the U.S. Supreme Court over the past few years, this is not really an edge case. Landry and his cadre have overstepped, and are very unlikely to succeed. Even Justice Sam Alito, recently recorded agreeing that the country needed to return to “a place of godliness,” is unlikely to play ball here. It’s a case that seems designed to be lost, and maybe that’s not an accident.After signing the statute, Landry said“I can’t wait to be sued,” appearing to understand not only he definitely would be but that this would be excellent political fodder, not even if he wins, but especially if he loses. That will give him the ability to rail against the godless heathens and Commies who have taken over the courts and spurned this nation’s supposedly integral Christian character, which is of course what this is really all about.Landry doesn’t care that much if the poster really ends up in schools or not; on the off chance it does, he can claim a victory for his movement, but in the much likelier scenario that it doesn’t he can turn that loss into donations, Fox News hits and the energizing of an evangelical base. There’s little downside for him, unless voters show him in the only poll that matters that they don’t appreciate his antics.— New York Daily NewsWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."

While the decision came too late for Rudisill, who now serves as an FBI agent, it could help plenty of veterans pursue their dreams following their service.GI Bill benefits are a debt of honor owed to those who have served in the military, not something that should be subject to bureaucratic economies or lawmakers’ budgetary maneuvering. Those who have served honorably have kept their end of the bargain. The U.S. has the obligation to do likewise.At the heart of Rudisill’s case are today’s two GI Bill programs. The Montgomery GI Bill is an update of the World War II-era GI Bill. It provides up to 36 months of educational benefits. The Post 9/11 GI Bill, which took effect in 2009, provides more generous education benefits, including housing stipends, also for up to 36 months, for those who entered service after the 2001 terrorist attacks.Rudisill served in the Army for eight years over three separate periods of service, first as an enlisted soldier and later as an officer. It’s no secret that access to higher education is one of the reasons many volunteer for service.Rudisill used 25 months and 14 days of his 36 months of Montgomery GI Bill eligibility to get his college degree while serving. He returned to the Army as an officer, becoming eligible for the Post 9/11 GI Bill.A Korean War-era law allows veterans to use benefits from a combination of programs for up to 48 months. Because he had separately earned his entitlements to educational benefits, Rudisill believed that he should be eligible for 22 more months of benefits under the Post 9/11 GI bill. He planned to attend Yale Divinity School, become an Episcopal priest and return to the Army as a chaplain.But the VA maintained that Rudisill was eligible only for 10 months of Post 9/11 benefits because of its policy of “coordinating” benefits from the two programs. The VA had been making students give up eligibility for the Montgomery program when they signed up for the Post 9/11 bill.The Supreme Court ruling rejects that position, saying that veterans who earned separate entitlements to both GI Bills cannot use education benefits from both at the same time, and they cannot receive benefits for more than 48 months, but they can use those benefits in any order up to the 48-month cap.The favorable Supreme Court ruling came too late to help Rudisill. But other veterans who need more help from the VA as they pursue advanced education could benefit from it. The ruling means the VA may have to spend considerably more money on veterans in similar situations. Rudisill’s lawyers estimate that could include as many as 1.7 million veterans across the United States. Federal officials estimate the ruling will affect fewer than 30,000.This country owes the best benefits possible to those who serve, and should be proud to pay them.— The Virginian-Pilot/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

So, if you move here, you better turn into one of them. It’s not easy, though. This is a state with many lakes and even more Lutherans. So, if you happen to be an atheist who believes in the healing power of ocean walks, brace yourself.The last person who dared to make fun of by-the-lake Christians was run out of town to make room for the reign of righteousness.

With topics revolving around family, faith and farming, the endings are way too happy for me, and the Good Lord, inevitably, gets all the credit. I’d rather watch Progressive car insurance commercials. Their messaging is less predictable.I have been to real lakes too — not just Lake Wobegon. The ones I tried reminded me of Yellowstone. I mean the TV drama, not the park. And specifically, a memorable scene where Kevin Costner shoos some foreign tourists off his gigantic property and informs them at gunpoint that “we don’t believe in sharing land in America.”To be clear, nobody has ever threatened me with a gun, but the bottom line is you can’t get to the damn water; there are too many lakefront mansions blocking the way. The freedom to roam or share land, which is a big thing in Scandinavia, must have fallen off the boat when immigrants from Norway sailed to America and settled in Minnesota.

No need to fear invisible brain eaters there; you’ll know when you come close to an animal whether it’s one with a ticket or without. The most visceral animal encounter I’ve had so far was a visit to the “The Miracle of Birth” tent. The picture that will stay with me is one of a monstrous pig in labor, about to give birth to a breathtaking number of piglets and surrounded by thrill-seeking fair visitors, many of whom are looking no less pregnant due to an overdose of Martha’s cookies. And for those fair goers who need spiritual comfort and forgiveness after wrecking the privacy of birth-giving pigs, there is a booth right next door run by born-again Christian missionaries. They can answer any questions about the miracle of rebirth.When it comes to piety, America clearly hits the ball out of the parish.In a recent survey, most Western European countries reported daily praying as a habit for just 10% or less of their citizens.

philinquirer_2024_24,"Two Center City churches have recently discontinued bike lane parking during services. Here are three other steps we can take to keep our fellow Philadelphians safe.A central tenet of many religions and ethical codes is to love your neighbor and treat them well. Last week, two congregations on opposite ends of Center City — Old Pine Street Presbyterian Church and Tenth Presbyterian Church — demonstrated this principle by placing the lives of their neighbors above parking.Every day, close toa thousandpeople on bikes ride on the Spruce and Pine Street bike lanes. These are of the few east-to-west bike lanes in Center City — the Pine Street lanes run east to the Delaware River, while Spruce’s head west to the Schuylkill — connecting residents across the city to businesses, schools, river trails, and jobs. However, on weekends these bike lanes become parking lots for religious institutions, forcing bikers like me to put our lives at risk and merge into traffic.Religious institutions receive permits from the city so that their members can park for free in no-parking zones during services. Many of these permits are for blocks without bike lanes, allowing congregants to park nearby without endangering neighbors. But some permits also allow congregants topark in the bike lane. Fortunately, starting last weekend these bike lanes became significantly clearer: Old Pine Church, at Fourth and Pine Streets, and Tenth Presbyterian, at 17th and Spruce Streets, have listened to the community and discontinued bike lane parking.As a Washington Square West resident who lives on Spruce Street and frequently uses the Spruce and Pine Street bike lanes, I would like to thank the Old Pine and Tenth Presbyterian congregations for deciding to remove the Spruce and Pine Street bike lanes from their parking permits.In taking this action, they join the Ethical Society, St. Peter’s Church, and Old St. Joseph’s Church in leading by example.However, street safety should not be dependent on the goodwill of religious institutions. It is the city’s responsibility to keep its streets safe. And the city has failed at that task dramatically, as demonstrated by thenumberof pedestrian and cyclist collisions in recent years.According tofigures compiled by the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, a traffic safety advocacy group, 128 people were killed in traffic collisions last year, including 59 pedestrians and 10 cyclists.» READ MORE:There’s another kind of violence crisis in Philly: traffic deaths | Helen UbiñasOur elected officials can and must do better. That’s whymore than 5,000 peoplehave signed a petition demanding that the city take three basic steps to protect residents.The city must end its practice of giving permits to block bike lanes. The city must replace all “No Parking” signage with “No Stopping” signage along protected bike lanes. And — most critically — the city must fully protect major bike lanes with permanent concrete barriers.Paint is not protection. As long as cars can physically drive into the bike lane, they will continue to do so. Physical barriers are needed to protect people on bikes from drivers.As a resident of Spruce Street, I know that a small number of my neighbors vocally claim it would be unfair to prohibit drivers from stopping in the bike lanes in front of our homes. But this is a special privilege a majority of Philadelphians do not have: Most streets have parking on both sides and finding a spot directly in front of your house is close to a miracle.And this small convenience for a few is not worth the danger it causes.A better solution exists: loading zones. Residents do need to unload. Delivery drivers need to stop. Taxis need to pick up and drop off passengers. We need designated spaces on our streets so that all of these critical functions can occur without putting neighbors at risk. That’s why the city justinstalled new loading zonesalong Spruce and Pine. But more are needed.People live on Spruce and Pine Streets to enjoy the countless benefits of being in one of the most beautiful and walkable neighborhoods in the country — not because they believe there will be convenient parking.The majority of neighbors I have spoken to on Spruce and Pine support protected bike lanes. In fact, the views of local residents are whatultimately droveTenth Presbyterian to give up its bike lane parking permits. As people who walk, bike, and drive, we want safe streets and an end totraffic violence. We are sick of putting our lives at risk every time we set foot outside.Neighbors who support safe streets should take action before another life is lost: Sign theprotected bike lanes petition, and contact your councilmember and the mayor. Our politicians must start listening to the entire community — not just to the small vocal minority who value parking over the lives of their fellow Philadelphians.Sage Lincoln is an attorney who lives on Spruce Street.

suffolknewsherald_2024_66,"Published 6:20 pm Tuesday, March 5, 2024ByJen JaquaIt’s unbelievable or kind of miraculous, or lack thereof, that, in the Catholic Church, there isn’t a Black Catholic American saint yet declared by the Catholic Church. I observed and wondered why. There seems to be a disparity in the canonization process for Black Catholic candidates for sainthood compared to their counterparts. There were no “Blessed” Black American Catholics either, except we now have four declared “Venerable” to date. We know there are Black American Catholics whose causes for beatification and canonization are underway in the Vatican.The Saintly Six are six Catholic African American candidates for sainthood: Mother Mary Lange, Father Augustus Tolton, Mother Henriette DeLille, Pierre Toussaint, Julia Greeley, and Sister Thea Bowman.An advocate for “Saintly Six,” Ralph E. Moore, Jr., who has recently gone to Rome with his group from St. Ann Social Justice Committee in Baltimore, Maryland, wrote in the Black Catholic Messenger on Feb. 1, expressing his sentiments and lamented for lack of Black American saints yet in the Catholic Church. He urged the Vatican, “No more silence: Give us our six saints now.”If civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Laureate (1964 , Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., were a Catholic convert, would he have been declared by the Catholic Church the first Black American saint because of his love of and practice of faith and peace, “his nonviolent struggle for civil rights for the Afro-American population” and other people of color, and his overall impact and contribution to humanity? What do you think?February is Black History Month, an annual observance in the United States that recognizes and honors Black Americans or Americans of African descent for their significant contributions and impact on America and the world.Since it’s Lenten season for Catholics and other Christians worldwide, I’d like to remember and pay tribute to our Black American Catholic brothers and sisters of Christ, who have become models of Christian virtues and inspiration to many.Because of their heroic virtue, love of God, living, preaching, and spreading the Good News, saving souls, and doing corporal and spiritual works of mercy with charitable spirit, the “Saintly Six” faithful servants of God have lived their lives of faith and holiness on earth. Models of the faithful love of service to the Lord and others are on their way to sainthood, worthy to be revered and venerated in the Catholic Church. In due time, they’ll be called Saints.Chris A.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_213,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°It is embarrassing to have to type this sentence, but type it we will: If and when there are no shelter beds available, it is unacceptable for a city or town to make it a crime for individuals to fall asleep outdoors. Though Grants Pass, Oregon, insists it is only prohibiting behavior, not the people themselves, that’s a distinction without a difference when it refers to a basic, involuntary human need like sleep. The U.S. Supreme Court should invalidate its attempts to punish those who fall asleep outside.To underscore the point, though it’s technically illegal for anyone to doze off outdoors anywhere, the town uses the statute only to go after those who have no homes. If you’re well-dressed and well-fed and clean and begin to drift off on a bench on a lazy summer day or while stargazing in a park late at night, there will be no citation or arrest; it’s only if you have no place else to go that this activity becomes a public offense.It’s important to say what we don’t mean. We don’t mean that a dense city with a right to shelter, like New York, cannot enforce rules against sleeping rough on sidewalks and in parks overnight and on subway platforms. In this case, individuals without homes have other options — and when it is cold, those individuals are endangering themselves, which can trigger government intervention.We don’t mean that a city or town cannot prohibit encampments, where people cluster and set up tents and collect other materials. That is unsanitary and unsafe, as is public urination or defecation. Public health and order and safety should permit the regulation and even punishment of many behaviors that tend to overlap with homelessness.But banning outdoor sleep altogether, like banning outdoor eating or even breathing, is so expansive a prohibition that the Supreme Court should indeed rule that it violates the Eighth Amendment’s bar on “excessive fines and unduly harsh penalties.”So asserted Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who in oral arguments on Monday smartly pointed out that there might be ample sanitation rationale to bar public eating — but that to do so would cruelly target only those who have no choice but to nourish themselves outdoors, forcing them and only them to starve. “It seems both cruel and unusual to punish people for acts that constitute basic human needs,” she said.The attorney for the town was right to say that regulating homelessness — and helping homeless people, who sometimes struggle with mental health problems or drug addiction — involves complicated choices and tradeoffs. But she was wrong to suggest that every choice should be left in the realm of policy, with no basic rights to be protected by the judiciary ever at stake.“Where do we put them if every city, every village, every town lacks compassion and passes a law identical to this, where are they supposed to sleep?” asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor. “Are they supposed to kill themselves not sleeping?”No, the Grants Pass lawyer would have replied if she was being honest, they can sleep all they wish in jail, locked up — an answer that would’ve laid bare the insanity and brutality of enforcing a law such as this one.—New York Daily News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

Graduations will soon begin if they haven’t already and the future lies just ahead of you.As a student, you are at the nexus of a pivotal point in your life. No matter what your next plans are, you will soon be leaving the familiar and looking ahead to the uncertain future. Experiences you’ve never had before, decisions you didn’t have to make before.For some, this is a scary next step. For the past 18 years your feet have been firmly rooted to the present — the here and now, but with that next step you will have the broad horizon laid out before you.From here, your life will largely be your own. Not that you have to make any new decision without asking others for advice, but in the grand scheme of things the decision for your next footsteps will be for you to take.For still others, these very things that can cause anxiety in others are causes for excitement. Maybe you have been waiting years for the opportunity to spread your wings and experience life’s adventures.Regardless of who you are, we applaud you for your bravery.It’s at this point that we’re choosing to offer up our own advice to the chorus of advice you’ve no doubt received from others and it comes twofold.First and foremost, never forget where you’ve come from. Experiences can often be neutral and are defined by the circumstances in which they arise. By this we mean that whatever the experience is, it’s valuable with the right mindset and helps define the person you are becoming.From this perspective can come celebration or the knowledge that you can rise to the adversity of the moment if it so demands. This gives you strength and with strength comes confidence. Everything up to this point has built you into the person that you have and are ready to become.Value those friends you made, value those teachers who guided you, value the parents that have supported you and value this moment in time.The second part is to acknowledge the future and its potential while at the same time understanding that a large part of it will be beyond your control. That’s where you learn to adapt and change your future as you see fit or as circumstances require.The future is fickle and as much as you try, some things you just won’t be able to bend to your will. Again, adapt and pivot when necessary, but at the same time don’t compromise who you are.You will have to compromise life in some ways, but you don’t have to compromise who you are. You are a singular being made up of moments in time that have culminated in this nexus. You will make mistakes and you most certainly will not be perfect, but that’s life. Be comfortable in who you are and stay your course.That’s it. That’s our advice.Congratulations to all of you graduates who are stepping to the edge of one moment and ready to cross into the dawn of a new moment. It’s an exciting time, embrace it."
suffolknewsherald_2024_89,"Published 6:03 pm Tuesday, July 30, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor:A recent Suffolk News-Herald article about the 2045 Comprehensive Plan update presented to City Council on July 17th mentioned that there was a petition against this plan. I’d like to highlight a main reason why many residents think the 2045 Plan should not be approved.Page six of the 2045 Comprehensive Plan draft states that “Different kinds of development have different impacts on the fiscal health of the City. Development that is not supported by existing infrastructure (roadways, water, sewer and that is more consumptive of land can be a greater drain on the City’s finances.” This is a pretty intuitive concept! When the initial draft came out in February with recommendations to expand Growth Areas by a shocking 23%, many people assumed it would be backed up by some solid data. (For context, our current 2035 Comprehensive Plan only increased the growth area by 5% back in 2015. Planners did reduce the recommendation to a 17% increase and have since reduced it again, but it is still roughly a 12% expansion.While looking for the justifications for this kind of growth (that flies in the face of the public feedback the City received , we realized that it is a norm to have a Fiscal Impact Analysis (FIA done during the comp plan update process. Originally, there were plans to do one: it was a requirement in the City’s Request for Proposal seeking a consultant to review and update the 2035 Comp Plan; it was part of the Scope of Work and timeline in the selected consultant’s proposal; Tischler Bise was the consulting firm scheduled to do the FIA and in 2022 their representative attended a workshop here with city staff. However, in August 2023, city staff decided to postpone the FIA until after plan approval.At a joint Planning Commission/City Council work session on May 1 of this year, Planning explained that an FIA is not really needed now because the City will continue using the same growth strategy it’s already been using.This assumes that the current strategy is a good one! The FIA can help determine probable long-term fiscal effects of different growth scenarios. Why would we want to move forward without this information?Citizens of Suffolk deserve data-driven reasons as to why our Planners want to double down on a strategy that is negatively impacting our ability to move around the City and increasingly straining our infrastructure.

minnpost_2024_134,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Each year, Women’s Equality Day, Aug. 26, gets lost in the flurry of last preparations for school openings and the Minnesota State Fair, compounding frustrations that we still haven’t passed an Equal Rights Amendment.Since the U.S. Supreme Court Dobbs decision, opponents of gender equality have gone rogue, legislating abortion bans, restricting women’s travel for essential healthcare needs, declaring zygotes as persons, blocking access to contraception and dragging us back to the 1950s. In response, legislatures, activists and voters took immediate action, advancing successful reproductive freedom constitutional amendments in Ohio and Kansas.That number expandedto include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota, states that have now added reproductive rights amendments to their 2024 ballots. Huge numbers of folks are mobilizing to secure permanent protections against the recission of our rights via the ERA.One thing is clear: we’re not going back. Equality is our inalienable right. We mean to establish principles of equal rights once and for all.And there’s hope: Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate in the presidential race, Gov. Tim Walz, care about the disenfranchisement of all women, including Black, Indigenous, Latinx and Asian women and women of color, as well as LBGTQI+ individuals, and they are fully informed of the benefits of federal and state ERAs to protect against discrimination.These leaders are poised to herald a new era for all those who were intentionally left out of the Constitution from this country’s inception.At an Iowa campaign rally in 2019, Harris made clear what she would do for women in her first 100 days, saying, “Passing the Equal Rights Amendment, let’s start there.” And this past winter, Harris spoke to a key ERA leader who sits on the board of our national affiliate, ERA Coalition, saying, “Had we had the ERA, we wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in now!” in reference to the Dobbs decision.When Harris says she’ll pass the ERA, believe her.Walz graduated from ERA supporter to champion last year when hesigned ERA Minnesota’s Resolution to Congressto enact the fully ratified 28thAmendment to the U.S. Constitution. He wasn’t required to sign it, but in doing so he cemented his commitment to updating the Constitution to include all people.Walz’s ERA action speaks louder than words.We’re already getting a taste of reactionary, well-funded anti-ERA efforts this election cycle, unmasking blatant, loathsome misogyny. Rather than bowing to bullies, we now have the power to move our state and country forward with our vote, which can lead to a breakthrough of the barriers foisted upon the ERA. The opportunity is there to embed the principle of equality into the Constitution, our country’s strongest legal document.State ERAs are on the march. Despite anti-equality cries to the contrary, state ERAs have a proven record ofproviding protections for reproductive freedom, as seen by actions in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Connecticut. Today a majority of states have ERAs in their constitutions;28 states have some form of state ERAs and four states actively pushed this year to adda state ERA. New York has their inclusive ERA on the ballot.Minnesota came within a hair’s breadth of passing our ERA, no thanks to a $1 million anti-ERA pushback effort and headwinds from a few power brokers who thought it politically expedient to pass the ERA two years from now when our House, Senate and governorship are all up for election. (FYI: Telling activists to wait is unthinkable to activists who have been part of the longest movement in history, the movement that touches all other movements: the ERA. It’s been 101 years, after all. Minnesotans are resilient; we came closer than ever before, having passed an all-inclusive ERA through both houses of our Legislature, albeit with slightly different language. We grew our coalition, garnered national attention, and we will be back.Elections matter. Vote for candidates who champion equal rights. Voters have the power to elect equality.Women’s Equality Day must not be a painful reminder of a country in decline. It’s up to us to seize the moment and move forward toward equal rights for all.Betty Folliard is a national ERA speaker, former state representative and founder of ERA Minnesota, a coalition of activists and allied organizations dedicated to passing both a state and federal ERA."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_244,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Within hours of Vice President Kamala Harris announcing her running mate, certain corners of the internet had exploded with “Tampon Tim” memes, a reference to a bill that Tim Walz signed ensuring free period products in Minnesota public schools.Republicans gleefully used the policy to take yet another jab at trans kids. The object of their ire? The bill’s inclusive language, which requires period products to be available “to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12 according to a plan developed by the school.”But neither the policy nor its language meaningfully diverge from the many other state laws related to period products in schools. There are similar policies in 28 states and the District of Columbia.Nevertheless, in an interview with Fox News, Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, suggested something nefarious was afoot. “As a woman,” she said, “I think there is no greater threat to our health than leaders who support gender-transition surgeries for young minors, who support putting tampons in men’s bathrooms in public schools.”As a woman myself — and also someone who’s spent over 20 years reporting on U.S. health care — let me tell you why free tampons are in fact no threat to public health at all, regardless of where they are provided.On the contrary, an inclusive period product policy is a model for good health care for children everywhere.Let’s start with affordability. According to the Alliance for Period Supplies, 1 in 4 students in the U.S. do not have access to period products because of their cost. Experts call this “period poverty.”Period poverty makes it harder to learn. A recent survey of high school students in St. Louis found that 64% of girls experienced some form of period product insecurity, and 33% of participants said they had missed school because they lacked a period product. Two-thirds of all students surveyed said they had at some point relied on their school for access to menstrual products.Other studies have found that when women can’t afford pads or tampons, they resort to unsafe or unhygienic practices, like using products for much longer than recommended. Some made do with rags or paper towels, which are not as effective.No politician should want to be associated with unhygienic rags. And yet some Republicans governors are actively preventing efforts to help kids get appropriate products. Most recently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis vetoed funding that would have established a pilot program providing free pads and tampons in the state’s public schools.These programs don’t only help the neediest students. They make puberty less awkward for all girls. Periods can start at inopportune times — say, in the middle of social studies class, when even the most prepared can be caught without a needed product.Menstruation is also starting earlier for some kids; some data suggests a rise in the number of girls beginning to menstruate at age 8 or younger, when the transition might catch them by surprise.And while we’re long past the point where the taboo around periods should be shed, the truth is, adolescence is just an embarrassing time. Even the most body-positive kids might not want to ask their math teacher for permission to grab a pad from their locker or if he has any spare tampons in his desk.Most of us have just those types of memories from puberty. Ask anyone about their first period, and I guarantee they will have a story. It’s not only a rite of passage, but the start of a yearslong adjustment to an unpredictable body.Having these products available in restrooms just makes it easier — one less thing for kids to worry about as they navigate their changing bodies. As for trans students, periods can exacerbate the dysphoria experienced by some transgender kids. Why not minimize that stress for a tiny group of kids who are already disproportionately likely to be bullied?To answer that question, we have to ask why having period products in boys’ bathrooms strikes some as such a threat. Surely many boys already see these products in the bathroom at home.Instead of the colossal dunk Republicans hoped for with their “Tampon Tim” nickname, they instead pointed to a very real problem faced by adolescents around the country.Policymakers should be thinking broadly about ways to make adolescence healthier and happier. That includes normalizing and easing the body transitions all kids experience.Making puberty less awkward? I’d vote for that.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.7 p.m. update:."
suffolknewsherald_2024_31,"Published 5:33 pm Tuesday, June 4, 2024ByStaff ReportsDr. Artis: Help. How do I maintain my sanity when I feel overwhelmed with life, family, and work?Hold on. Help is on the way. I know that feeling overwhelmed can often make you feel like you are drowning beneath a sea of to-do lists, projects, deadlines, bills, and demands. However, the key is to face your problems. Do not run and hide. Do not stop answering your phone. Do not avoid your boss. Do not work late so you don’t have to deal with household problems. Do not avoid your family — you can’t get rid of them that easily. Do not let the bills pile up — they are still due. Avoidance or denial may seem like the right things to do to decrease your stress in the moment, but you will regret these actions in the future because they can lead to worsened outcomes (for example, collections, divorce, job loss . I have two suggestions for you. The first thing I want you to do is to show up for your life — no more hiding. Face your financial struggles and seek ways to make life better by reviewing your current income and expenses to ensure you are not spending more than you earn, or apply for a part-time job or increase your hours to pay off that unexpected bill. Face your family concerns by communicating with one another through face-to-face conversation or seek a third party, such as a counselor or pastor, to help you find common ground. Effective communication is also essential when facing your work concerns. However, finding joy outside of work often helps to make work more satisfying, so perhaps you must learn how to leave work at work and enjoy time by yourself and with loved ones, especially evenings and weekends. Or, perhaps, it is time to find a new position or a new career doing something you are passionate about and utilizes your strengths yet allows you to be financially comfortable. Lastly, my second suggestion is to strive for balance once you get everything back under control. Deal with life, face the little things so they do not become big things, strive to always be a better you, and balance work and play by working hard but also enjoying life — spending quality time with the people that matter in your life, learn something new, exercise, go dancing or dance in front of your mirror, laugh out loud, or read a good book.

philinquirer_2024_73,"Everywhere we went, my wife ran into one of her UArts students. It s a special community that deserved better than to be told it would be gone within a week.To me, thesudden news on May 31 that the University of the Arts would close within the weekfelt like a death in the family.I taught writing and film at UArts for 15 years. I was a student in therenowned Saturday Schoolas a teenager and worked at the college as an artist’s model while a student at Temple. My late wife,artist Maddy Gold, was an undergraduate at the school when itwas still known as the Philadelphia College of Art, and then began teaching there while she was a graduate student at thePratt Institute.Maddy taught at UArts for 35 years. Her father, World War II combat artist and renownedsocial realist painter and illustrator Albert Gold, headed the illustration department for nearly 40 years.My mother-in-law, painter Aurora Gold, met Albert as a student at the college — their love story at the school preceded Maddy’s and mine. Aurora also taught there for nearly 20 years. My brother-in-law, composer and pianist Bob Gold, got his master’s in music education from UArts.The University of the Arts was such a part of Maddy’s and my life that our wedding rings feature a carving of that famous Hamilton Hall facade.Our wedding rings feature a carving of that famous Hamilton Hall facade.Whenwe were high school sweethearts,we would steal kisses in the studios in the basement of Hamilton Hall, the smell of modeling clay and linseed oil all around us.There was nowhere in Center City Maddy and I went where we didn’trun into one of her UArts students. One night after midnight Mass on Christmas Eve at St. Mark’s Church at 16th and Locust, we walked to Rittenhouse Square. It was snowing lightly and the scene was pure Currier and Ives. As we leaned in for the first kiss of Christmas, we heard, through the muffled snowy quiet, “Ms. Gold! Maddy Gold!” One of her students ran up to us in the park, wishing her a Merry Christmas.For so many years, UArts was the locus of our lives. We spent New Year’s Day standing on Hamilton Hall’s steps watching the Mummers Parade in our teens and college years. Faculty art shows, film festivals, student events, holiday parties, graduations — on our calendar, UArts was always present.Because more than anything, UArts was a community, a small liberal arts college in a big city that catered to the fine and performing arts. Its students were immensely talented and eager to be part of that camaraderie and closeness one rarely associates with big-city schools.That tight-knit, artistic community cannot be replicated elsewhere. It was distinct to UArts. Sometimes in my writing classes, we could hear music students performing. UArts had the atmosphere of a small New England college in a big city where music students could leave their classes and head to the jazz clubs on the Avenue of the Arts, or theater students could get cheap seats at the Wilma or the Merriam. UArts was a center for Philly’s independent film scene and festival circuit.So many artists and entertainers began their careers at that school, and we all felt the light of promise emanating from it.I loved teaching at UArts — the students, the school. I loved sharing a connection withboth my wife and in-laws.» READ MORE:My wife loved the Eagles. On Sunday, I’ll turn Maddy’s picture to face the TV. | OpinionWe all knew there were issues with enrollment and funding even before the pandemic. Maddy left in 2012 and went to teach at Drexel after the school shut down the department in which she’d taught for over three decades.Still, none of us were prepared for the abrupt announcement that it would close entirely. The subsequent days brought little clarity. The administration announced a meeting with students, faculty, and media for late Monday afternoon, butcanceled it minutes before it was scheduled to begin, with only a cursory statement that it wasn’t possible to address the issues and the university simply had no option but to close.The school’s president, Kerry Walk,resigned on Tuesday, wreaking further havoc by causing the cancellation of a bargaining session on the terms of the closure, leaving faculty and staff in limbo over payments, benefits, and severance. On Wednesday,the faculty filed lawsuitsagainst the school.What a mess.And a totally avoidable one. When the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts announced it was closing at the end of the 2024-25 school year back in January,it provided a planin which juniors, seniors, and Master of Fine Arts students on track to graduate in 2024 or 2025 would still be able to do so.Why didn’t current UArts students get this level of respect? And what about incoming first years, now high schoolers from all over the country, who had chosen UArts as their college? What about them? Imagine how this news hit them — their sense of loss and betrayal. Where will they go now? Where will current students go now?While Templehas said it is exploring a merger, Temple is a vast campus ofmore than 30,000 students, hardly that compact campus Maddy and I taught at where everyone knew everyone. Not the campus that angry, wounded community membershave been protesting overoutside Hamilton Hall since the news of the closing first hit.I’m angry that so little care was given to that community Maddy and I were so deeply invested in for so many years. I can’t imagine how painful this would be for my wife to witness, and how devastated she would be for our friends and for the students.The UArts community — both past and present — deserved better than last week. Most importantly, we deserve a chance to keep the doors open. We deserve, somehow, to let the legacy continue.Victoria A. Brownworth is a local writer and reporter.

At the time, I hoped that these programs would not only create jobs and give people a sense of financial security but also be seen as a sign of respect, a sign to the unseen and the alienated that America had their back.These policies were successful in economic terms, sparking a torrent of additional investment and lifting real wages, but economic progress has not produced social or spiritual progress — less alienation, higher social trust. American society, at every economic level, is still plagued by enmity, distrust, isolation, willful misunderstanding, ungraciousness and just plain meanness. The pain in America resides in places deeper than economic policies can reach. So how can we create a society in which it is easier to be decent to one another?To answer that question, I returned to Howard Thurman’s magnificent 1949 book, “Jesus and the Disinherited.” Thurman, a Black theologian, was a contemporary of Martin Luther King Sr. at Morehouse College and had a strong influence on the activism of his son Martin Luther King Jr.In the book, Thurman asks a series of profound questions: How is it possible for the disinherited and the oppressed to live pushed against the wall without losing their humanity? More broadly, how is it possible to strengthen the spiritual and social foundation of society so that people will recognize one another’s full dignity amid the normal tussles of life? These are germane questions today, when so many — on the left and right — feel that society has pushed them against the wall.Thurman emphasizes that Jesus was a poor Jew living under the tyranny of Roman power. But even in these vicious circumstances, Jesus focused his attention on the “inward center” of each person. He showed that you can’t look only at a person’s economic or political circumstances. The crucial level for any person is the spiritual level, the place where souls are either sanctified or degraded.Thurman reminds us that when the networks of relationships in a society are broken and unjust, national transformation must flow from a tide of personal transformations.He first focuses on how our circumstances either diminish or elevate our souls. With tremendous insight, Thurman probes the psychologies of those who dominate and those who are disinherited. He points out that those who do the dominating often live in fear that if they don’t keep dominating, then their security will vanish. Meanwhile, those who are disinherited face their own psychic pressures: “There are few things more devastating than to have it burned into you that you do not count.”In a passage that anticipates the rise of Donald Trump, Thurman notes the awful power of the demagogue who says to the alienated youth, “No one loves you — I love you; no one will give you work — I will give you work; no one wants you — I want you.” In another passage that anticipates the current agony in the Gaza Strip: “The doom of the children is the greatest tragedy of the disinherited.”It is natural, Thurman writes, for people who are disinherited to feel fear and hatred toward their oppressors. It is natural to want to lie to those who dominate you in order to protect yourself. But, he continues, these are self-destructive responses.He writes, “Jesus rejected hatred because he saw that hatred meant death to the mind, death to the spirit, death to communion with his father.” When you try to deceive someone else, even for your own protection, you end up becoming a deceiver deep in your nature. You end up losing the ability to make moral distinctions.Thurman argued that the first step toward reconciliation comes when we redefine the people on both sides of these power equations. When status categories are frozen, people in different groups meet as enemies. But you can scramble status categories by asking deeper questions of one another: How have you decided to live your life? What are the questions you have had to answer? These inquiries begin the process of seeing others in their full dignity. They initiate a process of sharing mutual worth and value.Then comes my favorite sentence in the book, “There cannot be too great insistence on the point that we are here dealing with a discipline, a method, a technique, as over against some form of wishful thinking or simple desiring.”A discipline, a method, a technique.To be a good citizen, it is necessary to be warmhearted, but it is also necessary to master the disciplines, methods and techniques required to live well together: how to listen well, how to ask for and offer forgiveness, how not to misunderstand one another, how to converse in a way that reduces inequalities of respect. In a society with so much loneliness and distrust, we are failing at these social and moral disciplines.Similarly, to create social change, it is necessary to have good intentions, but it is also necessary to master the disciplines and techniques of effective social action. The people in the civil rights organizations in the 1950s and ’60s spent a lot of time rigorously thinking about which methods would work and which would backfire. Thurman’s emphasis on methodological rigor and technique influenced King’s brilliant and often counterintuitive principles of nonviolent resistance:1. It is not a method for cowards. It is active nonviolent resistance to evil.2. It seeks not to defeat or humiliate the opponent but to win his friendship and understanding in order to move toward a beloved community.3. The attack is directed against the forces of evil rather than against the people who happen to be doing the evil.4. One must have a willingness to accept suffering without retaliation, to accept blows from an opponent without striking back. Unearned suffering is redemptive.5. It avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of the spirit. It is a refusal to hate.6. Nonviolent resistance is based on the conviction that the universe is on the side of justice. It has a deep faith in the future.As many have noted, we’re not going to solve our problems at the same level of consciousness on which we created them. If the national consciousness, the state of our national soul, is to repair, it will be because people begin to think as deeply as Thurman did and begin to be intolerant of the immoralities of their own side.I was impressed this week by Georgia’s former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan. A conservative Republican, he announced his decision to support Biden, and he rebuked those other conservatives who are appalled by Trump but still vow to vote for him. Duncan’s reasoning was straightforward: Character is more important than policy. Or to put it more grandly, the soul of our democracy is more important than whatever the future top tax rate might be.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

minnpost_2024_48,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.More than 30 years ago I began my social service career working at a community center in a low-income housing project. I loved that job, but I will never forget the day I overheard a young African American boy discussing the year he thought he would go to prison — because he did not see any other options for himself. His words helped catapult me into early childhood advocacy because I wanted to create so many options for that young man and young people like him. I have spent my career working to close opportunity gaps for children of color and all low-income children, beginning with support for their families even before birth.As the 2024 legislative session progresses, I want to celebrate the huge step forward we’ve taken to close opportunity gaps — especially for families living in low-income households — due tomajor legislative winsin 2023. For instance, it’s estimated that thehistoric Child Tax Creditwill reduce child poverty by one-third and affect 300,000 families in Minnesota. Also, investments that increase the affordability of early childhood education will result in nearly 35,000 more children attending preschool!Child care worker compensation was a major issue before the pandemic, and the need has only grown as more parents and caregivers reenter the workforce. New investments in childcare worker compensation, mental health supports for children, housing access and affordability and more are a big step in the right direction to create opportunities for low-income children, like the ones I used to work with at the community center.Investing in our children is the best investment we can make. This recent funding is set to yield major public and private benefits in Minnesota, including improved school performance, workforce participation and physical and mental health, and crime reduction.Studies showproof of successwhen our littlest learners access high-quality early education. Children are more likely to start kindergarten ready, succeed in work and life, and experience greater health in their bodies and relationships. These benefits add up with each generation, and lead to lasting prosperity in households, neighborhoods and the state as a whole.According to Arthur J. Rolnick, associate economist at the University of Minnesota, the most impactful investments in early childhood must start early. The programs must be high-quality and prioritize children and families facing racial and economic barriers. These investments are very low relative to the public and private returns we can expect over the next few years and decades.At The Family Partnership, 95% of the families we serve live near or below the federal poverty level. The cycles of grief, homelessness and violence we see every day — especially in our Northside and Southside neighborhoods in Minneapolis — point to the work yet to be done to help our community heal. While there is no band aid for a wound this big, we have seen great success for thousands who participate in our whole-family services. Whole family — also called 2gen — services recognize the need to work with parents and caregivers alongside their children to build sustainable paths of healing and well-being.In the face of our community’s challenges, now isnotthe time for us to get weary of well-doing. Let’s continue to build on the investments from 2023 and make early childhood education affordable for everyone. The United States is the only developed country that puts the financial burden of an early childhood education on the backs of families. Like many families around the country, families in Minnesota across multiple income levels struggle to afford child care that costs a monthly average of $1,300 per child,based on 2021 Child Care Aware Minnesota survey data.I invite you to contact your state representatives to thank them for supporting the latest funding, and this year ask that they support policies for increased wages for early child care educators and providers, and funding to cap child care costs at 7% of household income. As pandemic recovery continues, partnerships will help us sustain the momentum to close opportunity gaps and expand opportunities for generations to come. When individuals, organizations, business leaders and lawmakers work together and prioritize strong families, we all flourish.Because when we can close opportunity gaps so all children succeed, our community succeeds.Dianne Haulcy, the president and CEO of The Family Partnership, hosts the Early Risers podcast on MPR."
eugeneweekly_2024_1,"We ve got issues. As a child I quickly learned from my father the importance of having a place to call home. He made our modest home in Sunland, an extremely small California town with one junior high and one high school. There my siblings and I grew up, never leaving until we went to college. He grew up in several homes located in several states, and I understand my father’s need for stability. He was also a preachy, philosophical World War II veteran who often stressed that no matter where we wandered and explored, having family and a home to come back to was all we truly needed to live a fulfilling life. Being the sponsor of two Salvadoran asylum seekers for nearly four years now, has given me an even stronger understanding of what having a home means.As I have written in previousEugene Weeklycolumns, Luisa and Lola (not their real names arrived in Eugene by leaving their home country, their families and their friends behind and walking through several countries to get here. Why did they leave and what were they seeking? Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Luisa and Lola chose to leave El Salvador because it was and is a country ripe with gangs and violence, particularly against women. They each have their story about why they had to leave. And what they sought and what they have worked towards these past four years center around safety and having a home. This desire and need for a home appears everywhere in Eugene. People may be annoyed by all the tents popping up on our vacant lots and parking strips, under trees and behind bushes, but really all anyone wants is a place to rest, to be safe, to be protected from the weather. To be “homeless” is, I believe, one of the worst things that can happen to someone. Conestoga shelters, tiny houses and low income rentals need to continually be built, because really no matter life’s often unexpected circumstances, everyone deserves to have a home. Luisa and Lola have been living in a trailer donated by Oregon Community Asylum Network (OCAN . With their work permits secured, they have constantly worked at this job and that job until finally they have good-paying jobs with full benefits. They often work more than 40 hours a week. I have never seen anyone work as hard as they do. And why are they working so hard? They want to save money so they can have a safe life with a cozy, affordable home and to possibly bring Lola’s daughters here to live with them. Yes, like my father told me, family is important. With the help of a friend of mine, we found Luisa and Lola their home — a small, cozy one-bedroom affordable rental with a second attic bedroom for the daughters at an affordable price. Luisa and Lola moved in at the beginning of March and are beyond happy. Their happiness is truly my happiness. They know they are family to me and my home is also their home. As Luisa shared with me as we sat on their couch, “I came here with only a small day pack and the clothes I was wearing. Now I can hardly believe I have my own home.” I am reminded of the ending ofThe Wizard of Ozwhere Dorothy’s adventures end with the gift of her ruby slippers.

philinquirer_2024_65,"The right to an attorney after you’ve been charged with a crime is enshrined in the Constitution. Our state s lack of funding for public defenders has put that right in jeopardy.If you’ve ever watched a television show or movie that includes police as part of the storyline, chances are you’ve heard the phrase: “You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided to you at no cost.”That right isn’t fiction, it’s a fact.The right to an attorney after you’ve been charged with a crime is enshrined in the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, which mandate that the right to effective representation shouldn’t be just for rich people.This right has been affirmed repeatedly for decades by both theUnited StatesandPennsylvaniaSupreme Courts, both declaring that public defendersact as a safeguard against the deprivation of human rights.Despite this right being enshrined in legal doctrine (and pop culture , the intent of this right is not just about having a warm body with a law degree sitting next to you in court. The right to counsel is actuallythe right toeffectivecounsel. This right means a public defender or court-appointed attorney must have the time, resources, oversight, training, and supervision to adequately prepare and vigorously advocate for their clients.Unfortunately, Pennsylvaniaprovides almost no state funding for public defenders. Instead, the commonwealth leaves nearly all funding and control of public defender offices to the discretion of each individual county.But counties have a more limited revenue base than does the commonwealth, as most counties cannot collect income or sales taxes. And in local politics, funding for services for older adults, roads, public health, and law enforcement will always win out over an office that, by design, serves only people accused of crime who cannot afford a private attorney.A lack of funding for public defenders means people arrested and placed in jail oftendon’t meet with an attorney for days or even weeks.This is plainly unconstitutional.That’s why, after more than two years of research, data analysis, court observation, and countless interviews with participants in the criminal legal process, especially the public defenders and their clients,the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania sued the state. Our lawsuit asks the court to find that Pennsylvania’s decision to delegate nearly all funding and control for public defenders to the counties violates the Pennsylvania and U.S. Constitutions. The commonwealth has the ultimate obligation to ensure adequate representation for poor people charged with crimes in the state.» READ MORE:Ketanji Brown Jackson is now the only former public defender on Supreme Court. This matters. | OpinionTo be clear, this isn’t a knock on the public defenders. The large majority are hardworking, dedicated, and grossly underresourced professionals. The problem is not them; the problem is the system they work under. Even the most talented lawyer could not provide effective representation with caseloads that only allow mere minutes to help each client.The ACLU of Pennsylvania is not the only one ringing the alarm on the public defense funding crisis in the commonwealth.Arecent report by a law professorat the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School found that at least 60 of Pennsylvania’s 66 counties with public defendersdid not have enough attorneys in their public defender offices to meet national standards.Thenational standards, compiled in 2023, established different caseload recommendations based on the complexity of the matters an attorney handles. For example, the study estimated that a public defender may spend roughly a dozen hours handling a low-level misdemeanor, while a high-level felony — where the accused could be sentenced to life in prison without the opportunity for parole — could consume nearly 300 hours. Even under the University of Pennsylvania study’s conservative methodology, which did not factor in the time public defenders spend on additional work such as appeals and probation and parole violation hearings, nearly all Pennsylvania county public defender offices had caseloads that exceeded the national standards.These aren’t minor shortfalls, either; an estimated 47 Pennsylvania counties would need to more than double their attorney staffing levels to meet the national standards.These aren’t minor shortfalls.Some welcome news is that many of Pennsylvania’s elected leaders have acknowledged the funding crisis, and have started to take some baby steps toward addressing it. Gov. Josh Shapirosecured $7.5 millionin his 2023-2024 annual budget proposal for public defender funding and has continued that level of funding innext year’s budget, just signed into law. It’s a good start, but it’s not nearly enough.A fairly and fully funded network of public defender offices is the only way to make sure every Pennsylvanian has a fair chance to navigate the criminal legal system.Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians are impacted by the public defense resource crisis per year. They are the people who spend extra time incarcerated while they wait to be assigned a public defender, in jails wheredrug deaths and overdoses can run rampant. They are the public defenders whowork tirelessly to represent an overwhelming number of clients. They are the children whose parents unjustly sit in jail. They are the spouses who struggle to make ends meet while their partners await their day in court. And so many others.This lawsuit isn’t just about making sure Pennsylvania is following the law. It’s about preventing the unjust and unnecessary suffering of so many Pennsylvanians as a result of a broken system.Veronica Miller is the senior policy counsel for criminal legal reform at the ACLU of Pennsylvania.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_252,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Kamala Harris, who still hasn’t held an unscripted media appearance since Democratic power-brokers anointed her to replace the now-forgotten Joe Biden, made her first major decision of the campaign Tuesday — and it underwhelmed.Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — a former congressman, teacher and football coach — as her vice presidential candidate. The decision confirms that, as president, she would eschew a moderate path and instead be at the beck and call of the radical progressives dominating her party. A “squad” member, if you will.The decision is rather curious, given that Walz is virtually unknown outside his reliably blue home state. Although some Republican operatives believe Donald Trump has a shot to take Minnesota this year, Gopher State voters haven’t supported a GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972. Nor does Walz necessarily appeal to the moderates who will decide this election. He has morphed into a passionate devotee of the far left, recently proclaiming, “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighborliness.”Walz got the nod over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the popular leader of a vital swing state. But Shapiro defends Israel’s right to fight back against Hamas atrocities, earning the wrath of progressives who have thrown their lot behind Middle Eastern terrorists. The fact that Harris felt it necessary to appease antisemitic protesters in the Democratic Party does not bode well for America’s foreign policy under her leadership.Back to Walz. It’s difficult to see the national appeal. Republicans have already begun the attacks, pointing out that he did virtually nothing when the city of Minneapolis was engulfed in violence and riots after the killing of George Floyd during the summer of 2020. Instead, he expressed “excitement” about those seeking “fundamental change” as the city burned, stores were looted and a police precinct was attacked.The New York Times reports that “he and Minnesota’s Democratic Legislature have enacted a sweeping progressive agenda.” James Freeman of The Wall Street Journal noted, “The selection of Walz is bound to reignite the debate on whether Kamala Harris has managed to get to the left of Bernie Sanders.”Both Harris and Trump appear to have chosen running mates designed to excite their own rabid supporters rather than to expand their coalition to attract the independent and moderate Americans who will be vital to electing the next president.— Las Vegas Review-JournalNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.Mahalo for quick response by HECO"
suffolknewsherald_2024_27,"Published 2:26 pm Wednesday, June 19, 2024ByStaff ReportsMonday, June 17, marked the 126th anniversary of the Hospital Corps of the United States Navy.Established in 1898, the Hospital Corps is a vital component of the U.S. Navy in general and U.S. Navy Medicine in particular. It exists to serve in peace and wartime. Its members, known as Navy Hospital Corpsman, are charged with caring for all eligible healthcare beneficiaries’ health and medical needs worldwide.As the largest occupational rating (Navy Enlisted Classification-HM in the United States Navy, the Hospital Corps has about 30,000 members on active duty and reserve, and they’re everywhere.They’re at sea and undersea, in Navy ships and submarines, or ashore, in hospitals, medical centers, clinics, Marine units, battlefields, and special operations. They are considered the most decorated in the U.S. Navy and, in general, the United States Armed Forces. To their credit, to date, are 23 recipients of the Medal of Honor, 179 Navy Cross, 31 Distinguished Service Cross (United States Army , 959 Silver Star Medals, and 1,600 Bronze Star Medal with Combat “V” for heroism.They’re referred to as “Doc,” a term of endearment, by the Marines who love them dearly and consider them their “unsung heroes,” their “lifesavers.” The Marines are very protective of them who often make the difference between life and death, especially on the battlefield. They may be frequently the only medical care-giver available in many fleet or Marine units, especially on extended deployment. In a combat environment, they render emergency medical treatment or initial treatment.They perform various functions as clinical or specialty technicians/technologists, with specialized training as medical laboratory technologists, optometry technicians, aerospace medicine specialists, pharmacy technicians, operating room technicians, and radiology technologists.They receive advanced medical training and qualifications, as well as qualifications and certification in sanitation and public health. Others are assigned independent duty as IDCs (Independent Duty Corpsman in surface ships and submarines, with diving teams and Fleet Marine Force (FMF Recon teams, as well as remote shore installations, trained and skilled in combat and other specialties.Besides doing bedside hospital or clinic health and medical care to patients, they perform duties as assistants to healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses ; advisers regarding health and injury prevention, and treatment illnesses for decompression sickness and other conditions requiring hyperbaric treatment.As I recall, I participated in the flag ceremony and official tribute to the Navy Hospital Corps at its 100th anniversary celebration — A Century of Tradition, Valor and Sacrifice — at The First and Finest, Naval Medical Center in Portsmouth (NMCP in June 1998.To grace that special occasion, 1954 Medal of Honor recipient, Master Chief Hospital Corpsman (HMCM (SS retired, William R.

The traditional cake-cutting ceremony featured the oldest corpsman (Charette and youngest NMCP staff member. By the way, Charette Health Care Center, Building 2, recently celebrated its 25 years in April this year. Based on my observation and experience, I’d like to share “What a Hospital Corpsman is?”He’s more than an aide, an assistant, an adviser, a specialist, a technician or a technologist.He’s more than a doctor’s helper or a nurse’s aide…He does quality patient care with the utmost service that’s rare—Only in the military, he’s full of responsibilities; a call to duty…and other collateral duties.On the frontline, He is there; on the battlefield, He is there, everywhere with his comrades, Sailors and Marines, rendering emergency medical services and caring for them when they’re sick; giving all the support they need: moral, emotional, physical, mental, social, and spiritual as well.Of his nursing and medical experiences in the field or battlefield, the Marines call him “Doc” because he cares for them until the end.In a ship or a hospital, he’s everywhere, here and there: in the wards or the Lab, in the Pharmacy or Radiology, in the Emergency or the Galley, sometimes in the Quarterdeck or PSD, in Sick Call or in Supply. But, despite his job, he can still smile and have fun, even for a while.He’s a healthcare provider and a health record keeper. He is a giver and a peacekeeper. He’s a writer, teacher, and lecturer. He’s so talented, can you not tell?He’s a Hospital Corpsman, proud to serve his fellowmen in sickness or health, in wartime or peacetime; He’s always ready to care, serve, and protect…Here’s the Hospital Corpsman’s Oath or Pledge:“I solemnly pledge myself before God and these witnesses to practice faithfully all of my duties as a member of the Hospital Corps. I hold the care of the sick and injured to be a privilege and a sacred trust and will assist the Medical Officer with loyalty and honesty. I will not knowingly permit harm to come to any patient. I will not partake of nor administer any unauthorized medication. I will hold all personal matters pertaining to the private lives of patients in strict confidence. I dedicate my heart, mind and strength to the work before me. I shall do all within my power to show in myself an example of all that is honorable and good throughout my Naval Career.”To all our hospital corpsmen everywhere, kudos and thank you for a job well done, and always ready to heed the call, “Corpsman up.” May God bless you and your families always.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2024_122,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled on City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, which grappled with the growing issue of homelessness and whether cities can criminalize camping on public property when no other shelter is available.While the ruling, which supports the enforcement of camping bans, has far-reaching implications for how communities address homelessness, it is worth stepping back to look at what we know about homelessness in Minnesota. How can we work toward addressing homelessness in our local jurisdictions and prevent this solvable issue from becoming a national-level court case?The Minnesota Homeless Study, conducted every three years by Wilder Research, helps tell the story of who is experiencing homelessness in our state and the reasons behind it. More importantly, data informs the types of services and policies that could help — or hurt — those who are homeless. Conducted in partnership with government agencies, tribes, service providers and advocates, the 2023 Minnesota Homeless Study included thousands of in-depth interviews with people experiencing homelessness.In October 2023, 47% of adults experiencing homelessness were on a waiting list for public housing and another 10% could not get on the waiting list because it was closed. One-third of homeless adults had been turned away from a shelter in the previous three months; a majority of them ended up sleeping in the most precarious locations available: outside, in a car or vacant building, or on transit (62% . From service providers across the state, we have heard again and again that shelters are stretched nearly to the breaking point due to the complexities of this population, staffing shortages and lack of adequate long-term funding.Decades of Minnesota Homeless Study data show that more people are unsheltered today than in the past. In October 2023, 28% of adults experiencing homelessness had spent a week or more sleeping outside, compared to 13% in October 2009.People who have spent more time sleeping outside are also those who have been homeless multiple times, have repeatedly moved from place to place and have been homeless for a longer part of their life. The unsheltered population has multiple, complex needs that limit their ability to get housing, especially in a competitive rental market. The majority of people who have slept outside for a week or more have spent time in jail (70% , have a significant mental health condition (69% or have been in treatment for substance use (61% .To be clear, the most common challenge to finding housing, regardless of how much time someone has slept outside, is affordability. Half of those experiencing homelessness cited “no affordable housing” as a main barrier, followed by credit problems, having no local rental history and a criminal background.In addition to these challenges, people who have slept outside for a week or more experience higher rates of violence and sexual exploitation while homeless (64%, compared with 51% of those who had not slept outside in the previous month . Experience with trauma and violence are shockingly high in both the Twin Cities metro and Greater Minnesota, an issue explored in a recent publication onmnhomeless.org. This is a clear indicator that we need to get people into safe and stable housing, not further punish them for being forced to sleep outside.Communities across the United States are deliberating ways to address homelessness and preserve the safety and well-being for all community members. Given that people sleeping outside have more complex health needs and larger barriers to finding housing, the answer cannot be creating more obstacles.To end homelessness, Minnesota must fund housing for people with very low incomes, increase substance use and mental health treatment services, and invest in critically underfunded emergency shelters and supportive services that meet the complex needs of our unsheltered community members.Michelle Decker Gerrard is co-director of the Minnesota Homeless Study and Stephanie Nelson-Dusek is a research scientist at Wilder Research."
minnpost_2024_8,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.I want to see an America where everyone can access the tools they need to reach financial freedom, regardless of where they come from or how wealthy they are.In line with that vision, I am always happy to see proposals that will bring more Black and brown Minnesotans into our nation’s financial system, like the proposed Capital One and Discover merger. This merger, which the federal government has to review, would be a win for communities that have been cast aside by too many other financial institutions and heighten competition in the payment network market — a win for small and minority-owned businesses in Minnesota and around the country.Visa and Mastercard currently process 80% of all credit card transactions. This lack of competition means Visa and Mastercard can get away with charging high prices, with Visa accused in a recent lawsuit of engaging in anticompetitive practices. The consolidation of the payment network industry has hurt minority-owned small businesses, which can lack the profit margins to absorb Visa and Mastercard’s ability to set whatever price they want for their services.If this merger becomes final, it would bolster Discover’s standing because Capital One will be able to issue its cards over the Discover payment network. This will make Discover a more robust competitor to the Visa and Mastercard duopoly.This heightened competition would push all payment networks to compete for the opportunity to work with businesses by offering better services and adopting more competitive pricing, and give small businesses a greater ability to negotiate more favorable terms for themselves. This would be a big win for minority-owned businesses who are most impacted by the current lack of competition in the marketplace.And even the financial press agrees. The Bloomberg editorial board has said, “The Capital One-Discover merger is likely to inject much-needed competition into the card market,” which would expand consumer choice and yield more competitive price points for small businesses in our communities.In addition to competition, the merger would bring to the marketplace the creation of a Capital One-Discover bank that would also benefit communities often forgotten by other financial institutions, like so many in Minnesota.Capital One has been a leader in providing innovative and personalized banking services to everyone. The bank has gained recognition for its commitment to ensuring that all people, regardless of background or income or wealth, have access to the financial tools they need to build or repair credit and is the largest issuer of credit cards to first-time cardholders.Discover’s credit cards are also known for being pathways toward building credit for people. By coming together, a fused Capital One-Discover bank could build on its mission of empowering people to build credit — the first step toward securing a business loan or financing large purchases like buying a vehicle or a home.This is a unique opportunity for President Joe Biden’s administration to build on its work of uplifting Black and brown communities. It would be a victory for minority-owned small businesses that currently bear the brunt of the consequences as a result of the Visa-Mastercard duopoly and for Minnesota’s marginalized communities in need of expanded credit access in order to reach their financial goals.Lawrence Wright, a Minneapolis resident, is a DFL Party and community activist."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_194,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°As the magnitude of the bird flu outbreak in cattle becomes clearer, so does the need to quickly get a firmer grip on some basic facts. Namely, how far this H5N1 virus has spread, how it is spreading, and where this situation is likely to go next. The COVID-weary public also wants to know whether humans are at risk.Public agencies must move faster and collaborate more efficiently to answer some of those unknowns. After all, this is a pathogen that has loomed large in the minds of infectious disease experts for its potential to cause a deadly human pandemic.“It’s fair to say for every question we’ve had answered in the last month, we have 10 to 15 new questions,” says Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy in Minnesota.Among the most essential: Just how widespread is this outbreak?The seriousness of the situation escalated after scientists found viral fragments in milk on grocery store shelves—including in states that had not reported infected herds. The Food and Drug Administration eventually said it had detected H5N1 fragments in one out of every five of the commercial milk samples it tested.That suggests the virus has been circulating in cows longer and more easily than anyone realized. Genetic sleuths have traced the outbreak back to a likely spillover event in late 2023, when a wild bird may have infected a cow on a farm. Widespread testing is essential to understanding the outbreak’s true scope — and to have any hope of containing it. But that’s easier said than done. Consider that tens of thousands of cows are being moved around the country any given week, says Keith Poulsen, Director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “We can’t test them all, so we need to test where it’s going to be logistically easy to accomplish.”The US Department of Agriculture recently said cows could not be moved between states without a negative H5N1 test, and expanded the amount of testing it will pay for. But the agency is still only requiring farms to test a few dozen cows out of each group, an approach that is not sufficient to stop the spread.Paulsen and others are working on methods to test bulk milk, but need to ensure they are sensitive enough to pick up even one infected cow out of a pool of milk from as many as two thousand. Because even asymptomatic cows seem to be shedding so much virus in their milk, he thinks that’s feasible.Which leads us to another seemingly simple, yet still elusive question: How exactly is the virus spreading among cows?On a recent call with state public health officials, USDA Chief Veterinary Officer Rosemary Sifford noted that transmission is mostly occurring within cows who are lactating, but it’s unclear if the spread primarily is happening through the milking process itself or because a cow with a high viral load in their milk is passing it onto others. The USDA has said that anything that comes in contact with milk, whether that’s a human, another animal, a vehicle or fomites, could spread the virus and that it’s likely occurring in more than one way.So far, the virus really seems to be largely in the mammary glands, though the USDA has found evidence of the virus in the respiratory tract of one cow (though it’s unclear how many nasal swabs are being performed . The agency is currently conducting transmission studies in cattle that could inform mitigation efforts.Of course, everyone is wondering what the coming weeks and months will look like — for herds, for our food supply, for other livestock and, of course, for humans. To help answer that, attention should focus on the Texas panhandle, where the outbreak was first detected. Those herds might provide important clues about what the coming months could look like. “Maybe the simplest question is: When a herd ‘recovers,’ what does it mean?,” asks Richard Webby, a specialist in influenza at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis.We need to know whether cows generate sufficient immunity to ward off another infection, how long that immunity might last, and how widespread that immunity might be. That will mean looking for antibodies to the virus in herds around the country, regardless of whether there was a known outbreak there. Clarity on immunity will help shape future mitigation and monitoring efforts.Which leads us to the questions most relevant to the general public: Am I safe?Let’s start with the food supply. The FDA’s tests have shown pasteurized milk is safe to drink. (Raw milk, on the other hand, should be absolutely avoided. And the USDA, which maintains the meat supply is safe, nevertheless is currently conducting tests of both ground beef on grocery shelves and at processing facilities, to understand whether evidence of the virus exists there, too. The agency is also looking at what happens to meat infected in a lab and then cooked at different temperatures.Then there’s the worry of infection. Osterholm, who has been following H5N1 for nearly three decades now, reiterates that despite this new twist of widespread infections in cows, the risk to humans remains low. But “that should not leave us complacent,” he says. “All can change in a heartbeat.”Some scientists are working behind the scenes to prepare in case the virus adapts to infect humans. So far, the same antivirals used for the seasonal flu, such as Tamiflu, seem likely to work against H5N1. Meanwhile, two vaccine candidates against H5N1 seem somewhat effective against viral samples taken from infected cows, and enough raw materials exist to make limited doses if needed.But the caveats are many. For example, our flu treatments aren’t great to begin with — to be effective, they must be taken within a very short window of developing symptoms. And there’s reason to worry that our existing vaccines might be far less helpful if the virus adapted to infect people. Researchers are working on newer antivirals and vaccine strategies, but those efforts are nascent and wouldn’t do much for us if the situation suddenly took a more serious turn.It’s important to keep pushing for answers and transparency. The stakes are too high to let the questions keep piling up.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

minnpost_2024_175,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.This week, the Twin Cities is experiencing what may be a once-in-a-lifetime event. Downtown Minneapolis is alive with the nation’s premier clean energy innovators for the American Clean Power Association’s CLEANPOWER Conference. Simultaneously, an important bipartisan clean energy bill is working its way through the Minnesota Legislature.CLEANPOWER is bringing together policymakers, industry leaders and renewable energy experts from across the country, and Minneapolis is a wise choice to host this illustrious crowd. There is figurative power to our natural resources — like the ‘Mighty Mississippi’ and the winds of the Buffalo Ridge — and literal power:Minnesota ranks 10thnationally in clean energy production.Last year, Minnesota joined only six other states, plus the District of Columbia, in committing itself to 100% clean electricity by 2040. Getting there may sound herculean, and it will take some very deliberate action and coordination among state leaders, but it is doable.Standing in the way is the region’s lack of adequate transmission infrastructure, which has led to significant congestion on the power grid. This hampers development of new clean energy projects that create jobs and generate tax revenue to communities that host them. The cumbersome and lengthy permitting process for essential new transmission infrastructure is impeding our ability to deliver the 100% clean energy future that Minnesota pledged to achieve.Congestion and delays for expanding transmission infrastructure means low-cost wind and solar energy are wasted when there is no room on transmission lines for it to be delivered. This costs ratepayers money.There’s vast potential to generate more clean energy when we have enough transmission to deliver it.There is a solution. We need our elected officials to pass theMinnesota Energy Infrastructure Permitting Act. The legislation will save money and “could reduce overall permitting times for wind, solar, and transmission projects bymore than a year,” according to House Majority Leader Jamie Long. We commend Rep. Long, Sen. Frentz, and Rep. Acomb for leading on this important issue.This bipartisan bill is the product of a stakeholder group commissioned by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission with the assistance and participation of our teams at Clean Grid Alliance and LIUNA. The stakeholder group represented 32 organizations, including state agencies, environmental advocates, property rights organizations, labor groups, developers and utilities who worked together to advance this reform.The group identified over 30 ideas for improvements to the process and coalesced around a package of 12 core reform recommendations that will combine to make Minnesota’s permitting process significantly more timely, efficient, and cost-effective without diminishing public input or community involvement. The Minnesota Energy Infrastructure Permitting Act is built around these 12 core reforms.We are counting on legislative leaders and the Governor to make sure this bill becomes law this session. There is no time to waste. The road to 100% clean energy by 2040 is achievable and we have the roadmap in front of us. We just need to implement the right legislation.Peder Mewis is the regional policy director for Clean Grid Alliance. Kevin Pranis is the marketing manager for the Laborers’ International Union of North America in Minnesota and North Dakota, the chair of Minnesota’s Clean Transportation Standard Work Group and a member of Gov.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_205,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°During Vietnam War protests, the Nixon administration called them “outside agitators.” Now my university’s provost prefers “participants — many of whom do not appear to be affiliated with USC.” Beyond Andrew Guzman’s misdemeanor of wordiness, the playbook is the same: Blame outsiders, as part of the justification for police action against students exercising their rights to question a heinous U.S. foreign policy that is killing tens of thousands of men, women and children half a world away.In his statement to the USC community Wednesday, Guzman claimed that almost entirely peaceful protesters in Alumni Park were “threatening the safety of our officers.” USC officials determined that its own police were unable to contain the chanting, singing, marching-in-a-circle demonstrators. Agenda items for the student action, before it was broken up by police, included yoga, kite-making, Black/Palestinian solidarity, a Jewish Voice for Peace Kaddish reading and a sunset vigil.In the face of these allegedly threatening protests, USC officials shut down the campus and called in the Los Angeles Police Department. I watched riot-ready officers posted at 36th and Vermont with more than three dozen police cruisers. As the Daily Trojan reported, LAPD “officers in riot gear marched into campus at around 5:30 p.m. armed with 40-millimeter less-lethal projectile launchers, sponge batons and zip ties.” Later, according to USC Annenberg Media, which posted a video, police fired a rubber bullet into a crowd gathered outside the school’s main gate.As Guzman pointed fingers, USC President Carol Folt appeared to be walled off in her office, steps from Tommy Trojan. Finally she broke her silence — to gush about USC football. While protesters chanted “USC, shame on you, your hands are bloody too,” Folt took her stand — applauding the reinstatement of Reggie Bush’s Heisman Trophy. “I am so happy for Reggie and the entire Trojan Family,” our president declared.The surreal disconnect follows 10 days of disingenuous statements from USC leadership, which in apparent deference to donors, and perhaps with a nervous gaze at right-wing congressional attacks on university presidents, has trampled on students’ free speech rights, citing — unoriginally —“security risks.”On April 15, USC canceled valedictorian Asna Tabassum’s graduation speech. Her pro-Palestinian views roiled backers of Israel.“As always, and particularly when tensions are running so high across the world, we must prioritize the safety of our community,” Guzman rationalized, although no threats were specified. On Wednesday, this concern for our safety had transmogrified into a call for riot police to clear the “camp-in” at the center of campus. USC students and faculty were ostensibly protected by arresting 93 protesters who offered little to no real resistance.Now USC may raise the stakes. The university’s Department of Public Safety announced to protesters Wednesday that students who didn’t disperse could face suspension or expulsion. These same students presumably learned USC’s“Unifying Values”: to “stand up for what is right, regardless of status or power.” My university’s shameful doublespeak threatens to taint promising careers before they start. Professors arrested, including vulnerable untenured colleagues, may also face sanctions.We should remember what the protests are about: According to Gaza officials, more than 34,000 Palestinians, some 14,000 of them children, have been killed by Israeli armed forces, with weapons supplied in part by U.S. taxpayers. Survivors driven from their homes face widespread famine. And as students at USC and other campuses realize, their Palestinian counterparts are victims of “scholasticide” — every university in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed.Universities exist to advance knowledge, independent thinking and an open exchange of ideas. But USC is criminalizing protest and speech with the Orwellian charge of trespassing. This, for students assembling peacefully on their own university campus.Among protest organizers’ demands are calls for investment “transparency” and divestment from Israel. This will not come any time soon: USC is a private university and is unlikely to reveal its investments. But with the support of the USC community, another of the demands is feasible: full and unconditional amnesty for those who were arrested on Wednesday.Student protesters and the faculty members who demonstrated along with them must not pay for the disastrous, unnecessary decisions of USC administrators to call in police to squelch legitimate protest and the free expression of ideas.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
philinquirer_2024_32,"Waverly B. Woodson Jr. treated 200 casualties on Omaha Beach. Segregation and racism largely prevented him from being honored. On Friday, a street in his old neighborhood is being renamed for him.On the morning of Aug. 24, 1944, The Inquirer ran an article about a hometown hero.The dateline was vague — “Somewhere in France” — but the story was detailed.Army medic Waverly B. Woodson Jr., a 20-year-old Philadelphia native and Lincoln University premed student, had landed in D-Day’s first wave.Severely wounded by German shelling, he “helped bandage and administer plasma and sulfa throughout the day and night, helped evacuate the wounded when the tide came in and continued first aid operations until 4:30 the second afternoon.”The Army would credit him with treating 200 casualties on the deadliest stretch of the invasion beach before nearly collapsing from fatigue and blood loss.A Pittsburgh Courier story about the Overbrook High School graduate ran days later. The headline: “Hero No. 1 of Invasion.”Woodson, one of the few Black soldiers in D-Day’s first wave, may have been a household name in Pennsylvania for a brief time in 1944, but he and his heroism were largely forgotten in the ensuing decades.That changes this week when the city of Philadelphia renames the street where Woodson was born and raised — North 58th Street — “Waverly Woodson Way.”Woodson’s story has touched me personally. I, too, am a Philadelphia native, and I currently serve in First Army, the historic Army unit that led all ground and airborne forces on D-Day. On June 6, 1944, then-Cpl. Woodson’s shoulder bore the same block-A patch I wear on my uniform today.For years, First Army has advocated for proper recognition of Woodson’s remarkable acts. It was announced last month, just a few days before the 80th anniversary of D-Day, thathe would be posthumously upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest medal for bravery.Some of our troops who were in France for commemoration events took the medal that will be presented to his wife, Joann, to Omaha Beach, and laid it on the sands where Woodson saved so many. The valor upgrade will come in Washington later this summer; the street renaming in Philadelphia will occur Friday afternoon.I’ve thought a lot about what I want to say to my fellow citizens of Philadelphia as we honor Woodson. I want to acknowledge that it is long overdue for the Army to award Woodson’s gallantry. In 1944, that didn’t happen due to a perfect storm of realities: an Army segregated by race and riven by racism, the fog of war, lost records, and infighting among his leaders.But I also want to point out that every time we tell Woodson’s story — every time we honor his service and sacrifice — we do our part to correct the injustices he endured on behalf of our great, but sometimes imperfect, nation.Those of us who have had the responsibility of leading America’s sons and daughters in combat know one thing: We who wear the cloth of this nation are just ordinary citizens who love our country enough to do extraordinary things when that country calls. Woodson was an ordinary young man, from an ordinary Philadelphia street, who became extraordinary on a bitter, windswept morning that changed the course of human history.Woodson was undoubtedly shaped by the city in which he was raised — the heart of colonial America where the Founding Fathers penned our most famous declarations to freedom and liberty — as well as a family with a true heart for military service. Even as Waverly fought his way onto Omaha Beach, his younger brother, Eugene, was an officer with the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed all-Black unit of military fighter pilots.Merion Station resident Paul Newman and Philadelphia City Councilmember Curtis Jones Jr. undertook the effort to rename North 58th Street with one simple goal: to inspire a new generation of Americans by drawing attention to the actions of a member of the Greatest Generation. It is my hope that the young men and women who today walk the sidewalks of Waverly Woodson Way will know that they, too, can achieve extraordinary things.In the Army, we often say we stand on the shoulders of giants. Woodson is one of our giants. He died in 2005 and was a First Army soldier eight decades ago, but we still consider him — and his family, many of whom still call Philadelphia home — our responsibility. It is our duty to ensure he is remembered.Our thanks go to the city and people of Philadelphia for helping First Army do just that — and, even more, for raising the ordinary, extraordinary citizens who have fought for this nation from our earliest days, and who fight for us still.Maj. Gen. Timothy Brennan is First Army’s deputy commanding general for support."

philinquirer_2024_49,"A violent coast-to-coast, riot-cop crackdown on campus protests threatens the right for all dissent on the eve of the presidential election.The moral insanity of America’s long war in Vietnam — protested by 1960s kids who were on the right side of history, even if the grown-ups didn’t see it in real time — came to be defined bythe unnamed U.S. majorwho told journalist Peter Arnett after the particularly deadly 1968 battle of Bến Tre that “it became necessary to destroy the town in order to save it.”History doesn’t repeat but it rhymes, gratingly. Asa new generation of young peoplespeaks out against attacks on women and children halfway around the world — this time in Gaza — college administrators fromBostontoL.A.are racing to call in heavily armored riot cops to shut down protest encampments at campusesthey’d sold to applicantsas bastions of academic freedom, open expression, and historic demonstrations that had changed the world.They are destroying the American university in order to keep it “safe.” In a week whendecades happened, the lowest moments in what became a nationwide assault on college free speech bymilitarized policeveered from shock to tragicomical irony.At the University of Texas in Austin, right-wing authoritarian Gov. Greg Abbott ordered a large helmeted brigade of state troopers to march through the heart of his state’s flagship campus and shut down a pro-Palestinian protest that he’dbranded as violent and antisemiticeven before the event had actually started. Prosecutors laterdropped all criminal chargesagainst 57 UT students and others arrested by Abbott’s army, saying the arrests “lacked probable cause.” The riot cops were photographed marching past a UT promotional sign, “What starts here changes the world…”what starts here changes the worldpic.twitter.com/ZV0ojR4vQuStudents at two large Midwestern schools — Indiana and Ohio State Universities — who grew up on active shooter drills were shocked to look up during their campus protests to see what appeared to be trained police snipers aiming long guns at the action. IU officials stayed mum about what seemed to bephotographic proof. In Ohio, where the volley of National Guard shots that killed four students at Kent State University ata May 4, 1970, protest still echoes today, OSU officials called the rooftop officers just spottersbefore admittingthey’d “switched to long-range firearms” at night “once the troopers began using force on the students.”Apparently “using force on the students” wasn’t a problem for them.Some of the most shocking footage came from Atlanta, involving police and the state troopers who in 2023 hadshot and killed a protesteragainst the police training center known to foes as “Cop City.” Multiple videos from Emory University showed a string of violent arrests, including a young Black man who wasshot with a Tasereven though officers had immobilized him on the ground. When an Emory economics professor, Caroline Fohlin, saw a cop violently arresting a student and screamed, “What are you doing?!,” a second officer grabbed her andslammed her hard to the ground,her head against the hard pavement, as she screamed, “I’m a professor.” Fohlin, who was shown on video doing no more than raising her voice, was charged with “battery” against a police officer.One of the most chilling videos from Georgia, ironically, shows no violence at all. In it, Noëlle McAfee, chair of Emory’s philosophy department, stylishly dressed, handbag slung over her shoulder, isled away in handcuffsby a masked officer. She later told a faculty meeting that, like Fohlin, her supposed crime was questioning an officer making a violent arrest of a student.In her regular life as a distinguished academic, McAfee wrote a book,Democracy and the Political Unconscious,which argues that America’s untenable “global war on terror” showed a need to keep reliving the trauma of the 9/11 attacks — a concept that must have crossed her mind as a militarized cop led her away. She turned to a videotaping studentand asked, “Can you call the philosophy department and tell them I’ve been arrested?”I’d kind of like to call the philosophy department myself, in the hope that some beautiful mind there can explain to me how college presidents can morally justify calling armed police officers against their own students to clamp down on free speech, beyond their desperationto stay employed. Or maybe someone in Fohlin’s economics department could pick up the line and do the math for me on why America’s best universities valuetheir biggest donorsover their students’ free expression.The most tumultuous week on U.S. college campuses since May 1970 resulted inat least 600 arrestsat 15 different schools as of Saturday, with more surely on the way. It’s going to take even longer to tally all the students facing suspension and in some cases expulsion for speaking out onthe bloodshed in Gaza, or the now-ruined careers of principled professors who stood between their students and a nightstick.Not to mention the lasting psychological scars for young people who saw their dream college summon cops to arrest them or even fire rubber bullets or canisters of tear gas at them, which would be considered a war crimeif used in Ukrainebut is apparently OK in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s hometown of Atlanta.The notion ofcollege as the American dream— fostering not just upward economic mobility but a nation of informed citizens taught to think critically — has been steadily dying since the originalright-wing backlash against student protestin the 1960s triggered the end of taxpayer support for low tuition, which caused a $1.75 trillion student loan crisis. The maelstrom around the war in the Middle East has given the enemies of higher education — and they are many — a chance to move in for the kill.Their ammunition is the complicated relationship between student protests for Palestinian liberation and against Israel’s current conduct in Gaza, where its more-than-six-month assault has killed at least 33,000 people — the majority of them women and children — and the constant scourge of antisemitism. Even though some advocates lump political criticisms of the state of Israel underan overly broad definition of antisemitism, there’s no question that the despicable harassment and assaults on Jews on or around college campuseshave risensince the Oct. 7 start of the war (as they also havefor Muslims .A few of the claims linking the worst antisemitism to the student protests have been disingenuous, such as whensome journalistscited a nonstudent and well-known antisemite stationed a block from the Columbia University main gate as an example of protester hate speech. At Boston’s Northeastern University,administrators sent in policeSaturday who detained 100 students based on a shout of “Kill all the Jews!” that veteran journalists on the scene said came from a Jewish demonstrator waving an Israeli flag, apparently seeking an escalation.But there has also been some instances of antisemitism that are indeed the fault of pro-Palestinian student protesters. In the most egregious example, an encampment leader at Columbia posted a video in which he said “Zionists don’t deserve to live!”He’s been bannedfrom the Manhattan campus, and rightfully so. Just as it was a relief when the Cornell student who made vile antisemitic threatswas arrested. It shows that the tools to single out and punish the perpetrators exist. So why instead blow up the entire ivory tower in a cloud of tear gas and paranoia?» READ MORE:Fear and loathing on America’s college campuses as free speech is disappearingThe biggest driver is right-wing authoritarianism. Red-state governors like Abbott in Texas or Georgia’s Brian Kemp have watched the new hero of U.S. conservatism, Hungary’s Viktor Orban, makecrushing his homeland’s once freethinking universitiesthe centerpiece of his strongman governance. Now they are importing the strategy. The Gaza protests have given governors and their fellow travelers on Capitol Hill a golden opportunity to squelch the notion of a liberal education while squeezing out a few more tax-cut dollars for their billionaire donors, and creating a nightly Two Minutes Hate of young peopleon Fox Newsthat distracts from the 88 felony counts against their presidential candidate.The hypocrisy is astounding, especially from the likes of Abbott, who actually signed a 2019 law he insisted would protect students’ freedom to speak their mind. “Some colleges are banning free speech on college campuses,”Abbott said five years ago. “Well, no more.” Well, that’s exactly what Abbott and his tin soldiers did last week, even though months earlier the governor was silent when the Texas Republican Partyrejected a ban on associating with Nazi sympathizers.The complexities of never-ending conflict in the Middle East is what allows the cynical Greg Abbotts of America to get away with this. Too many would-be Democratic critics are too wedded to years of deep support for Israel, ignoring that a the right-wing extremismof Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies is not your father’s Israel and b the assault on campus free speech has much deeper implications than the current crisis. Too many college presidents have displayed extreme cowardice, caught in the headlights between Republican bullying andbillionaire donors, who likely fear the protesting students might eventually question the brand of capitalism that made them billionaires.Topping off this perfect storm is a critical failure on the left, which over the last couple of decades has emphasized a particular brand of campus identity politics that didn’t take the free-speech question seriously, despite warnings from folks who remembered how hard students fought in the 1960s and ‘70s to win those rights. The safe-spaces crowd is now seeingthe “safety” issue turned against themat places like the University of Southern California, where administrators’ fear of a Muslim valedictorian led to the cancellation of commencement for 65,000 people.But the biggest problem is the large mass of Americans sitting on the couch and saying absolutely nothing, glued to the nonstop Trump Court TV that cable news has become, watching pundits fret that democracy will die in the November election even as a runaway police state already clamps down in April. Look, the threat ofa Trump 47 dictatorship is real, and last week’s three-hour Supreme Court debate over whether any presidentis above the lawwas riveting, even if in a healthy republic it would have lasted just three minutes. Too many boomer “Trump Resistance” types see the wave of college arrests as a distraction, a sideshow. Trust me, this is the entire ballgame.Ending free speech on college campuses is the leading edge of a bigger war against dissent that could already be lost by Nov. 5, and any contest of the election result that follows. I’m sure Congress and President Joe Biden have some valid concerns about Chinese ownership of TikTok, but I doubt lawmakers would have moved so quickly to threaten a large media platform with extinction were it not for fear thattoo many young people are exposed to ideasthey find dangerous. The chaos on college campusesis already being citedto curb other protests, such as moving demonstrators far away from July’s Republican National Convention so they can’t be heard. Democracy defenders might find the battle to stop a second Jan. 6 coup was lost on the playing fields of Emory.By the time a returned-to-the-White-House Trump makes good onhis vow to send out troopsand tanks to put down any Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration protesters, America might be numb to such images. That’s why the time to speak up for America’s young people and everyone’s right of free speech — to your neighbors, or in church or at the coffee shop, or even at the family dinner table — is today. We can’t trust the job to feckless college presidents who are willing to watch their students get slammed to the ground to save their jobs.

The gun charge was the surest means to assure he became the only presidential offspring in history to be convicted of a felony.The trial on tax evasion charges that will come later this year, while promising more salacious and damaging testimony, are less certain to deliver a guilty verdict, and may ultimately be avoided with a plea deal.The gun case was ironclad, as demonstrated by the jury’s speedy return of its verdict. But it doesn’t change the fact that almost no one else who does what Hunter Biden did has had to face the legal consequences.The president’s son was charged with three violations of federal law for falsifying the form a purchaser must fill out before buying a gun. Hunter Biden failed to disclose his drug addiction, as required, when he bought a handgun from a Delaware dealer in 2018.In 2019, 27 million background checks were done on gun buyers. Of that number, 478 individuals were reported to federal prosecutors for lying on the form. And just 298 faced charges.That puts Hunter Biden in rare company and adds credence to the claims that his prosecution was at least in part politically motivated.But it doesn’t mean he should not have been charged. Just the opposite — the other 180 violators who walked away with not so much as a wrist slap should have been in the courtroom with him.The federal law Hunter Biden violated was championed by his father when he was in the Senate. It was designed to help answer a key concern of those advocating for more responsible gun policies: How to keep firearms out of the hands of those most likely to abuse them.Yet, like so many measures passed in response to cries to “do something” about guns, lax enforcement has rendered the screening form requirement largely useless.In general, gun laws aren’t aggressively enforced. Remember that Anthony McRae, the shooter who killed three students on the Michigan State University campus, was previously arrested on a felony gun charge that would have prevented him from purchasing a firearm. He was allowed to plead down to a misdemeanor.A Republican-backed law pending in Congress called the Prosecuting Gun Crimes Saves Lives Act would prioritize the prosecution of those who illegally purchase guns. It’s gone nowhere for lack of support by Democrats, who keep pushing for more restrictive gun laws that end up being undermined by progressive or lazy prosecutors.On the day his son was convicted, President Joe Biden attended an anti-gun rally calling for even more gun laws. He also, disingenuously, said he respected the legal system that convicted his son. Never mind that his Justice Department tried to orchestrate a sweetheart plea deal that would have spared Hunter Biden from facing any consequences.Hunter Biden may not have been treated the same as others who violated the screening law. But all future violators should be treated the same as Hunter Biden.—The Detroit News/TNSFumie Christine Cabral, 96, of Hilo died Aug. 26 at a private care home in Hilo.

And I was bleeding like a pig, and I won the world title right in front of Donald Trump.”Uh, sure you did.Of course, the truth is that Hogan never really won a world championship of anything, although he was and is a world class big mouth.He was a professional wrestler. His matches were staged, choreographed and the outcome decided in a production meeting, not the ring.They were as rigged as Trump falsely claimed the 2020 election was.Is there such a thing as stolen valor in sports? Maybe there ought to be.Steve Kerr, on the other hand, is the real deal.He’s won nine world titles in a real sport, NBA basketball. That includes five as a player, three with the Chicago Bulls and two as a San Antonio Spur; and four as coach of the Golden State Warriors.His buzzer-beating jump shot to eliminate the Utah Jazz in the 1997 finals remains an NBA classic.Make that 10 world titles, if you count the gold medal the U.S. Olympic team just won with Kerr as coach.And here’s what he said about that:“So the last time I was in a packed basketball arena was in Paris, France, nine days ago. Some of the best players on Earth, 12 incredible American men, came together to win Olympic gold. And the next night, I was back in that same building, watching 12 more of the best players on Earth, our incredible American women, do the same thing.“I cannot think of a better metaphor for what this country is all about than the way Team USA came together at the Olympics. We have players from across our wonderful country, players who have trained and fought relentlessly, shed tears trying to beat one another throughout their careers, joining forces to wear the red, white and blue. When we won, the American flag raised to the rafters, National Anthem playing, gold medals draped around the necks of our players, whose hands were held over their hearts. It was the proudest moment of my life.”He added: “Now, imagine what we could do with all 330 million of us playing on the same team … not as Democrats, not as Republicans, not as Libertarians, but as Americans who know the greatness of this nation doesn’t come from any one of us, but from each of us doing our part to build a more perfect union.”The difference between Hogan and Kerr is obvious. One’s an actor, the other’s a champion.Hulk Hogan brags about titles he never won. Steve Kerr doesn’t have to brag about titles he did win. And he doesn’t need to rip his shirt to show how tough he is.Dion Lefler is opinion editor for the Wichita Eagle.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser."

minnpost_2024_72,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In January, Minnesota’s Public Utilities Commission held ahearingin western Minnesota about a $13.9 million plan for a 28-mile pipeline of methane gas from four local dairies into a nearby natural gas pipeline. Anotherdigesterin western Minnesota captures nearly 700,000 gallons of manure daily from three big dairies to power a digester. Both projects, connected to dairy giant Riverview, receive significant funding from a California climate program. Why does California care about gas from Minnesota’s large dairies?Methane gas derived from huge liquified manure pits at large-scale dairy, beef and hog operations is receiving afloodof state and federal dollars, tax breaks and credits. Capturing methane from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs has been branded as a “renewable” or “low carbon” fuel by many states, the Biden administration and the natural gas industry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has declared biogas a “climate-smart practice,” sendingfederal dollarsto subsidize methane digesters at CAFOs around the country.The most significantsourceof financing for biogas is California’s Low Carbon FuelStandard(LCFS , which provides valuable credits to transportation fuels with a lower greenhouse gas (GHG emissions intensity score than traditional gasoline and diesel. Remarkably, CAFO-derived biogas has a negative emissions intensityscore— lower than ethanol, biodiesel and even electricity generated by solar and wind. How is this possible?When calculating CAFO biogas, California neither counts emissions from the cows (by far the largest source of methane emissions at dairy and beef CAFOs nor emissions from feed production, including the potent GHG nitrous oxide emitted from nitrogen fertilizer used to produce corn. Finally, California doesn’t consider emissions from digestate (manure after methane has been captured that is applied to farm fields as fertilizer, thoughevidencesuggests digestate can emit more GHGs than undigested manure applications.Under California’s LCFS, any biogas project around the country, including those in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, New York and otherstates, are eligible for credits if the captured methane enters into a North American natural gas pipeline.The expansion of CAFO biogas projects raises concerns for rural communities and our farm economy. Because these digester projects are so expensive and require so much manure, they are only practical for the largest CAFOs located close to natural gas pipelines. When the biggest operations generate revenue from dairy, beef or pork and from the methane gas from their manure, they have a major advantage over small and mid-sized operations in sectors where consolidation is already occurring. Minnesota and Wisconsin have lost thousands of dairies over the last decade as bigger CAFOs have flooded the market, with nearly 150 dairy permitslostin Minnesota in 2023.Rural communities are concerned about the growing role that fossil fuel companies play in farm operations. Food & Water Watch reported recently on the many ways oil giants, such as Chevron, BP and Shell, are investing in on-farmbiogasand associated pipelines running through rural communities.The climate benefits of CAFO biogas are questionable. Biogas projects create perverse incentives to produce more manure and thereby more associatedwaterandairpollution. A large CAFO that adds cows also adds methane emissions, whether gas from the manure is captured or not. The expansion of corn acres in Minnesota and other Midwest states, and associated nitrogen fertilizer use, is tied to the expansion of CAFOs, which use corn-based feed and corn ethanol byproducts called dried distillers grains.The carbon accounting from California’s LCFS could weaken Minnesota’s efforts to reach its climate targets. By granting credits, California is buying the GHG benefits from Minnesota projects. To prevent what is known as double-counting, Minnesota could not count those climate benefits toward its own climate targets.Fortunately, California is reassessing its LCFS and how it considers biogas. The state acknowledges that the rapidly growing electric vehicle sector will overtake biogas as a transportation fuel, and credits will need to be phased out. But the phaseout only begins after 2029, with a 10-year grace period to 2040. Thus far, the state has ignored therecommendationsof its own Environmental Justice Advisory Committee calling for the end of CAFO-derived biogas credits.IATP’s comments to Californiacalled for an immediate phaseout of biogas credits, questioning the state’s dubious carbon accounting and consequences for rural communities outside of California.California’s LCFS-favoring CAFO biogas has implications for rural communities in Minnesota and around the country. There are other ways to raise animals (pasture-based systems and manage manure (dried manure systems emit much less . Bad climate policy can create perverse incentives, such as more manure waste and pollution, problems that California has elected to offshore to rural communities around the country.Ben Lillistonis the director of rural strategies and climate change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, which is based in Minneapolis."
eugeneweekly_2024_17,"We ve got issues. The voters for Ward 1 Eugene City Council deserve a campaign based on facts, policy and experience not hyperbolic lies and character assassination. The guest viewpoint “Field of Schemes” signals a level of desperation and fear of the likelihood of success for both my candidacy and the Ems multiuse stadium bond. Mischaracterization of a candidate and personal attacks are an unfortunate toxic aspect of politics, and you need to accept that stepping into the political arena. Certainly, the meanness is consistent with the authors’ previous behaviors towards their neighbors. However, the denigration of my spouse, Stephanie, and delegitimizing elected Jefferson Westside Neighbors neighborhood association volunteers are beyond the pale. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Stephanie is a university professor, textbook author, philanthropist and tireless neighborhood volunteer. She is not merely “his wife.” She is a strong professional woman with her own mind and her own opinions, not an appendage of her husband. As women, the authors should know better. The JWN Executive Board is responding to the egregious lies and misrepresentation of the comprehensive outreach around the Ems Stadium and interactions between Allan Benavides and the JWN. I encourage readers to look at my full list of campaign contributors to get an accurate picture of my support (search ORESTAR and then Ted Coopman , which are overwhelmingly individual neighbors. You can also view my long list of supporters in my ad in the print issue and atTedCoopman.com. Ted M. Coopman is the six-time elected chair of Jefferson Westside Neighbors and a candidate for Eugene City Council, Ward 1. Editor’s Note:Eugene Weekly’s policy is to call people by their first and last names on first reference to show respect, however Ted Coopman clarified Stephanie Coopman was OK with being called by her first name only in his viewpoint. In a May 9Eugene Weeklyguest viewpoint, Heather Marek, Anya Dobrowolski and Christine Beneda presented their reasons for dismissing Ted Coopman as a qualified candidate to represent Ward 1 on Eugene City Council. In so doing they misconstrued the actions of the Jefferson Westside Neighbors Association. We would like to add some additional information to the topics broached by Marek, Dobrowolski and Beneda. Coopman has strong neighborhood support. He has been elected to the JWN board eight times; twice as a board member-at-large and six times as chair, where he has served with distinction in representing the community. The JWN board voted in 2021 to support the athletic facility at the Lane Events Center with the Emeralds as the anchor tenant. Ted Coopman’s 2023 testimony before a state legislative committee was a factual reiteration of the 2021 JWN board position to support the Ems multiuse Stadium at the Fairgrounds if neighborhood concerns could be worked out. The JWN has held six public meetings that included information on the Ems Stadium. Ems representatives and Lane County staff attended these meetings. As with all JWN meetings, everyone — JWN members and the general public — are welcome to attend and ask questions. Neighbors have been kept updated via eNews and mailed newsletters. The “surveys” referenced in the viewpoint reached a tiny fraction of residents and were not impartial, representative or large enough to be statistically valid. JWN volunteers have worked to update historic property surveys and explore the possibility of creating an historic district since fall 2022. As part of a neighborhood- wide fundraising effort, the Emeralds’ general manager, Allan Benavides, offered to match donations up to $1,500. Neighbors’ donations exceeded that match, contributing $2,100 to the project. Under Oregon law, a historic district is prohibited from excluding development of middle housing. Anya Dobrowolski was elected to the JWN Board in 2023, replacing Stephanie Coopman, Ted’s spouse. However, Dobrowolski immediately refused to serve on the board after being elected. Stephanie Coopman remained on the board and was re-elected in 2024. As a chartered Eugene neighborhood association, Jefferson Westside Neighbors does not endorse or promote candidates.

They have served between two and eight years on the board. Upon reading the “Field of Schemes” viewpoint I feel disappointed and saddened by the tone and continued falsehoods directed at myself, the team and the JWN association. Eugene, we’re better than this. Over the past several years, we’ve actively volunteered for community events like the JWN picnic and the Monroe Park Cleanup and contributed a matching grant to fund the JWN Historic District task force, as we have with numerous other nonprofits. We’ve attended countless city council and county commissioners’ meetings to advocate for our cause. Without the broader community’s support, we wouldn’t have come this far; it’s the countless emails flooding elected officials’ inboxes with expressions of support that have kept this project alive. This proposed $15 million bond is one of the city’s smallest, averaging just $22 annually for property owners. In return, we’ll have a beautiful new facility capable of hosting graduations, concerts, high school baseball games and, of course,EmeraldsSportsball.comevents.

During the pandemic, while other sports teams closed doors, the Elmores funded us and urged us to assist those in need.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_99,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It is infuriating as well as alarming that the U.S. Senate on Wednesday failed to pass the Right to Contraception Act, a straightforward bill that would guarantee a federal right to safe and legal contraception.The bill needed 60 votes to proceed but only received five, all but two of those coming from Democrats and independents who caucus with Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., a staunch supporter of the bill, changed his vote to a “no” so as to allow him to bring up the bill again.Americans should be appalled that nearly half of the people elected to represent them in the Senate are so spineless they couldn’t vote for something as simple as a right to contraception, which 90% of women have used at one point in their lives and is considered basic preventive healthcare.Only two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted for it. Good for them. Their Republican colleagues, on the other hand, blustered variously about the bill being a political move, too broad or unnecessary.That’s ridiculous. There’s clearly a movement among antiabortion activists to wrongly redefine contraceptives as abortifacients. And any of their constituents should think long and hard about voting for a senator who won’t support their right to contraception. If it were enshrined into federal law, states couldn’t override it with restrictions. If the Supreme Court struck down its own precedents protecting the right to contraception, the federal law would still protect it.And that is not out of the question. The Supreme Court has voted three times to support the right to contraception over the decades, but does anyone want to bet on the justices upholding this precedent? The court also guaranteed a right to abortion in Roe v. Wade — and upheld it in a subsequent case— before overturning it in the Dobbs decision two years ago.Ominously, that abortion decision also contained a concurrence written by Justice Clarence Thomas that suggested the court revisit the landmark 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which granted married couples the right to birth control. So there are plenty of reasons to fear that the Supreme Court could withdraw its support for birth control.The Senate contraception bill does not force anyone to provide contraception. It allows women to access it and health care professionals to provide it. Nor is this bill a slippery slope to condoning abortion, as opponents claim.Contraceptives are not abortifacients. “The medical definition of pregnancy is an embryo implanted in the wall of the uterus,” says Daniel Grossman, a professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at UC San Francisco. “No contraceptives end an established pregnancy — they prevent pregnancy from occurring.”So why would Senate Republicans block a bill supporting a right to contraception? Aren’t these the same people who, for the most part, don’t want women having abortions? How do they think reproduction works? Or is this about taking away the rights of women to control their own bodies to curry favor with far right antiabortion groups who have problems with contraception as well?We should all work to make sure legislators who don’t support the right to control your own body don’t get reelected.—Los Angeles Times/TNSRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.A 22-year-old Hilo man accused of a series of violent assaults on his 23-year-old girlfriend has been released from custody by a judge without posting cash bail.BOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_229,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Raise your hand if you knew that Congress is debating a bill this summer that could slow the pace of climate change, produce cleaner drinking water, restore habitat for endangered wildlife and improve the American diet. No?It’s the farm bill, the massive food and agriculture policy vehicle that Congress updates every five years (in theory , and, frankly, most people don’t follow it closely. The sprawling legislation is simultaneously so parochial and so complicated that even most lawmakers just leave it up to the experts. That’s a shame, because this year Washington has a chance to update the farm bill in a way that takes steps toward healthier diets and a healthier planet.When Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid the foundations of modern farm policy in the 1930s, rural America was in crisis: The Dust Bowl had blown away thousands of farms and commodity prices had collapsed. Federal intervention did a lot of good for destitute farmers and the nation generally.But today the nation has different challenges: climate change, polluted waters, devastating floods, endangered birds and pollinators. Since farmers control what happens on millions of acres of land across the middle of the continent, they’re in a position to address these challenges — and Congress is in a position to give them the right incentives.Consider soil and water conservation. In 1985, Congress created a landmark project called the Conservation Reserve Program which paid farmers to take vulnerable acres out of production and plant them with grasses and trees. It was an astonishing success — soil erosion plummeted, wildlife rebounded.But farmers always chafed at the idea of getting paid for idling land — and some taxpayers did too. Then came a brilliant idea: Pay farmers for conservation practices on working land, using tillage practices such as cover crops and no-till cultivation.These have proven benefits in reducing soil erosion, keeping farm chemicals out of lakes and streams and cutting farmers’ use of diesel fuel and petroleum-based fertilizers that contribute to climate change. The core elements, the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, are so popular that farmers are applying at three times the rate of available funding in states like Minnesota. At the very least, this year’s farm bill should give CSP and EQIP a funding boost.Then there’s crop insurance, now by far the largest safety net in the federal farm bill. Crop insurance is probably still a good idea, since farmers are as vulnerable as ever to extreme weather and volatile commodity prices. But the current system has the effect of tying farmers to a few favored crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat, while rewarding over-planting and overproduction. Congress should tighten up the program’s conservation compliance enforcement and adjust the rules so it’s easier for farmers to plant a diverse, healthy mix of crops such as oats, barley and alfalfa and even fruits and vegetables.It should also build on an innovative program called Whole Farm Revenue Protection, which gives farmers — especially young, innovative farmers — more freedom to plant what they want. And since public subsidies cover about 60% of the cost of crop insurance, why not use those subsidies to achieve public benefits? Give farmers premium discounts if they adopt proven practices that reduce erosion, improve wildlife habitat, sequester carbon and reduce polluted field runoff.In 2022, with the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration introduced an idea called “climate-smart agriculture,” that directed billions of dollars into the underfunded conservation programs. A key struggle on Capitol Hill heading into the fall is that the House farm bill would redirect much of that money to conventional farm supports, a very bad idea, while the Senate bill would protect the climate-smart approach.If all this seems like an environmental wish list that urban liberals want to impose on hardworking farmers, that’s not true. Innovative and influential farmer-led groups such as Practical Farmers of Iowa and Minnesota’s Land Stewardship Project have championed crop diversity and conservation farming for years.With hundreds of farmer members, they have demonstrated that conservation practices help the land and make farms more climate resilient. “Farmers don’t all agree on climate change politics, but they do agree that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more severe,” Minnesota Farmers Union President Gary Wertish told an editorial writer. “We’re interested in things we can do to address that, while also helping cash-flow our farms.”Apart from conservation, Congress should also take steps this year to address the extraordinary concentration of today’s food industry. Farming has always been an uneven playing field, with thousands of small individual producers going up against big railroads, big banks and big grain companies. It has only gotten worse in recent decades: Today a handful of global corporations control the production of seeds and farm chemicals and a handful of grain and food companies control the markets for a farmer’s crops.As antitrust expert Austin Frerick pointed out in his excellent book, “Barons,” this has the effect of perpetuating a food system built on chemical-intensive corn and soybeans and highly processed consumer foods. The Minnesota Farmers Union has proposed stronger enforcement of federal antitrust law so that farmers have more flexibility and receive a bigger share of the nation’s food dollar — and Congress should listen.The historian Geoff Cunfer has observed that, over the centuries, agriculture is the single biggest interaction that humans have with the natural world — and by extension, the biggest opportunity to heal some of the wounds that humans have wrought on the planet. “The farm bill has a bigger impact on our landscape in the Midwest than any other government program, by far,” Brian DeVore of the Land Stewardship Project told an editorial writer. “It could be such a force for good.”— Star TribuneEmmress Ann Harpole, 75, of Hilo died July 29 at home.

Sometimes it’s just a small slight, and other times it becomes a symbol for something much larger.Last week, I was informed that the Hinckley-Finlayson School Superintendent and the legal advisers of their school board suggested that a five-minute Ojibwe travel song should be banned from the graduation ceremony on Friday night, May 24. The song was played last year without any problem. This year there are 21 Native American students graduating, about a third of the class, and they’ve worked hard to reach this important milestone. They overcame obstacles and defied the statistics that often weigh against Native American students. This travel song isn’t just music; it’s a salute to their grit and success. It’s a way for us to acknowledge their journey, and it helps us heal old wounds and look ahead with hope.But the school board decided to eliminate this part of the program, claiming the song might breach the 1st Amendment’sestablishment clause. While we have told them the song is not religious, they think it violates the separation of church and state. They also feared that if they let our students play their song, it’d open the floodgates for other groups to demand the same. So, the board voted unanimously to ban it. The students began a peaceful protest and I sent a letter to the School Board asking them to reconsider — all to no avail.This matter went viral on social media. Now, Native Americans and others from near and far want to come to Hinckley to support our students on Friday night. The Mille Lacs Band has a great relationship with the Pine County Sheriff’s Office. Our tribal police department is teaming up with the county to manage the gathering. In order to ensure a peaceful and respectful demonstration before the graduation, the school provided space at one of its parking lots and we are grateful for that. However, the school will not reconsider its decision on including the song at the end of the graduation ceremony.For 500-plus years, our customs and traditions were misunderstood and outlawed by non-Indian governments. A lot of that changed with the federal government starting in the 1970s and more recently with the administration of Gov. Tim Walz here in Minnesota. Walz signed a law that requires state employees to learn about tribal history and governance and for state agencies to consult with tribes on a regular basis. We need to broaden this education to all decision-makers. In this case, it’s about teaching educators and school administrators that tribal history and culture in Minnesota is a shared history and should be embraced and respected.Melanie Benjamin is the chief executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe."

If you don’t know what that means, look up the sound byte and put JD Vance’s face on it.Fuck these guys. The destruction of their family structure had nothing to do with the ease of divorce, but probably everything to do with the guys they revere and call, “dad.”Apparently there is a growing group of — wait for it — Republican men who want to make getting a divorce harder. You guessed it, Vance and Johnson are singing that tired, childhood trauma dirge loud and clear instead of seeking therapy.It’s this kind of projection that too many men, particularly white Republican men get trapped in.Never has it been more obvious that Republicans have jumped the shark past Reagan than right now. The twice-married Reagan signed the first no-fault divorce bill into law as Governor of California in 1969.And to make this bid to snare women into tragic unhappiness and baby production more ridiculous, they want the thrice-married, multi-extramarital-affairs cad Trump as their leader.We are living in very stupid times, people.My question to Republican voters is, what do you really stand for? Don’t say “American values” because what does that mean? If it’s about the American family, who is the blueprint because it can’t be Trump, can it?If it’s about fiscal conservatism, how do you explain tax dollars funding silly fights like abortion that keeps tax dollars funneling into legal fights when it would be cheaper to fund healthcare without limits.It can’t be about religion because most of these folks talk a lot about God but do the very opposite of the teachings.So please tell me? What is it?Here’s my guess. You don’t even know yourself, and I know why.Have you heard of the game Three Card Monte? It’s a game where cards or a ball under a cup gets shuffled around while you try to guess where your card or the ball is.That’s the Republican platform.Modern Republicans have no actual intention of helping American people or families, but they will shuffle the cards of manufactured rage and get you all angry about abortion, immigration, or family values but never actually tell you what those are.You’re never going to guess where the ball is.Remember when being a Republican meant something?It wasn’t a party for whiners but people who actually stood for something identifiable. Reagan did it. George Bush, Sr. did it but somewhere the messaging got lost in the foolery.It’s been a long time coming. Nixon got it started when he hopped in the cesspool of theSouthern Strategyand Reagan sealed it when he cupped the fuzzy balls ofevangelical ministers.Now the Republican party is every bit as stupid as predicted, maybe more. I don’t think most folks who identify with that “R” want to be perceived that way though.To be fair, and with some bit of compassion, I get why these folks are hanging on to this mess of a party. It isn’t about any of those values, immigration, or abortions.It’s about the past and sadly, it’s a past that won’t ever return and the people who should be speaking for them are zealots with attention deficits and mommy/daddy issues.But what about “our guns.”It’s the ball again, sorry folks. It’s bait to keep you strung out on this stupid carnival ride. I’m definitely not trying to convince you to become a Democrat, that’s another fucking mess in itself but I would like to urge you to think bigger than what you’re being fed by these people.Think past them. What is the America you want? Write it down. Does your dream match theirs?Do they even tell you what they want and how they will actually get you there?If it s a series of rage bombs, I’m just going to say to you, that’s a big ass red flag and this relationship is a doom spiral.If this is a story about divorce — it is and it isn’t — America needs to divorce Republicans.BTW, Vance and Johnson, here s a tune by a woman to heal your hurt little man souls.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_100,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°On May 21, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, in Hamburg, Germany, ruled that greenhouse gases are marine pollutants and nations must take action to “reduce, control and prevent” their effects. The tribunal, sometimes called the Oceans Court, was responding to a request from a consortium of small island nations disappearing under rising seas.The United States is not one of the 169 parties to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, but it abides by its principles. And while the tribunal’s unanimous ruling is not legally binding, it will influence national and global court cases now being brought against the fossil fuel industry and its well-funded resistance to a carbon-free, renewable energy future.Donald Trump offered himself up to that resistance in April when he solicited a billion-dollar donation from oil executives by promising, if reelected, to reverse President Joe Biden’s clean energy rules. Big Oil could certainly afford the bribe. One billion dollars represents about 1% of the profits raked in by ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP combined last year under Biden’s moderate climate policies.Which is why the tribunal’s ruling may not be enough to halt or even slow the ocean’s approach to a literal boiling point.Climate impacts are overwhelming all other marine environmental insults, including industrial overfishing and oil, chemical and plastic pollution. Compounding the danger, unsound floodplain development is destroying coastal habitat in such places as Jakarta, Indonesia; Lagos, Nigeria; Houston; and Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis recently signed legislation banning any reference to climate change by state agencies.Scientific reviews have found that the duration of marine heat waves has increased more than 50% since 1925. By 2014, 50% of the ocean was affected, and last year, more than 90% of the ocean hit internal heat wave temperatures, including one day when the temperature of the waters off the Florida Keys measured 101 degrees. The average global ocean surface temperature hit a record of nearly 70 degrees Fahrenheit one day last year, the highest ever recorded, and a stark contrast to the 61 degrees average throughout the 20th century.That should be no surprise given that 90% of the heat generated by the burning of fossil fuels — along with about a third of the carbon dioxide — has been absorbed by the ocean. The carbon dioxide, buffered into carbonic acid, increases acidity in ocean water, which is bad news for corals, clams and other shell-forming creatures. Also, a warmer, more acidic ocean contains less dissolved oxygen, expanding hundreds of “dead zones” in coastal waters, as tracked by the United Nations.Not worried yet? In 1997-98 I reported on the first-ever global coral bleaching event, caused by too-warm water and affecting 16% of all coral reefs. In April, scientists reported the fourth and largest global bleaching to date, now affecting more than 54% of the world’s coral reefs and growing by 1% a week.Coral bleaching is similar to but more extensive than the kelp forest die-off along the coasts of South Australia and California. Ninety-five percent of Northern California’s kelp forest has been displaced by sea urchin “barrens” since the West Coast’s marine heat wave in 2014, ’15 and ’16, when water temperature averaged 7 degrees above normal. A study done by Oregon State University found that with the destruction of the kelp forests, migrating gray whales are losing weight and energy because kelp helps generate the phytoplankton the whales feed on.Even if most ocean climate impacts remain out of sight and, therefore, out of mind, I’ve met too many people directly affected by these changes — fishermen, surfers, coastal homeowners, beach town shopkeepers — not to wonder why the Law of the Sea Tribunal’s ruling wasn’t major news around our blue planet. Likewise, why isn’t climate change, which is causing warmer, wetter, more extreme weather in nation after nation, a major issue in the 2024 U.S. election?The tribunal’s ruling could cool the oceans, if only there were a way or the will to enforce it.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

Their popularity and efficacy have sparked a prescription-writing frenzy in recent years, leaving both medications on the Food and Drug Administration’s drug shortage list since May 2023.But even when the supply rebounds, access to these drugs will remain out of reach for the majority of Americans. That’s because brand-name versions of the drugs range from $11,000 to $16,000 a year, prices that are unaffordable for most people.Attempts to control prices through legislation face significant hurdles, both in the divided halls of Congress and in the courts, where determined legal challengers await.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, hopes that applying pressure at upcoming hearings will force Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, to lower prices voluntarily. History shows that pharmaceutical companies rarely bend on prices, even in the face of public scrutiny.Fortunately, Congress can implement a straightforward solution to make these drugs affordable, thereby improving the nation’s financial and physical health.Before explaining that strategy, here’s why our nation needs effective, affordable and available weight-loss medication.• • •Framing the obesity epidemic:Around 42% of American adults are obese, putting them at dramatically elevated risk for a host of complications: diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, leg amputation, cancer and severe musculoskeletal problems.The economic impact of obesity is staggering, with related health care costs estimated to be $260 billion annually.For decades, health experts have pleaded with Americans to exercise more, eat better, and make lifestyle improvements while urging lawmakers to regulate food and address the “social determinants of health” that lead to excess weight gain. Currently, billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on government-run nutrition and exercise campaigns — on top of the $190 billion Americans spend on weight loss products, programs and supplements.Despite these extensive efforts and expenditures, obesity rates continue to climb, as do the associated consequences, contributing to as many as 500,000 preventable deaths every year.• • •The outsized promise of GLP-1 drugs:Studies show that all GLP-1 drugs lead to major weight loss, averaging 15% of a user’s body mass. And when obese individuals combine regular exercise with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, they shed an average of 34 pounds.Beyond weight loss, GLP-1 medications have been shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular events, prevent kidney failure and potentially improve cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s.Despite all the known and potential benefits, the high price of weight-loss medications forces insurers and employer health plans to limit coverage, leaving many patients without access to these beneficial solutions.• • •The current financial burden:The cost of providing 100% of obese Americans with GLP-1 medications would surpass $1 trillion a year, even with drug rebates. For perspective, that’s more than twice what Americans spend on all prescription drugs annually. Moreover, that figure dwarfs the $260 billion in projected savings if obesity were eradicated.And because patients who stop taking the medication regain an average of two-thirds of the weight they’ve lost, that trillion-dollar annual cost would persist indefinitely. From the vantage of the U.S. health care system, this ongoing expense (an estimated 25% annual bump in total health care spending would strain funding for other vital components of care, including hospitals and clinicians. It would also drive insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs through the roof.A recent report from Sanders’ office highlighted the stark disparity in global pricing for GLP-1 medications: Americans pay over $1,300 for a 28-day supply of Wegovy while patients pay far less in countries like Denmark ($186 , Germany ($137 and the United Kingdom ($92 .This is because nearly all national governments, except for the United States, negotiate the price of prescription medications, rather than allowing drug companies to charge whatever they deem best for their shareholders.• • •The hidden truth:Contrary to what people might assume, these drugs are not expensive to make. A team of Yale and Harvard scientists determined that semaglutide can be manufactured for less than $5 per month.In May 2024, telehealth company Hims &Hers began selling a compounded (pharmacist created version of the GLP-1 drug semaglutide for $199 per month, about 85% less than the brand names Wegovy and Ozempic.This reflects a profitable, but more appropriate, price point.Hims &Hers can sell its version of these patented weight-loss drugs because Congress has authorized the compounding and sale of a patented drug when there is an FDA-determined drug shortage. However, once the GLP-1 shortage is resolved, companies like Hims &Hers will be required to cease production.This will compromise the health of current users and price out many more Americans still struggling to lose weight.• • •A creative solution for the FDA and Congress:Congress can make these lifesaving weight loss medications affordable for all eligible Americans by expanding the FDA’s definition of “drug shortage.” Whereas “shortage” currently refers only to inadequate supply, a more modern definition would include medications that are unaffordable and therefore inaccessible to millions of people.By amending the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this expanded definition would allow compounded versions to remain available at a reasonable price, even when weight-loss drug manufacturers increase production.The reason drug manufacturers price GLP-1s at $10,000 to $16,000 a year has little to do with research and development, overhead, or manufacturing costs. The reason is simple: greed.Such pricing strategies might be tolerable in other industries, but when the health of tens of millions of Americans is at risk, Congress has an obligation to act.Expanding the definition of “shortage” would break the monopolistic hold of current manufacturers, improve public health, save lives and incentivize GLP-1 manufacturers to reduce prices.

minnpost_2024_25,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In some ways, our experiences have been worlds apart. While Ubah grew up in the midst of a civil war in Somalia, Katherine was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But when we met in 2022, we saw immediately how our lives intersect. Now, as both friends and colleagues, we organize renters across race and ethnicity, language and income, bridging multicultural relationships that make our communities stronger.But that strength and solidarity is threatened by outdated state laws that allow landlords and developers to undermine organizing efforts, unjustly evict tenants and discriminate against Minnesotans because of where they come from or how they pay their rent.Thanks to tenants raising our voices, housing is a top priority at the state Legislature again this year. But while there’s broad consensus around more housing production, we can’t solve the ongoing crisis without more rights for renters. We can’t let supply overshadow the urgent need to balance the scales between landlords and renters so we have the fundamental right to choose where we live, stay where we are and come together as neighbors to make sure our housing is safe, dignified and reliable.In recent years, residential leases have become longer and more complex, shifting more and more rights and protections to the landlords who profit rather than the tenants who pay. In fact, analysis byHOME Lineof a standard 52-page lease found that fully 52% of the clauses are in the interests of landlords while only 6% are in the interests of tenants.It’s time to rebalance the scales and bring Minnesota in line with the rest of the nation by ensuring that key measures like right to organize, just cause eviction protections and reforms to tenant-landlord law get passed this session.We both know what it’s like to be renters in a market where landlords and developers — even those with government subsidies — continue to push rents far beyond what our families can afford. We know what it’s like to have a Section 8 voucher that, in theory, provides much-needed rental assistance but, in practice, is nearly useless because no landlords will accept it. And we know what it’s like to worry we will be unjustly penalized or even evicted from our homes because we want to make our living spaces better for all our neighbors.Over the past two years, we’ve worked together organizing with tenants across the metro, particularly in properties owned by developers who benefit from tax credits intended to keep rents affordable. While their leases have ballooned to more than 70 pages, the tenants we work with are being squeezed by rent increases, endangered by lack of timely maintenance repairs and exploited by massive overcharges on utility bill collections.Too often, when renters raise issues individually they are rebuffed — or worse — by property managers and, understandably, feel isolated and demoralized. By connecting across language and culture, we’ve cultivated a sense of hope and community among English and Somali speakers, forming the Minnesota Tenants’ Coalition, which includes residents from 17 different buildings across the state. But the corporation that owns these properties has responded with increased restrictions on our freedoms.In multiple buildings, where we and fellow tenants posted flyers and knocked on the doors of our neighbors to let them know about meetings, our tenant associations flourished, with as many as 70 people attending monthly meetings. Together, we identified shared concerns and approached management with a sense of collective power. But the management immediately cracked down, restricting promotion of the meetings to a single flyer in the corner of the mail room — and penalizing tenant leaders with “strikes” on their record that could lead to eviction with a single additional act of unsanctioned outreach.That type of intimidation is why we need a statewide right to organize policy that would ensure renters don’t have to fear retaliation from their landlords for connecting with their neighbors and elevating common concerns.Minnesota lawmakers should be proud of the progress they made last year, making sweeping changes to tenant-landlord law. But it isn’t enough. Now is the time to pass policies that rebalance the scales of power for renters like us — and the tenants we organize with every day.Katherine Banbury and Ubah Shire are renters in the Twin Cities and organizers with HOME Line, which is a member of the Equity in Place coalition."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_37,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The opportunity to see fascinating species thriving in their natural environments draws many of us to national parks, waterways and wildlife refuges every year. Almost as alluring is the appeal of getting the perfect picture that captures an animal’s beauty, ingenuity or charisma. But our Instagram aspirations must not be achieved at animals’ expense. Experts agree that the best way to protect and respect wildlife is to put our binoculars and zoom lenses to good use by giving these animals plenty of room to roam. We’re visiting their home, after all —and we must respect them and their space.Most species of wildlife have a healthy fear of humans and will flee, hide or stop engaging in natural behavior if they feel stressed or threatened. Get too close and you’ll not only ruin the photo op but also jeopardize their safety and well-being. Staying far away (and, ideally, out of sight is more likely to result in an exciting glimpse into how these animals communicate, navigate, work, play, show affection and more.It’s also required by law. The National Park Service reminds visitors, “It’s illegal to feed, touch, tease, frighten or intentionally disturb wildlife.” The agency recommends that wildlife watchers stay at least 25 yards away from the animals. Some parks require at least a 50-yard buffer. And that number increases to 100 yards for larger predators, such as bears and wolves.Attempting to interact with wild species hinders them from eating and drinking, finding or building shelters, resting, mating and doing all the things they must do in order to survive. Germs from humans can sicken wildlife, and these animals have been injured and even killed by handling, which also puts humans at risk of being bitten or attacked.Recently, a group of people in Asheville, North Carolina, pulled two baby bears out of a tree so that they could pose for photos with them. The terrified cubs managed to escape after one of them bit someone in the group. Wildlife biologists found one of the babies cold, wet and suffering in a retention pond. That cub was taken to a rehabilitation center, and authorities said they could only hope that the other one was able to reunite with their mother, as the cubs were too young to survive on their own.A dolphin who became stranded on the Texas Gulf Coast’s Quintana Beach died after beachgoers reportedly surrounded, harassed and tried to ride her. In North Macedonia, a swan died after a tourist dragged her from a lake to take pictures with her.And those are only a handful of the reported incidents.Equally as important as respecting wildlife’s space is properly storing and disposing of food and garbage. It’s vital to avoid unintentionally feeding wildlife and allowing them to become attracted to human food — what the National Park Service calls “food conditioning.” Animals who learn to seek out human food frequently suffer from malnutrition caused by an improper diet, which can result in illness and early death.When booking a guided wildlife tour in the U.S. or abroad, research tour operators ahead of time to ensure that your provider only engages in safe, humane viewing. Ethical companies maintain sufficient distance from animals, visit during specific times of the day to minimize stress to them, and never harass or encourage people to hold or feed them."

Gloating Trump haters should ask themselves whether New York City would have spent time and treasure pursuing these 9-year-old charges against any other human being on the planet. Or whether prosecutors would have moved forward against Trump was he not running for the Oval Office. The answers are obvious.What’s next is anybody’s guess. Trump will appeal — and likely has a reasonable chance of prevailing, given the way this prosecution was constructed and the case unfolded. Falsifying business records is a misdemeanor in New York, but District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued that the offenses occurred as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 presidential election. Voila! The misdemeanors became felonies even though Mr. Trump was never charged with any election-related offenses. If that makes sense, congratulations, you’re a law school graduate.The felony charges carry no mandatory sentence. Will the audacious Bragg push his luck and demand prison time? Would the judge agree to jail a 77-year-old, first-time offender with no criminal record? How far are they willing to go for a victimless offense beefed up by an election statute that, observers say, has never before been enforced? Sentencing is set for July 11, four days before the Republican National Convention.Trump has so far retained his support despite the barrage of legal boulders that Democratic prosecutors have rolled his way. His loyal base remains strong. But the former president — along with Republican Senate and congressional candidates — would surely rather be campaigning without having to address the political realities of last week’s verdict. In a close election involving a handful of swing states, Trump can’t afford to lose any potential support. Previous surveys have shown that a small number of independent or undecided voters might be less likely to back the GOP standard-bearer if he were found guilty of any crimes.Even if Trump were to have his convictions overturned on appeal, that might come too late to mitigate the potential damage, which may reach down the ballot once Democrats begin pounding the airwaves with freshly minted attack ads. Expect to hear the word “felon” ad nauseam between now and November. Every Republican candidate — from school board to Congress — had best prep for a constant stream of “gotcha” inquiries.The convictions will make an already vicious and contentious election even more so, further riling activists and creating deeper fissures. Talk on the right of exacting “revenge” is unhelpful and dangerous. Ultimately, it will be up to the American people to decide in November whether the legal offensive against Trump represents the legitimate pursuit of justice or an unprecedented partisan crusade to cripple an opposition candidate.—Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNSIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

minnpost_2024_33,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.For many Americans, the dominant narrative in government today is one of gridlock and hyper-polarization. Congress is in the middle of one of theleast productivelegislative sessions in decades. An endless budget brawl kept the country teetering on the brink of a government shutdown for months.But hidden beneath the partisan bickering, there is another story that most Americans don’t know. Without much attention, bipartisan elected leaders and career civil servants from Minnesota to Washington, D.C. have been quietly transforming how governments invest taxpayer dollars to achieve better results.A recentreportwritten by Dr. Christina Ciocca Eller of Harvard University showcases the progress the federal government has made over the last decade in focusing on what works. In 2013, the federal government had just one evidence clearinghouse – focused on education – that contained a few hundred evidence-based programs. Now, when making decisions, policymakers can consult more than 10 federal evidence clearinghouses featuring over 20,000 effective programs and interventions that can help improve outcomes for children, families and communities.As government leaders learn more about what works, it is changing how they spend taxpayer dollars. At the federal level, there has been a30-fold increasein grant dollars invested in programs backed by evidence of effectiveness since 2013. This meansmore fundingfor programs like the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which studies show leads to better health outcomes for both babies and moms. In Minnesota,more than 7,000families are benefiting from these home visits from nurses and social workers.Federal leaders are increasingly incentivizing state, local and tribal governments to use evidence to make better investments. In 2021, Minnesota used federal American Rescue Plan funding that encouraged evaluation to test whether grants to child care providers could alleviate worker shortages. The state found that thegrants helped. Childcare providers that received the grants were more likely to increase wages for their workers and remain open. Based on this evidence, in May, Minnesota created a permanent,state-funded grant programto support the child care industry and child care workers. The state has allocated $316 million for the first two years of the program and $136 million annually thereafter.When faced with tough challenges, federal and state leaders can quickly turn to evidence-based policies. During the pandemic, lawmakers expanded the evidence-based Child Tax Credit and kept over3.7 millionchildren out of poverty. After letting the expanded tax credit lapse, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are now seeking to broaden it. With such clear benefits for children, Minnesota isn’t waiting for Congress. It is offering astate-funded refundable child tax credit, which could benefit over300,000 familiesand reduce child poverty in Minnesota by one-third.In many ways, Minnesota is a model for federal lawmakers in how to invest based on what works. Thanks to bipartisan support, since 2015 the state’s central budget office has maintained an inventory of hundreds of publicly funded programs and services, which rates howeffectivethey are based on rigorous evidence. Last year, Minnesota was one of just two states, along with Tennessee, toinvestmore than $1 billion each in evidence-based human and social services. Yet even more could be done. A recent study found that only6% of Minnesota’s grant dollarsfor human services were spent on evidence-based practices. State leaders can improve this by requiring that evidence be used in grantmaking or rewarding grant applicants who propose programs backed by results.At the federal level, interviews and surveys with dozens of evidence and data leaderssuggestthat insufficient funding for evaluation, inadequate data sharing and other constraints are holding back progress. Similarly, asurveyof state policymakers, led by researchers from the University of Minnesota, found that a lack of time for rigorous evaluations (59% , limited resources (46% and fragmented decision-making by government leaders (46% are slowing state-level efforts to invest in the most effective programs and policies.Federal and state leaders should act to strengthen the movement to invest in what works by prioritizing the useof evidence in legislation, budgets, grants and more. It’s not enough to know what works; policymakers also must steer money to those programs.The scope and magnitude of the challenges facing our country demand solutions that work. By focusing on results, federal and state leaders can improve lives and begin to rebuild the public’s trust in government.Michele Jolin is the CEO and co-founder of Results for America, a national nonprofit organization that helps leaders at all levels of government use evidence and data to deliver better results."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_287,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°President Joe Biden is reportedly pondering support for a legislative package that would enact ethics rules with the force of law on the Supreme Court, as well as some sort of term limits.He should throw his weight behind such a proposal, which would be broadly popular with the American public and take aim at an out-of-control top court. Congress should pass it on the basis of self-preservation alone; the justices lately have seemed all too happy to take over increasing shares of the other branches’ powers.The need for such policies was already apparent two-and-a-half years ago, when a bipartisan presidential commission explored them in a 300-page report meant to be advisory. It has only become far more apparent as the Supreme Court has worked to reshape American policy and jurisprudence to its often right-wing whims.In the past few years the court has thrown out the right to abortion; tossed century-old gun restrictions because they did not sufficiently jibe with perceived historical norms, while upholding an ahistorical opening of the campaign finance spigot; signed off on politically-motivated gerrymandering; whittled down almost all consequences for public corruption; vested itself with the power to determine how administrative agency experts should interpret their mandates; and declared the president a king, immune from prosecution for a huge array of “official acts.”If a lot of this sounds geared towards anti-democratic governance and public corruption, that’s because the court is not only on board but has several justices directly benefiting. Sam Alito and Clarence Thomas both personally received undisclosed gifts from wealthy benefactors, with Thomas raking in millions while he just so happens to rule along patrons’ ideological preferences, and failing to recuse from cases involving 2020 attempted election theft, in which his wife had a direct hand.The process by which the conservative majority was created in the first place went against historical norms, twice. Senate Republicans refused to adhere to their constitutionally-mandated role in considering Merrick Garland’s nomination after the February 2016 death of Antonin Scalia, arguing that it was too close to the November election. Four years later, these Republicans sped through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett after Trump nominated her less than two months before that year’s election.Neither was the normal process of how Supreme Court nominations were intended to work, and the upshot is that the right wing has given itself a largely bulletproof majority, even if the court occasionally fails to support its more extreme efforts.This doesn’t mean that Democrats should get into a court-packing arms race with Republicans, but some basic moves to have the other branches reassert their own authority and sap some of the dizzying power we’ve placed into this small handful of people is more than appropriate.At the very least, term limits could prevent these nakedly political mad scrambles to replace justices while one party holds the presidency or the Senate. And if we expect all of our elected officials to be bound by some standards of ethics and propriety, there’s sub-zero reason not to expect the same from some unelected ones, among the most powerful in the nation.— New York Daily NewsWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."

Using very conservative estimates, if each flight was booked on average with 64 people, and the average cost of a ticket was $290, the lost direct revenue on these days totaled more than $180 million.Given that some of these people had to cancel hotel rooms and car rentals, and perhaps even miss cruises, the secondary effects of the outage in the hospitality industry alone are likely many times more than this.In some areas, 911 services were unreachable, which meant that emergency calls for heart attacks and accidents went unanswered. Some of these missed calls may have resulted in deaths, for which no financial value can be placed.Numerous large hospital systems around the nation were also affected, forcing nonemergency procedures and office appointments to be canceled or delayed.Such a massive disruption has not gone unnoticed. The House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection requested a meeting with Crowdstrike CEO George Kurtz.The question now being asked is: Who will pay for all these delays, cancellations and consequences?The first group affected is investors on Wall Street, where more than $10 billion of value was trimmed from Crowdstrike’s market capitalization through July 22. How long it will take for Crowdstrike’s shares to recoup such losses remains to be seen.The irony of the situation is that Crowdstrike software is designed to protect computers against viruses and malicious software. Yet the current outages did harm that rivals what a computer virus or malicious software could have unleashed. Using a war metaphor, what happened with Crowdstrike was akin to friendly fire.The one saving grace from this event is that the fix to the problem file was not complicated, taking less than 80 minutes to identify and implement. However, damage had already been done to the 8.5 million computers affected, with some requiring manual deletion of the problem file and reboot.Does this make Crowdstrike liable for all such work and efforts and the associated downstream damages?Every software product that is available carries with it terms and conditions that limit its liability to the user in the events of any type of malfunction or disruption. In essence, users agree to hold the software owner harmless. Few of us ever take the time to read such agreements, even though we are bound by them.Unfortunately, the outage is likely to spur a series of class-action lawsuits that will allow attorneys to argue on behalf of different classes of those harmed, seeking damages that ultimately will be settled out of court.However, of greater importance is that the Crowdstrike outage shines a bright light on the fact that all organizations and entities that rely on computers are one bad file, one inadvertent keystroke or one software update away from a potentially destructive technology meltdown. Every organization and entity are exposed to such risks.What happened with Crowdstrike could have happened with any one of the many other security software companies, though perhaps not on such a large scale. This is the price that we all pay for enjoying the benefits of cyber efficiency and access to the digital economy.No one wants to return to a paper-centered world, manually undertaking tasks that can be completed digitally thousands of times faster and more accurately.This outage also provides a sneak peek into the future of how glitches in artificial intelligence systems may lead to cyber meltdowns, disrupting financial, transportation and health systems far beyond what any group of people could cause on its own.Crowdstrike may carry some liability for what happened July 19, yet the demand for efficiency offered by our digital economy is just as complicit.The next several months will be interesting to observe as these liability issues are unraveled, discussed and explored. The alternative to what Crowdstrike offers — namely, no cyber protection — is far more dangerous than what transpired July 19.This is the reality of living in a digital economy. It carries numerous benefits and conveniences that we all enjoy. It also carries risks, some of which are obvious, such as viruses and malicious software, and some are not, as many organizations learned July 19. season."

Democracy has run its course. It’s time to bring back the king, equipped with divine rights, immune from prosecution and flying high above the law. The big advantage for voters? We can finally get rid of the Electoral College — and New Yorkers need no longer fret about the fact their fellow Americans in North Dakota have three times more voting power.There is a precedent in European history, and it involves one of the continent’s usual suspects:In 1806, Napoleon, with a stroke of his Sharpie, dissolved the college of prince electors that had chosen the Holy Roman Emperor for half a millennium, put himself in the Emperor’s place and replaced the princes with his brothers. That’s what you can do when you enjoy full immunity. No need for brothers, by the way. You can also fill key positions in the imperial household with your sons, daughter and son-in-law.And what’s in it for SCOTUS and its members? They’ll be the royal court and no longer just supreme. That would make them courtiers rather than justices, but to some of them the new role would come easily. As a member of the royal court, Clarence Thomas, for example, could stop pretending that he likes vacationing in an RVon Walmart parking lotsand would no longer have to restrain his inner Marie Antoinette. Naturally, staying away from lamp posts and guillotines would be key to his continued thriving as a luxury loving courtier.As for the pros and cons of a monarchy, was George III really that bad? According to Thomas Jefferson he was a monster.But Jefferson hated all Englishmensince he owed them a lot of money and the British banks wouldn’t accept his American currency. Yes, it’s hard to love your creditors. That King George abolished the slave trade and had all his children (15! with the same wife didn’t put him in Jefferson’s good book either. However, calling him a tyrant — as Jefferson did to put more drama in the Declaration of Independence — was a bit over the top since the British Parliament had more control overKing George IIIthan Congress would ever have over President George I or any of his successors.OK then, let’s think this through. Who do we start the dynasty with? And the answer is easy. Give the job to Prince Harry. He is already in the country, he speaks English, and I am sure we will get used to his plummy accent. If a B-listed actor from Hollywood can win the Cold War, imagine what a spare prince from England could do. Given his family history, he might even be able tokick Russia out of Ukraine. At least that’s what happened when his 4thgreat grandmother, Queen Victoria, was running her empire. And think about the guaranteed diversity bonus that comes with an office that’s hereditary: Harry’s successor will be Princess Lilibet I — born in the USA and America’s first queen of color.Henning Schroeder is a professor at the University of Minnesota and currently teaches in the Department of German, Nordic, Slavic & Dutch.

The Trump administration had terminated an EcoHealth grant, but as these emails showed, Morens was working to reverse that decision. (The termination was eventually reversed, but last week the Biden administration barred EcoHealth from all federal funding, after a hearing in which the organization was scorched by lawmakers from both parties for misrepresenting its work with Chinese virologists. After Morens rebuffed the committee’s request for a voluntary interview, it subpoenaed him to testify.Morens told the committee he used a private email account because he was merely trying to avoid having his personal correspondence with Daszak, whom he described as a longtime friend, become public information. However, the subpoenaed emails revealed Morens advised Daszak on how to publicly respond to the termination of EcoHealth’s grant and demeaned other scientists who worried about biosafety lapses.Morens wrote to Daszak, “We are all smart enough to know to never have smoking guns, and if we did, we wouldn’t put them in emails, and if we found them we would delete them.”Rep. Raul Ruiz, a physician who is the committee’s ranking Democrat, told Morens his actions were a “stain on the legacy” of his colleagues. Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., read email after email from Morens on his avoidance techniques and snapped, “When you say, ‘Oh, I didn’t know this. I didn’t intentionally use my Gmail,’ are you kidding me?”Morens replied to that and many other pointed questions with a version of “I don’t remember,” drawing strong rebukes from members of both parties.The only way to reassure the public that smoking guns weren’t deleted is proper transparency.© 2024 The New York Times Company"

minnpost_2024_64,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In America, there is a lot of talk these days about President Joe Biden being “elderly.” The term is used to describe his age in a way that focuses on possible physical or cognitive declines that can be associated with aging. What comes to mind is frailty, dependence and a diminished capacity to contribute to society. Beyond Biden, elderly is a term perfectly used to reinforce stereotypes that marginalize older individuals, focusing on limitations rather than capabilities.In these combative times, name-calling Biden elderly is a great ploy, a useful device that can be played over and over to harm the faith citizens would otherwise have in our president. I’d like to encourage everyone to pause in this way of thinking for the next few moments. I’d like to encourage us to imagine choosing the term “elder” for Biden.Elder carries a more positive and respectful connotation, emphasizing wisdom, experience and leadership. Being called an elder is a sign of respect and honor. For Biden, it confers upon him the reality of his knowledge, insights and skills developed over a lifetime of serving America. The term acknowledges the relationship between Biden and the people he serves, respecting this time of his life when all that he has become in life contributes meaningfully to society.It seems that we have much to learn from cultures that value their elders, look to their elders for leadership and guidance and value their judgment and decision-making abilities. For Native American and indigenous cultures, elders are often consulted on a wide range of matters — from community decisions to personal advice — reflecting their role as custodians of cultural heritage. For Asian societies (e.g., China, Japan, Korea ,elders are respected as authority figures within families and communities, and their advice is highly valued in personal and professional contexts. For African communities, elders are often involved in community leadership, mediation and the passing on of oral histories and traditions. For Pacific Islander cultures (e.g., Maori, Samoan , elders are central to maintaining the fabric of society, including language, customs and social norms.Across many cultures, elders are recognized for their life experiences — experiences that embody resilience and the ability to navigate challenges. Biden has endured great sorrows, realized great successes and navigated family and national trials. Being a time-tested elder confers to Biden many qualities that he isusing for the betterment of, and on behalf of, America.Biden has an extensive career in public service, endowing him with a depth of experience in both domestic and international affairs. He has the wisdom of time devoted to America that informs his decision-making and leadership. This wealth of knowledge enables him to navigate complex political landscapes, forge bipartisan relationships, and address the nation’s challenges.Biden’s role as the elder statesman of the United States allows him to draw upon a lifetime of public service, leveraging his insights and experience to guide the country through times of change and uncertainty. His tenure illustrates the strength and resilience that comes from experience, offering leadership that is informed by the past yet focused on shaping a future that reflects the values and aspirations of a diverse and dynamic nation.In these contentious times, where statesmanship seems all but lost, Biden is the nation’s elder statesman, an elder to be proud to have as our president. Whenever we find ourselves falling prey to dismissing Biden for being elderly, we should rewind, reframe and hit play.William H.

minnpost_2024_13,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Since 2012, when California and Washington legalized recreational marijuana, 24 states in addition to the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories have followed suit. The speed of change is a consequence of several factors: a sincere desire to repair some of the devastating effects of the War on Drugs, Big Tobacco’s heavy investment in the cannabis industry along with its lobbying power, and the federal government maintaining severe restrictions on marijuana research. The absence of federal legislation cedes too much to states, leading to hodge podge legislation that poses serious risks.In the 1960s and 1970s, a moral panic about “dangerous drugs” swept through parts of the United States. The moral panic found immediate amplification in bipartisan political power with the passage of The Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act in 1970 — now called the Controlled Substances Act.There are three titles or parts of the CSA.The first title is concerned with the rehabilitation of drug users and gained very little traction. The second two titles have had a devastating and disproportionate effect on Black and brown people, poor people and marginalized people. The second title addresses the registration or classification of particular drugs into five schedules based on medical uses and potential for abuse. The third title concerns the importation and exportation of controlled substances. These very different titles reflect the fact that the CSA melds medicine, public health and criminal justice into an uneasy and unequal union. The Drug Enforcement Agency has the power to schedule a drug while the Health and Human Services may make recommendations.In 2022, President Biden requested the HHS review the scheduling or classification of cannabis. In conjunction with his request, he pardoned people who had been charged under federal law for possession. The House passed theMarijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Actin 2022 that expunges criminal records, reinvests in communities that have been devastated by the War on Drugs and prohibits discrimination against people for cannabis-related activities.The cannabis industry is growing at an astounding rateas more states legalize medical and recreational cannabis products. In 2022, legal sales totaled $30 billion with an expected $35 billion in 2023. In the absence of any changes in federal legislation and with additional states legalizing, legal sales could top $70 billion by 2030.The tobacco industry has made significant investmentsin cannabis products.Drawing from an estimated $107 billion in present revenue from tobacco products, Big Tobacco is directing its unrivaled lobbying power to the end of legalizing medical and recreational cannabis.The cannabis industry is followingthe marketing book of Big Tobacco, targeting youths with posts on social media. Advertisements shape the perception that cannabis is not only less risky than other drugs, including alcohol, but has salutary benefits, making consumers more likely to use cannabis.The evidence about harmful effects of more potent cannabis products is growing. Emergency departments have become ground zero for cannabis-related events. There has beena staggering increase of people older than 65. Since 2005, there has been a relative increase of 1,808% in the rate of cannabis-related ED visits.On the younger end of the scale, trips to EDs for children under the age of 6 have increased by 1,375% from 2017 to 2021. This may be a consequence of more potent edibles that resemble candy. People between 15-24 account for most ED visits for cannabis-related events.With no shared limitations on potency, no agreement on a serving size, no measure of impairment, few research programs investigating new and more potent forms of cannabis, and no clear shared restrictions on production, quality control and distribution, the federal government is abjuring its responsibility and ceding all the power to Big Tobacco and Big Cannabis. Trying to regulate products already on the market is extraordinarily difficult, as we have seen with tobacco. Menthol cigarettes were heavily marketed toBlack smokersin the 1960s onward. About 70% of Black smokers prefer menthol cigarettes compared to 30% of white smokers. In 2009, when the Food and Drug Administration assumed power over tobacco, all flavors were banned except menthol. In 2022, the Biden Administration delayed the ban again. Civil rights activists, the ACLU and Big Tobacco charge that the ban targets Black smokers. One of these is not like the others.The failures to regulate the tobacco industry should be object lessons. Will the federal government heed them? The cannabis/tobacco industry would prefer we don’t understand these lessons, which may explain why there is often a vociferous and effective backlash against anyone who questions the claims that cannabis is harmless and not additive or who advocates for caution and thoughtfulness in cannabis legislation. The reluctance to legalize all forms of marijuana without any limits gets painted as continuing the same moral panic that led to the War on Drugs in the early 1970s. That’s a false equivalence. People can be in favor of descheduling but with restrictions on the potency, production and distribution of cannabis. This needs to be a viable position in ongoing debates about marijuana.In the absence of federal legislation, the hodge podge legislation between states may only make the problems worse.Peg O’Connor is a professor of philosophy at Gustavus Adolphus College, a recovering alcoholic and the author of “Life on the Rocks: Finding Meaning in Addiction and Recovery” and “Higher and Friendly Powers: Transforming Addiction and Suffering.”"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_1,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Special Counsel Jack Smith has filed a new indictment against Donald Trump’s attempts to interfere in the 2020 election, an effort to comply with the Supreme Court’s dangerous immunity decision from July, holding that presidents cannot be criminally investigated or prosecuted for so-called official acts.The four counts remain, with the main distinction being that the new document jettisons Trump’s meddling with the Justice Department and focuses mostly on his attempts to lean on state and local officials to rig the election on his behalf.This is wise for the simple reason that such acts are clearly outside of even the most expansive view of presidential authorities, and are plenty well-evidenced enough on their own.It’s a shame that this is even necessary.This cat and mouse game is frankly embarrassing for our country; the counts are the same because the alleged crimes themselves haven’t changed. All that’s happened is that the Supreme Court has made the offenses harder to prosecute, not just against Trump, but any president who chooses to use the powers of the office for acts that run counter to the public interest and the oath of office.That’s a problem that we’ll have to deal with more straightforwardly sometime soon, but for now, it’s still important to hold Trump accountable for the acts that we all watched, heard and experienced him committing.It is worth reiterating that there is plenty of evidence that Trump actually did what he’s accused of.Trump was recorded trying to have the Georgia secretary of state falsify that state’s vote count. Trump has been tied by testimony that he conspired to have slates of fake electors cast their counterfeit ballots for him. Trump was on camera whipping up the crowd that would go on to march on the Capitol, and he did tell the Proud Boys and other potentially armed extremist groups to “stand by.” It’s on video, in transcripts, in investigative documents, all laid out in sordid detail.What we’re really arguing about here, then, is if all this conduct should result in criminal charges and a public trial that could end with the former president being convicted. That’s the concept of no one being above the law. There is no free pass for holders of high public office. The rule and all that, right? Otherwise, then what? What comes after we say that a president can stage a coup?Still, the justices get the last word and they have ruled and now Smith, following their edict, has responded based on the new (and we still contend, wrong, limits . Not prosecuting a former president on clear transgressions over strained legal technicalities is not better than not doing so for more explicit partisan reasons, and indeed the court has already derailed the possibility that this case will move forward before the election, leaving the American electorate to cast their ballots without the benefit of having seen the case presented against him in a court of law.So we commend Smith for not being dissuaded and moving forward with this indictment, even as we rue that the court has misguidedly immunized past or future efforts to weaponize the Justice Department. We’ll take the accountability we can get, for now.— New York Daily NewsWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_17,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Six decades after the age when most people do, I’ve become obsessed with Lego. My gateway drug was a set reminiscent of an ice cream truck. Like many parents, I was trying something new as a way to connect with one of my kids. Unlike many parents, in my case the kid in question was an adult, and I was building a set that he had designed.My three boys were infatuated with building blocks as children, and my husband would play with them, teaching the concept of a “stable base.” But I was the one alone with the kids day after day, enduring interminable and soul-crushing afternoons on the floor of the playroom. I remember when the boys were about 3, 7 and 8, feeling like it was an eternity until my husband would get home, and I was thinking: “Lego again? Didn’t we just do this yesterday?” Those hours seemed to go on forever, but one day, impossibly, I blinked, and they were suddenly driving, procuring fake IDs and heading off to college.Of the three, my middle child, Aaron, was the enigmatic one, the one I couldn’t always understand. We moved from Ohio to the Bay Area when Aaron was in fifth grade, and the transition was almost too much for him. He’d always been change-averse; when I rearranged the furniture in our Ohio family room when Aaron was about 6, he was disconsolate, wailing for days like King Lear in the storm: “Why is everything different?”The move to California caused him terrible angst; like a sad old turtle retreating into his shell, Aaron lived 24/7 in hoodies with the hoods pulled all the way up for almost a year. I look back at family photos from this time and my heart breaks to see his face, often filled with consternation rather than joy.So how did Aaron find his equilibrium?First of all, he discovered musical theater. As a teenager, he was in a dozen musicals at our local community theater. He and I saw Broadway shows together whenever we could: “Hamilton,” “Anything Goes,” “Dear Evan Hansen.” To see Aaron discovering joy through musical theater was a delight (and a relief .Secondly, Aaron continued building with Lego even as other kids his age outgrew it. During middle school, he found a group of similarly infatuated enthusiasts online who shared their original designs with each other. By the time he was in high school, he had discovered the “adult fans of Lego” community, and that was it for him: He’d found his people.During college, he started accepting commission work (“Can you design and build a life-size Nike Jordan shoe out of Lego?” “Why, yes!” “How about creating a Balrog, the demonic monster from ‘The Lord of the Rings’?” “You betcha!” . After graduating, he continued with larger and better-paying commissions, cobbling together a burgeoning career.Aaron’s dream, pretty much ever since he developed fine motor skills, was to work for Lego as a designer. But that would also mean moving to Denmark. After college, he’d begun to teach himself Danish — the kid had his eye on the prize — and, a few years after he graduated, he was hired by Lego.He and his wife now live in Billund, Denmark, 5,368 miles from our home in the Bay Area.Last fall, through a fluke of timing, Aaron and I got to spend a few special days together in New York, going to Broadway shows and to a bar in Greenwich Village for a big drunken show-tunes singalong. But it was when we went to the Lego store at Rockefeller Center that I felt like I got a glimpse into the center of his soul. We saw sets he’d designed, and he told me about fellow designers when we checked out their sets. This was his place, these were his people, this was his life — or, at least, it was his foundation.Thinking about it now, I realize the concept of the “stable base” that my husband taught him all those years ago has become a metaphor for Aaron’s life: This world of interlocking bricks is where he feels the most calm, happy and competent. He needs things to make sense in the way Lego makes sense.As much as those after-school hours all those years ago felt monotonous, I’d love to go back in time to when we all lived under one roof and when I, the boys’ mom, was the big love of their lives, sitting on the floor of that playroom.Not forever, but just for a little while, armed with the insights I have now.The time has gone too fast. In the meantime, I have a new and profound connection to Aaron, my sometimes-elusive one. When I dump out a bag of the little plastic bricks and start sorting through them, just the mere sound brings me back, to remember and to feel the essence of my son, however far away he might be.Abby Margolis Newman is a freelance writer in the Bay Area.@newmaniacsNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."

The findings — based on data gathered between 1979 and 2022— are consistent with the wave of decriminalization under state laws, notably with California’s Proposition 215 back in 1996.After the election that year, a law professor at Loyola was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying “this may be the baby boomers taking control.”It wasn’t the boomers prevailing, but pragmatism.About 1.3 million people in the U.S. are in state prisons. The most common reason for incarceration? Drug-related crimes. Given how much the country with the highest prison population loves pot, it makes sense to stop throwing people in jail for doing weed.Today the only states where cannabis is totally illegal are Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina and Wyoming. Earlier this month President Joe Biden announced plans to reclassify pot as a less dangerous drug.In short: “Just say no” is dead. Long live “pass the dutchie ‘pon the left-hand side.”The next important step in having policy actually reflect society would be for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign the “munchie bill” that’s likely to be headed his way soon.Last year Assembly Bill 374 — which would make it legal for dispensaries to become cafes and offer food as well as host live events — passed the Assembly 66-9 and the Senate 33-3.Marijuana cafes have existed in Amsterdam since the 1970s. Last summer I spent a few hours listening to music and eating homemade desserts at the first marijuana cafe in North America. Fittingly called New Amsterdam Cafe, the popular hangout opened in Vancouver in 1998 and is as chill as Issa Rae’s Hilltop Coffee.Despite law enforcement’s best efforts, illegal pot is estimated to have pulled in more than $8 billion in 2020 compared with $4 billion for legal. However, it’s the small-business owners who also have the burden of taxes, regulations and fines. All of which eats away at profits and businesses’ ability to grow. Haney said his proposal not only would allow small business owners to diversify their income stream, but also would encourage people to come out of their post-pandemic cocoons and socialize again.California began liberating cannabis culture in 1996. It’s only right the state continues to correct a narrative that was born not from science but from President Nixon’s prejudice. It’s because of that cloud hanging over cannabis that advocates of decriminalization had to sweeten the deal for voters by promising a financial windfall for the state, which of course is why legal pot is ridiculously overtaxed.My hope is that the munchie bill meets Newsom’s approval. With proper ventilation for employees and customers alike, marijuana cafes could provide local artists with new venues and add another branch of tourism.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

And in local politics, funding for services for older adults, roads, public health, and law enforcement will always win out over an office that, by design, serves only people accused of crime who cannot afford a private attorney.A lack of funding for public defenders means people arrested and placed in jail oftendon’t meet with an attorney for days or even weeks.This is plainly unconstitutional.That’s why, after more than two years of research, data analysis, court observation, and countless interviews with participants in the criminal legal process, especially the public defenders and their clients,the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania sued the state. Our lawsuit asks the court to find that Pennsylvania’s decision to delegate nearly all funding and control for public defenders to the counties violates the Pennsylvania and U.S. Constitutions. The commonwealth has the ultimate obligation to ensure adequate representation for poor people charged with crimes in the state.» READ MORE:Ketanji Brown Jackson is now the only former public defender on Supreme Court. This matters. | OpinionTo be clear, this isn’t a knock on the public defenders. The large majority are hardworking, dedicated, and grossly underresourced professionals. The problem is not them; the problem is the system they work under. Even the most talented lawyer could not provide effective representation with caseloads that only allow mere minutes to help each client.The ACLU of Pennsylvania is not the only one ringing the alarm on the public defense funding crisis in the commonwealth.Arecent report by a law professorat the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey Law School found that at least 60 of Pennsylvania’s 66 counties with public defendersdid not have enough attorneys in their public defender offices to meet national standards.Thenational standards, compiled in 2023, established different caseload recommendations based on the complexity of the matters an attorney handles. For example, the study estimated that a public defender may spend roughly a dozen hours handling a low-level misdemeanor, while a high-level felony — where the accused could be sentenced to life in prison without the opportunity for parole — could consume nearly 300 hours. Even under the University of Pennsylvania study’s conservative methodology, which did not factor in the time public defenders spend on additional work such as appeals and probation and parole violation hearings, nearly all Pennsylvania county public defender offices had caseloads that exceeded the national standards.These aren’t minor shortfalls, either; an estimated 47 Pennsylvania counties would need to more than double their attorney staffing levels to meet the national standards.These aren’t minor shortfalls.Some welcome news is that many of Pennsylvania’s elected leaders have acknowledged the funding crisis, and have started to take some baby steps toward addressing it. Gov. Josh Shapirosecured $7.5 millionin his 2023-2024 annual budget proposal for public defender funding and has continued that level of funding innext year’s budget, just signed into law. It’s a good start, but it’s not nearly enough.A fairly and fully funded network of public defender offices is the only way to make sure every Pennsylvanian has a fair chance to navigate the criminal legal system.Hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians are impacted by the public defense resource crisis per year. They are the people who spend extra time incarcerated while they wait to be assigned a public defender, in jails wheredrug deaths and overdoses can run rampant. They are the public defenders whowork tirelessly to represent an overwhelming number of clients. They are the children whose parents unjustly sit in jail. They are the spouses who struggle to make ends meet while their partners await their day in court. And so many others.This lawsuit isn’t just about making sure Pennsylvania is following the law. It’s about preventing the unjust and unnecessary suffering of so many Pennsylvanians as a result of a broken system.Veronica Miller is the senior policy counsel for criminal legal reform at the ACLU of Pennsylvania.

suffolknewsherald_2024_85,"Published 7:03 pm Tuesday, January 30, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,The population in the city of Suffolk has dramatically increased with the amount of residential buildings and development. The first issue we are seeing is a difference in traffic since the neighborhoods and apartment complexes have been developed. The widening of roads to handle such traffic should’ve been done in preparation, not after the traffic has become a mess. If the building permits are slowed down to give the city enough time to prepare for future traffic, this wouldn’t be as much of an issue.With the increase of people in the city, there is an increase in calls for first responders. The issue with this is that there aren’t enough first responders to respond. The call volume is too much at times. Officers are leaving along with fire and rescue because of the work overload, work environments, and shortage of employees. This can be solved if the Police and Fire departments would raise the wages to retain who they have already hired and trained for the job. By raising the pay, other already certified officers from other jurisdictions will want to come to Suffolk.The Suffolk Public School System is seeing the increase as well. Schools are extremely overcrowded. This makes them not only unsafe, but it is overworking their teachers. Teachers are leaving the profession left and right, adding on too many students and unsafe learning environments is just going to push teachers out. This also negatively impacts the learning environments and how the public views the school system. Building schools in preparation for the increase would keep this issue from occurring. Suffolk needs to build new schools now because of the increase.These issues the city could have been easily avoided. The city cannot keep up with the amount of homes being built. There needs to be expansion in these areas to combat the growing population numbers. The city is incredibly behind and needs to be proactive when it comes to issues like these because it affects the current citizens.Alayna CarrSuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

eugeneweekly_2024_21,"We ve got issues. As a parent of a Spencer Butte Middle School student and a member of this community, I find myself compelled to address a recent incident that strikes at the heart of the values we cherish. It has come to my attention that Jenoge Khatter, a dedicated educator known for his commitment to fostering inclusivity and understanding, faced a directive to remove a Palestine flag — a symbol of solidarity with the suffering of people in Gaza — from his classroom. This directive, coupled with the threat of termination for non-compliance, is alarming not only for its implications on Khatter’s freedom of expression but also for the message it sends to our students about the bounds of empathy and dialogue. Khatter has played a pivotal role at Spencer Butte, notably through his leadership of the Asian Pacific American Student Union, which has been a sanctuary of inclusion for my daughter and her peers. In a world where the sense of being understood and accepted is not guaranteed, Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Khatter’s efforts have illuminated paths of compassion and solidarity. The decision to censor a gesture of support for global suffering — irrespective of the intricate politics that envelop it — raises significant concerns. It suggests a retreat from our commitment to nurture a culture of open dialogue, critical engagement and empathy. Education, at its essence, is about broadening horizons, encouraging the pursuit of diverse perspectives, and cultivating informed, empathetic citizens. To stifle such expressions is to undermine these objectives, hindering our children’s growth into conscientious global citizens. The principle of freedom of speech is a bedrock of our democracy, deserving of staunch protection, especially within the halls of education. Our schools should be bastions of free expression, where diverse voices are heard and explored, not silenced. The action taken against Khatter sends a disquieting message to my daughter and her classmates about the limits of empathy and the risks of standing in solidarity with those who suffer. In light of these considerations, I urge the Eugene 4J School District board members to reassess the measures taken against Khatter and reflect on their broader implications for our school’s mission and values. Let us demonstrate to our children the importance of empathy, understanding and the respectful exchange of ideas, even — and especially — in the face of complex global issues. I appreciate the community’s attention to this matter and remain hopeful for a resolution that reaffirms our shared commitment to freedom, inclusivity and the enriching power of education."
minnpost_2024_44,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Imagine owing hundreds of dollars in medical debt and then having it suddenly erased. This scenario is becoming more common in the United States thanks to American Rescue Plan Act funds and a nonprofit called RIP Medical Debt.Currently, nearly1 in 10 adults owe more than $250in medical bills and 6% of U.S. adults owe more than $1,000. Medical debt — debt from unpaid medical bills — often results from unexpected health care expenses, such as an emergency hospital stay following a health crisis or accident. While lack of health insurance is a key risk factor in having medical debt,nearly half of adults with insurancehave incurred it too.Medical debt can be devastating to one’s health and well-being. Negative effects of owing medical debt includecutting spending on food, clothing or other basic needs, beingunable to access needed health care services, and being forced to change living situations. Medical debt is so commonplace in the U.S. that in 2022, credit bureaus removed paid medical collections from credit reports and in 2023, medical collections under $500 willno longer appear on consumer credit reports. These changes amount to an admission by credit agencies that owing medical debt is not a reflection of financial responsibility in the U.S. Instead, it is an all-too-common experience for users of our opaque health care system. It doesn’t need to be this way, though.To combat medical debt, the nonprofit,RIP Medical Debt, has been using private donations to pay off medical debt since 2014. By purchasing debt for cents on the dollar, RIP Medical Debt uses the same model private sector companies have used to buy up debt — but arguably with better intent. More recently, RIP Medical Debt has started to use public dollars to cancel medical debt, contracting with more than 30 states, counties, and cities tocancel medical debtfor hundreds of thousands of individuals using COVID-19 funds from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA .Minnesota is not immune to the effects of medical debt. In February, state lawmakers proposed “The Minnesota Debt Fairness Act,” which would, among other things, ban medical debt from being reported to credit agencies, reduce interest on medical debt, and ban the withholding of medical services due to unpaid debt. Withholding medical services due to unpaid medical debt is on the minds of many Minnesotans after theNew York Timesreported that Allina Health was rejecting patients who were in medical debt from receiving care. This legislation is of critical importance but stops short of erasing medical debt for individual Minnesotans.There have been efforts at the municipal level, though, to eliminate medical debt for Minnesotans. For example, in December of 2023, Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paulannouncedthe city would be investing $1 million of ARPA funds with RIP Medical Debt to pay off $100 million in medical debt for approximately 45,000 St. Paul residents. Other cities around the U.S. havetaken similar action, including New York City, Washington, D.C., New Orleans, Chicago (Cook County , and Detroit (Wayne County .We applaud the efforts by St. Paul and these other cities to cancel medical debt. So far, however, most efforts to address medical debt around the country have focused on large urban areas. While such efforts are urgent and important, they ignore the disproportionate impact of medical debt on rural residents. In the U.S., rural residents are more likely than urban residents to experience medical debt (11% vs. 8% . In addition to shouldering a disproportionate share of medical debt, rural residents are more likely to beuninsured, have worse overallhealth and mental health, and havemore barriers to health care services, includingrecent closures of obstetric unitsin Minnesota. Ensuring the continued vitality of rural Minnesota requires addressing the crisis of medical debt there, which is made worse by these other systemic failures.We heartily support the cancellation of medical debt, and we encourage lawmakers in Minnesota to add statewide medical debt cancellation to its legislative agenda. Other states such as Arizona andConnecticuthave contracted with RIP Medical Debt to cancel debt throughout their states, and we encourage Governor Walz to do the same in Minnesota. Rural residents should receive the same benefit as their urban St. Paul counterparts.Hannah MacDougall is an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota School of Social Work.

leoweekly_2024_27,"“That is theisland of Imrali. There is nothing but a prison on that island. They only are having one prisoner there. You know we don’t have terrorism here? They caught the only terrorist and put him there. All by himself. Now everyone is safe.”That’s the story we got from our tour guide in Turkey. One need not be trained in ferreting out propagandistic bullshit to recognize that something about it doesn’t ring true. Tour groups don’t attract a lot of critical thinkers, or at least not many who are so impolite as to not keep our mouths shut when we hear something outlandish. So perhaps it was social graces that kept me from cross-examining our poor guide. Or perhaps it just wasn’t shocking enough to ask about.Curiosity eventually got the better of me, so I looked it up. There was in fact a lone prisoner on the island of Imrali. He still lives, though not in total isolation. His name is Abdullah Öcalan. Whether or not he is a terrorist is, uhm,debatablein the way that the legacy of Che Guevara, Yasser Arafat, or even Ataturk isdebatable.Öcalan was at one time a leader of Kurdish militants, and became what we might call an anarchist, in the sense that he believes that the state is inherently oppressive and should be abolished. He was tried and convicted of treason in 1999. The reader’s attention span and my own capacity to retain information prevent further discussion of Öcalan’s life and times, but if you’re looking for more reading on a truly fascinating character, it’s out there.Öcalan was sentenced to death, but when Turkey abolished the death penalty in 2002, the sentence was commuted to solitary confinement.Verysolitary. So solitary, in fact, that he was the only prisoner on the island of Imrali for ten years. In 2009, Öcalan’s captors moved other prisoners to Imrali, initially allowing them to spend ten hours a week together. They also gave Öcalan a TV. These changes apparently resulted from pressure by the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.For most of our history, that sort of treatment wouldn’t have been tolerated in the U.S., either (at least not out in the open . Long-term isolation of prisoners, though technically allowed since the 1790s, was a tactic rarely used before the late twentieth century, mostly because the courts and the general public perceived it for what it was: an inconceivably inhumane practice. As far back as 1890, the Supreme Court overturned a prisoner’s death sentence because his long-term solitary confinement was considered unconstitutionally cruel.Solitary as we know it continued to be widely condemned until around the 1970s, when the drug wars, and a resulting wave of prisoner litigation, gave the courts opportunity to visit the issue over and over. At first, courts continued to decry solitary confinement, if not in very strong terms. As late as 1978, the Supreme Court held that even short-term solitary confinement “served no rehabilitative purpose.”But something extraordinary happened in the wake of the mass incarceration crisis following the drug wars: prison officials simply ignored public outcry—and the courts. There were so many prisoners to manage, so many bodies to warehouse, that putting even a substantial number of people in solitary for months at a time didn’t catch attention like it used to. The problem was just too big to control, even from the hallowed halls of the high court. When violent revolts (inevitable in the overcrowded prisons of the post-Nixon era became a bigger story than prisoner treatment, public sympathy for incarcerated people waned. Incarcerated people could be held in total isolation for months, even years, without engendering the ire of the public. Prison administrators didn’t much care what the courts had to say about it; they just kept on putting people in boxes and daring anyone to stop them. And so over time, the courts bowed to systemic pressures and upheld even the most monstrous examples of solitary confinement.Today, it is a common practice of many facilities to keep people locked up alone for twenty-three hours a day, often with no human contact, no reading material, no natural light, and barely any amenities. We take this kind of punishment, considered outrageous 200 years ago, as a standard, even necessary, side effect of the carceral state, justified by even the slightest perceived infraction. Incarcerated people have been put in solitary for failing to make their beds properly, for mouthing off to guards, and, as seen in at least one New York case, for eating the wrong parts of an apple. Judges and juries don’t decide to put someone in solitary; that decision is usually left to the discretion of ordinary prison guards. Solitary affects everyone, from the tall to the small—misdemeanor offenders can get it just as often as people convicted of felonies—and in any institution. As we have come to discover more and more over the years, the effects of solitary on any person’s psyche are profound. Even a month without human contact can result in serious long-term harm, and it is not unusual for incarcerated people to spend years—even decades—in near-total isolation.In contrast, Öcalan was probably never completely cut off from humankind. During his first ten years on Imrali, there were around 1,000 Turkish military personnel on the island. He was at least in regular communication with his lawyers, and was able to make regular public statements through them. Öcalan also lucked out by being in an EU member state, and not just because of the commutation of his death sentence. Here, there is no “Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,” or anything like it, that might investigate and interview incarcerated people about their living conditions. Post 2009, his access to the outside world seems exponentially better than Americans in “Special Housing Units.” And a TV? That’s positively posh.Still,10 yearsof solitary? That’s enough to make the average human brain into oatmeal. And yet, a mere decade of torture is no big deal by American standards. Thomas Silverstein did 36 years of solitary in federal prison. Albert Woodfox, one of the “Angola Three,” spent an unthinkable 43 years in a Louisiana isolation cell. And Kalief Browder — a child —spent more than a year in solitary in an adult jail despite never having been convicted of any crime. Remember, these are American citizens we’re talking about. We don’t really know what the ceiling is for foreign “combatants” kept in storage containers by the U.S., here or overseas. Dozens of prisoners whose names you’ll never hear will die on our watch every year having done far more than a decade of solitary. Öcalan got off comparatively easy. Hell, had he been convicted in America, where we’ve managed to retain the death penalty more than 20 years after Turkey abolished it, he might be dead already.In sum, I am more or less unbothered by Abdullah Öcalan’s extensive isolation. I am somewhat bothered, however, by the fact that I am unbothered by it. What might it say about American’s criminal legal system — or those of us who participate in it — when we can compare it to ten years of solitary confinement on a Turkish island prison and say “eh, that doesn’t sound so bad?”*** ."

Torrential rain and flooding the day before and more rain after, but during the commencement ceremony, the sun was bright. The sun paled in comparison, however, to the many smiling faces in the crowd as ‘ohana and friends assembled to cheer on their graduates!Near the end of my script are the lines, “We know you are ready for the next step in your career and we are excited by what the future holds for you. Be successful and demonstrate to the world what graduates of UH Hilo can accomplish.” Try as I might, my voice always catches on the second sentence, as the emotion of the day and the year all converges on me.In that moment, I am simply overwhelmed: overwhelmed with pride in our students and all they have accomplished, overwhelmed with gratitude for the hundreds of people working across our campus to support the personal and educational journeys of these students, overwhelmed with excitement for the next chapter in the lives of our graduates, overwhelmed with concern about the challenges those graduates will face.The concern is counterbalanced by the excitement, gratitude and pride of the day. Commencement day is the day I smile the most every year, so much so that my jaw aches a little! After all, one cannot look out at over 2,000 joyful cheering people and not smile. As I leave the stadium and make my way to the car, I see more ‘ohana and friends greeting the new graduates. Some came from hundred of miles away, but on that day, we all smile.The lead-up to commencement day is filled with symposia and celebrations as departments and colleges give out honors and awards and celebrate their graduates in smaller venues. Graduate students might make one more research presentation, undergraduates squeeze in one more exam, and faculty enter the grading zone, inundated by exams and papers. Those projects and exams verify that the students are indeed ready for what comes next, whether it is graduate school or work.These milestones give me the confidence to know how much “graduates of UH Hilo can accomplish.” Our students have been guided by experts in their field, supported by any number of people in the greater UH Hilo ‘ohana, and driven by their inner drive and ambition. Many of them already have jobs when they graduate; others are still searching, but we know that they are ready.Commencement day is also a day of reflection. Speeches meant to be inspiring are quickly forgotten in the emotion of the day. Those speeches often contain hopeful messages and encouragement, but also notes of concern about the many things in the world that we hope might be improved. And, we proclaim, our graduates are the ones who will cure disease, address social and economic problems, and care for the environment. The older generations look back at what we did not/could not accomplish and instill our hope in those who enter the world of work now. It may not be fair, but the cycle of generations is always accompanied by the message that “we did not fix the world, but you can.”UH Hilo hosts any number of place-based, community-engaged, hands-on learning experiences that help students prepare to change the world. They act locally, which is how change begins. At several of those pre-commencement convenings, I meet students and hear about their capstone projects. Some of our students work in labs and libraries, but many are working on the ‘aina or in the community. They learn that positive change takes hard work because their capstone experiences do not always go smoothly. They encounter real world issues of bureaucracy and economics, regulation and recalcitrance. Yet they continue to kindle the fires of optimism, and they learn persistence.The Monday after commencement day, I am once again in the real world. The rain comes back, as do the challenges. The campus is quiet, and those of us at the university gear up to welcome another group of students in the fall. I kindle my own fires of optimism, and set my sights on a better future for us all.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_40,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Among the many rulings the Supreme Court handed down this term, a decision on so-called Chevron deference could prove especially consequential. The question at issue was whether the courts or government agencies should determine the meaning of ambiguous laws. The new ruling unsettles a 40-year-old understanding by shifting some of the power over these choices away from the executive branch. Many regulatory actions may now face a torrent of litigation.Chevron deference matters more than it should because Congress insists on passing so many ambiguous statutes. Lawmakers do this partly by accident, failing to think through how new regulations will work in practice, and partly by design, settling on muddled directives as a way to build coalitions and satisfy rival constituencies. In either case, their failure leaves the other branches of government to work out what the laws in question actually mean. Under the now-discarded Chevron doctrine, courts usually deferred to the wisdom of regulatory agencies — and, on the face of it, with good reason. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, know a lot more about how to regulate pollution than do lawyers and judges. The problem is that the relevant statutes give the agencies such wide leeway that they can sometimes act as de facto lawmakers. Under Chevron deference, the agencies weren’t required to show that their interpretation of the law was correct, or the best or most plausible interpretation — only that it was “reasonable.” Over time, agencies have become increasingly adept at widening this discretion and expanding what conservatives often deride as the administrative state.So it’s no surprise that the court’s conservative majority has overthrown the Chevron understanding — or that the liberal minority objected in such strident terms. In a dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote, “A longstanding precedent at the crux of administrative governance thus falls victim to a bald assertion of judicial authority. The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.”It’s worth remembering that the politics of this decision can cut both ways. When Chevron deference was first established in 1984, conservatives applauded and liberals were dismayed. Under President Ronald Reagan, the EPA aimed to lighten regulation of power plants. Liberals wanted the agency’s discretion to do this reined in and objected when the Supreme Court said, in effect, the regulators know best. As you might expect, opinions on where power in these matters should reside often have more to do with political preferences and who happens to control the respective branches of government than with constitutional propriety.Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts said, “By its sheer breadth, Chevron fosters unwarranted instability in the law, leaving those attempting to plan around agency action in an eternal fog of uncertainty.” That’s true. Kagan’s dissent is equally correct to say that overturning Chevron will itself be enormously disruptive. The fact is, there’s no good remedy for Congress’ tendency to write ambiguous laws. If lawmakers cannot bring themselves to enact clearer statutes, agencies and the courts will frequently be at odds over what the law demands. Whichever branch gets to choose, the eternal fog of uncertainty won’t lift.The fault, and the only good solution, lies with Congress.—Bloomberg Opinion/TNS"

As details of the 13 July attempt on our former president’s life continue to emerge, and reactions continue to range from stoic to lunatic, let’s look at the evolving situation through an intelligence lens to bring a few things into better focus.Analysis.In CIA’s New Analyst Course, I was trained to step back from the melee of competing narratives that arise with fast-breaking, high-impact stories to mitigate the effects of the fog created by conflicting information, changing story lines, and gaps in knowledge. Leaps of logic, unsupported assertions, and conspiratorial thinking can fast creep into such situations, and there is no room for that when you are writing for “The Book,” the President’s Daily Brief. Such discipline is lacking, however, in many “assessments” we see about the Pennsylvania incident, even in news outlets that chose ratings over solid journalism.What can we do? Open your media literacy toolkit. Pull out Occam’s Razor, review the signs of the Dunning-Krueger effect, and scrutinize author and purpose and intended audience of the information you consume.Also, beware of commentators whose credentials give an authoritative air, but who — on closer inspection — lack specifically related qualifications to provide truly meaningful input. For instance, many people commenting on security arrangements, response times, and Secret Service agents’ performance in Butler lack experience in protective detail work — from congresswomen who were not there to adrenaline-fueled eyewitnesses who cannot put their observations into a professional security context to the mixed martial artist running a podcast out of his mom’s basement.While the factual details of the shooter’s motive remain a matter for discovery, politicians’ presentation of conjecture on that motive as fact — and constituents’ acceptance of such — reflects intellectual dishonesty by one and intellectual laziness by the other.“Those who know, don’t say; those who say, don’t know.”— old spy adageSteer clear, too, of pundits who fail to demonstrate even a grade-school level ability in logic, argumentation and critical thinking. (Spoiler alert: It is improbable that Thomas Matthew Crooks was under CIA mind control, that the incident was staged by the GOP, or that Big Foot was taking selfies in the tree line. Exploitation. Foreign intelligence services’ influence campaigns began tapping this recent example of politics, guns and violence colliding in a democracy even before the former president was manhandled into his armored vehicle. Look carefully at the narratives coming out of Moscow and Beijing. They are clearly crafted to further inflame divisions in our national politics, advance their preferred U.S. presidential candidate, and convince their own people that democracy is a sham. (Domestic political operators on both sides of the aisle are exploiting the incident for their own messaging, but that is beyond the scope of this article. Executive.U.S. intelligence community tracking of Iranian plots to assassinate Trump (in retaliation for his ordered killing of a military leader, General Soleimani, in a third country in 2020 caused early speculation about foreign involvement in the recent shooting in Pennsylvania. That scenario is now eclipsed by a growing body of publicly available information pointing to a lone wolf scenario, but that may change as more information becomes available. It is noteworthy, however, that many Americans immediately dismissed the possibility of foreign involvement, apparently unaware of recent foreign intelligence assassination attempts on U.S. soil.In January, for instance, the Department of Justice indicted three conspirators tied to Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security who planned to kill a dissident in Maryland. In November 2023, India’s Research and Analysis Wing attempted to kill an activist in New York. In June of last year, the U.S. sanctioned the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps for plotting to assassinate former National Security Advisor John Bolton in Washington, D.C., or Maryland, and there was an assassination attempt in Miami against Russian defector and former SVR officer Alexander Poteyev. Remember when Putin critic Dan Rapoport in 2022 “fell” out of his high-rise apartment in D.C.? Many observers considered that a “Moscow Swan Dive,” a calling card of Russian intelligence.So what now?

Strangers often thought they were a boy, and they were not offended. They liked trains and car toys and were disinterested in Barbie dolls. They always debated the unfairness of what boys were allowed. They also wanted no pictures of themself hung, shared, or displayed. And they were quite ambivalent about relationships.Away at college, they called to say, after giving heterosexuality an uncomfortable turn, they embraced a lesbian identity. Unbeknownst to us, the identity quandary was far from over. It was not until a year later, when Sondra casually mentioned a friend’s non-binary status, that they finally were able to share a secret they had been hiding for a year. They were, in fact, non-binary and would now embrace the pronouns they/them.On the one hand, it made perfect sense and was a confirmation of history. On the other hand, we dreaded the misunderstanding, judgment, and even animosity they might experience in the great, wide, binary, often-mean world. And we also grieved the loss of “normalcy” that made life so simple and predictable for us. Change is hard. We used to be the confident parents of a strange girl. Now, we were the insecure parents of a non-binary person. From now on, there would be endless adjustments for us and all their existing relationships. We still make many mistakes.Fortunately, they have three incredibly supportive siblings, who have been confidantes along the process with them. They have run interference, corrected our mislabeling and misinterpretations, and nurtured our understanding. It is hard to embrace the fact that one’s child has been alone in very difficult work for years, all while being in your care.We were certainly not alone in our journey. It turns out, several friends were going through the same process with their own dear children. I formed a strong bond with another dad, whose child had also moved from self-doubt to great confidence and social ease. These friends were all great sources of wisdom, insights, and assurance that our child could also find community and understanding.And so, we moved into the new reality with great commitment to dispense with our insecurities, embrace the journey and put our egos and expectations aside. We have become grateful for the courage and stamina of our child, who faces misunderstanding, scary news stories and the uncertain reactions of uninitiated family and friends every day. Our child is a champion.The most serendipitous outcome has been the absolute turnaround in mental health, well-being, identity confidence, and purpose. In fact, clarity of mind has led to clarity of purpose and the freedom to focus on their growing successes. Our conversations are now full of admiration and gratitude, flowing fulsomely both ways. It has become a family journey, with our child leading us to embrace a more complex understanding of human sexuality, close-up and intimate.I grieve for the many generations of young people who did not enjoy society’s scientific and cultural evolution in understanding human sexuality and gender identities. We are grateful for all the parents before us, especially the ones who led the love-filled revolution for the acceptance of gay marriage. And we gladly join them in this work to set our children free.This Pride Month, I send this message to my non-binary child: We are deeply grateful for who you are. You have expanded our world and made us better parents and people. We will always protect you, within the sphere of our influence, from all hostility. We will defend your right to be who you are and to be that well. But most importantly, we will protect you with our unconditional and enduring love. We now understand that by allowing you to be yourself fully, we are becoming more wholesome ourselves. Your father is proud of you and honored to be your student.Don Samuels is a candidate for Congress in Minnesota’s 5th District and the former CEO of MicroGrants.

He’s right.If nothing is done, this insurance crisis in Lava Zones 1 and 2 is only going to get worse.Insurance premiums have skyrocketed from $1,500 per year to over $5,000 per year. This is unsustainable for most homeowners, and the situation puts those with mortgages really in a hard spot.What is the community doing? A small group was formed in Puna to study the reasons for all this and to work on legislative efforts. We have now formed an Exploratory Committee to see if an insurance cooperative is the right solution for us.We envision a member-owned, nonprofit co-op. Our goal is to provide affordable insurance for those in Lava Zones 1 and 2.You can go to www.mutualmemberinsurance.org if you would like to know more about us. No obligation at all, this is simply a feasibility study to see if there is enough interest in this concept before we move further.Andrea RosanoffPahoaPay the homelessto collect chickensYes, I am tired of all the clucking by Hawaii County and the state Department of Agriculture about invasive species control.Considering the last effort to control feral fowl on Oahu spent $100,000 to trap only 150 chickens — or about $333 per chicken — how about instead we pay Hawaii Island’s homeless folks a bounty of $50 per chicken? Then the so-called “tight” funds would go much further and help the homeless at the same time.Just print up a few “wanted dead or alive” posters to announce the chicken bounty and set-up a collection and incineration center at the dump.Nonprofit organizations can cash-in, too, with chicken-hunt fundraisers! Hey, maybe even sell the dead chickens to Honua Ola Bioenergy as biofuel for a sustainable waste-to-energy system?Or better yet, hire a professional animal trainer to teach or even breed specialty chickens to eat those coconut rhinoceros beetles before they get out of control. The chickens would likely do a better job of managing yet another invasive species than DOA’s current “plan” of wrapping trees in nets.In the meantime, I’m doing my part to keep the chicken population down by hunting for free eggs in my backyard.Cluck-a-doodle-do.Sylvia DahlbyHiloPolice are investigating a two-vehicle traffic collision Thursday afternoon in Pahoa that sent a motorcyclist to the hospital with critical injuries.BOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

But few added that there was still one more Division I women’s scoring title remaining.That one belonged to guardLynette Woodard, who scored 3,649 points while playing for the University of Kansas from 1978 to 1981. Her record was set before the NCAA offered women’s championships, when the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, or AIAW, was in charge.When Clark surpassed Woodard’s AIAW milestoneon Feb. 28, 2024, in the fourth quarter of a game against the University of Minnesota, it opened up another chance to revisit this buried piece of sports history.The AIAWlaunched in 1972. Within a decade it was bigger than the NCAA, with nearly 1,000 member colleges and universities. It sponsored 19 sports in three divisions, was the sole organization for women’s intercollegiate athletics and the only one led by women. And the NCAA destroyed it through what SUNY Cortland sports management professor Lindsey Darvin described as a “hostile takeover.”As ascholar of sport, gender and American culture, I study the AIAW as a key moment in sports history that has been buried, and I’m currently writing a book exploring its philosophy, impact and legacy.In any history of women’s sports in the U.S., you’ll hear a lot aboutTitle IX, the federal law dictating that female college athletes must receive equal opportunities in sports.But you’ll rarely hear about the AIAW, a sporting body led by women that fundamentally changed intercollegiate sports. Its student-centered governance model continues to resonate as college athletes chip away at the power of the NCAA, whether it’s through thetransfer portalorname, image and likeness deals.Throughout the early part of the 20th century, female college students participated in physical education classesfocused on health and wellness. There were few opportunities for organized team sports.By the 1960s, however, women students demanded school-sponsored intercollegiate teams and championships like the men had.Women professors of physical education agreed.. But they had watched the NCAA commercial model of sport descend into exploitation and scandal under what historians have called the “cynical fiction” of amateurism. As the NCAA remained exclusively male, there was an opportunity to create something different for women’s athletics.The AIAW emerged from that momentum – an intercollegiate athletic governance organization designed for and by women, dedicated to creating high-level competition while maintaining focus on the well-being and education of student-athletes.Under the AIAW, all teams and athletes were supported equally, not singled out for their ability to generate revenue. They had a right to due process, an appeals system and student representatives on local and national committees. The organization ran on dues from member schools and eventually some advertising and media contracts.Women’s athletic programs were led by physical educators turned coaches and administrators. Some of the most famous coaches in women’s basketball got their start under the AIAW, including C. Vivian Stringer, Pat Summit and Tara VanDerveer, who recently brokethe all-time record for college basketball wins.In addition to Woodard, other notable AIAW players include Ann Meyers-Drysdale, Nancy Lieberman and Lusia Harris, who was recently the subject of anOscar-winning documentary.There is no doubt that Title IX, which wassigned into law in 1972, had a big influence on the growth of women’s college sports, mandating that educational activities, including athletics, should be the same for men and women.Congress passed Title IX just before the AIAW’s first championship season, and the law spurred calls for more equitable resources for women’s sports.There was immediate backlash from male-dominated sporting organizations, including the NCAA, which saw the addition of women’s sports as a loss for men’s sports. Walter Byers, then the NCAA’s executive director, said, “The possible doom of college sports is near.” One college football officialtold reporter Sally Jenkinsthat women’s sports advocates were trying “to tear the shirts off our backs.”Despite the fear mongering, college sports continued to thrive. Nonetheless, over the past 50 years, even though nearly all schools have beenout of athletic compliance with Title IX, none has lost federal funding for violations. As Title IX scholar Sarah Fieldshas written, “Without punitive damages, the law is limited: it is toothless.”All along, change has come not from the law’s mere existence but from students filing complaints and lawsuits, and the determination of administrators to use the law to carve out and protect athletic opportunities for women. During the 1970s, those administrators were almost all in the AIAW.By the late 1970s, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare had laid out clearer standards for athletic compliance with Title IX.While the NCAA and AIAW were not subject to the law, their member institutions were, and the two organizations’ efforts to collaborate failed. Instead, the NCAA, which had long fought Title IX’s application in athletics, changed course and set its sights on taking control of women’s sports.The NCAA offered women’s championships in all three divisions for the first time during the 1981-82 school year. Leveraging all of its presumed legitimacy and financial resources, the 75-year-old men’s athletic organizationoffered all-expenses-paid women’s championships on the same weekends as the unpaid AIAW championships.The strategy worked. The AIAW lost significant members and ceased operations in mid-1982, despite the fact that women athletes, coaches and administratorspreferred its educational model and leadership structure.The NCAA made vague promises to support women’s athletics but refused to give women more than token representation on its governance boards. Women student-athletes were, for the first time, led by a male-dominated governance organization.To this day,institutional sexism remains entrenched in the NCAA.Women hold only41.3% of head coaching positions for women’s teams and 23.9% of athletic director positions– roles that were largely held by women under the AIAW. A recent gender equity review found that the organizationunder-resourced nearly all of its women’s championships, a result ofgender bias and its focus on making money.The NCAA and its corporate partners would like you to believe that their organization is the be-all and end-all of college sports.But the story of the AIAW – created by and for women, rejecting the crass commercialism of the NCAA and empowering student-athletes to speak up – offers ideas for a more equitable future for college sports.Diane Williamsis an assistant professor of Kinesiology at McDaniel College.This article is republished from The Conversation."
eugeneweekly_2024_37,"We ve got issues. For 30 years, Eugene Pride has been an annual tradition for our area’s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and other LGBTQ+ community, and it has been the only consistent cultural tradition of the queer, trans, and gender diverse community during that time. Throughout, we have learned, grown and changed. We are an all-volunteer led and run 501(c (3 nonprofit. Over the past several years, due to the tireless work of the Pride board and volunteers, the festival has grown to include close to 300 sponsors and vendors with booths. Many of these businesses are owned by queer youth and emerging entrepreneurs who are opening small businesses and making their start. Additionally, the festival showcases 153 drag queens, musicians, comedians, dancers, poets and other artists who express themselves on our two stages to a crowd of over 12,000 people. This is the work of PRIDE — Promoting Respect in Diverse Expression for arts and culture in the LGBTQ+ community. Eugene Pride is not just a party or festival — it is a life-saving event for many. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Over the years, Pride has incorporated offerings that really sustain our community. We have a Sober Circle where queers and trans folks in recovery can still be in community while maintaining their sobriety and building a network of support year-round. We offer an Interfaith Area where faith organizations can work to undo centuries of trauma inflicted on our communities. Our Youth Zone offers the chance for LGBTQ+ parents to meet each other and for queer, trans and gender diverse youth to express themselves through art, activities and fun. We have a large clothing swap and offer free gender-diverse haircuts so that people can feel comfortable in their bodies. We also offer a Veterans Village where community members who served our country can navigate various resources that are available to them. No other venue or organization in Eugene offers so much to the LGBTQ+ community in a single day. This year, we estimate more than 100 people will be tested for HIV and, if they receive a positive result, will get immediately connected to care in a supportive environment. More than 100 nonprofits will raise awareness around their services and connect the LGBTQ+ community to jobs, resources and support. Others will receive health care at our medical tent from doctors and nurses who are volunteering their time. People will meet their first partner at Pride. Some will be openly queer for the first time. Others will see friends they haven’t seen in years. Some will see that they are not alone and that it’s worth it to keep going; that a community cares about them. People find themselves at Pride. As we have worked to grow the Pride festival to attend to the needs and wants of the LGBTQ+ community, we have tried to be respectful members of our larger community. We get out of the city’s way by having our event in August to avoid being in conflict with the University of Oregon commencement, track and field events, Juneteenth and the other events in the area during Pride month. Today, it feels as if we have to struggle to even have this one day, a struggle we are proud to share with each other and with our movement’s heroes — people like Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy and other transgender women of color and drag queens. After sustained public pressure, including appealing directly to our Eugene City Council, we finally have what we need to produce the festival, despite getting those answers less than three weeks before the event. We have received enough parking to ensure our attendees with disabilities, entertainers, sponsors and vendors as well as volunteers and organizers can access and park in Alton Baker Park where our event is held. Limited parking for four-plus carpools will also be available on a first-come first-serve basis, but no other public parking will be offered. Please do not attempt to drive into Alton Baker Park! We have arranged shuttles from sites around Eugene, and you are strongly encouraged to park on the side of the river where you reside or are traveling from. LTD is providing a code that will be posted on our website so that you can ride the bus free to Pride, and we will offer free bike valet, as well. All transportation options, including a map, can be viewed on our website. It is telling that we can bring 60,000-plus football fans to the same neighborhood where Pride is held, but getting 12,000 to the same area requires public outcry. We bring the whole world to Eugene to watch a track meet, but we struggle to get our local LGBTQ+ community what it needs to organize a one-day festival. We have some great advocates on city staff who are doing their best to support this event, and we are incredibly grateful for their support. However, we need leadership that values our community, not only with words of support, but with action and prioritization. Thank you to everyone who contributes to making Eugene Pride happen. It is a truly amazing community event, and this year will be no different. Happy Pride!

minnpost_2024_4,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Identifying with an activity is different from actually doing it.For example, 49% of Americans play video games, but only 10%identify as gamers.According to a recent survey we conducted, there’s also a small gap between reading activity and identity for younger readers: 61% of Generation Z and millennials have read a print book, e-book or audiobook in the past 12 months, but only 57% identify as readers.And yet there was a puzzling aspect of our results: The 43% of Gen Z and millennials who didn’t identify as readers actually said they read more print books per month than Gen Z and millennials overall.In other words, young people who don’t identify as readers are reading books at a higher rate than their generational cohorts as a whole.Why?Our best guess is that “reader” is an identity, not a behavior. And that identity is buttressed by involvement in book clubs, engagement with social media communities such as Booktok and Bookstagram, and access to libraries and bookstores.Identities of reader, writer and fan seem to reinforce each other.Millennials and members of Gen Z who identify as readers are also more likely to be writers and participate in fandom.Community is key to all of these identities. For example, two of the top reasons millennials and members of Gen Z identify as fans are the fact that they’re “part of a fan community” and are able to “meet others like me.”Every August, the Edinburgh Book International Book Festival in Scotland — the largest book festival in the world — puts on an entire month of events around books, authors and readers.During the2023 event, which we attended, you could see attendees clamoring to see writers like Alice Oseman, author of thebestselling “Heartstopper” graphic novels.We heard fans waiting in that line talking about how Oseman’s series featured the first queer characters they’d encountered in a book. Readers came to the festival with friends and family, and made new friends and connections at the event. The passion was palpable.But does a graphic novel like “Heartstopper” even count as “real” reading?If the National Endowment for the Artsdefinitions from the early 2000sare to be believed, then no — unless it’s reading literature for leisure, it must not be “real” reading.And some millennials and members of Gen Z may believe that the reading they are doing isn’t real reading. But a narrow definition of what counts as reading ignores the love Gen Zers and millennials have for content such as graphic novels, manga and comics.In our study, 59% said they would prefer a graphic version of a story over text-only. And let’s not forget audiobooks, which 34% of Gen Zers and millennials prefer over text-only. Millennials and members of Gen Z are also reading nonfiction or reading for school and work, rather than pleasure.In a separate study from 2020, we found that 83% of American readers read books for reasons other than entertainment, such as school, work or self-improvement.More Gen Z and millennial women identify as readers, so there could be gender differences at play: Perhaps young men, no matter how much they read, are hesitant to closely identify with an activity they see as the purview of women.Socioeconomic status may also factor into whether someone feels they can claim a readerly identity. Gen Zers and millennials who didn’t identify as readers were less likely to have a job in the past 12 months and earned less money.So it turns out that identifying as a reader is often about community, wealth and gender — and what counts as reading — than it is about how much someone actually reads.Perhaps there can be an effort to broaden the definition of “reading” — yes, audiobooks and comics count — and to build bookish communities beyond places such asBookstagramandBookTok. And being a reader can be more than loving classic literature, though certain social media trends, such as “Reading Like Rory” — a BookTok phenomenon centered on the literary classics read by Rory Gilmore of “Gilmore Girls” — amounted to just that.If young people were to see being a reader as simply enjoying and engaging with stories, how many of them would start to call themselves readers after all?Kathi Inman Berensis an associate professor of Book Publishing and Digital Humanities andRachel Noordais an associate professor of Publishing, both at Portland State University.This article is republished from The Conversation."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_56,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°President Joe Biden has repeatedly and rightfully described the stakes in this November’s presidential election as nothing less than the future of American democracy.Donald Trump has proved himself to be a significant jeopardy to that democracy — an erratic and self-interested figure unworthy of the public trust. He systematically attempted to undermine the integrity of elections. His supporters have described, publicly, a 2025 agenda that would give him the power to carry out the most extreme of his promises and threats. If he is returned to office, he has vowed to be a different kind of president, unrestrained by the checks on power built into the American political system.Biden has said that he is the candidate with the best chance of taking on this threat of tyranny and defeating it. His argument rests largely on the fact that he beat Trump in 2020. That is no longer a sufficient rationale for why Biden should be the Democratic nominee this year.At Thursday’s debate, the president needed to convince the American public that he was equal to the formidable demands of the office he is seeking to hold for another term. Voters, however, cannot be expected to ignore what was instead plain to see: Biden is not the man he was four years ago.The president appeared on Thursday night as the shadow of a great public servant. He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Trump’s provocations. He struggled to hold Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence.Biden has been an admirable president. Under his leadership, the nation has prospered and begun to address a range of long-term challenges, and the wounds ripped open by Trump have begun to heal. But the greatest public service Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for reelection.As it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency. There is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Trump’s deficiencies and those of Biden. It’s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Biden’s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes.If the race comes down to a choice between Trump and Biden, the sitting president would be this board’s unequivocal pick. That is how much of a danger Trump poses. But given that very danger, the stakes for the country and the uneven abilities of Biden, the United States needs a stronger opponent to the presumptive Republican nominee. To make a call for a new Democratic nominee this late in a campaign is a decision not taken lightly, but it reflects the scale and seriousness of Trump’s challenge to the values and institutions of this country and the inadequacy of Biden to confront him.Ending his candidacy would be against all of Biden’s personal and political instincts. He has picked himself up from tragedies and setbacks in the past and clearly believes he can do so again. Supporters of the president are already explaining away Thursday’s debate as one data point compared with three years of accomplishments. But the president’s performance cannot be written off as a bad night or blamed on a supposed cold, because it affirmed concerns that have been mounting for months or even years. Even when Biden tried to lay out his policy proposals, he stumbled. It cannot be outweighed by other public appearances because he has limited and carefully controlled his public appearances.It should be remembered that Biden challenged Trump to this verbal duel. He set the rules, and he insisted on a date months earlier than any previous general election debate. He understood that he needed to address long-standing public concerns about his mental acuity and that he needed to do so as soon as possible.The truth Biden needs to confront now is that he failed his own test.In polls and interviews, voters say they are seeking fresh voices to take on Trump. And the consolation for Biden and his supporters is that there is still time to rally behind a different candidate. While Americans are conditioned to the long slog of multiyear presidential elections, in many democracies, campaigns are staged in the space of a few months.It is a tragedy that Republicans themselves are not engaged in deeper soul-searching after Thursday’s debate. Trump’s own performance ought to be regarded as disqualifying. He lied brazenly and repeatedly about his own actions, his record as president and his opponent. He described plans that would harm the American economy, undermine civil liberties and fray America’s relationships with other nations. He refused to promise that he would accept defeat, returning instead to the kind of rhetoric that incited the Jan. 6 attack on Congress.The Republican Party, however, has been co-opted by Trump’s ambitions. The burden rests on the Democratic Party to put the interests of the nation above the ambitions of a single man.Democrats who have deferred to Biden must now find the courage to speak plain truths to the party’s leader. The confidantes and aides who have encouraged the president’s candidacy, and who sheltered him from unscripted appearances in public, should recognize the damage to Biden’s standing and the unlikelihood that he can repair it.Biden answered an urgent question on Thursday night. It was not the answer that he and his supporters were hoping for. But if the risk of a second Trump term is as great as he says it is — and we agree with him that the danger is enormous — then his dedication to this country leaves him and his party only one choice.The clearest path for Democrats to defeat a candidate defined by his lies is to deal truthfully with the American public: acknowledge that Biden can’t continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place to defeat Trump in November.It is the best chance to protect the soul of the nation — the cause that drew Biden to run for the presidency in 2019 — from the malign warping of Trump. And it is the best service that Biden can provide to a country that he has nobly served for so long.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyDuring the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."

It mentions a $50,000-funded Oahu project that captured a total of 150 chickens.Where do I apply for a job that pays $333 for each cluck plucked?Richard HoeflingerKeaauCase for adoptioninstead of abortionI believe that adoption is a better alternative to the abortion of a baby. I think that the women who don’t want the baby should continue with the pregnancy and eventually give the baby up for adoption if they truly don’t want it or know that they aren’t capable of taking care of it.I understand that not everyone will agree with my point of view and believe that it’s up to that woman what she wants to do with her body, but that’s my very issue. The fetus of the child isn’t her own body. The fetus is a body and a life of its own and should be given the opportunity to live.Though it is a difficult decision to make, choosing to continue the pregnancy and giving the baby up for adoption gives that child the chance of life with a family who is willing and capable of caring for it.Not only does this offer the child a chance at life, it also offers families who aren’t capable of having children the opportunity to raise, love and care for a child like their own.I understand if the woman or the fetus’s health and life is at a major risk, then unfortunately in that case I believe it may be acceptable. I also take into consideration the women who went through traumatic experiences such as rape and got pregnant without choice, but I still stand true to my opinion.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I am choosing to share mine. You never know who that child may turn out to be — they could change the world for good. But how would we know unless we actually give that child a chance?Alaysia Hokulani PickensPahoaMahalo for speedtables in KeaukahaOn behalf of the large majority of residents of Kalanianaole Street, we want to thank the county for putting in the long-overdue speed tables between Ka Umeke Kaeo School and Richardson Ocean Park.The tables will save lives, making the street and its five beach parks safer places to visit.Additionally, it will help restore the tranquility of the neighborhood for both visitors and residents by reducing the use of Kalanianaole as a drag strip — as has been the case in recent years.Mahalo!

leoweekly_2024_31,"I mailed a box of my own poop to a lab in Wisconsin. Before I sent it, I made the mistake of setting the box down ever so briefly in our living room, fully sealed and inconspicuous. I am an unfailingly honest parent. So when my seven-year-old asked “what’s in the box?” I had no choice but to tell her.“It’s daddy’s doo doo, honey.”“Really?”“Yes, really.”She narrows her eyes to suspicious slits. “Why?”“Well, they have to test my DNA.”“Oh…why?”“To see if I’m a cat.”To see if you’re…acat? What? Why would anyone think you were a cat?”“Oh, because I crap in boxes, sweetheart.”Unfailing honesty isn’t the same as candor, so I didn’t tell her that this is part of the new normal for being in your late 40s, that someday you, too, will likely have to lay a dookie in a Tupperware container affixed to your toilet seat, dump chemicals on said dookie, and ship it off to be tested for proteins associated with colon cancer, which, by the way, people keep dying of atalarmingly young ages dueto the unyielding horror of theAmerican diet, nor did I tell her that the smell of your own scat outside a toilet will convince you that you are, in fact, rotting from the inside, and that if it’s not cancer, you’ve by-god gotsomethingin there that is going to kill you.Then my oldest, a ten-year-old who is fascinated with cults, Japan, and cross examination, chimes in: “hold on, how is it evenlegalto mail a box of your own poop to someone?”Now there’s a proper question. Taking an educated guess at an answer, I expected there to be a blanket prohibition on the shipping of excrement, with a carve-out somewhere for legitimate medical purposes. I was wrong.Attorney Brett Snider, who has written an astounding 1183 articles for findlaw.org, has covered this topic in apostcalled “Is it illegal to mail poop?” So far as I know, Snider’s brief analysis presents the definitive treatise on the matter. He explains that it’s okay to ship the occasional brown dragon so long as you don’t intend to “harass” the recipient. When prosecutors go after poop mailers (orpoopetrators, to borrow the term from a recent case , they generally do so under state harassment statutes.Makes sense. And yet, it seems like this is more complex. Snider cites a service calledPoopSenders.comas an example of a “gag gift” that would fall outside the legal definition of harassment. But it seems to me that the entire PoopSenders business model is explicitlyproharassment. Their website promises “SWEET revenge at its Finest” and suggests that the product be sent to “your ex” or “the teacher that gave your son/daughter a poor grade.” Despite the site’s disclaimer, the target audience is obviously people who intend to cause harm.So okay, you can mail poop so long as it’s not done with the intent to harass, and even if it’s explicitly done for the purpose of harassment, that apparently doesn’t matter. Never mind all that. Here’s what I’m stuck on: The only recourse for the recipient is a catch-all state statute? I’m deeply skeptical. The feds have a crime for everything. They especially have a lot to say about regulation of the mail. Political candidates who place unwanted mailers in someone’s mailbox, for example, can be fined up to $5,000.00 (though it’s perfectly fine to mail the same unwanted mailers directly to the same mailbox . Based on everything I know about overcriminalization in the U.S., it seems wrong to assume a baseline rule of “sending a box of coprolite is permissible” and apply exceptions. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Shouldn’t it be presumptively, you know,wrongto mail your crap to anyone other than a lab that is checking it for cancer?I only found one statute that could make mailing fecal matter a federal crime.18 U.S.C.§1716provides that a person may be prosecuted for sending certain “nonmailable” and “injurious” items. The cases interpreting this statute tend to deal with bombs, poison, switchblades, and the occasional tarantula. The statute forbids the mailing of “germs and scabs,” but poop and other bodily waste isn’t specifically prohibited. Nor does the statute contemplate an exception for people who have a legitimate medical purposes for mailing doody (though there is an entire paragraph that creates an exception for, uh, lab scorpions .The only case I could find where someone was actually punished under 18 U.S.C. § 1716 for mailing crap to someone is a Texas federal decision calledHilmers v. Khoshdel.That one involves an incarcerated plaintiff who claimed to have gotten an abusive rectal exam from a prison doctor. The plaintiff mailed the court “a large flat box containing blood and feces on toilet paper to serve as DNA evidence.” No court seems to have applied it to, say, suburbanite incel goblins sending spiteful bags of gorilla dung to women who block them on X.I think the moral of this story is: 1 you simply cannot make any assumptions about what is a crime and what is not, and 2 you can shit in a box and mail it to someone with only minimal possibility of getting fined or tossed in jail. Still: don’t. Unless you need to get checked for colon cancer. Which you do. ( ."
philinquirer_2024_69,"Waverly B. Woodson Jr. treated 200 casualties on Omaha Beach. Segregation and racism largely prevented him from being honored. On Friday, a street in his old neighborhood is being renamed for him.On the morning of Aug. 24, 1944, The Inquirer ran an article about a hometown hero.The dateline was vague — “Somewhere in France” — but the story was detailed.Army medic Waverly B. Woodson Jr., a 20-year-old Philadelphia native and Lincoln University premed student, had landed in D-Day’s first wave.Severely wounded by German shelling, he “helped bandage and administer plasma and sulfa throughout the day and night, helped evacuate the wounded when the tide came in and continued first aid operations until 4:30 the second afternoon.”The Army would credit him with treating 200 casualties on the deadliest stretch of the invasion beach before nearly collapsing from fatigue and blood loss.A Pittsburgh Courier story about the Overbrook High School graduate ran days later. The headline: “Hero No. 1 of Invasion.”Woodson, one of the few Black soldiers in D-Day’s first wave, may have been a household name in Pennsylvania for a brief time in 1944, but he and his heroism were largely forgotten in the ensuing decades.That changes this week when the city of Philadelphia renames the street where Woodson was born and raised — North 58th Street — “Waverly Woodson Way.”Woodson’s story has touched me personally. I, too, am a Philadelphia native, and I currently serve in First Army, the historic Army unit that led all ground and airborne forces on D-Day. On June 6, 1944, then-Cpl. Woodson’s shoulder bore the same block-A patch I wear on my uniform today.For years, First Army has advocated for proper recognition of Woodson’s remarkable acts. It was announced last month, just a few days before the 80th anniversary of D-Day, thathe would be posthumously upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross, the military’s second-highest medal for bravery.Some of our troops who were in France for commemoration events took the medal that will be presented to his wife, Joann, to Omaha Beach, and laid it on the sands where Woodson saved so many. The valor upgrade will come in Washington later this summer; the street renaming in Philadelphia will occur Friday afternoon.I’ve thought a lot about what I want to say to my fellow citizens of Philadelphia as we honor Woodson. I want to acknowledge that it is long overdue for the Army to award Woodson’s gallantry. In 1944, that didn’t happen due to a perfect storm of realities: an Army segregated by race and riven by racism, the fog of war, lost records, and infighting among his leaders.But I also want to point out that every time we tell Woodson’s story — every time we honor his service and sacrifice — we do our part to correct the injustices he endured on behalf of our great, but sometimes imperfect, nation.Those of us who have had the responsibility of leading America’s sons and daughters in combat know one thing: We who wear the cloth of this nation are just ordinary citizens who love our country enough to do extraordinary things when that country calls. Woodson was an ordinary young man, from an ordinary Philadelphia street, who became extraordinary on a bitter, windswept morning that changed the course of human history.Woodson was undoubtedly shaped by the city in which he was raised — the heart of colonial America where the Founding Fathers penned our most famous declarations to freedom and liberty — as well as a family with a true heart for military service. Even as Waverly fought his way onto Omaha Beach, his younger brother, Eugene, was an officer with the Tuskegee Airmen, the famed all-Black unit of military fighter pilots.Merion Station resident Paul Newman and Philadelphia City Councilmember Curtis Jones Jr. undertook the effort to rename North 58th Street with one simple goal: to inspire a new generation of Americans by drawing attention to the actions of a member of the Greatest Generation. It is my hope that the young men and women who today walk the sidewalks of Waverly Woodson Way will know that they, too, can achieve extraordinary things.In the Army, we often say we stand on the shoulders of giants. Woodson is one of our giants. He died in 2005 and was a First Army soldier eight decades ago, but we still consider him — and his family, many of whom still call Philadelphia home — our responsibility. It is our duty to ensure he is remembered.Our thanks go to the city and people of Philadelphia for helping First Army do just that — and, even more, for raising the ordinary, extraordinary citizens who have fought for this nation from our earliest days, and who fight for us still.Maj. Gen. Timothy Brennan is First Army’s deputy commanding general for support."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_120,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Just three short years after the dawn of an era in which college athletes can profit off their name, image and likeness, a newer era is about to dawn courtesy of a legal settlement. Some 14,000 student-athletes who played and learned from 2016 to now will divvy up $2.8 billion in damages from the name, image and likeness money they were denied, and, going forward, schools will figure out how to divide around $20 million a year in a historic revenue-sharing arrangement.The agreement, yet to be finally approved by a federal judge, would resolve a series of lawsuits challenging the NCAA, and affect students past, present and future in the Big Ten, Southeastern, Atlantic Coast, Big 12 and Pac-12 conferences.It’s impossible to be wholly negative about a set of policies that will shift the balance of power in big-time college athletics, whereby multi-billion-dollar TV rights wind up buying massive contracts for coaches and lavish facilities, but negligible money flows to the students themselves, who actually play the games that generates all the cash.But today’s and tomorrow’s athletes already have the ability to profit in the free market of social media promotion, or at least the superstars do. Officially changing the paradigm so that players share a set percentage of revenue generated — in this case, about 22% — effectively defines athletes as workers, not students. And that is a fateful, unfortunate shift.College extracurriculars come in many shapes and sizes. Some young people put on theatrical performances; others spend time in professors’ laboratories, or compete in chess, or debate, or play volleyball or fencing or crew or lacrosse. It’s sports and only sports — and truly only a couple of lucrative sports, men’s football and basketball — that are now resetting their terms. And that’s bound to create all manner of perverse consequences.Let’s get specific. Alabama’s football team generates earnings; other programs do not. So, should players on its baseball team see a windfall? How about those in smaller sports? And women’s sports? Title IX generally requires a certain degree of parity between men’s and women’s athletics; should it extend to the distribution of money under this settlement?The principle advanced by the legal agreement is that those who generate revenue deserve a share of it — not that practicing and playing games is labor in and of itself. But by that logic, money generated by TV contracts, merchandise sales and the like should only benefit players in the relevant sports, and not second- or third-stringers, either. And by that logic, the lament that college sports is an education-distorting, profit-making enterprise will only become more true.Speaking of which, some fools in the New York Legislature, not content with having opened the floodgates to casino and sports gambling in our state, now want ever more people to part with their money — by legalizing prop bets in fantasy sports apps. These are wagers that go beyond traditional cover-the-spread type propositions to let people lose or win money based on specific predictions, typically about individual players’ performance.Whether aimed at pro or college sports, they’re a recipe for corruption. There’s no good reason to legalize them, except to keep lining the pockets of gambling proponents, and emptying out the pockets of people who have trouble controlling their impulses.—New York Daily News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of Hawaii.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_209,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°In a narrow vote this week, the Federal Trade Commission approved a rule that will ban the vast majority of noncompete clauses by U.S. employers, which have long prevented workers from switching jobs or setting out on their own.In doing so, the agency did its duty to protect American economic dynamism and opportunity. We hope that’s the clear conclusion of the courts that will now rule on a lawsuit being brought by the Chamber of Commerce, which has strenuously supported this anticompetitive practice.Of the arguments that the business group and other opponents have rolled out to oppose the banning of noncompetes, the main one relates to trade secrets, which is probably the scenario first contemplated by contractual noncompetes. We’ll grant that there are certain jobs in typically specialized fields where it is reasonable for an employer to propose a noncompete to protect truly particularized and market-critical knowledge and expertise.The fact that the FTC estimates one in five American workers operates under some form of noncompete shows just how far from that purpose these restrictive agreements have strayed. Companies can kick and scream all they want, but that won’t make it true that burger-flipping technique or actuarial practices or whatever else are secrets they’re entitled to zealously guard.The FTC did make an exception for senior management-level positions, where employees have much more of an ability to haggle over contracts; lower-level workers are expected to just sign on the line, and many don’t even know they’re agreeing to noncompetes.Opponents of the rule also contend that employers will be less willing to provide training and career development to workers who are then free to leave to competitors, which is a strange argument if you rephrase it to what it’s really saying: employers will refuse to properly train employees they can’t keep forever. If companies want to retain their workers, they should do so through competitive pay and benefits, good working conditions and an enticing work environment, not legal entrapment.Courts often use an analysis that weighs the interests of each party and tried to determine where the balance of interests lie. So while there are definite reasons for companies to seek noncompetes — some eminently legitimate, many simply having to do with maintaining a competitive advantage through what is essentially market manipulation — we must also consider the interests of the workers, and what runs downstream from being locked in with a noncompete.FTC Chair Lina Khan referenced some of these situations when discussing the ban, pointing to workers who had written public comments noting that they had been prevented from leaving workplaces they didn’t like or found abusive. It’s also the case that the era of most workers building entire careers at a single company, climbing the ranks, is practically over.In many industries, the key to advancement is jumping around, or setting up your own business to keep innovation flowing. That means that noncompetes do more than just stop workers from changing jobs; they can stunt entire careers that could flourish if employees had the choice to move freely in what entities like the Chamber of Commerce itself will otherwise suggest should be an open and competitive market. Good riddance, and good news for the American economy.—New York Daily News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

suffolknewsherald_2024_93,"Published 5:41 pm Tuesday, January 16, 2024ByStaff ReportsI recently had another birthday marked on the calendar. Turning 48 years old could be a non-event at this stage of life. However, I’m fortunate to have a very loving congregation and a legion of good friends and family. So, it did not go unnoticed.After receiving a healthy dose of love that day, I came home from church and decided to skip the mental list of chores and holiday preparations to make and treat myself. I realized I had not sat at a bar counter to drink a beer and enjoy a good meal in a while. I decided that I needed that treat.I’ve always loved the atmosphere of a good local bar or pub. A mixture of regulars who can communicate with the bartender just through head nods and hand signals, folks meeting up after work, people on a first date and, these days, even Bible discussion groups on occasion. I love the community in it all. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not naïve enough to ignore that things that are regrettable, and sometimes even offensive and harmful, can happen in barrooms also. I’ve seen my share of it. To be fair, those things also happen in churches, youth sports leagues, knitting clubs and any other place people gather. We have our flaws.Yet, for the most part, people still seem to want to come together with others. There’s healing that happens in the fellowship of eating, drinking and conversing with others. It’s also a building block to society and personal development that humans instinctively know we need. Even the most introverted person can get lonely. The truth is, sometimes a local “watering hole” is where many will feel the least judged. In the better examples, it’s one of the safest places for a person new to a community or a lonely person to feel the most welcomed.I’ve worked in the church world for over 10 years. I graduated from a reputable seminary. In my experience, I’ve had some of the deepest and most thoughtful theological conversations with an atheist on a barstool. Want to really hear the hard truths? Talk to folks in a setting like that who churches have harmed. That’s some of the same work Jesus did himself. He seemed to always be within listening distance to those who had been “put out” or “put off” by the religious establishment.So, back to my birthday excursion. I ended up sitting at the corner of the bar in Baron’s in downtown Suffolk. I got myself a pint of Guinness and the surf and turf. The plan was to savor each bite of a medium rare steak in solitude, leave a good tip and head home.But there was “Pete” (I’m not using his real name . A man about my dad’s age, with the fashion sense to wear a good looking “scally cap,” as I often do. He was a few seats down from me. I believe he had only one drink. Then he just sat there. As much as I love observing and often participating in the social aspects of a bar, I really just wanted to enjoy this time alone. Pete really wanted to talk to someone, you could tell that. I’m a bit ashamed of myself that I could recognize it, but didn’t really react to it at first.Thankfully, someone did. Society has few better at healing lonely hearts than a good bartender, or server. Katrina, working a double that day, appears to be a master at it. She noticed his need to converse and dove right in. Within minutes, he told her about his career as a truck driver and shared some decades-old stories about it. He was even breaking out his phone to show her pictures of the love of his life. My heart finally cracked open when he told of how she passed away. Katrina handled all of this with the conversational compassion that some have to get degrees and work internships to learn.I entered the conversation for a little while with Pete. He showed me the flaps inside his cap, though we both agreed they probably wouldn’t do much in a harsh winter wind in the North or Midwest. We talked about a few other things as well, but I don’t remember what. He’s a good guy. I do hope I see him again somewhere. I remember him saying goodbye, and there I was alone again, just as I had planned. Yet, I wasn’t alone again. Seems that my plan wasn’t what the day would bring. Before I knew it, I was showing Katrina pictures on my phone. We were soon deep in conversation about careers, children and even some theology.I savored that conversation even more than the pint and the steak. I had thought she was helping Pete heal. It turns out that was only part of the plan for the day.I give thanks for Pete, Katrina and a proper pint of Guinness.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_95,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Donald Trump’s uninspired list of vice presidential prospects includes several men who have been critical of Trump, which could present problems for the ticket.The former president – who has reportedly winnowed down his VP list to just a handful – needs somebody who can step into the Oval Office right away and be acceptable to the MAGA base.Trump’s legal problems and the real possibility of jail time remain a wild card, so Republican voters will want a VP who’s qualified to be leader of the free world.That candidate at the top of the list now appears to be Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. He has the experience and credentials and home state advantage but tangled with Trump eight years ago and will be viewed skeptically by the GOP faithful.Trump has derided Rubio as “little Marco” and Rubio insulted Trump during the 2016 campaign but those facts shouldn’t get in the way of Trump picking him.With the Trump campaign focusing heavily on the Latino vote, Rubio’s Cuban heritage and Spanish language skills gives him a huge advantage over his VP rivals.There is one other problem with Rubio; Trump would have to move from his Florida voting address back to New York to avoid conflicting with a constitutional provision prohibiting the presidential ticket from living in the same state.What Trump is really missing is a woman from his list. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem vanished from the prospects by disclosing she once shot her dog. People won’t support a woman who killed her dog and boasted about it.One longshot candidate who might be intriguing is Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, the former White House flack. Sanders may be short on experience but she’s been through the ringer and is a good campaigner.Whoever is VP – Democrat or Republican – has a very good chance of becoming president given the age of President Joe Biden and Trump’s legal problems.But most of the prospects are not ready for prime time – step to the front of the line, Doug Burgum. The 67-year-old governor of North Dakota ran an extremely unsuccessful campaign for president last year and dropped out early to become a VP candidate.He somehow seems to have made it to Trump’s narrowed list, probably because he’s been a successful businessman. But no one is going to jump to the voting booth to vote for Doug Burgum.Then there’s J.D. Vance, the Ohio senator and former “never Trumper” whose clashes with the former president you’d think would exclude him from the roster of potential picks. Vance would be viewed as disloyal by much of MAGA and his only upside is he’s from a battleground Midwest state.On the Democratic side, current Vice President Kamala Harris has the clear incumbency advantage if Biden should be unable to perform his duties or has to drop out.The Wall Street Journal piece detailing the worries of some in the White House about Biden’s mental capacities has made it even more critical that Democrats have a good VP nominee."
philinquirer_2024_45,"Current technologies, including artificial intelligence, make it possible to integrate the work of a child welfare worker, a mental health counselor, a housing specialist, and a health worker.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker has made an early commitment to shake up Philadelphia’s strategies forreducing crimein our toughest neighborhoods andcleaning up our dirtiest. I’ve heard it called the“crime and grime” agenda, and it is to be lauded. But addressing crime and grime alone will not be enough without also overhauling how the city delivers care to its most vulnerable populations.I have served in three mayoral administrations, and I’ve witnessed the value and impact of similar overarching commitments in the past. Mayor W. Wilson Goode Sr. prioritized“clean and green” neighborhoods, making a point of removing abandoned cars andgetting help for people experiencing homelessness. Mayor Ed Rendell revitalized Center City andeliminated a quarter-billion-dollar deficit. Mayor John Street sought to revitalize neighborhoods through theNeighborhood Transformation Initiativeand protect Philadelphia’s children through theChildren’s Investment Strategy.Parker’s agenda is perhaps the most ambitious of these initiatives. Reducing violent crime, especially among our youngest Philadelphians, is a tall order; Kensington’s drug culture has resisted many well-intentioned efforts to restore the neighborhood as a safe and healthy place to live. But most Philadelphians are holding their breath, hoping against hope that this time will be the charm.But to Philadelphia’s struggling children and families seeking help from the city’s beleaguered health and human services systems, fighting “crime and grime” will not be enough. Thousands of Philadelphia’s most vulnerable are stymied by convoluted and often insensitive city bureaucracies that, well-intentioned as they are, fail to provide efficient, effective help — not because they don’t try, but because of ancient technology and lack of coordination.Fixing how we “do” health and social services in city government can go a long way in reducing costly pain and suffering and, not incidentally, combating “crime and grime.”Call it the “care” agenda.Philadelphia’s major “care” systems — behavioral health, child welfare, homeless services, and public health — often get a pass when it comes to the great budget and policy debates in City Hall because they are overwhelmingly funded not by city tax dollars, but by state and federal governments. In my 40 years of interacting with city governments, mayors, managing directors, commissioners, and City Council members, all seem to believe that because those budgets are not paid for by city tax dollars, there’s little the city can do to mold and manage those dollars with the same aplomb as they do police, theDepartment of Licenses and Inspections, andcommerce.That’s a significant mistake. Why? Because the solutions to our most intractable health and social challenges can be found in that money. And, by my calculations, it comes toover $3 billion every year.Certainly, those billions come with strings attached, and there are lots of federal and state regulations and policies that must be honored in spending them. But time and time again, smaller initiatives being creative in how they use those billions have been proven to be more effective in helping people solve their problems.Parker is at the beginning of what many of us hope will be an eight-year mayoral tenure. That’s plenty of time to step back and take a look at the billion-dollar bureaucracies that today make it hard to get the help you need. She should make them more efficient and focused, less complex for regular people and for those trying to help them.For instance, at the Department of Human Services, those who used to be called “social workers” are now “human services program managers,” judging by a search of the city’spersonnel page. That’s because we’ve made access to health and social services so complex, involving several siloed bureaucracies, that we need a level of services just about making referrals. This means often passing a family back and forth in administrative limbo for hours or days or weeks because we have allowed each bureaucracy to create its own independent systems that rarely talk to each other. Millions of dollars support this referral bureaucracy — dollars that could otherwise be used to provide direct care to those who need it.A 20-year-old homeless Philadelphian should not need to interact with two or three or five bureaucratic entities making referrals to each other just to get a place to sleep. A family involved with the Department of Human Services should not have to wait for the DHS worker to refer to a community case manager who then has to make a referral to the behavioral health case manager to get a therapy appointment months away. We should not be spending millions on new levels of administration that only get in the way of what people need: an integrated system that connects them with the solutions that help now.Current technologies, including artificial intelligence, make it possible to integrate the work of a child welfare worker, a mental health counselor, a housing specialist, and a health worker. Such integration would make it so the individual or family in need can interact with a coordinated service response right away,rather than the client having to navigate multiple hidebound systems that usually rely on ancient technology.Such a revolutionary change would not be easy or cheap, or perhaps even fully achievable in an eight-year mayoralty. But if we really want to be as efficient as possible with that $3 billion of our tax money that we spend on human services every year, and if we really want to make progress on our great social challenges, we need to start now and take advantage of the astounding new technologies becoming available every day.“Crime and grime” has the advantage of being an easy rhyme to remember. “Crime, grime, and care” offers solutions that previous administrations could only dream of.David Fair was a program director in the city’s Departments of Health, Human Services, and Mental Health from 1996-2005."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_272,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Now that the dust has settled, and the Democratic Party is quickly and forcefully rallying around Vice President Kamala Harris, there remains one nagging question.What took them so long?The party breathed a huge sigh of relief after President Joe Biden announced that he would abandon his re-election campaign and urge the party to unite behind Harris.“I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,” Biden said last week, sounding like John F. Kennedy in his Oval Office address. “That’s the best way to unite our nation.”That was, and should have been the plan all along, only somewhere along the way, a disillusioned Biden convinced himself that he and only he could finish the job he started.But he wasn’t up to the job. We can say that now. Months ago, we could only whisper it, lest we risk offending the Biden faithful, and cast aspersions on the nation’s elderly population.Then came The Debate, the one where we skipped past all the Donald Trump lies and zoomed in on all the Biden miscues, the unfinished sentences, the weak, raspy voice.There would be no coming back from that.“I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term,” Biden said. “But nothing — nothing — can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.”There should be no shame in Biden’s decline. The job has worn down much younger men.Nothing tells that story better than the before and after pictures showing how presidents age under the pressures of the White House.Former President Barack Obama, who was only 55 when he left the White House, tried to blame genetics for the gray that took over his mane.Even one-term presidents like George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter aged before our eyes.Biden is 81 now. How much aging do you think he has done in the last four years?To his credit, Biden did what we asked of him — he sent Trump packing.Anything beyond that, like lowering prescription drug prices, student debt relief and putting a Black woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, was just icing on the cake.Biden was just supposed to be a bridge. But critics said it was beginning to look like a bridge to nowhere.And by waiting so long to step aside, Biden left his successor only weeks to mount a campaign.But wait. That may not be such a bad thing.If Biden had bowed out sooner, there would have been ugly, bitter primary battles, and lots of money spent on divisive campaigns.This way, the party can present a strong candidate, one unburdened by the bruises of a campaign battle.

The Sahan Journal recently covered the opioid crisis in Minnesota, validating the concerns we’ve received from our constituents. This crisis isn’t unique to any state, district, city or neighborhood — and it is certainly far too prevalent in mine.As we search for potential legislative solutions in the coming session, I’ve kept my eye on a piece of federal legislation that could be a lifeline for seniors. The Alternatives to Prevent Addiction in the Nation (PAIN Act is a bipartisan bill that would increase access for seniors to non-opioid pain management options in Medicare Part D. Not only would this bill create access to non-addictive opioid alternatives, it would also ensure that non-opioids would be the same price as a traditional opioid prescription.In everyday conversation, the term opioids is used to describe both illicitly manufactured drugs and prescribed pain relievers like hydrocodone. While opioids can be useful in treating persistent or severe pain, prescription opioids have proven to be a devastating plague on our nation because they are highly addictive. According to the American Medical Association, an estimated 3% to 19% of people who take prescription pain medications develop an addiction to them.While seniors aren’t often associated with the opioid crisis, the group has been significantly impacted. In 2021, over one million seniors were diagnosed with an opioid use disorder and 50,000 seniors suffered an opioid overdose from prescription opioids, illicit opioids or both. Furthermore, overdose deaths among seniors have soared by more than 60% in the last decade.One of the features of the Alternatives to PAIN Act is that a concept known as step therapy would not apply to pain treatments. Step therapy mandates that before your plan will cover a certain drug, you must first try a different or less expensive drug that treats your condition. Given how cheap and accessible opioids are, it is necessary to ensure that they aren’t the default or cheaper option for pain treatment when safer options are available.It’s not just seniors who would benefit from the proposed law. On July 1, the Moran Company released a report suggesting that the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries with opioid use disorder costs $33 billion. By passing this legislation and preventing opioid addiction before it can begin, Congress will save American taxpayers billions each year. While this certainly isn’t my primary reason for supporting the bill, it is important to point out how this legislation will benefit everyone.I am proud of the work the Minnesota Legislature and the state attorney general’s office have done and continue to do to curb the opioid crisis. Before I became a legislator, the attorney general’s office sued pharmaceutical distributors and opioid manufacturers to the tune of $300 million in Minnesota over the next 18 years. The office continues to sue corporations that perpetrated the mass marketing of these harmful drugs. This funding has given us the opportunity to address the crisis right here in Minnesota at the county level, especially the parts of the state that have been hit hardest.And just last year I was proud to support a bill that mandated schools, law enforcement, corrections, substance use disorder treatment programs and sober homes carry naloxone to reduce opioid deaths across the state. These are important steps in protecting Minnesotans from opioids.Our work is far from complete in addressing the opioid crisis as both a state and a nation. As we continue to find innovative solutions to curb the opioid crisis in St. Paul, our Minnesota congressional delegation should work to ensure that this bill is signed into law. While there is certainly more work we can do to curtail our nation’s opioid epidemic, our congressional delegation should jump at the opportunity to pass common sense legislation such as The Alternatives to PAIN Act to protect Minnesota seniors.Samakab Hussein represents District 65A in the Minnesota House of Representatives."

The life cycle can be summed up as follows: Eat. Sleep. Wake up. Go to work. Rinse and repeat. In between and even before and after each, we indulge in a misplaced and misguided pursuit of happiness.The part that breaks my heart in all of this is that we know what we are doing, but we just can’t seem to wake up from this nightmare. We know that we are sacrificing the most precious commodities we have — our health and time — for a dopamine release whose effect is temporary. We scroll through our phones nonstop, watching shows that mean absolutely nothing, listening to songs that are absolutely rubbish, and reading gossip so that we have something to talk about and laugh at with friends. What a sad existence.The fact is, it is not like we don’t have ambitions and dreams that we want to have come to fruition. We all have dreams, but they are just thoughts as long as we lack the loaded gun we need to fire. Discipline. I am guilty as charged, too. We want to become writers, entrepreneurs, designers, lawyers, travelers, motivational speakers, professional players, etc. The list never ends. We will never be able to check off any of these as long as we are indulging ourselves in what the body and mind want — an easy life. We don’t want to put in the work for the things we want to achieve and later wonder what happened to the time we had and where time went.I was delusional myself. Even though I fell into the category I mentioned, I always thought I did not have enough time to do much of what I wanted. I told myself I was busy so I believed in the fact that I was busy. (Gotta confuse yourself before you confuse the enemy . Looking back at it, I was doing busy work and was not busy at all. Had I only scheduled my daily activities, I would have been disciplined.I was presented with countless opportunities to achieve or at least get started on my dreams, but I was lazy (painfully at that and I was afraid of failure if I took the chance. That fatal combination crippled my self-esteem and poisoned my ambitious soul. I got used to staying in my comfort zone and living the mediocre life I had chosen with the mediocre salary I was receiving. I was pleading for a lightning bolt to the head to wake me from the self-induced coma of life I was living. I wanted some sort of awakening. I woke up. Maybe not fully yet, but I am conscious of my life now.I am learning that no one will live my life for me. Tomorrow is not even guaranteed to come. I am learning to seize all the opportunities that come my way. I am learning to carve my path and head in the direction I want to go, fully aware. I believe that life itself is a journey of self-discovery and that it is never too late to change for the better.As long as we have our health and time, we have no excuse not to be successful in life. Success is relative, so you define yours and go after it. I consider wasting time on meaningless things a betrayal to my heart and intellect. I am taking small steps every day to replace bad habits with productive and good ones. I am doing this now in my 20s; so can anyone else. It is never too late to find your way to the destination for which you are meant.Luul Boru, a graduate of the University of Minnesota, is currently a teacher in Kuwait."

Her priority was providing for her family on an annual salary of just $30,000. Drowning in $40,000 of student loan debt, she was forced to drop out of college and work full time.Janelle’s story is all too familiar throughout the U.S. — stuck in a low-paying job, struggling to make ends meet after being failed by college. Roughly40 million Americanshave left college without completing a degree — historically seen as a golden ticket to the middle class.Yet even with a degree, many fall short of economic prosperity.Datafrom 1 in 4 higher education institutions shows that, a decade after enrolling, the average salary for college attendees is less than the average salary of high school graduates.A majority (56% of Americans don’t think that a college degree is worth the cost, a recent survey found. College enrollment dropped by8%from 2019 to 2022, and Americans are sending a clear message: They need and want more options than just a college degree to make a good living. With the average price of tuition and fees across private and public universities increasingover 130%in the last two decades, who can blame them?These factors prompt Americans like Janelle to seek alternative paths into the middle class.As college enrollments fell over the last decade, the number of apprenticeships increased by more than50 percent, andnearly halfof American workers now say they have some form of alternative credentials. Clearly, Americans wantaffordable,fast,flexibleoptions with a highreturn on investment.Policymakers must respond to this overwhelming shift in public opinion and start helping Americans pay for these college alternatives.One approach: Expand the federal Pell Grant program in order to give Americans greater ownership of their education journeys and the financial freedom to pay for alternative programs that lead to a better life.Since itsauthorizationin 1965, Pell has awarded need-based federal financial aid to more than80 millionlow-income students to pay for college. In the 2022-23 academic school year,34%of undergraduate students received a Pell Grant.Yet, research shows that Pell students graduate at a rate of18 percentagepoints less than their non-Pell peers. In short, the large number of Pell aid recipients is not leading to a significantly higher number of lower-income Americans earning college degrees.In its current state, the program is not meeting its founding goals. That’s why it’s time to update this nearly 60-year-old federal program to meet the educational needs and demands of Americans today.During his State of the Union speech, President Bidensignaledhis intent to “continue increasing the Pell Grants to working- and middle-class families” and ensure that college remains affordable. His fiscal year 2025budget proposalincludes a $2.1 billion increase in federal funding as part of the administration’s plan to double the maximum Pell Grant award by 2029.But this doesn’t go far enough. We must also expand this access to Americans like Janelle, who need to be able to pay for short-term, nondegree education options.Thankfully, theBipartisan Workforce Pell Act, expected to be up for a full vote in the House of Representativesthis year,would expand the Pell Grant program to include affordable and flexible short-term career education programs.The bill would also create standards for these programs, to ensure that they provide the training necessary for today’s most in-demand industries and meet employer hiring requirements.Giving Americans more access to educational routes without the high price tag of a four-year degree would create a new, more diverse and skilled talent pool that we could easily connect to employers looking to fill in-demand jobs.This modern talent pool would benefit the entire economy. Manufacturing, for instance, is stillrecoveringfrom the pandemic and is hungry for skilled talent. The National Association of Manufacturers recently projected that roughly2.1 million manufacturing jobscould go unfilled by 2030.Many of these jobs require training beyond a high school diploma, and short-term programs have proven successful at filling that gap. This is particularly important as more sectors become increasingly tech driven. For example, there is a pressing need fordata analytics and digital skillsthat we know can be quickly taught by nondegree programs.The median salary for U.S. high school graduates with no college experience is a little over$44,000— which doesn’t cover the roughly$4,300a month that a single person needs to afford today’s living expenses.Americans who completed programs at the national workforce developmentnonprofitwe run are earning wages that are higher than those of U.S. high school grads without a college degree, according to our latestWage Gain Analysis.In a study of 2018-22 program completers, University of Virginia researchers found that three-plus months after completion, our learners’ average annual wages had increased from $26,000 to $50,000 — more than 92%.These are life-changing wage increases that can help a family afford long-term housing, allow a parent to go from working two jobs to one or enable these Americans to pay for basic medical care.After Janelle completed her training with us and landed a job, her annual wages increased by 66%, and today she’s a successful technical project coordinator earning $50,000 a year. Her career promises continued upward mobility, opening new financial opportunities that seemed unattainable just a few years ago, so that she and her family can thrive.Moving Americans from low-wage jobs into family-sustaining careers is possible. Imagine how many more lives could be changed if we gave more people the power to use federal Pell aid to pay for these pathways.College degrees should remain one of the many learning options available to Americans wanting to further their education. But it’s time for policymakers, workforce development leaders and businesses to advocate for lower-cost, short-term education opportunities, and that starts with passing the Bipartisan Workforce Pell Act.Connor Diemand-Yauman and Rebecca Taber Staehelin are co-CEOs ofMerit America.This commentary originally appeared in The Hechinger Report."

Should you bring a microwave or a mini-fridge? Pro-tip: There are community fridges and microwaves in the halls, so if you do not mind sharing, you can probably do without.We all have our favorite pillow, so this one is key because we want our students to get a good night’s sleep! If our students are coming from a distance, they often plan to purchase things in Hilo or have things delivered. That works, too.When I worked in Illinois, I led a team that “adopted” a residence hall, so we helped with move-in. My hall, the oldest women’s dorm in Illinois, was a beautiful building that had no elevator and no AC, so lugging things up the stairs was an adventure (and a great workout! . It was a tiring but joyous day, as we witnessed students, particularly the new students, prepare for the upcoming year. This same thing will happen this week at UH Hilo, where teams will greet students with aloha, help the residents get settled, and in general share in the excitement of our newest students.A recent article in the New York Times suggested that students might need some other things — phone cards, medical records, an emergency credit card. Some families tuck encouraging notes in their students’ belongings, to be found and opened when they unpack. Others give their student a free pass of sorts. “If you get in trouble, call me and I promise I won’t get mad. Call me so I can help.” There is logic to this: We all hope students will not face any hardships or get involved in something they shouldn’t, but we want them to feel comfortable asking for a lifeline when they need. And of course, our campus has staff who can help in emergencies.Every August, I spend time with families, reassuring them that we have the backs of the students: We know how to deal with natural disasters, pandemics, and all manner of lesser challenges. We understand the trust that families place in us, and we take it seriously.The other thing that students often bring with them is a big bag of advice. Family and friends and teachers all dispense advice, and most of it is quite good. Students will receive even more advice on convocation day from me, from deans, and from staff and faculty. We have all been in their shoes in one way or another, and at least in my case, I have been welcoming students at convocations for over 20 years!Some of the advice has stayed the same, offered before in this very column: Ask questions, get involved, make friends. These are still valuable and relevant. At convocation, several of us will say the same things. It can’t hurt to reinforce good advice, after all.Because we often repeat ourselves, however, I may actually change it up this year. 1. Learn Hawaiian, or, if you are a ‘Olelo speaker, offer to teach someone a few phrases in Hawaiian. As more of us learn more ‘Olelo, we become even more of a community on campus, and we honor our host culture. 2. For students from off-island, take a walk downtown and talk to a shop owner and buy something local if you can. Talking to people who actually live here gives you a different view of our community and shows that you want to be a part of our community while you are here. 3. Most importantly, open your mind to new ideas. Doing this does not mean that you forget who you are or where you came from, but it is the way we learn. More and more employers are looking for the so-called soft skills, and an open mind leads to empathy and understanding of others as well as learning.Hilo is a remarkable place, and at UH Hilo we want our students to emerge as responsible world citizens. Learning language, meeting people, and understanding the world all contribute to making the leaders of tomorrow, both in our community and across the globe.Bonnie D. Irwin is chancellor of the University of Hawaii at Hilo.

That starts with compensating teachers properly.I met Tony B. Watlington Sr. in the dairy section of Whole Foods on Pennsylvania Avenue in November. In the meat section, I introduced my infant son and invited him to visit my classroom. (I left the interaction chagrined when I realizedthe brand nameof the three tubs of almond dip on clearance in my cart was laced with profanity. In late January, my mind instantly returned to this chance meeting with the new superintendent of the Philadelphia School District when I received an email requesting input on the “Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Priority Survey,” stating, “Our responsible use of the federal funding received during the pandemic and post-pandemic years helped lead to lower levels of student learning loss than other large urban districts, balanced budgets and our highest bond ratings in decades.”Recently, a Commonwealth Court judge ruled that Pennsylvania’s school funding system is unconstitutional because it doesn’t provide enough resources to students in Philadelphia and other underserved districts, thus depriving them ofan adequate education.As the impact of this seismic ruling begins to settle and more funding begins to reach struggling districts, I implore Watlington and the School District of Philadelphia to take a few basic steps to make better use of its new — and existing — resources. That starts with compensating teachers properly.Except for an occasional pick-me-up or Amazon return, I don’t go to Whole Foods much. As a teacher, I can’t afford it. My most recent teaching contract increase did not even match the rate of inflation.» READ MORE:Philly educators are leaving at alarming rates. Here are 3 teachers’ stories.Like countless other teachers in the female-dominated industry, the majority of my paycheck goes toward day care ($2,100 per month ; I am still recovering financially from not having a viable maternity leave. Other young teachers send their checks directly to local universities for their required continuing education credits (while continuing to pay off undergraduate loans .To make ends meet, many teachers are balancing multiple jobs or seeking extra employment in the summer months. And, no surprise, research found thatPhilly teachers are leaving the profession at very high rates— higher than the rest of the state, and faster than they can be replaced by new members of the profession.Teachers should be compensated fairly so they can pay for their basic livelihoods.(Yes, teachers get great insurance benefits working in the district. But it only makes logical sense that people working in environmentally unfit conditions — such ascrumbling buildings full of asbestos— should have good medical care. I am good at stretching a buck — my son and I get all of our picture books at a thrift store for 50 cents. My classroom is filled with these findings, as well. We teachers have been doing this for years. Meanwhile, we watch as the district seems to struggle to manage its own internal resources in a smart way.In collaboration with Scholastic, the district is spending half a million dollars toprovide elementary schools with picture books. Bundles of shrink-wrapped new young adult readers lay in my classroom from a summer program that was held at my school but were never used. Watlington’s predecessor, William R. Hite Jr.,spent $600,000 renovating his office, and I can’t help but notice administrators toting costly briefcases and other fancy gear.I have seen portable Smart boards thrown away en masse. I have seen learners go through five Chromebooks in a year due to user damage. There are heavy building operational costs forhalf-empty schools. Some schools lack basic resources, while other buildings are overflowing with unused curricula.The district must get better at managing its internal assets. This is frustrating to watch as a teacher — although we have historically had inequitable funding, as the recent funding lawsuit points out, at times it doesn’t seem like we make responsible investments with the money we have.The district must get better at managing its internal assets.What’s more, we have historically failed to place money closest to the students. The district hasbuilt new headquarters, invested in a myriad of consulting firms for instruction, and appointed costly new administrativepositions. Meanwhile, classrooms continue to be overcrowded and buildingscontinue to be environmentally hazardous.Buying more curricula materials and technology for teachers will not fix many of the district’s systemic issues. We must invest in more teachers in classrooms. We must invest more in safe school buildings. This is what will have the most impact on students.Let me be clear: Even with a fair salary increase, I don’t expect to be making regular trips to Whole Foods anytime soon with a growing toddler and insane milk prices. I don’t expect the district to procure books from the thrift store. But I hope the district will begin financially investing in teachers. I hope the district will start being more judicious with its resources, just as its educators who are on a budget. And as more money comes in, I hope the district starts sending it where it has the most impact on the people who matter most: the students.Lydia Kulina-Washburn is a high school English language arts teacher in the School District of Philadelphia.@LydiaKulina"

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_233,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°“Have you ever heard Donald Trump laugh? I don’t even know if he has any joy in his body.”Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made this remark. It’s an insightful observation that reflects a major characteristic of Trump and how he will govern should he be elected.It is not precisely true that Trump doesn’t laugh. He does smirk and sneer. His amusement seems to take the form of self-congratulation when he denigrates others or when others do the same.Laughter and joy are not measures to be dismissed. They reveal much about an individual’s mindset and mental health.Ronald Reagan knew how to laugh. He and House Speaker Tip O’Neill could laugh at and with each other. Lyndon Johnson was personally known for his sense of humor. A great storyteller, he navigated many an impasse with laughter.Laughter brings people together, signals acceptance, and fosters connection regardless of differences of opinion.Laughter at the expense of others divides. Trump’s smirk is unhealthy. It shows an inability to relate to others’ feelings or to be self-effacing. It compromises his ability to work with others.Trump has called Vice President Kamala Harris’ laugh weird, like a behavior he doesn’t understand. From a psychological perspective, Harris’ laugh is healthy. It reflects confidence and acceptance of herself and others.Trump uses laughter effectively to influence his supporters. His smirk bonds his followers through slurs, insults and prejudice.The power of laughter is evident in Trump’s support. His rallies are filled with laughter — unhealthy laughter. Trump’s one-liners, disparaging his opponents, are the highlight of his events. His grins when the audience responds is about as close to laughter as he can get.Between his exaggerations of greatness and grandiose predictions, his followers are treated to pleasure at the expense of others. Spontaneous laughter is absent, but degrading laughter is abundant.Liberals often fail to realize laughter’s role in elevating Trump to his popularity. Supporters see friendliness, good cheer and camaraderie at his rallies and a bond with neighbors. Laughing together is powerful.Laughter is a behavior and an emotion. Emotions play an enormous role in how voters vote. Republicans took great offense at Hillary Clinton’s words “basket of deplorables” — a comment she believes was distorted. She claimed she was only referring to “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic and Islamophobic,” but it didn’t matter. Accurate or not, the emotions evoked by her words strengthened middle-class division against her and may have cost her the election.In a recent rally in Atlanta, Trump confessed that “I only like people that like me,” a rare expression of his internal feelings. This also reflects another characteristic of the former president — he has few deep friendships.Democrats are now experiencing a candidate who can bring the power of laughter to their party, healthy laughter not based on the denigration of others.Trump recently said, “I call her Laughing Kamala. Ever watch her laugh? She’s crazy. You know, you can tell a lot by a laugh.”Yes, Mr. Trump, you can. And you can tell a great deal about someone who doesn’t know how to laugh except to degrade others.You may soon lose to someone with a healthy laugh.Robert Pawlicki is a retired psychologist and author.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
suffolknewsherald_2024_46,"Published 5:24 pm Tuesday, April 23, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy Jason StumpMatthew 25:35-36, 40 – “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me. … Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”I can’t say that I have a definite favorite Bible passage, but the passage above has undoubtedly influenced my ministry more than any other.Even though church attendance has been in decline since the 1970s, there is no shortage of programming in the Christian church today.There is also an imbalance of practices. Jesus seems to be seen more heavily as some sort of personal spiritual concierge. In some cases, it appears that “personal salvation” is leaned on more as a piece of a marketing plan to fill the pews in a sanctuary or the seats in an auditorium. There’s a consumerism to seeking for and belonging to a church that worries me. The “I’m looking for a church that does what I want it to” questions in online forums are genuine, but also not the same as saying, “I’m looking for a church that does what Jesus taught.” You see, our modern view of thinking about our individualistic and personal faith practices, including a relationship with the Messiah, would be alien to first-century Christians and earlier faith ancestors.Life, especially their faith life, was a communal and social world. You were a part of something but not your own thing. That’s the context Jesus spoke in.Make no mistake, I believe Jesus is the Savior of All the World, and this is life-changing, but Christian scripture tells us so much more about Him. So do sacred texts of other faiths, like The Quran.On occasion, it seems to me like well-meaning folks, and some not so well-meaning, are throwing anything they can against a wall to see what sticks. I admit that I fall into those temptations as well. There are those only coming up with the next “faith fad” in order to profit and meet sales goals, and there are those genuinely trying to reach people in a new way; it can even be a bit of both. Either way, we should use discernment in our faith communities. Have you ever added too much of one thing to a recipe? The balance of flavors that is intended is lost. Let’s not forget that sometimes the best and most comforting, even healing, dishes are made up of only a few ingredients.I’m not here to criticize any church. I spend enough time working on improving my own ministry and my shared ministry with Oakland Christian UCC. But I do have a question or two. I’ll get to them in a bit.I believe that Jesus intended this passage to be instructive. This is what you do as followers of Christ. There certainly may be other things as well, but clearly this is important. In the wider text, He mentions these acts of love four times. It’s not the only place He mentions or demonstrates these types of acts either. We know that. I’m not sharing new information here.He wants us, His followers, to do these things and to do them in communal ways. There’s power in that, efficiency, more benefit to those in need, and that is His heart’s desire.Recently, I attended the Blessings Banquet of the Coalition Against Poverty in Suffolk (CAPS . This event celebrated staff, recognized volunteers, and provided testimony from those who have witnessed the power of communal Christian action in response to Christ’s teachings and commandments.CAPS is a network of churches and organizations working together for poverty alleviation and community development. Since 2012, more than 2,000 individuals have been assisted. Everything from hot meals to shelter to utility bills and budgeting assistance. CAPS not only helps those in poverty but also has helped bridge a gap in financial security that has kept neighbors from entering poverty.It was a wonderful evening! CAPS is a vital resource in our city. However, I couldn’t keep from pondering why, with around 180 churches in Suffolk, there are only 29 member churches. Hopefully, a few more are coming soon! There may be good answers to that question, but I don’t doubt that. Certainly, many churches help in many ways. Yet, with the minimal commitment required and the proven success of CAPS, I would think it’s one place Christ would look to find all of our churches gathered and working together.So, here’s my two questions to Suffolk churches:If not,Maybe I am wrong, but it seems to me that Jesus might be looking for you to be seated at that table.The city will be better if you do, and God will be pleased.To find out more information about becoming a member church of The Coalition Against Poverty in Suffolk, please call 757-935-5497.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

However, this may be changing. Increasingly, the media, pollsters, pundits and campaigns themselves are focusing onindependent voters, saying they will becrucial to the outcomeof the2024 presidential election.But even among political experts, there remains a good deal of disagreement on how many of these voters are out there. It’s possible that some voters identify as independent but really just have weaker political preferences than party die-hards, while still maintaining some loyalty to one party or the other. And some independent voters change their political identification from one cycle to another. That makes it hard to tell who an independent voter is and how many of them exist.Most of what political researchers likemeknow about independents comes from survey data.Though it might seem simple to look at state records of voter registrations, it’s not very useful:Many states requirevoters to declare a party affiliation when they register, though they can also declare that they have no affiliation.And some states require voters to join a major party to be allowed tovote in primaries. But others don’t. And some, like my home state of Arizona, prevent people who register as independents fromvoting in presidential primariesbut let them vote in primaries for other races, so long as they request a ballot from one of the parties.Those different rules mean the numbers from state records are almost certainly not reflective of the true number of people who are independent voters, and they also aren’t reliable indicators of how people might actually vote.Researchers do have two good sources that have tracked political affiliation over a long period of time:Gallup surveys, the famous polling company, andAmerican National Election Studies, a collaboration of universities. The number of independents these surveys report, however, depends on how the surveyors classify independents. But they may not take into account how specific voters’ political preferences change over time.Gallup’s polling operation, whichdates back to the 1930s, tracks which political party American voters support by asking them the question, “In politics, as of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat or an independent?” The voter’s answer is about their present situation and may be different from whatever party affiliation they may have declared when registering to vote — and it may also be different from how they have voted in the past.According to Gallup, political independents constituted the largest political bloc of voters in 2023, with an annual average of 43% of American voters claiming that label. Independents first outnumbered supporters of both major parties in 1991 and have done so since then, except between 2004 and 2008. InMarch 2023, independent voters represented 49% of U.S. adults, more than the two major parties combined.The scholarly classification of voters as independent dates back to the work of Angus Campbell and his colleagues, who first published “The American Voter” in 1960. The surveys that those researchers analyzed for the book have been considered by many to be the gold standard in the field.The source of those surveys was theAmerican National Election Studies program, a collaboration among several research universities. Though officially founded in 1978, the ANES has continuous survey data on the U.S. electorate since 1948. The survey is usually administered every other year but occasionally every fourth year.Since 1952, researchers and pollsters have typically asked a follow-up question to those who identify as independents to determine whether respondents prefer one party over the other if they had to vote. Most independents reported that they lean toward either Democrats or Republicans.So initially, these surveys ask respondents to identify themselves on a three-option scale — Democrat, Republican or independent. But for independents, they probe more deeply, seeking to locate the person being surveyed on a seven-point spectrum between “strong Democrat” and “strong Republican,” with five options in between, to offer a more nuanced look at people’s political preferences.In the 1990s, however, the idea of nuance among independent voters came under scholarly scrutiny. The 1992 book “The Myth of the Independent Voter” argued that there really were only the three main categories and that most people who said they were independentreally preferred one partyor the other.When those independents who report a lean toward a party are counted as supporters of that party, the overall proportion of independents is small — about 10% of the total electorate. That level has remained roughly constant since the 1950s.About two-thirdsof independents lean toward one of the two major political parties’ candidates.However,other scholars, includingme, disagree with the assertion that most independents are really leaning toward a party. We think there is more volatility in their voter patterns when tracked over time.Some researchers have argued that independents’ responses to questions asking whether they lean toward the Democratic or Republican parties aresignificantly affected by short-term factorsrelated to whatever campaign is happening at the time, such as particular candidates and specific issues. This is one reason it would be useful if surveys asked all respondents — not just independents — how closely they identify with one party or the other.In our January 2023 article “The Fluid Voter,” my colleague Dan Hunting and I analyzed ANES data on political identification and voting choices from 1972 to 2020. We observed significant volatility in loyalty to party among independent voters over more than one election. We also found evidence that a sizable number of independents move in and out of independent status from one election to another. We argue there is a need to look at long-term voting behavior of specific voters.So while there’s not consensus on how many independent voters there are in the U.S., their numbers do seem to be growing. The increase may require scholars, media outlets and the public to shift their traditional two-party view of American politics. It’s possible that the long-standing survey questions are no longer — or maybe never were — actually good at identifying political views of independent voters.Thom Reillyis a professor and co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at the School of Public Affairs, Arizona State University.This article is republished from The Conversation."
minnpost_2024_87,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Much is made of vice presidential choices, and Democratic presidential nomineeKamala Harris’ selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walzis no different.Well known forattacking Donald Trump and JD Vance as “weird,”Walz, 60, beat out a competitive field of Democratic options, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.Amoderate Democrat, Walz served as a U.S. representative from 2007 to 2019 and is considered an appealing option for potential independent voters.Harris’ decision comes at a crucial time in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. With less than three months remaining,national polls suggest the race is very close– and Harris believes her choice of vice president will translate to votes in crucial swing states on Election Day.The Conversation U.S. has published numerous stories on vice presidents and whether their selections helped or hurt presidential campaigns. Here are a few of them.As political scientistJoshua Holzernoted, the U.S. Constitution has only afew referencesto the vice presidency.Those references spell out that “the Vice President shall become President” if the presidentbecomes incapacitated, and their main duties include serving as the president of the U.S. Senate who can vote only to break a tie.But as Holzer points out, ties in the Senate have been rare. Since 1789,only 301 tiebreaking voteshave been cast, and 12 vice presidents, including then-Vice President Joe Biden, never cast a single one. Harris holds the record with 33 tiebreaking votes.“Other than staying out of trouble to avoid impeachment and waiting around to serve as – or replace – the president, vice presidents are really only obligated to occasionally cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate,” Holzer wrote. “This means that the great majority of the time, vice presidents have no real job to do.”John Adams, thefirst U.S. vice president, had a similar opinion. He oncecomplained to his wifethat the vice presidency was “the most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived.”As a scholar who studies American politics,Philip Klinknerhas explored how political considerations in selecting a vice president have changed over the years.While there is little evidence that vice presidential candidates help their tickets, a bad pick can hurt the ticket. “Whether Harris decided to play it safe or go bold with her pick, the most important consideration was to do no harm,”Klinkner wrote.With a bad pick, Klinkner explained, the issue isn’t whether the ticket is sufficiently balanced or diverse, but rather whether the candidate was adequately vetted.“The worst picks – Tom Eagleton in 1972, Quayle in 1988 and Palin in 2008 – resulted from hasty and poorly thought out selection processes,” Klinkner wrote.Karyn Amirais a political scientist whose research focuses on the relationship between Donald Trump, the Republican Party and conservatism.Since Trump chose U.S. Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate, it’s been widely reported that Vance once described Trump as “morally reprehensible” and “cultural heroin,” and heprivately comparedhim to Hitler.But the day after Vance won his own Senate race in 2022, he reportedly made it known thathe would support Trumpfor president in 2024 and now says that he wouldnot have readily certifiedthe 2020 election if he had been in Vice President Mike Pence’s shoes.As Amirapointed out, Vance doesn’t represent a swing state. Nor does he have much appeal to MAGA-skeptical independent voters.But people close to Trump call the 39-year-old Vancethe new heirto Trump’s MAGA movement.What can be concluded from Trump choosing Vance?Since 2015, Amira explained, Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party, moving it further from its professed conservative ideology. “The choice of Vance as Trump’s running mate – and the competition that preceded it – are the latest steps in this process,” Amira wrote.Howard Manly is the race and equity editor for The Conversation.This story is a roundup of articles from the archives of The Conversation, where this column first appeared."
minnpost_2024_68,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The Rethinking I-94 project Policy Advisory Committee met Feb. 14 to update officials and the public on the status of the project.Rethinking I-94, a Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT project launched in 2016, will decide the future of the I-94 highway corridor between Minneapolis and St. Paul.At the lastPAC meeting in July 2023, MnDOT released 10 project alternatives that range from a “no build option” to make repairs but largely maintain the highway as is, to an expanded freeway with additional travel lanes, to an “at grade” option that would create a highway-to-boulevard alternative along the corridor.February’s meeting provided updates on the project and engagement efforts throughout the summer and fall. The current stage includes alternatives to understand what proposal best meets the“purpose and need”documents.Related:Fill in the I-94 trench? Add more lanes? Here are the options the state is studying for I-94 between St. Paul & MinneapolisHere are five key takeaways from the meeting:The original project schedule was delayed as MnDOT said it needed more time to engage with communities, meaning the scoping period for the project will stretch into 2025, at which point the project alternatives will be narrowed. The environmental review process will stretch to 2029, and construction will likely begin in the early 2030s. Funding for the project’s implementation will be determined at a future date.MnDOT staff claimed that they had conducted robust engagement with communities along the corridor. They touted their efforts over the summer of 2023, including events, surveys, and stakeholder engagement. However, it is clear that MnDOT has not engaged with the diverse communities along the corridor. Based on its data, only one-third of respondents lived in communities along the corridor, including 691 responses from five zip codes along or near the corridor.Of the respondents, 2,518 were white, compared with only 316 residents of color. The survey was full of jargon, nearly 50 questions long, and not accessible to everyday people who aren’t transportation engineers. White college-educated men ages 25-34 had the highest number of responses, not representative of the corridor’s communities or Minnesota as a whole.Advisory committee members, including Council President Mitra Jalali (St. Paul Ward 4 , Council Member Robin Wonsley (Minneapolis Ward 2 , Commissioner Angela Conley (Hennepin County District 4 , and state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura (House District 63A in Minneapolis all raised concerns about outreach practices, calling for interventions ranging from expanded engagement to bringing in outside specialists who can engage with diverse residents living along the corridors. Making engagement accessible, with plain language and more realistic and understandable renderings, would further this goal.When raising the concern regarding a mismatch in MnDOT’s stated equity goals and outcomes, Councilor Jalali stated,“The PAC keeps acknowledging the lack of equitable engagement and not getting the results. I’m trying to underscore that I am feeling a lot of urgency around that and a desire to immediately address the practice changes that need to happen.”In a departure from previous PAC meetings, the public was only permitted to provide written comments and testimonies during the meeting. PAC meetings are one of the rare opportunities for community members to engage with elected officials and project leaders, making it an essential forum to voice perspectives and concerns. While written testimony is also valuable, the town hall forum element of this process holds critical importance, especially where project outreach fell short. MnDOT should allow public testimony at future meetings and reduce barriers to participation for people of diverse backgrounds.Many of the advisory committee members stated that their constituents had overwhelmingly opposed highway expansion along I-94. Commissioner Angela Conley echoed her constituents in fighting highway expansion, saying “ … nobody wants an expanded freeway. None of my constituents. And a lot of them are reaching out.”MnDOT’s continued inclusion of highway expansion plans also directly contradicts resolutions passed byMinneapolisandSt. Paulin 2021, which both stated their opposition to the highway’s expansion. When pressed on the matter, project leads reiterated their desire to study the entire range of options despite this proposal being directly at odds with feedback from elected officials and community members and inconsistent with MnDOT’sVehicle Miles Traveledreduction targets.Council Member Robin Wonsely captured this, stating, “… if anything, there has been a centralized conversation around how we pursue other alternatives, like highway removal.” Wonsley and other PAC members called for better communication about the at-grade proposal to expand public awareness of an option beyond our current familiarity with freeways. This confusion stems from MnDOT’s communications around the project option, where the at-grade proposal and highway removal are painted as separate possibilities but used interchangeably in the discourse around the project.Wonsley elaborated, stating, “… I will once again reiterate, I was very concerned to hear staff say that highway removal was not considered because it’s not in alignment with the project … I absolutely think that’s an inaccurate statement to make, especially when you have something somewhat similar included in the project options . I don’t know if it’s a redirection or a co-opting of language to not say removal because of the political implications of it.” MnDOT’s communication mismatch creates confusion and distracts from the momentum to repairhistoricandongoing harmsby replacing the highway with an alternative like theTwin Cities Boulevardcommunity vision led byOur Streets Minneapolis.MnDOT officials spent the last section of the meeting discussing examples of highway capacity reductions. This presentation was unfocused, creating more communication woes by listing highway projects from around the country that ranged from minor roadway adjustments to highway removals. These examples includedRochesterandSyracuse, New York, andDuluth, Minnesota, but little context was given and MnDOT officials upsold differences to make these examples seem less feasible despite their merits.Next StepsTechnical activities in the coming months will include refining and evaluating project alternatives and developing draft scoping documents. Engagement is also set to continue, without concrete steps to ensure more representative and equitable results. The PAC will meet again later this year as the Rethinking I-94 project continues, but it is clear that significant procedural changes are necessary at MnDOT to ensure equity and the success of the project.Joe Harrington is a student and writer in St. Paul who focuses on urban geography, transportation and environmental policy.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_83,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Three months ago, following last summer’s congressional hearings on UFOs, the Pentagon’s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office issued a 63-page report evaluating almost 80 years of evidence. Its conclusion — not altogether surprising, given the name of the office — can be summarized as follows: Not much to see here. Please move on.(The actual language from the report: “AARO has not discovered any empirical evidence that any sighting of a UAP represented off-world technology or the existence a classified program that had not been properly reported to Congress.” The Senate Intelligence Committee isn’t buying it. The Intelligence Authorization Act , which it passed this month, among other things calls for review of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office. The bill would also limit research into what are now called UAPs (for unidentified anomalous phenomena unless Congress is informed and add whistleblower protections for anyone who might wish to step forward and speak their minds.Less plausible claims about UAPs have been achieving greater circulation in part because of the efforts of David Grusch, who testified before Congress last year about hidden alien bodies, crashed vehicles and secret conspiracies. Those claims, which primary witnesses have not corroborated, defy belief, and the ensuing controversy has helped make concerns about UAPs appear silly.Nonetheless, the truth remains that there are systematic sightings and sensor data of fast-moving entities that the government cannot explain. You don’t have to think they are space aliens to realize that they are threats to national security. At the very least, the mere fact that some experienced military pilots entertain the more speculative alien-linked hypotheses suggests that the military is not processing information effectively. Does it make anyone feel better when reports from pilots are dismissed as crazy?UAPs will remain an issue as long as China and Russia (and possibly other nations remain national security threats, because the US military will always want to identify possible entrants to its airspace. No report or bureaucratic process can make those concerns go away. And so there is a kind of paralyzed equilibrium, where a very strong force — the desire to know — has met an immoveable object — a lack of knowledge.In this sense, the frustration of the Senate Intelligence Committee — as expressed by its unanimous 17-0 vote — is understandable. The Pentagon’s report presents many of the weaker UAP allegations and notes that there is no serious evidence to back them up. And it simply dismisses some of the stronger UAP puzzles, such as the Nimitz or Gimbal incidents.It is not until Page 26 that the report concedes: “A small percentage of cases have potentially anomalous characteristics or concerning characteristics. AARO has kept Congress fully and currently informed of its findings. AARO’s research continues on these cases.” Those sentences should have been on the first page, and then the report should have presented the evidence about those cases. If this were an undergraduate term paper, I would have given it a D+.The chatter among insiders, some of which surely reaches senators, is that some of the data is very hard to explain. Some people, such as John Brennan, former head of the CIA, have even speculated that the available evidence might imply contact with a non-human civilization. Agree or disagree, the admission is a marker of our ignorance.The conspiracy, to the extent there is one, is not to suppress evidence of different life forms; it is to avoid admitting the embarrassing absence of any real answers. So at the very least, the Senate Intelligence Committee deserves credit for reopening the issue.It can be hard to wrap your head around such huge questions. People are often more concerned with dismissing the possibility of alien life than with admitting the possibility of genuine uncertainty. And since even partial evidence of aliens might scare the public too much, there is an overriding incentive to keep matters under wraps.When I think about all this, I try to keep two questions separate. First, is there a major puzzle to account for? And second, what is the best explanation for that puzzle? It helps to focus on the first question in isolation, since we can’t seem to keep our heads on straight when it comes to the second.By admitting that there is a real puzzle to be solved, the Senate Intelligence Committee has moved decisively to answer the first question. Once we clarify exactly what the puzzle is, maybe we’ll be able to make some progress explaining it.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt."
minnpost_2024_114,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Since PresidentJoe Biden’s disastrous presidential debateon June 27, 2024, election news coverage has focused on one question: Will he remain in the race?This focus has been apparent to even the most casual of news consumers. Journalist Jennifer Schulzeobserved that, as of the morning of July 5, the New York Times had published nearly 200 pieces on Biden’s debate performance, comprising 142 news articles and 50 opinion pieces.In comparison, the historian Heather Cox Richardson wrote that Trump was covered in only 92 stories during that same period.“Although Trump has frequently slurred his words or trailed off while speaking and repeatedly fell asleep at his own criminal trial,”Richardson pointed out, “none of the pieces mentioned Trump’s mental fitness.”As the flood of reporting continues on whether or not Biden will or should remain as the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, members of the public have been asking a different question:How did all the journalists get on the same page so quickly?The intensity with which journalists have been reporting on this story and, more importantly, the consistency with which journalists have been framing it, have led some to wonder if the news media as a wholeis on a crusadeto end Biden’s campaign.Some thinkthat journalists and newsroom managers are conspiring to bring Biden down as a means to increase the odds of defeating Donald Trump, whom they see as an existential threat to American democracy.Others think journalists are unfairly focused on Biden’s age out of some warped sense of covering “both sides,” despite the fact that, from their perspective, Trump’s debate performance was filled with “lies, hyperbole, bigotry, ignorance, and fear mongering.”There is a far simpler explanation for why news coverage surrounding Biden’s debate performance looks the way it does. Journalists want to do stories that the public will find valuable and that their audiences will find interesting.The Biden story is both.At a moment ofdeep distrust in journalism, there exists a widespread belief that journalists present the news in biased and overly sensational ways.People who detectpolitical biasin the news assume journalists are trying to push an unsuspecting public to embrace certain political views and reject others.Those who detect sensationalismin the news assume journalists – and news organization owners – care more about making money from audience attention than the accuracy or quality of their reporting.Journalism skeptics who have been observing the coverage after the debate have consequently concluded that journalists are trying to turn the public against Biden so that he drops out of the race. Former journalism professor Dan Gillmor, for example,recently wrotethat The New York Times “has been on a campaign to make sure Joe Biden won’t have another term in the White House.”Yet studies of journalists’ values and practices tell a different story.First, when it comes to reporting, journalists value sudden turns of events – also known as “timeliness.” They especially value those that unfold in a very public way – known as “spectacle.” The debate offered both. Until then, journalists and the public alike hadn’t regularly monitored or covered Biden’s age, other than a few notable outlets, such asThe Wall Street Journal. The debate offered a live opportunity for the world to see firsthand why there have been concerns about electing an 81-year-old to a second term.Second, journalistsdepend on sourcesfor their reporting. Unsurprisingly, as soon as Biden’s halting debate performance began, political reporters beganhearing from panicked insiders, who appear to have jump-started the “replacing Biden” discussion.As ascholar who explores the relationship between journalism and the public, I believe these sources are venting to journalists as a way to keep the spotlight on this news story. That’s a major part of the reason for this coverage, which each day seems to bring with it fresh quotes, leaks and scoops about Biden’s age from people involved in Democratic Party politics.Of course, journalists do not simply transcribe quotes and distribute them to the public. They and their editors decide whether – and how much – to cover a story.Asmy own research has shown, journalists try to strike a balance between what the public “wants” and what the public “needs” – sometimes known within journalism as giving the audience their “vegetables” along with their candy.Most journalists and their editors care deeply about producing valuable news that will galvanize the public around a cause and lead to a change in public policy. Why else would they work in such anunstableandpoorly paidprofession?Yet journalists also assume that these “important” news stories are rarely going to be as popular as more entertaining fare.The current Biden story is different.Until now, interest in the presidential election has been conspicuously low. While subscriptions to The New York Timesskyrocketedfollowing Trump’s election in 2016, the public has beenfar less interestedin following the news during this election cycle.An April NBC News poll showed that, in 2024, interest in the presidential election hadhit a nearly 20-year low.The debate offered something that had been missing from the election so far: a sense of uncertainty. That’s because the story itself has everything journalists want. It’s interesting, timely and easily reported using various sources. As long as there are incremental developments to report on, then being interesting, timely and easily reported will keep a story in the news for a long time, as seen with the ongoing coverage surroundingthe coronarivus pandemic. Plus,audiences are invested in it. And no one knows how it will turn out.Until Biden drops out or it becomes clear that he will remain the party’s nominee, Americans will continue to be inundated with news coverage about everything from hiscampaigningtoDemocratic donors’maneuvering to get him out or keep him in the race to investigations into the extent to which Biden’s age has beenaffecting his performance as president so far.Americans will also continue to seehand-wringing about this coverage, specifically that it comes at the expense of other coverage or that it runs the risk of affecting the very story it’s meant to illuminate.As this unfolds, news consumers would all do well to keep in mind that this reporting is unlikely the result of a conspiracy among journalists and their managers to change the outcome of the election.It is likelier the result of a consensus among political journalists and their sources that this is an important and fascinating story.It’s certainly one I intend to follow.Jacob L.

philinquirer_2024_0,"DEI is under attack, but in medicine, I believe it saves lives. My Black patients feel like they can trust me more than my white colleagues, which helps facilitate high-quality care. “I am so happy to have a Black doc! I feel seen!” A Black patient warmly said this to me as I walked into their hospital room.I acknowledged his statement with a smile and a humble thanks and proceeded with my care for him.As a Black female physician in Philadelphia, this experience happens to me on a weekly — if not a daily — basis. It is a shared experience amongst many Black doctors.And is it any wonder? Many Black people remain uneasy when receiving medical care, given the racial history of medicine.They’ve heard aboutresearch done decades ago at the Tuskegee Institutein Alabama, in which doctors didn’t treat syphilis in hundreds of Black men to study the disease’s natural course. They’ve heard aboutthe case of Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman with a tumor whose tissue samples were taken without her consent, and have since been used bytens of thousands of labsaround the world, promptingher family to sue for compensation.However, when a Black patient has a Black doctor, that unease diminishes. They feel seen.My Black patients feel like they can trust me more than my white colleagues. It’s a simple thing, but it helps facilitate high-qualitycare.Yet, diversity in medicine is being threatened by the proposal of a new bill to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI initiatives in medicine,known as the EDUCATE Act. Last month, Rep. Greg Murphy (R., N.C. — a former doctor, no less — proposed that all race-based mandates at medical schools and accredited institutions be banned nationally.“Diversity strengthens medicine, but not if it’s achieved through exclusionary practices,” Murphysaid in a statement. “Medicine is about serving others and doing the best job possible in every circumstance. We cannot afford to sacrifice the excellence and quality of medical education at the hands of prejudice and divisive ideology.”This move is part of a larger backlash against DEI initiatives in all areas of life, with some claiming these programs were even to blame after adoor panel blew out of an Alaska Airlinesflight in midair. DEI’s critics echo Murphy, claiming DEI practices are racist against white people, and reduce quality because organizations worried about racial quotas won’t always hire the most qualified person for the job.These critics are wrong.Critics are wrong.DEI initiatives are not “exclusionary practices,” as Murphy claims. They are inclusionary practices to ensure those who look like me can be part of our chosen field.Take medicine, for example. As a profession, it has anabysmally low representation of people of color. Here in Pennsylvania,only 4% of physicians are Black, though 11% of the population is Black. Thesestatistics are mirrored nationally.All of this has an impact on patient health. Having Black physicians not onlyincreases patient trust and satisfactionbut alsoimproves outcomes for Black patients. Recent data have shown that in U.S. counties with 10% more Black primary care physicians, Black residents’ life expectancy is an average of30 days longer than that of Black people living in counties withfewer Black physicians. Moreover, Black patients who receive care from a Black doctor are more likely to follow up with their yearly health screenings andagree to recommended care.In short: Increasing the diversity of physicians will improve — not sacrifice — patient outcomes.» READ MORE:‘A Black guy’ didn’t cause Boeing’s midair blowout. Capitalism did. | Will BunchWhat’s more, medical students who attend a diverse medical schoolfeel better equipped to treat patients of different ethnic backgrounds, no matter their own race. In addition, clinicians who are part ofdiverse medical teams learn more and have better patient outcomes. Medical schools with diverse students train better all-around clinicians ready to care for anyone, including patients who do not look like them.Supporting diversity in medicine is beneficial for patients and physicians alike.However, medical institutions have historically struggled with increasing diversity in medicine — which isn’t a huge surprise, given how expensive it is to obtain a medical degree.

suffolknewsherald_2024_11,"Published 4:50 pm Tuesday, July 16, 2024ByEd PughOn a humid Saturday, Grammy-award-winning country music artist Sam Hunt brought his Locked Up Tour to Virginia Home Loans Amphitheater in Virginia Beach with support artists George Birge and Russell Dickerson. Despite that dense humidity, concertgoers were treated to a high-energy country music spectacular. The July 13 show was the sixth stop on the tour, which began on June 28 in Bend, Oregon.Hunt sent the more than 10 thousand in attendance home, buzzing with excitement.The parking area resembled a tailgate before a college-football game, complete with pop-up tents, wafts of food cooking on grills, drinks, and familiar tailgate games like cornhole and ladder toss, setting the stage for what turned out to be an absolute dance party, both on stage and in the seats.Most people will remember Saturday, July 13, as the night of the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump’s life at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. As the news of the shooting began to filter throughout the amphitheater, fans already seated waiting for Birge to kick off the show were seen talking among themselves, sharing their phone screens with the various updates posted on the internet. None of the artists mentioned the incident, but as Hunt moved into his final song, he acknowledged the crowd trying to get a ‘USA’ chant going and welcomed them to start as they prepared for the final song, ‘Once Birge hit the stage and the first few notes of Gavin DeGraw’s ‘I Don’t Want Be’ started playing, the news out of Pennsylvania was an afterthought.The Austin, Texas native expressed his appreciation and strong connection with Virginia Beach, telling the crowd it was the first market to play his song on the radio. He also told the already charged-up crowd he was playing a brand new song called ‘Missin’ Tonight.’ A teaser for the song was filmed before the show and posted on Birges’ Instagram account.“This is the first city in America to ever play my songs on the radio,” Birge told the charged-up crowd. “ … Virginia Beach kind of feels like a second home, so it’s good to see some familiar faces out there, too,” Birge said. “And because this town’s been so good to me, I want to play y’all something brand new. We just wrote this, it’s not even out yet.”The short, 30-minute set was the perfect primer for the middle act, another of country music’s multiplatinum stars, Russell Dickerson, who called his stage show an R&B party and delivered.Donning a Brooks and Dunn T-shirt, Dickerson kicked off the party appropriately with the song he recorded with Florida Georgia Line, ‘It’s About Time,’ causing the packed pit area to raise their cups, signaling a party had officially begun.An already drenched Dickerson acknowledged the heat before breaking into his new single, ‘Bones.’“I haven’t believed in a song like this since my very first single I ever put out,” Dickerson said. “So I’m just gonna play my brand new single that came out literally less than 24 hours ago … This song, I wrote for my beautiful wife.”After a couple of his hit ballads and shouting out his sister-in-law in the crowd celebrating her 40th birthday, Dickerson picked the intensity back up with ‘My Girls Night Out,’ mixed with covers of Cyndi Lauper’s ‘Girls Just Want to Have Fun’ and Whitney Houston’s 1987 smash hit ‘I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me .Dickerson was the perfect choice to loosen the crowd for headliner Sam Hunt, who also brought incredible energy and crowd participation and even a brief run through the venue during his performance of ‘House Party.’ Jumping into the right side of the pit and running behind the 100 section and back onto the stage.Like Birge and Dickerson, Hunt gave the audience a reason to dance in their seats with his new song, ‘Country House,’ which he says is about getting back out into the country.Hunt gave his audience plenty of chances to sing along during his 21-song set, but when Hunt broke into a cover of the John Denver classic ‘Take Me Home, Country Roads,’ the whole venue erupted.That led Hunt into a two-song acoustic set, with his second Billboard Hot Country Songs number one song, ‘Take Your Time.’Hunt said he tries to put truth into his music and ‘Cop Car,’ — the second acoustic version of the night — was the most truthful of any song he has written.“I try to put some truth in all the songs that I write, but this song here, this next song, is probably the truest song that I ever wrote,” Hunt said. “It’s about an experience I had down in Birmingham, Alabama, back when I was in college.”Hunt went on to tell a story about taking a girl to a spot near the airport where a portion of the fence was cut out to watch airplanes take off.“Everything was going according to plan,” Hunt chuckled. “We were having a good time, but before the night was over with, we both ended up in the back of a police car. The silver lining is the officer gave us a hard time for about 20 minutes and ended up letting us go … But fast forward eight or nine years later, I ended up marrying the girl who I spent the evening in the back of a police officer car.”Appropriately, that led into the title track from his latest EP, ‘Locked Up,’ a glimpse of Hunt’s road to redemption following his November 2019 DUI arrest and its impact on his marriage.Hunt kicked the energy to a maximum with six up-tempo songs to finish the hour-and-a-half set. If you can catch any of the remaining legs of the Locked Up Tour, whether you are a fan of the genre or not, this one will leave you wanting more.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Geoengineer David Keith suggests we might cool Earth and combat climate change by releasing sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere.In 2018, here in Puna where I live, the volcanic eruption released much sulfur dioxide. One reason why people in Lava Zone 1 had to evacuate was because of the rise in sulfur dioxide in our air.In fact, the Department of Health set up monitors for this gas as it can be harmful to health, even though the one monitor in Leilani Estates, site of the eruption, was disrupted by the lava. Oh, well!At our home, the leaves on all our plants, save the hapu‘u, were gone.Gone! It was amazing to see the jungle without any green leaves!But all the leaves came back, and today I look out my window and see the jungle restored to its green glory. Our metal roof did not fare so well and had to be replaced due to damage from the altered gases in our atmosphere of the time.Dr. Keith could do well to study the temperature and gas emissions data of our lava eruption of 2018 and probably lean a lot. I wonder if the temperature of Puna dropped for awhile after the 2018 eruption.I suggest that the gases emitted during our eruption were more than sulfur dioxide — a more “natural” mix, if you will, and that releasing only sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere would be like a human taking a single nutrient supplement rather than a whole natural food diet that contains all essential nutrients, in balance.Just some thoughts.A.

philinquirer_2024_53,"DEI is under attack, but in medicine, I believe it saves lives. My Black patients feel like they can trust me more than my white colleagues, which helps facilitate high-quality care.“I am so happy to have a Black doc! I feel seen!” A Black patient warmly said this to me as I walked into their hospital room.I acknowledged his statement with a smile and a humble thanks and proceeded with my care for him.As a Black female physician in Philadelphia, this experience happens to me on a weekly — if not a daily — basis. It is a shared experience amongst many Black doctors.And is it any wonder? Many Black people remain uneasy when receiving medical care, given the racial history of medicine.They’ve heard aboutresearch done decades ago at the Tuskegee Institutein Alabama, in which doctors didn’t treat syphilis in hundreds of Black men to study the disease’s natural course. They’ve heard aboutthe case of Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman with a tumor whose tissue samples were taken without her consent, and have since been used bytens of thousands of labsaround the world, promptingher family to sue for compensation.However, when a Black patient has a Black doctor, that unease diminishes. They feel seen.My Black patients feel like they can trust me more than my white colleagues. It’s a simple thing, but it helps facilitate high-qualitycare.Yet, diversity in medicine is being threatened by the proposal of a new bill to ban diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI initiatives in medicine,known as the EDUCATE Act. Last month, Rep. Greg Murphy (R., N.C. — a former doctor, no less — proposed that all race-based mandates at medical schools and accredited institutions be banned nationally.“Diversity strengthens medicine, but not if it’s achieved through exclusionary practices,” Murphysaid in a statement. “Medicine is about serving others and doing the best job possible in every circumstance. We cannot afford to sacrifice the excellence and quality of medical education at the hands of prejudice and divisive ideology.”This move is part of a larger backlash against DEI initiatives in all areas of life, with some claiming these programs were even to blame after adoor panel blew out of an Alaska Airlinesflight in midair. DEI’s critics echo Murphy, claiming DEI practices are racist against white people, and reduce quality because organizations worried about racial quotas won’t always hire the most qualified person for the job.These critics are wrong.Critics are wrong.DEI initiatives are not “exclusionary practices,” as Murphy claims. They are inclusionary practices to ensure those who look like me can be part of our chosen field.Take medicine, for example. As a profession, it has anabysmally low representation of people of color. Here in Pennsylvania,only 4% of physicians are Black, though 11% of the population is Black. Thesestatistics are mirrored nationally.All of this has an impact on patient health. Having Black physicians not onlyincreases patient trust and satisfactionbut alsoimproves outcomes for Black patients. Recent data have shown that in U.S. counties with 10% more Black primary care physicians, Black residents’ life expectancy is an average of30 days longer than that of Black people living in counties withfewer Black physicians. Moreover, Black patients who receive care from a Black doctor are more likely to follow up with their yearly health screenings andagree to recommended care.In short: Increasing the diversity of physicians will improve — not sacrifice — patient outcomes.» READ MORE:‘A Black guy’ didn’t cause Boeing’s midair blowout. Capitalism did. | Will BunchWhat’s more, medical students who attend a diverse medical schoolfeel better equipped to treat patients of different ethnic backgrounds, no matter their own race. In addition, clinicians who are part ofdiverse medical teams learn more and have better patient outcomes. Medical schools with diverse students train better all-around clinicians ready to care for anyone, including patients who do not look like them.Supporting diversity in medicine is beneficial for patients and physicians alike.However, medical institutions have historically struggled with increasing diversity in medicine — which isn’t a huge surprise, given how expensive it is to obtain a medical degree.

minnpost_2024_115,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Contrary to what many think when it comes to leadership, it’s never supposed to be about you. If that is the case, neither Donald Trump or Joe Biden are fit to be president.For more than 25 years I have taught ethics and done ethics training or consulting. My clients have included public, private and nonprofit organizations, ranging from Fortune 500 to mom and pop organizations. Across them all there’s a common warning sign when there is something wrong with the organization. It occurs when somebody in a leadership position says something to the effect: “This organization couldn’t exist without me.” Once I hear that I know something is wrong. That person is incapable of separating out what’s in the best interest of the organization versus their own personal self-interest.At this point, I advised him to quit.I am not alone in this assessment.Marilyn Fischerwrote“Ethical Decision Making in Fundraising,” where she set up a framework to assess what is ethical for an organization when soliciting money. She poses three questions:What is powerful about Fischer’s three questions is that it always starts first with the question of mission. If one cannot argue that a choice furthers the mission of the organization, stop. It would be the wrong choice to go forward. Second, you then look at how a choice impacts stakeholders. Stakeholders could be your customers, it could be your employees, or it could be the general public. If you cannot argue that it furthers a good relationship with them, stop.Finally the question is about you. If the decision is good for the organization and stakeholders but you cannot ethically live with it you have a choice: Live with it or find another job.Fischer’s three questions separate out what is good for the organization and stakeholders versus the self. It prioritizes the former while placing you last. Unfortunately, for many people, they get it in reverse. They think in terms of what’s good for them ahead of the mission or stakeholders. That is the source of all the problems when it is about you and not the organization.Leadership is not about you. You come last. This is the argument among the best authors of leadership includingJames MacGregor Burns,James Kouzes and Barry Posner,Selena Rezvani, andBill George.How does this apply to Trump and Biden? For both of them, their candidacies are about them. It is not about the good of the nation or of their parties.Consider for example, a statement byDonald Trumpin assessing himself as a candidate:“I’m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I’ve said a lot of things… I know what I’m doing and I listen to a lot of people, I talk to a lot of people and at the appropriate time I’ll tell you who the people are. But I speak to a lot of people. My primary consultant is myself, and I have, you know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.”Similarly, Joe Biden, when interviewed byGeorge Stephanopoulosafter his disastrous debate, was asked what if he stayed in the race but nonetheless lost to Donald Trump?“I feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as a job as I know I can do (sic , that’s what this is about,” Biden said.Neither Biden nor Trump are self-reflective and self-aware of the problems their candidacies bring to the U.S. or their political parties. Neither of them are putting what’s good for the United States, or what’s good for their party ahead of them. Both of them are confusing what’s in their own self-interest with what’s in the greater interest of America and their party.This is the ethical problem that they both face. Were I advising them I would say it’s time for you to quit.David Schultz is a distinguished professor at Hamline University. He teaches in political science, legal studies and environmental studies."
philinquirer_2024_1,"A divided America needs more eclipses. Unfortunately, the next one on the continental U.S. isn’t until 2044.LAKE WAPPAPELLO, MO. — Before I was shaken awake by darkness, I was just one of a swarm, a crowd of humans walking down a hill from the parking lot to the lake’s edge. We had driven for hours through the rural wilderness to get here, past fields growing crops I cannot name and through roads so remote they don’t have names, just letters of the alphabet. The traffic thickened near the state park’s gate.The procession to the path of totality felt like the tailgate before a big game. People had wagons full of drinks and barbecue supplies. Folding chairs and picnic blankets abounded. Some had brought colanders from their kitchens to see the sun with chunks taken out of it by the moon. Others had elaborate camera lenses and tripods. I brought an orange, two bottles of water, a Frisbee, my notebook, eclipse glasses, and a desire to experience whatever show the sun and moon and planets would provide.At first, the crowd was tentative. We kept our distance, pods of families and friends strewed on blankets and towels. But then, in line for the porta potty, I started talking with a dad from Washington state who had driven to Missouri for the eclipse, stopping to visit his daughter in Denver on the way. This wasn’t his first time; the copious supplies in his backpack showed that he knew what he was doing.We settled beside the lake and started to throw the Frisbee for the dog, waiting. A family next to us played volleyball. It was delicious to be gathered with strangers for nothing other than the simple reason of being in awe of the sky. That kind of unity is hard to replicate.In the hours of waiting, I started talking to others assembled in the crowd. Kendra and Peter from Iowa had an elaborate folding rocking chair and looked so completely at ease next to each other, not tearing their gaze from the sky. A whole family from Wisconsin, three generations, including an infant, were replicating the colander trick with a piece of paper that had been hole-punched and cast shadows on their blanket. A grandmother from Alabama had driven her grandkids here just to see an eclipse together in her lifetime.Everything was beginning to feel so normal that the hurtling plunge of totality was akin to a slap. And for those four weightless minutes, we were transported into a different world.It was so dark, darker than I could believe.A sudden coldness in the air on my skin made me stand up straighter. The wind kicked up and blew my hair back. The shadow of the moon was over us as colors faded to gold and gray. We could see the biggest corona, a ring of light, irregular, strong, tendriled, dancing outward from the black hole where the sun used to be. And the sun felt larger than it ever has; I could almost reach out and touch the flares.I started to holler, unable to control the noises coming from my mouth. Time turned on its head. I cried and I danced barefoot in the grass. I shouted and whooped and spun.Annie Dillard, in heressay about the 1979 eclipsein Washington state, perhaps says it best: “Seeing a partial eclipse bears the same relation to seeing a total eclipse as kissing a man does to marrying him, or as flying in an airplane does to falling out of an airplane. Although the one experience precedes the other, it in no way prepares you for it.”I wasn’t ready. There was no way to be. Seeing a total eclipse is not some flight of astrological fancy, but instead a life-changing experience, one that emphasizeshow united we are on the surface of this planet we call home.In a time of disunity, after perilous elections and a global pandemic, it’s a message of togetherness our country needs now more than ever.Yes, there were Trump signs in the Missouri farming towns I had driven through, but out by the lake, politics didn’t matter. We were gathered to participate in an intricately choreographed togetherness, one contingent on a precise alignment of our hurtling through outer space. What would it take, I wonder, to replicate that feeling without the confluence of the sun and moon?It’s abnormal to feel one’s smallness in this world — combined with a deep well of interconnectedness with another and the entire cosmos. I am merely human. I get caught up in my own heartbreaks, my own pains, failure, the mundane stuff of living. The sun rises and the sun sets. I am used to the predictable rhythm of living.Yet in those minutes of totality, darkness in the bright afternoon, I hugged a stranger. I hugged my dog. I felt completely outside of myself, as if I was seeing my body from above, whirling, luminous — and how wonderful does that feel? I was one with the sun and the moon and the lake and the hundreds of people around me, all of us focused on one point of massive black in the middle of a ring of light. And I could see other planets laid out in the sky, too: a three-dimensional model of what it looks like to peer into the solar system. Someone next to me shouted that it was Venus. And was that Saturn, too?When the lights turned back on, totality over, I felt deflated, like when the overhead brights turn on at the end of a dance party that I never wanted to end. Last call. The planets were gone. I kept the eclipse glasses on my eyes, hoping to recapture some of that feeling, the improbability of all of it. But like all joys, it ended.Nothing gold can stay. The sun returned to its normal brightness and we drove away, part of a procession back to our respective states, wondering: Did this all really happen? And how could we ever be the same?That circle of darkness is seared in my memory now. I want more. I understand why a crazed group of explorers travels the world chasing eclipses. Totality is a rush that my body is still making sense of, and that I won’t soon forget.But what will stand out from those precious moments at Lake Wappapello State Park in Missouri is not the corona of the sun — magnificent as it was — nor the small bites of light that the moon took out of our nearest star for the hours before and after, ravenous. Instead, it’s the community that formed around a shared experience.Liv from Colorado, adjacent to us, offered the biggest hug in the darkness and said: “Isn’t it beautiful?”In her embrace and in her question, I realized that I needed to have that beauty magnified back at me. We needed to reassure each other that the eclipse was real. As if to say: Did you see that? Did you know that the wild miracle of being alive in this moment together is just, for lack of a better word, divine?In this moment — a fraught election year, wars raging abroad, democracy at stake — fear is more accessible than love. It’s easy to be afraid of one another. Cultivating trust with strangers is another challenge entirely. It’s much, much easier to turn away from the hard work of seeing one another.Yet as I continue to make sense of the minutes I felt outside of myself under a darkened sky, I have to ask: What will it take to keep this feeling alive? To know, truly, that our neighbors are just like ourselves?America needs more eclipses. Unfortunately, thenext one on the continental U.S. isn’t until 2044.An alignment of the earth and the sun and the moon can jolt us into a shared reality. But we can get there another way — by learning a different way of seeing: one that prioritizes shared experiences over sterile pandemic bubbles, the great expanse of the sky over the smallness of screens, and generosity over all else.That kind of beloved community is always available, just behind the curtain of light."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_265,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Not long ago, a millennial father of two in the Midwest whom I interviewed was convinced that many of our elected leaders like to feast on the flesh of children. He feared that the world was at the mercy of a depraved club of the richest and most powerful among us, one armed with space lasers and clones.Most shocking to those who knew him weren’t the conspiracy theories themselves. It was that he had come to believe them. Nearing 40 years old, he was a college-educated, upstanding guy with friends, a family and an established career. How, they wondered, had this perfectly sane person gone crazy?It’s a question more and more Americans are asking about their own loved ones. As disinformation permeates our culture, the road to QAnon-type territory is getting shorter. Healthy skepticism easily gives way to undue suspicion. The dizzying public reaction to Donald Trump’s near-assassination was a perfect illustration: Observers across the political spectrum raced to fill the information void with baseless assertions that have gained momentum despite mounting evidence to the contrary, revealing a nation increasingly at odds with reality.The statistics are as stunning as the falsehoods. Millions of people now believe that the government, media and financial worlds are “controlled by Satan-worshiping pedophiles,” according to recent polling. These aren’t loosely held views. While reporting for my book “The Quiet Damage,” I talked to people all over the country who had tried until they were blue in the face to make the conspiracy theorists in their lives accept the truth.But the truth is almost beside the point.It seems entirely sensible to fight fiction with fact. In spite of passionately professed allegiances to “the truth,” however, ardent conspiracy theory adopters seldom have a desire to be accurately informed. Belief in the unbelievable, in many cases, stems from desperation to meet fundamental human needs, such as feeling valued and having a purpose. Over the last three years, while interviewing hundreds of disinformation-splintered families, it has become clear to me that facts alone can’t fix this. The solution begins with treating conspiracy theory obsession not as a sickness but as a symptom.For the Midwestern father, the trouble began after an injury largely robbed him of his mobility — and, in turn, much of his life’s meaning. Once an active family man, he was suddenly stuck in a chair. His wife took up solo hobbies and completed the housework alone; his children played with friends instead of with their dad. If he couldn’t fulfill his role as a husband and father in the ways he always had, who was he?In the QAnon quagmire, which he eventually stumbled into online, he was a patriot helping to bring “deep state” corruption to light. One of the good guys fighting the good fight. Someone who mattered again. During his gradual journey from QAnon-curious to feverishly embracing the most crackpot claims, his critical thinking skills didn’t mysteriously vanish — they were overpowered.Human needs are just that: needs. Our innate need for things such as meaning and belonging is superseded only by what the body requires for subsistence, and not by any thirst for accuracy or truth. When these needs go unmet, we can become desperate to satisfy them by whatever means necessary. And the conditions that leave people deprived of what they need and susceptible to irrational conspiracy theories are common — and commonly overlooked.In movements such as QAnon, the lonely find belonging, the aimless find direction and the angry find validation. Consider baby boomers, who share an alarming amount of fake news online. Many people believe that some mix of cognitive aging, poor digital literacy and too much Fox News is to blame. But this overlooks a bigger issue. Conspiracy-theory-entranced seniors have described to me how, before adopting a QAnon-like brand of what some called “activism,” they felt as if society no longer valued or had use for them. Facing what experts have identified as an “epidemic of loneliness,” they yearned for purpose, community and fulfillment.By their nature, conspiracy theories provide all of the above. They give supporters an enemy to oppose and a cause to rally around. It’s not difficult to see how churning out Facebook posts (errantly warning about killer COVID vaccines could have felt like a gratifying self-appointed job in retirement. Or how latching onto delusions that offer convenient answers and clear villains in times of debilitating uncertainty can restore feelings of agency and security.There’s no singular mold of conspiracy theorists or set of circumstances that shapes them. In my research, I’ve encountered people of all generations, classes, races and political leanings. All had their own reasons for believing and their own needs to satisfy. A political psychology study published on factors that predispose people to conspiracy theories shows that those less capable of “bouncing back” from hardship are more susceptible, suggesting that espousing these views can be a crutch. At the deepest level, then, it doesn’t necessarily matter to believers whether Taylor Swift is truly a psy-op or chemtrails are poisoning the skies. What matters is how clinging to such convictions serves the believers’ underlying needs.In the end, it wasn’t the truth that saved the Midwestern father, though he has come to see it clearly again. After badly damaging his life at rock bottom of the rabbit hole, he carved a long, sometimes bizarre and profoundly difficult path toward recovering his sense of purpose as a parent and partner. Only then did the ludicrous lies he’d been so consumed by lose their hold over him. He no longer needed them.Success stories like this will remain rare if we don’t shift our approach to this crisis. We’re living in a moment where a slew of critical stressors, including an unprecedented election season and an artificial intelligence boom, are fueling a tsunami of disinformation and leaving many of us mentally and emotionally compromised.As more Americans turn to conspiracy theories to cope, we must remind ourselves that we can’t do away with delusions that meet people’s fundamental needs by simply debunking them. We need to focus on the cause, not the symptom — to look past the lunacy and probe the roots of our collective vulnerability — because none of us is as immune as we would like to think.Jesselyn Cook is a reporter and journalism lecturer.

suffolknewsherald_2024_10,"Published 4:51 pm Tuesday, July 16, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,A wise Planning Commissioner recently told me that rezoning land or granting conditional use permits should be reserved for truly worthwhile things that will benefit the city and its citizens.On July 17th, City Council has to decide if allowing surface mining operations adjacent to the South Quay Sandhills Natural Heritage Site and along a portion of the Blackwater River (a Virginia Scenic River will be truly beneficial for Suffolk. The proposal involves extracting the same sand that makes the Natural Heritage Site special, along with the fact that it contains the last natural stand of Longleaf Pine in Virginia.Surely, there must be an important reason to disrupt this unique place that the city itself wanted to turn into a park just a few years ago, right?The answer to that question is ‘no.’ At the May 15th City Council meeting, the applicant’s lawyer made it very clear that this sand “is specialty material. It’s not common old build-a-road sand. Some of the sand has great value. It can be used on golf courses, uh, other cosmetic type circumstances.” I guess this sand isn’t even meant to benefit the average citizen!Suffolk’s planning staff recommended the denial of this permit. Their report says that “Impacts to the environmentally significant areas either partially or completely for the proposed surface mining operations would deplete the resources on the property and cause a reduction in the ecosystem.” Most Planning Commissioners still voted in favor of this project, despite concerns from the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR .The DCR Natural Heritage Program director even came from Richmond to the May 15th meeting, but most council members didn’t heed him either. Some also dismissed concerned citizens because they don’t live right near the borrow pit site. A couple council members took the time to gush about the great reputation of the applicant. It was, once again, very apparent who is most favored in the council chambers.

philinquirer_2024_52,"We re teenagers, and even we can tell the city s housing voucher system is broken.Each time we complain about the potholes in our neighborhoods, or all the noise outside from what’s either gunshots, fireworks, or motorcycles, or the drug dealers a few blocks from the apartment, we hear this: “If you don’t like it, then leave.”As if we haven’t been trying.One of us (Gianna Luna has been living in the same apartment in Hunting Park since she was born. As the years passed, it’s gotten too small for her and her mom, and the cracks have started to show. Even with the windows closed, you can feel a breeze. No matter the season, it’s the same temperature inside as it is outside, regardless of how hard the heaters and air-conditioners work. The plumbing has broken several times, and the landlord — without fail — opts for a Band-Aid fix that only solves the problem temporarily. To do it right, Luna and her mom had to pay for repairs themselves.» READ MORE:Philly teens have become desensitized to the epidemic of drugs, homelessness | OpinionLuna’s mom has been searching for anywhere else to live for months. From online listings to calling the numbers on “for rent” signs, the outcome is the same: too expensive.The only thing keeping them in the same apartment is that the landlord doesn’t and hasn’t raised the rent in years. They feellucky for that. That’s the only reason they’ve been able to afford everything they needed and a little more. The day they move is the day all of that will change.Rent in Philadelphia hasreached astronomically high levels, especially with the post-COVID-19 boom of people looking for new housing after being cooped up during the pandemic. Not to mentionthe cost of buying a house these days, which is impossible for many because of the income requirements and high mortgage rates.Those unable to find housing within their budget are stuck spending more than they can afford just to have a roof over their heads.More than54% of Philadelphia renters are “cost-burdened”— meaning they spend more than 30% of their household income on housing costs. That’s about 800,000 people. On top of that,nearly one-quarter of Philadelphia residents live in poverty.Many residents feel lucky when they are able to find affordable housing. But they soon realize that a large number of these residencesare in a state of disrepair.We can relate to this personally. Here are only a few things both of our families have had to repair since we each moved into our abodes, with or without landlord help: faulty plumbing (the shower, the washer and dryer, the toilet, and almost every sink , the hot water and central heating/cooling system, the roof (on several occasions , the screen door, garage door, and front windows (none would open , and the entire bathroom (three cheers for broken porcelain .This is not to say the government doesn’t help at all; the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Philadelphia Housing Authority have been working to help low-income families with housing vouchers. Last year, HUDcreated a new plan to increase the value of housing vouchers, based on the fair market rent for the zip code, so they cover 70% of the cost of housing.But when it comes to vouchers,the demand is still much higher than the supply. Last year, the website for the PHA — which administers the voucher program — crashed right after it reopened, due to overwhelming demand. Because of limited funds, thousands remain stuck on the waiting list. In March 2023, the PHA stated itonly supported around 18,405 households with vouchers— this, in a city where around one out of four households live in poverty.The demand is still much higher than the supply.And even though it is illegal, many landlordsrefuse to accept housing vouchers— to the point where the PHA startedoffering bonuses to landlordswho take vouchers and may even pay the security deposits of these households. What’s more, many landlords’ rent prices arehigher than fair market rent pricesas defined by the HUD, so the voucher won’t be enough to cover costs.Housing vouchers are a good solution, but they need to be fixed. We need more funding so vouchers can be handed out with more money and to more people, hopefully cutting down the waiting list. In order to give renters who rely on vouchers better options for housing, landlords refusing to accept these vouchers must be heavily penalized.In addition, there should be some incentives for landlords to abide by fair market rent prices, which will make it easier for voucher recipients to find a home.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker’s 2025 budgetdoes address some of our concerns — such as adding 30,000 housing units and allocating funding to housing repair — but it doesn’t go nearly far enough. We believe the Philadelphia government and the PHA — thefourth-largest housing authority in the nation, and the largest landlord in Pennsylvania — can do far more to help low-income renters.Housing is a right and should be accessible to everyone regardless of economic status. We hope one day that becomes a reality.Gianna Luna is a senior at Central High School desperate to move out of her neighborhood. Anna Cadogan is a senior at Central High School."
minnpost_2024_86,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The phrase “deaths of despair” has become cultural shorthand for deaths from overdose, suicide and alcoholism. Coined by economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case, it paints a provocative picture of what many people are experiencing. They may believe that no matter what they do, nothing is going to improve. They may no longer even care what happens to themselves. This is where despair becomes fatalism; death by overdose may seem inevitable to some people. If not this time, then perhaps the next.Yet this description is also misleading; there are structural economic dynamics driving the despair. This is evident from the recentNational Vital Statistics Reportfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that examines the relationship between occupations and overdose deaths in the United States and presents staggering statistics that indict the economic prospects and working conditions of many employed adults.The study examined deaths from overdoses by major occupations per 100,000 workers in that occupation. According to the data from the year 2020, overdoses killed 163 people out of every 100,000 who primarily worked in construction. For every 100,000 workers in food preparation and service, 118 died from overdose. Among every 100,000 personal care and service providers, such as childcare and home health workers, overdoses killed 74 of them. Simultaneously, the lowest rates of overdose death by occupations are found in the business and financial sector (11 , computer and mathematics (9 , and education, training and library positions (6 . The combined death by overdose rate for the highest three groups is more than 13 times greater than for workers in the three lowest groups. This stark disparity requires explanation.While it might be tempting to attribute the difference in overdose rates to intelligence, that’s a convenient fiction. Even in stable economic times, occupations with the highest rates of overdose deaths are among the most physically demanding. Construction and healthcare workers spend long hours on their feet, climbing, bending and carrying tools, materials or even people. These physical demands create dangerous conditions; workplace accidents and injuries are far more common with roofers, for example, than they are with librarians. If education does provide a protective factor, it is because education provides access to occupations that are inherently less dangerous.There’s also a higher degree of employment uncertainty with construction, restaurant and personal care workers. Economic downturns hit the construction industry hard. Construction is weather dependent; many workers are pushed, or push themselves, to take advantage when the weather cooperates. When the economy is shaky, eating out becomes a luxury many eliminate.Restaurant closures soaredduring the pandemic and most likely will not return to pre-pandemic levels. Finally, personal healthcare workers during the pandemic often had to do more with less.Their turnover rate— those who left or whose employment was terminated — soared to 77%.One of the biggest protections against overdosing is having affordable health insurance. Many employers don’t offer insurance, putting the onus on workers to buy their own healthcare plan or find a job — often an additional one — that does provide coverage. Even then, plans with high deductibles and copays preclude many from using their insurance for anything other than something catastrophic. Moreover, people need workday flexibility to go to appointments. If someone worries she’ll be fired or lose shifts, she’s less likely to seek medical care and may try to alleviate her pain by self-medicating with drugs she gets from family, friends or dealers. Fentanyl is commonly mixed with recreational drugs along withXylazine, a veterinary non-opiate sedative, analgesic and muscle relaxant. In these instances, pain relief may come at the expense of one’s life.The overdose epidemic is not the canary in the coal mine; it’s the mine collapsing. The misleading part of “deaths of despair” is that despair is a consequence of marginalization, powerlessness and exploitation. When people are marginalized in the economic, social and political realms, they are relegated to the sidelines, their voices ignored or silenced. Marginalization leads to powerlessness, a loss of control over major life decisions such as occupations, marital status and living arrangements. These people become more susceptible to the vicious cycle of economic exploitation: long hours, low pay, dangerous working conditions and fragile job security.By addressing these dynamics of despair — marginalization, powerlessness and exploitation — we begin to create a real possibility of effectively reducing the number of people whose tragic, premature deaths are ultimately avoidable and preventable.Peg O’Connor is a professor of philosophy at Gustavus Adolphus College, a recovering alcoholic and the author of “Life on the Rocks: Finding Meaning in Addiction and Recovery” and “Higher and Friendly Powers: Transforming Addiction and Suffering.”"

Anderson, the case reviewing the Colorado decision to remove former President Donald Trump from that state’s ballot.And, it was the spirit of those Reconstruction Founders which wholly eluded those justices as the arguments proceeded, for reasons I am still contemplating.As one commentator wrote:“It is strange, too, that the court, which in past years has made dramatic and ruinous changes to American life out of its professed loyalty to our nation’s ‘history and traditions,’ chose to more or less completely ignore the suggestions of history here.”But, in the case of a crucial Reconstruction Era amendment, fashioned after the loss of over half a million Americans who died to both reunite the Union and to vindicate Abraham Lincoln’s “new birth of freedom,” the nine justices — with maybe one or two exceptions — seemed as if they were interpreting a principle of an ancient and foreign treaty.It was as if they knew nothing of (or simply ignored our own history.The meaning and purpose of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment and its permanent and unequivocal demand that insurrectionists against our Constitution, and against the rights secured by those Second Founders, must be excluded from holding office in our republic, seemed as strange to these justices as would outdoor plumbing or the workings of a cotton gin.It seemed there was simply no place in the minds and experience of the majority of the justices to imagine that an American political leader — especially a wealthy white male — might be cut from the very same anti-democracy cloth as were the 19th century men and women who met in 11 Southern states in the early 1860s to pass secession ordinances and later engage this nation for fours years of brutal bloodshed.There was likewise no place in the justices’ experience to conceive of the fact that even after the Civil War formally ended that white Southerners engaged in a widespread and persistent reign of terror against newly free Blacks still living in the South — a terrorism that was arguably as organized and certainly as violent as the war of rebellion itself; a reign of terror aimed at defeating Reconstruction and the progress which would only arrive for Black Americans some 90 years after the official end of the Civil War.It was for these reasons — some well known to the Reconstruction Founders, some only perhaps anticipated — that they wrote the language of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment: to exclude then and henceforward and forever those who might engage their countrymen in an insurrection against the meaning of our Constitution.The tragedy of Feb. 8, 2024, for future historians will not be that a single demagogic politician would likely be permitted to stand for office, but rather that our Highest Court simply could no longer see the purpose for which that Reconstruction Amendment was adopted — that they could no longer either remember or fully understand the meaning of the words proclaimed on a battlefield as Lincoln prayed for this nation to at last have “a new birth of freedom.”Goins lives in White Bear Lake."

Which of the following is the best response?1. Issue a warning. Tell everyone, “Hey, watch out — this stuff isn’t good for you.”2. Regulate the dangerous substance so that it causes the least amount of harm.3. Ban the substance and penalize anyone who distributes it.In the midst of a well-documented mental health crisis among children and teenagers, with social media use a clear contributing factor, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recommends choice one. As he wrote in a New York Times opinion guest essay Monday, “It is time to require a surgeon general’s warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents.”It’s an excellent first step, but it’s a mere Band-Aid on a suppurating wound. Telling teenagers something is bad for them may work for some kids, but for others, it’s practically an open invitation to abuse. To add muscle to a mere label, we need to prohibit its sale to people under 18 and enforce the law on sellers. We need to strongly regulate social media, as Europe has begun to do, and ban it for kids under 16. Murthy urges Congress to take similar steps.Free-speech absolutists (or those who play the role when a law restricts something that earns them lots of money will say that requiring age verification systems is an unconstitutional limit on free speech. Nonsense. We don’t allow children to freely attend PG-13 or R-rated movies. We don’t allow hard liquor to be advertised during children’s programming.Other objections to regulation are that it’s difficult to carry out (so are many things and that there’s only a correlative link between social media and adverse mental health rather than one of causation.Complacency is easy. The hard truth is that many people are too addicted to social media themselves to fight for laws that would unstick their kids. Big Tech, with Congress in its pocket, is only too happy for everyone to keep their heads in the sand and reap the benefits.

Utility companies are charging us more while they get paid off by the fossil fuel industry to block the transition to renewable energy.Utility companies have gotten away with profiting at the expense of people and our planet for too long. It’s time we hold them accountable and demand they stop using our money to burn our future while individuals and families struggle.We deserve an energy system that allows everyone to have access to clean and affordable energy.Erica WesselmanCaptain CookCannot let Israeldrag U.S. into warBenjamin Netenyahu believes he can start a war with Iran because his big dumb puppy dog country will be there to back him up when those mean Iranians strike back.

His response wasn’t even a “thanks, but no thanks”; it was just “mind your own business.”But the operation of the high court is everyone’s business, including the public’s elected representatives, not a nine-member fiefdom presided over by an impervious chieftain.One of Chief Roberts’ cudgels, shared with some of his most vocal fellow jurists, especially the ethically-challenged ones, is that any effort by Congress to mandate the development of a meaningful and enforceable code of conduct or even devise one itself would be an unconstitutional breach of the separation-of-powers doctrine that bars one branch of government, the legislative, from intruding into the operations of another, the judiciary.But his imploration to stay off of his cloud rings hollow. Congress clearly has the authority to appropriate funds to the judiciary, restructure its units, name judicial facilities and add or, yes, reduce the number of high court justices, among other indulgences.So, Congress could, if it wished, impose or direct the development of a moral compass for the high court to get its act together, a tall task for the legislative body that can’t seem to do it for itself.When undertaking his role 18 years ago, the chief justice famously, but inaccurately, equated his role to that of a baseball “umpire,” impartially calling “balls and strikes.”Unlike an umpire, he’s been more of a passive — and poor — musician, emulating Nero, who fiddled while Rome burned.When it comes to establishing meaningful ethical standards for the high court, it could be said that the chief justice, rather than calling the pitches from behind the plate, has struck out. Worse yet, the chief hasn’t even stepped up to the plate, preferring to remain on the bench in the dugout rather repairing the problems on his bench.Marshall H.

suffolknewsherald_2024_7,"Published 6:03 pm Tuesday, July 30, 2024ByStaff ReportsChris QuilpaLet us not underestimate the power of prayer. It can move mountains. It can heal. It can make dreams come true. It can save lives.Pope Francis of the Catholic Church has declared 2024 the year of prayer “to rediscover the great value and absolute need for prayer, prayer in personal life, prayer in the life of the Church, prayer in the world.”This is an opportunity for faithful believers to increase their prayer activity and make praying a regular routine to get closer or connect to God. Prayer increases our awareness that we are God’s children, always needing guidance and protection.Our private and direct communication with God can make a difference in our daily lives. Through the intercession or intervention of our guardian angels and holy saints, our prayer can be more effective, therapeutic, and preventive. If we’re troubled and in distress, we have only God our Father to turn to through our heartfelt, sincere prayer.Our loving God is omniscient, ever knowing what we’re going through. He’s waiting for us to open up our hearts and minds. By pouring out our inner selves to him, asking forgiveness, and for His Divine Mercy to help us overcome our daily challenges in life, we become His children. Helpless and hapless, like little children relying on their Mom/Dad or guardian for their needs, we turn to God, our Almighty Father, when there is no one else to turn to.When we pray, amazing things can happen. Miracles happen. Answer/s to our prayer may or may not happen instantly, but we have to be hopeful and patient. Ultimately, we’ll see the fruits of our devotion and dedication to prayer. When we pray, we can ask for the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of Jesus Christ, our spiritual mother and patron saint of the Americas. Praying the Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, our Mother of Perpetual Help is a good daily practice.The holy saints, who were once sinners, should serve as our role model when we pray. Because of their abiding faith, fervent prayers, a life of holiness and their heroic virtues, they’re called saints worthy of veneration and intercession.St. Teresa of Kolkata, aka Mother Teresa, said that prayer is putting oneself in the hands of God, at His disposition, and listening to His voice in the depth of our heart. “Prayer in action is love; love in action is service,” she said. St. Augustine said, “Pray as if everything depended on God. Work as if everything depended on you.” St. John Vianney said, “Prayer is the inner bath of love into which the soul plunges.”Believe and trust in the love, divine grace, mercy, and goodness of God, our Almighty Father.It’s also a very good practice to pray for others besides ourselves. Praying for others, those who are sick, wounded, or dying, indicates that we are one human family caring and living for one another. Praying for others is one of the spiritual works of mercy we do as Christians, brothers and sisters in Christ.A simple “Thank you, Jesus; thank you, Lord” prayer is all it takes to be grateful for being alive and well. Or, just silently pray, “Jesus, I trust in You. Amen.”I wish you a prayerful life. May God bless and keep us always.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

minnpost_2024_154,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The Supreme Court’s recent decision inAlexander v. South Carolina NAACPhas been widely critiqued because it allows the state to create a voting district gerrymandered on the basis of race. The most heinous part of the decision, however, is not that it allows one such district to exist, but that it dooms to failure any future efforts to forestall race-based gerrymanders. It does this by reinforcing a rule of evidence that has led the court, over several decades and in numerous cases, to legalize racism.The Alexander decision concerns South Carolina’s first congressional district. To ensure Republican representation, the state Legislature redrew the district’s map. They acknowledged their goal was to gain partisan advantage (a type of gerrymander that previous Supreme Court rulings, unfortunately, have allowed but denied race was a factor in selecting where to draw the district’s boundaries.The result, nonetheless, was a district that contained thousands more white people and thousands fewer Black people. As Justice Kagan stated in her dissent, “More than 60% of Black Charleston County residents previously in District 1 were relocated to District 6. Of the 11 precincts with the largest Black populations, 10 were gone.” The district court declared the map unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court found the gerrymander to be partisan, not racial, and thus reversed that decision.However wrong-headed one might find this reversal, the deeper problem is in its rationale. Justice Alito’s majority opinion asserts: “we start with a presumption that the legislature acted in good faith” and to refute that presumption requires, in almost any case, “a relevant state actor’s express acknowledgment that race played a role in the drawing of district lines.”Even if evidence points to race-based manipulation of a district, absent such “express acknowledgment” the legislature enjoys the benefit of the doubt. “When confronted with evidence that could plausibly support multiple conclusions” Alito writes, a court must “draw the inference that cuts in the legislature’s favor.” The majority opinion requires the court to accept the state’s case unless a state representative has admitted they acted with racist intent.No one, of course, will confess to such a motivation. It thus becomes nearly impossible to demonstrate a race-based gerrymander. All a state body needs to do to refute the charge is say “we didn’t do it. It was partisan, not racial.”Which is exactly what happened in this case. The state acknowledged the new map created “tremendous disparity” that broke down along racial lines, but claimed the racial skew was an unintended consequence of its partisan goal. Alito’s ruling endorses this justification: “a map that has been gerrymandered to achieve a partisan end can look very similar to a racially gerrymandered map. And if either politics or race could explain a district’s contours, the plaintiff has not cleared its bar.” The state needed only to show a partisan explanation was possible (not even probable to successfully refute the plaintiff’s case.Once admission of racist intent is required to demonstrate violation of the constitution’s equal protection clause, bad actors are free to disenfranchise Black citizens. They can get away with it by citing race-neutral reasons to justify the unfair conditions they have created.This practice is not new. Richard Rothstein, in “The Color of Law,” his excellent book about racial segregation in housing, examines how zoning laws shunted Black people into neighborhoods contaminated by toxic waste facilities. He concludes, “For the most part, courts have refused to reject toxic siting zoning decisions without proof of explicit, stated intent to harm African Americans because of their race.”Michelle Alexander, in “The New Jim Crow,” cites examples of Supreme Court decisions based on the requirement of stated racist intent. In McCleskey v. Kemp, a 1987 case about racism in criminal sentencing, the court ruled that “bias in sentencing, even if shown through credible statistical evidence, could not be challenged under the 14th Amendment in the absence of clear evidence of conscious, discriminatory intent.” In United States v. Armstrong, a 1996 case about differential treatment of Black and white defendants who had committed similar crimes, the opinion conveyed that “unless evidence of conscious, intentional bias on the part of the prosecutor could be produced, the Court would not allow any inquiry into the reasons for or causes of apparent racial disparities in prosecutorial decision-making.”Prosecutorial misconduct in jury selection was central to Purkett v. Elem in 1995, in which the court ruled any race-neutral reason was sufficient justification to strike a potential juror. A lower court had ruled against a prosecutor who struck one Black juror because “he had the longest hair of anybody on the panel,” and another because “he had a mustache and goatee type beard.” The Supreme Court’s reversal of the lower court held that “unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor’s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.” Justice Stevens’ dissent bemoaned the majority’s “surprising announcement that any neutral explanation, no matter how ‘implausible or fantastic,’ even if it is ‘silly or superstitious,’ is sufficient to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination.”The Supreme Court has rendered numerous decisions based on the rule of evidence central to its majority opinion in Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP: to demonstrate racial bias requires admission of racist intent. Without that admission, any race-neutral explanation will suffice.Since one needs minimal ingenuity to disguise intent, this rule requires the court to turn a blind eye to most cases of racist motivation. But more importantly, it requires the court to sanction actions and policies that, even in the absence of racist motivation, discriminate against minority populations. Like many Americans, the court finds racism in individual bigots, but not in policies that segregate Black homeowners or incarcerate Black citizens or, most recently, disenfranchise Black voters.Jeffery L.

suffolknewsherald_2024_51,"Published 5:47 pm Tuesday, April 2, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIn October, when Suffolk Police Chief Al Chandler announced his abrupt retirement, city manager Al Moor did not hesitate to name an interim replacement, which made complete sense. The last thing you need is uncertainty among law enforcement’s ranks.Moor selected the person he felt was best to fill the role temporarily, with the possibility of becoming permanent. Enter James “Danny” Buie, who has served the Suffolk Police Department in many capacities and through many decades — during the good and not-so-good times. The move to elevate Buie made sense, and removing the interim tag makes sense, too.Buie is a Suffolk native, and if you talk with him, he will make it clear that he loves this community — he is invested, which says a lot about who he is.Extending the search to external candidates nationwide is also a good idea.A fresh perspective is sometimes necessary to help move forward. SPD’s direction could be more active and progressing, but a vision from another lens may make a difference.Considering all candidates allows the city to make the right long-term decisions for the department.To that end, the city has launched a community survey to gather thoughts, perspectives, and preferences regarding the essential characteristics and qualities desired by the new police chief. They also provided a similar survey to the members of SPD to gain their insights.This is an excellent way to determine what the community and department personnel value most in a leader. If used properly, that data will help guide the search firm Raftelis in culling the list of applicants.We want to offer a few traits we feel are important in a police chief. First, this person should have the experience to lead through the changing policing landscape. They must be forward-thinking and transparent, possess the ability to mentor, and have integrity.The city has yet to say how long this process will take, but it has been seven months since Chandler retired.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_224,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°The Pentagon is in the midst of an enormously expensive program aimed at building a new generation of nuclear-armed missiles, bombers, and submarines, at a cost of at least $2 trillion over the next three decades. The plan is both dangerous and unnecessary.Of particular concern is the effort to build a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM , known as the Sentinel. Former secretary of defense William Perry has called ICBMs “some of the most dangerous weapons we have,” because a president would only have a matter of minutes to decide whether to launch them on warning of an attack, greatly increasing the risk of an accidental nuclear war based on a false alarm. Given this risk, the wisest policy would be to cancel the Sentinel, and to remove existing ICBMs from the U.S. arsenal.Last month the Pentagon missed a major opportunity to make Americans safer when it announced the results of a review of the Sentinel program under the Nunn-McCurdy Act, a provision designed to curb runaway cost overruns in major weapons programs. The review was triggered by the fact that the estimated costs for the Sentinel have grown by an astonishing 81% in the past two years. It will now cost over $140 billion to develop and build the Sentinel system — a total of $214 million per missile.Under the Nunn-McCurdy review, the Pentagon had the option of canceling, delaying, or restructuring the Sentinel program. Instead, the department doubled down, committing to spend whatever it costs to complete it even if it means cutting back on other projects.Given that a new ICBM will make the world a more dangerous place, why is the Sentinel program still going forward? The short answer is that there’s money to be made. Northrop Grumman and its fellow contractors on the program are determined to reap the profits from the Sentinel, and they are using all their power and influence to make sure that happens.The companies are joined in this effort by members of Congress whose states and districts benefit from spending on the Sentinel. The most active faction is the Senate ICBM Coalition, made up of Senators from Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming — states that house ICBM bases or major ICBM manufacturing facilities.Congressional advocates of the Sentinel program have been backed up by the clout of the major ICBM contractors, who have donated $87 million to Congressional candidates in the past four election cycles while employing 275 lobbyists, most of whom came from influential positions in government before joining the arms industry. The argument of last resort for the Sentinel is that it creates well paying jobs in key communities, but this claim is hugely exaggerated. Northrop Grumman itself claims that the program will create 10,000 jobs in the development phase, a tiny fraction of the national work force of 167 million people.Given all of the challenges we face as a nation, from conflicts abroad to unmet needs at home, we simply cannot continue to let special interest lobbying determine the size, shape, and cost of our nuclear arsenal. It’s long past time to cancel the Sentinel and retire existing ICBMs. Not only will it make America and the world a safer place, it will free up tens of billions of dollars to address other urgent national needs.DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of Hawaii."
philinquirer_2024_13,"As the owner of several rental properties in Philadelphia, I’ve learned that being a landlord is a way to build community.“Tell your tenant to move her car!” These were the first words I heard when I answered my phone 18 months ago.Because I have a “For Rent” sign with my contact information in the yard of the duplex I own not far from my own house, I get more than my share of irate calls from neighbors, complaining about some real or imagined infraction. This time, the woman on the other end was fuming mad because she thought my tenant’s car was blocking the common driveway — again. I was annoyed, but felt vindicated when I confirmed that it wasn’t my tenant’s car. Still, I sent out a reminder to keep the driveway clear.Recently, I rang that same neighbor’s doorbell. She invited me in and we stood together in her living room, preparing to hang “No Parking” signs for our upcoming block party. That irate phone call from a year and a half ago felt distant.She offered me water, we talked about how much fun everyone was going to have, and she showed me a picture of her son, who passed away a few years ago. She was no longer a faceless angry homeowner and I was no longer an anonymous landlord; we were neighbors, excited for our block party.Since 2017, I’ve bought several rental properties in Philadelphia, and in that time I’ve learned that being a landlord is not just a way to make money — it’s a way to build community and improve the city, block by block.Many Philadelphia residents are skeptical about landlords, as real estate investors are often seen as unwelcome outsiders, and I understand.As a young girl growing up in Mount Airy, I watched a battalion of construction workers and their pickup trucks lay siege to my block as they turned the old horse stables down the street into a dozen new rowhouses.Then they tore down the large single family house across the street, replacing it with six more rowhouses. It changed the landscape of my childhood dramatically, and made me feel unsettled.My rehab projects aren’t changing an entire street. I also look like the people who live next to my properties, which helps put neighbors at ease. But I’m still aware of the sense of uncertainty that my presence can bring. So, at the start of my projects, I try to show that I come in peace.I try to set a positive tone by doing what I can to improve and secure my property, while also enhancing the block. Street sweeping is my favorite way to start because it can be free — just me, my broom, and a contractor bag — and gives instant results that residents can see, even if the outcome is just temporarily less trash.I installed flood lights in a dark alley beside one property; it won’t totally deter drug use and other illegal activity, but it hopefully makes people feel a little safer. I’ve also installed security cameras, which don’t stop people from illegally dumping or breaking into the nearby cars or apartments, but residents have told me they appreciate knowing they can use the footage when they file a complaint with the police.These small decisions benefit my property and my best interests, but they also help each block as a whole. With every sweep and security camera, I’m slowly building trust and establishing a good working relationship with the community.If every landlord does a little bit beyond the front doors of our buildings, we could help transform the city. Not just how it looks, but also how it feels.Over the course of my renovation projects, my professional relationship with the neighbors on the block slowly evolves into a more personal one. I observe people in the most unfiltered moments of their lives — relaxing, arguing, loving, and simply existing. And they watch parts of my journey unfold, too, in the sweat, setbacks, and slow progress of repairs. Occasionally, small talk turns into longer, more meaningful conversations. These moments of connection are magical.This summer, I tried to make more of these moments by organizing block parties on a couple of streets where I own properties. I asked my angry neighbor to help, and the planning process gave us a reason to communicate without shouting.I learned she had lived on the block for 50 years, but she kept saying “the neighborhood isn’t like it used to be.” There was more crime and trash, and most of the older folks who made the street feel like a family were long gone. Like me, she mourned the loss of the place she knew — but, in her case, she was also grieving the tragic loss of her child.In the couple of months spent planning the block party, I learned more about her than I had in the couple of years I’d owned the duplex on her street. I no longer saw her simply as angry; she was hurt. And in understanding each other more, we’ve built a friendship. When she needed referrals for work on her house, I sent her my best recommendations. When I needed a home base for the block party, she made it clear that me and my guests were welcome to anything she had.On the day of the block parties, residents and I cleaned up together and shared food and funny stories. We walked up and down the streets, putting faces to the front doors and watched kids play carefree. I felt the optimism that comes from working together, and the vulnerability that comes from hoping together. The people on the block became people I have an obligation to and a responsibility for. They became neighbors.» READ MORE:Philly crime made me consider a move to the suburbs. Here’s why I stayed. | OpinionThere areroughly 50,000 landlords in Philadelphia, and around three-quarters are like me, owning a handful of properties. If every one of us does a little bit beyond the front doors of our buildings, we could help transform the city. Not just how it looks, but also how it feels. Whether it’s planning a block party, referring reliable contractors to residents, or introducing yourself to all of the residents, we have the opportunity to impact every block where we own property by not only being an investor, but by being a neighbor.Because neighbors are not just the people who live next to us, but the people we choose to see and connect with. And while our individual efforts might feel insignificant, if we gather enough small contributions and meaningful moments of connection, eventually we’ll find that we’ve discovered something precious — community.Jasmine Schley is a proud Philadelphian."
minnpost_2024_28,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (MSP recently welcomed U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation Polly Trottenberg and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff as part of the Biden Administration’s “Investing in America” tour. However, absent from their discussion was the potential impact of a recent tentative decision from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT that would affect a crucial flight serving the Twin Cities, and thereby disproportionately affect the Latino community here in Minnesota.The DOT has proposed a tentative termination of the Joint Cooperation Agreement (JCA between Delta and Aeromexico, putting the airlines’ partnership in jeopardy. Terminating the JCA would put almost two dozen air routes between the United States and Mexico at risk, including one that operates out of MSP, as well as thousands of jobs.Over time, we have built Minneapolis as a realization of the American dream by addressing challenges to ensure the well-being of all its citizens. Continuing to drive economic growth and improve quality of life means thwarting harmful proposals like this that directly impact members of the Latino community. Terminating the JCA between Delta and Aeromexico could have significant consequences for Latinos and businesses in Minneapolis that would reverberate across the state.Looking back, the JCA has improved connectivity between Mexico and the United States since its establishment in 2016. More than 350,000 passengers relied on the Delta-Aeromexico flight route connecting MSP and Benito Juarez International Airport (MEX in 2023. If approval of the JCA is terminated, this vital route, which serves as a lifeline for many Latino families, is at risk of being canceled.The flight made possible by this strategic partnership has had many positive effects, including increased market competition and more affordable airfare. Businesses depend on reliable transportation between the two countries to support trade partnerships and operations. In Minnesota specifically, trade with Mexico totaled $5.4 billion in 2021 and supports more than 90,000 jobs. Losing access to this route could impact the businesses that use it to support their operations. Thousands of U.S. jobs would be at risk if the DOT does not renew approval of the JCA.Further, Minnesota has a fast-growing Latino population, with more than 300,000 residents who identify as Latino. Of that group, 66% are of Mexican descent. Many of our state’s Mexican and Latino residents rely on easy access between Minnesota and Mexico to visit family and friends and stay connected to their heritage. It is no question they would likely feel the economic and familial effects of this tentative decision.I am from Mexico City; my family is from Mexico City. Due to immigration challenges, I had been living in Minnesota for 20 years without the ability to visit my family and my home country. When I finally obtained my green card, I used this potentially discontinued route to reunite with my family. This route is incredibly personal to me and many members of the Mexican American community here in Minnesota.The DOT’s proposal is in response to unrelated concerns regarding Mexico’s aviation policy. While the need to ensure that the Mexican government honors our countries’ air-services agreement is understandable, ending the important partnership between Delta and Aeromexico is not the way to reach a solution.The best way to support our cities is through smart policies that boost our economy and support the people who live in them. The termination of the JCA would do the opposite. Should the DOT finalize its proposed decision, Minnesotans, and especially Latinos, would be unfairly punished for a diplomatic dispute they have no part in. So, while the Biden administration continues to tout new investments in infrastructure and transportation, the DOT must make regulatory decisions that help, not harm, Minnesotans and our Latino community.Emilia Gonzalez Avalos is the executive director of Unidos MN, a grassroots organization that works to advance social, racial and economic justice for working families."
philinquirer_2024_44,"Lawmakers in Harrisburg and Washington must resist an industry-driven push to undo a plan to toughen air quality standards.At the heart of the Clean Air Act lies a promise: Everyone in the United States, no matter where they live, deserves to breathe clean, healthy air. But while air pollution levels have dropped nationwide, the full measure of this promise has been denied to Black communities, including those in Philadelphia.Indeed,like other metropolitan areas, Black neighborhoods in Philadelphia are more likely to breathe toxic air pollutants, with particulate matter — commonly known as soot — being one of the deadliest. This insidious pollutant causes heart attacks, strokes, asthma, low birth weight, and infant mortality.Soot comes from tailpipes, smokestacks, and power plants. The placement of many ofthesepollution sources in Black neighborhoods is no accident. They are the product of decades of bad policy choiceslike redlining and so-called urban renewal, which devaluedBlack communities and surrounded them with major pollution sources.Unsurprisingly, Black Americans are 300% more likely to die from particulate matter pollution than their white counterparts. Equally unsurprisingly, North and West Philadelphia and the Lower Northeast — the city’s Black neighborhoods — are where childhood asthma rates remain the highest, according to the mostrecent “Health of the City” report.Finding solutions to Black and Hispanic communities’disproportionate exposureto particulate matter pollution has been elusive for the country, especially in Philadelphia, for years. But in an admirable move, the Biden administration made tackling air pollution inequality one of its top goals. And in February, after relentless advocacy from groups across the country, the Environmental Protection Agency strengthened the annual air quality standard for particulate matter.This new standard will force states to reduce particulate matter pollution from industrial and mobile sources, like cars and trucks — and in doing so, it will prevent some 800,000 asthma attacks and save more than 4,500 lives annually by the time the standard is fully implemented in 2032,according to the EPA.This reduction in mortality from particulate matter pollution isn’t simply an abstract number on a spreadsheet. Anyone who has lost a loved one to heart disease or respiratory illness can understand the grief and trauma of loving and losing someone to chronic illness.But despite the major lifesaving benefits of this new standard for particulate matter, polluting corporations and some conservative members of Congressdecry it as a “job killer.”In Pennsylvania, groups like the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry have argued that the new rules will, among other things, “diminish the prospects” for expanding industries in areas of the state that fail to meet the new standards. And in March of this year, national industry groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers filed a lawsuit to stop this new rule, arguing that “it would make the U.S. less competitive globally.”If it weren’t for the fact that some policymakers take these claims seriously, this familiar refrain would be easy to dismiss as a cliche. But some members of Congress are listening, and they are nowseeking to overturn the strengthened standard via the Congressional Review Act, a GOP invention of the Newt Gingrich-era that allows lawmakers to kill federal agency rules after they have been promulgated. With many of Pennsylvania’s own elected lawmakers likely to facesignificant lobbying by industrial polluters, they have failed to indicate how they will vote on this issue.Members of Congress from Pennsylvania, however, should be skeptical of trade groups and corporations’ slick language. The facts simply do not support the talking points that have been repeated ad nauseam since the EPA began regulating air pollution in the 1970s.Particulate matter standards have saved 230,000 lives and prevented more than 17 million lost workdays.For one, pollution limits aren’t “job killers.”On the contrary,studies have shownthat as emissions of major pollutants decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2018, the nation’s gross domestic product increased by 275%. Meanwhile, over the past five decades, particulate matter standards havesaved 230,000 lives and prevented more than 17 million lost workdaysfrom health-related air pollution effects.Given the stellar results of clean air safeguards, it is worrisome that many elected officials still want to listen to polluters’ mistaken rhetoric and subject their communities, and Black communities in particular, to the well-known harms air pollution poses. Especially because we are living at a time when the climate crisis — which is driven by emissions from tailpipes, smokestacks, and industrial power plants — fuels unprecedented wildfires that cause increasing pollution not just in the West, but in the Midwest and East now, too.Just last June, Philadelphiaexperienced its worst air quality daysince theEPA began collecting particulate matter pollution data, as wildfire smoke from Canada blanketed the Northeast of the continental U.S. And while the strengthened particulate matter standard doesn’t directly address wildfires, it improves overall air quality, offering relief on days marred by smoke-filled skies.A stronger standard means cleaner air, healthier communities, healthier kids, and healthier ecosystems. These are things we should expect our lawmakers in Harrisburg and Washington to uphold and defend. The health of our communities, and particularly Black communities, must not be sacrificed so that corporations can continue to pollute with impunity in the pursuit of profit.Marvin C.

The4,000 teaching vacancies Florida facesas the new school year approaches “is more than the population of teachers in 19 of Florida’s smallest counties combined,” the state’s teachers union says. In Vermont, there are days when whole grades of students are sent homebecause there’s no teacher or sub available.The teaching profession faces a morale — and staffing — crisis. A National Education Association survey of members found that, as of late 2022, a staggering 55% of educators werethinking of calling it quits.This is a legacy of COVID-19. Teachers were already unhappy before the pandemic, but the public’s reaction to the education their kids got during that crisis continues to haunt the profession. A Brown University study found teachers’ job satisfaction in 2022hovered near its lowest level since the 1970s.As aresearcher focused on education policy, along with my colleagueSara Dahill-Brown, we spent the pandemic researching how teachers felt as events unfolded. Between 2020 and 2022, we conducted 164 interviews with a total of 53 leaders of teachers unions and associations from 45 school districts in 14 states. They represented urban, suburban and rural districts and an array of partisan leanings.The results,published in our new study in Teaching and Teacher Education, show how damaging the pandemic was for K-12 teachers. Thousands subsequentlyleft the profession.Many teachers were already worried about security because of school shootings. With COVID-19, thosefears were compoundedby the public’s demand for a fast return to in-person class before public health officials deemed it safe and before money flowed to put best practices in place.In the summer of 2020, most teacher leaders told us they were “terrified” and “scared to death” because there was “no established criteria or expectations. … It was just jump into the deep and do your best.”Vaccines and other scientific developments eased that particular anxiety, but as recently as April 2023, nearly 4 in 10 teachers told researchers theywere considering looking for another jobbecause they didn’t feel safe at work.Throughout the 2020-21 school year, parents balanced jobs with children sitting — or running and yelling —alongside them for “Zoom school.” Teachers found themselves with two jobs, thanks to hybrid models in which they taught in person for some students and via videoconference for others.According to one respondent, they were “expected to teach students in person, but also deliver a meaningful education experience to those same students when they were at home.” Another shared that “teachers were working many, many, many more hours than they had ever put into a face-to-face environment,” clocking “12 to 16 hours a day and weekends” and providing feedback “until 10 o’clock at night.”The result was exhaustion that one leader described as “June-tired in October.” And that was merely an unusual bump in their already intense workloads; teachers in non-pandemic times typicallywork 53 hours per week on average. That’s seven more hours than the average working adult.The pandemic also exacerbated festering dissatisfaction with school and district leadership. Teachers felt misled, ill-informed and unconsidered. They were rarely asked for input and forced to make radical changes to education, respondents told us.Teachers wanted “consistency,” “straight answers” and to stop “switching on a dime,” they told us. Plans changed so frequently that one said “an email written on Monday” was “stale by Wednesday.” Another said administrators would say “the right things in public” to signal “compassion and care for teachers. But the actions are different. And it’s really taking a toll on teachers.”One union leader told us: “You see parents’ comments on social media, there are a lot more of ‘You just need to shut up and get back to the classroom. You’re lazy. You’re not doing your job.’”Another echoed this: “Historically educators have been an under-respected profession. But it’s much, much worse now. It’s not just that they’re disrespected, they’re villainized.”The majority (68% of study respondents were concerned from early in the pandemic about budgets or job security. Forty percent feared enrollment losses related to COVID-19 would make those worries worse. And many worried that “schools don’t have the budget to do all of the safety procedures that science tells us is necessary.”All of this persisted even as Congress, in April 2020,set aside more than US$13 billionfor K-12 emergency relief. By the end of 2020, then-President Donald Trump pledged$50 billion more to help schools reopen.These funds did hold off catastrophic cuts, but researchers and policymakers bothwarned of a fiscal cliff facing districtsif they didn’t prepare for the point at which that spigot would run dry. And, indeed, examples now abound of just that reality, as seen by mass job cuts inSt. Paul, Minnesota,HoustonandAnn Arbor, Michigan, among others.With the worst of the pandemic behind us, resources are being reduced despite ongoing needs. This recipe – burned-out teachers quitting and some who chose to stay being fired —has the entire profession reeling.There are several ways to boost morale, but most require more investment, not less.Teachers say they need better pay —to the tune of a minimum starting salary of $60,000 a year– along with stability in health and retirement benefits. The National Education Association says theaverage starting salary now is $44,530. The NEA is also advocating for better conditions for the paraprofessionals who assist them in the classrooms. And teachers want more say inwhat they teach.Short of these changes, we don’t see school systems being able to stop the exodus of educators from the profession — and they will continue to lose their best and brightest as a result.Lesley Lavery isa professor of Political Science at Macalester College.Steve Friessis an independent writer and editor at the University of Michigan.This article is republished from The Conversation."

The climate initiative includes green jobs training, efficient renewable energy homes, planting trees, food waste reduction, biochar and electric vehicle charging.These projects are important in order to provide affordable clean energy for residents across the city, and to accomplish the goals set forward in last year’s Climate Equity Plan.Right now, the mayor and city attorneys are negotiating with Xcel Energy behind closed doors about whether or not the biggest polluters should be held accountable to support the city’s new goals and allow these projects to continue.These negotiations will set the terms for the next 10 years, setting revenue the city can count on to finance its climate goals after 2024. Now is the time to contact the mayor and tell him that polluters should pay and that the negotiations should hold Xcel accountable for its emissions!Lisa Rudolph lives in Minneapolis.My Minneapolis neighbors and I have been organizing to ensure the mayor and city council negotiate strong franchise agreements with CenterPoint and Xcel Energy that require big polluters to pay their fair share for the cost of carbon emissions. We have a deep commitment to mitigating global climate change and want Minneapolis to be a leader in reducing CO2 emissions.The franchise agreements expire at the end of the year. Minneapolis has a critical opportunity to shape new agreements that will last another five to 10 years. Increased franchise fees, based on the social cost of carbon emissions, are required to provide revenue to implement weatherization, clean energy retrofits and electrification for Minneapolis homes. The majority of carbon emissions in Minneapolis come from buildings, so these upgrades are essential for reducing emissions.For 2024, $10 million is being generated in franchise fees targeted to home upgrades, with priority for Green Zones that have historically suffered from disinvestment and inequities.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_94,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°In Normandy last week, President Joe Biden gave a speech defending democracy that was designed to evoke Ronald Reagan’s famed “Boys of Pointe du Hoc” address in the same spot 40 years ago.But if Biden wants to make sure democracy is defended from tyrants, he should emulate Reagan in another way: the Gipper’s leisurely travel style.Nancy Reagan was always on guard, making sure her husband wasn’t being overstuffed with facts or overbooked with travel.When I accompanied the couple in 1986 to Tokyo for the Group of 7 summit, we wended our way there blissfully slowly. A stop in LA, a couple of nights in Honolulu, a look-see in Guam, three nights in the paradise of Bali. Nearly a week later, when we finally reached Japan, Reagan was tanned, rested and ready. (By contrast, when George H.W. Bush — known in Asia for having a frenetic “ants on a hot pan” personality — dashed around the Pacific Rim in 1992, he threw up on the Japanese prime minister and fainted in his lap at a banquet. Reagan was 75 when we went on that dream trip, but he never acted as if there was a problem with his age (even though it would seem later that there was, given his subsequent Alzheimer’s diagnosis . He played the ancient king, gliding along at his own pace.Reagan wasn’t immune from criticism about his age, but he wore his years better than Biden, who seems in denial. And no one is stepping in to schedule him any breathing room; Jill Biden, the Nancy to Biden’s Ronnie, has a schedule that’s even more frenetic than Joe’s.Biden and his staff always seem to be frantically trying to prove he’s energetic enough to govern. The 81-year-old sometimes jogs to the podium. And he’s trying to exhibit, through a strenuous travel schedule, that he’s up to the job. He arrived back in the United States on Sunday and went to Wilmington, Delaware. He came back to Washington the next day to host an early Juneteenth concert at the White House. On Tuesday, he gave a gun safety speech at the Washington Hilton — awkward, after Hunter Biden’s guilty verdict on gun charges. He went straight from the Hilton to Andrews Air Force Base, and flew to Delaware where he gave his beleaguered son a hug on the tarmac.On Wednesday, three days after he left Europe, the president schlepped back to Europe, this time for a G7 summit in Italy, and meetings with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the pope, and a joint news conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. On Friday, he flies through cascading time zones to LA for a glittering George Clooney-Julia Roberts-Jimmy Kimmel fundraiser with Barack Obama as a guest star.Nancy Reagan would be appalled.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_208,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Before we launch a GoFundMe page for Caitlin Clark, who will make a comparatively paltry $76,535 as a WNBA rookie this season, consider that the basketball phenom is poised to sign an eight-figure endorsement deal with Nike that will include her own signature shoe.Caitlin Clark will be just fine.It’s the other women’s basketball players we should be worried about.Remember, the WNBA is the same league that features Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner, who in 2022, spent nearly 300 days in a Russian jail after being wrongfully detained on a trumped-up drug smuggling charge.The only reason Griner was even in Russia was because she couldn’t make enough money playing the game she loves in her own country — and she is one of the higher paid players.How bad is the WNBA’s starting salary?Yahoo Sports just posted a job on LinkedIn that pays almost as much, $73,000 to start, to post about the NBA and WNBA on social media.Clark’s contract has predictably sparked discussion and debate over pay equity and the ever growing gender gap.Even President Joe Biden weighed in on the controversy, calling for women to be “paid what they deserve.”“Women in sports continue to push new boundaries and inspire us all,” the president posted on his X account. “But right now we’re seeing that even if you’re the best, women are not paid their fair share. It’s time that we give our daughters the same opportunities as our sons and ensure women are paid what they deserve.”Clark will pocket $338,056 over four years under her contract with the WNBA’s Indiana Fever.In contrast, last year’s No. 1 NBA draft pick — 7 foot, 4 inch Victor Wembanyama — secured a $55 million, four-year contract.In fact, the NBA’s lowest paid player, Mouhamed Gueye of the Atlanta Hawks makes a little more than $1.1 million, a sum that still dwarfs most WNBA salaries.“Steph Curry makes more per game than what Caitlin Clark is making for 4 years!” journalist Lisa Ling wrote on Instagram. “With the toll sports and travel take on women’s bodies, is this even a living wage?”Of course Clark should be making more. As a legend at the University of Iowa, Clark made history as the NCAA’s Division I all-time leading scorer.More importantly, her play has increased interest and viewership of the game.Her first-round pick helped to drive a 304% increase in viewership for the WNBA draft this week, shattering previous ratings records with 2.46 million viewers on ESPN.The name of the game is revenue, and the men’s game generates much more of it. The WNBA has a TV contract worth $60 million.The NBA’s contract is worth $2.7 billion.How much bigger is that? It’s like standing Wembanyama next to Dawn Staley.Staley just won her third national title as coach of the University of South Carolina, beating Clark and the University of Iowa in a game that drew 18.9 million viewers, the most-watched women’s basketball game of all time “Caitlin Clark is the sole reason why viewership has shot through the roof for our game — the sole reason,” Staley said.That’s high praise from a woman who is already in the Basketball Hall of Fame."
suffolknewsherald_2024_92,"Published 5:42 pm Tuesday, January 16, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardIn October, the Virginia Department of Transportation announced the dates for its planned extended closure of the James River Bridge to complete a rope replacement project. Initially, it was thought the first closure would take place in November. However, VDOT Special Structures Project Administrator Mark Grass said publicly the November start time was unrealistic.With that being said, no matter when the closure happened, it should not have come as a surprise to anyone, although, judging from comments on our social media pages, it did. Some were angry about the traffic issues a closure of this sort created – contrary to some reports, traffic on Friday was a mess – some were questioning the overall safety of the structure, and some defended the closure.The 4.5-mile James River Bridge is Virginia’s longest state-maintained bridge. It was opened in 1928 as the first connector between the Peninsula and South Hampton Roads. The bridge carries Routes 17/258/32 between Newport News and Isle of Wight County.The original two-lane bridge was replaced in 1982 with a wider four-lane lift-span bridge designed to handle increased traffic volumes.Given the bridge’s age, regular maintenance is critical and sometimes inconvenient. With nearly one million vehicles using the JRB monthly, ignoring the structure or taking shortcuts to make necessary repairs or upgrades can jeopardize the structure’s integrity and pave the way for potential disaster.Routine maintenance can also save time and money in the long run by addressing issues before they escalate.A brief inconvenience trumps a devastating, potentially life-altering catastrophe any day.Whether you are a frequent traveler of the JRB or only occasionally cross the structure, don’t let the next extended closure catch you by surprise. It is scheduled for 1 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 2, through 5 a.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 6.

The water washes over it all as it heads directly into the ocean.Sadly, most of these items could have been disposed of for free.

Any casual drive around the back roads of the Big Island will reveal evidence of dumping nearly anywhere you look.What am I missing? If it’s free, and you have a truck, why illegally dump it?

philinquirer_2024_68,"The heroism of West Philly native Waverly Woodson, who was honored with a street renaming Friday, will be a revelation to most. Hopefully, other stories of previously unknown Black heroes will follow.On Friday, Philadelphia honored Waverly B. Woodson Jr. — an Overbrook High School and Lincoln University graduate — by adding his name to a street sign near his boyhood home in the Carroll Park section of West Philadelphia.The heroism of Woodson, a veteran of World War II, will be a revelation to most. African Americans weren’t depicted in war newsreels, nor were they seen in movies about D-Day such asThe Longest DayandSaving Private Ryan.However, about2,000 Black troops landed on Omaha and Utah Beaches.As an amateur historian, I first learned about Woodson’s bravery in 1997, when the Army publishedThe Exclusion of Black Soldiers from the Medal of Honor in World War II. That book highlighted the bravery of multiple individuals whose actionsabove and beyond the call of dutywere “overlooked” in the awarding of our nation’s highest military award for bravery.That omission was corrected in 1997,when seven soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor. Unfortunately, most of Woodson’s military records had been destroyed in amassive 1973 fire(which coincidentally occurred on July 12 . Woodson didn’t receive it.It’s sad America needs to look to Germany to learn how to reconcile the present with history. From 1933 through 1945, Nazi Germany murdered over a third of the world’s Jews, destroyed thousands of synagogues and cemeteries, as well as Jewish schools and community buildings. Immediately after World War II ended, Germany coddled known Nazi war criminals and did little to acknowledge its sins.However, over the last few decades,Holocaust education has become mandatory in German schools. Today, Germany has hundreds ofhistorical markers and monumentsrecalling the official persecution of its Jews. It has rebuilt synagogues that were destroyed. It has installed over100,000 Stolpersteine brass plaquespermanently affixed to the pavement in front of buildings where Jews lived before they were murdered during the Nazi era.Descendants of the survivors of theMiddle Passage, which killed substantially over a million Africans on their horrific journey to the Americas, have suffered from slavery,debt peonage, sharecropping, lynching, state-sanctioned pogroms,redlining, segregation, discrimination, and police brutality. However, until recently, American schools have been reluctant to teach all this shameful history.More than two decades ago, attorneyMichael Coardbegan his campaign to incorporate historical references to the legacy of slavery at Independence Mall. Thanks to his efforts, the stories of how slaveholders Martha and George Washington kept their “property” a stone’s throw from the Cradle of Liberty are included at thePresident’s House Site, which is now a must-see for every school student and tourist.Before 1990, thePennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission had erected only two of its distinctive blue-and-gold historical markersrecognizing African American individuals, institutions, or events in Black history.Charles L. Blockson, the noted scholar of Black history, dedicated the next 30 years of his life to getting the commission to erect over 50 African American-themed markers.Today, there are efforts to limit teaching Black history and acknowledging that America has had a racist legacy.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis recently proclaimed thatslaves benefited from slavery.During the race for the Republican presidential nomination, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley didn’t mention slavery when she was first asked aboutthe cause of the Civil War.African Americans weren’t depicted in World War II newsreels, nor were they seen in movies about D-Day.Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos stated that historically Black colleges and universities wereestablished to support school choice, conveniently ignoring that many predominantly white institutions barred African American students.Permanently acknowledging Woodson’s bravery brings his story to the fore. Hopefully, other stories of previously unknown African American heroes will follow.The study of African American participation in World War II shouldn’t be limited to Dorie Miller and the Tuskegee Airmen.Over one million Black men,6,500 Black members of the Women’s Army Corps, and500 Black nursesserved in North Africa, Liberia, Italy, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, Guadalcanal, Guam, Saipan, Iwo Jima, India, China, Hawaii, Alaska, and in every state.The challenges these brave soldiers faced as they were subjected to segregation and discrimination in the military — while being expected to fight fascism abroad — became the crucible that forged in them a postwar spirit that forever changed America to truly being a country “with liberty and justice for all.” Their stories must be told.Paul L. Newman is an amateur historian of African American history. He has written a miniseries docudrama on the African American civil rights movement of the first half of the 20th century."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_199,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°In February, there was a flurry of discussion about whether Joe Biden’s advancing age and seeming weakness in a matchup with Donald Trump meant that he should step aside. I wrote a column on that theme, but the more notable (that is, nonconservative voices arguing that Biden should consider withdrawing from the race included polling maven Nate Silver and my colleague Ezra Klein. The report from special counsel Robert Hur, which indicated memory problems for the president, was also part of the discussion — or, if you prefer the terms favored by the president’s allies, part of the unnecessary freakout.“The Drumbeat for Biden to Step Aside Will Only Grow Louder” ran one headline from that period, from Robert Kuttner in the American Prospect. Kuttner was wrong; the drumbeat has quieted. All it took was Biden giving a passable State of the Union address: Thereafter his poll numbers marginally improved, the optimists on the Democratic side seized the rhetorical initiative, and the “should Biden step aside?” discourse faded into background noise.But here we are entering May, with just six months before the election, and the basic dynamic that inspired the original discussion/freakout is still with us. Biden’s minisurge was, well, miniature. He’s still slightly behind in national polling, and he still trails Trump in the swing states that won the Electoral College for the Democrats last time — Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The gap is narrow: Depending on your preferred polling average and what you make of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s polling numbers, Biden probably needs to make up just a few points to pull ahead — maybe 3 points, maybe 4. But it’s also quite consistent; since last fall, both candidates are bouncing around within a very narrow range.The Democratic response to this consistency blends unwarranted confidence with unwarranted fatalism. On the one hand, there’s the belief that Trump’s lead is unsustainable — because he has a ceiling and can’t get past 50%On the other hand, there’s a “what can we do?” irritation with anyone who suggests that Biden should deviate from the way he’s approached policy and politics to date. He’s done great! The public is just ungrateful or confused, misled by the media or blinded by partisanship! He should be up by 10 points! If he can’t win with this record, America deserves what it gets!Here is an alternative view of Biden’s situation. One plausible lesson of the Trump years is that if you are consistently beating Trump in the polls, you want to be temperamentally cautious, focus on your campaign fundamentals and get-out-the-vote efforts, and project normalcy at every opportunity. This was what the Democrats did well in 2018 and 2020, their years of anti-Trump success.If, on the other hand, you are losing to Trump (as his Republican rivals were in the 2016 and 2020 primaries , you cannot relyat allon events or Trump fatigue magically coming to your rescue. Instead you need to formulate a strategy that’s commensurate with the challenge and be willing to break the normal rules of politics (as Trump’s Republican rivals failed to do in 2016 and 2020 in order to deal with the abnormality of Trump himself.The problem with the Biden campaign is that it’s being run as if its candidate were in the first position, as if it were protecting a lead that Biden doesn’t have.That means refusing the kind of big move that Klein and others urged, wherein a patriotic recognition of his own limits, physical and political, leads the unpopular incumbent to step aside and give his party a chance to reset the terms of the election.It means eschewing the smaller kind of potential ticket shake-up, in which Kamala Harris, the worst possible backstop for an aging president, yields to a vice presidential candidate who might actually be reassuring, even popular.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

minnpost_2024_53,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Abraham Lincoln, who was a very good attorney before becoming president, once warned fellow practitioners not to assert in their legal papers “more than you ought, lest you have to prove more than you can.”Simply put, when engaged in the legal process, less is more or, better yet, more can be a morass.Lincoln’s admonishment is the foundation of the doctrine of judicial restraint, a tenet that ordinarily strives to decide cases narrowly on the issues raised in it and cautions against sweeping rulings that go beyond the needs of the particular dispute.But the majority of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court strayed from that precept in deciding March 4 in the Colorado ballot exclusion case that neither it nor any other state can bar former President Donald Trump from the ballot under the “engaged in insurrection” clause of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Five of them, all purported subscribers to the judicial restraint principle, ran right through the red light of restraint in their decision.The core of the ruling was that states lack “authority” under that provision to disqualify a candidate for federal office. But the majority, composed of five of the six conservative, Republican-appointed men, were not content to stop there. Plowing through the red light of restraint, contrary to the limitation of the lore of Lincoln, a founder of the Republican Party, the high court five articulated a laborious and impractical way to invoke the “insurrection” clause.The only way to do so, the quintet declared, was for Congress to enact specific legislation directed at a particular individual, which would presumably necessitate a time-consuming highly partisan proceeding to decide if an “insurrection” occurred, whether the particular individual “engaged” in it, and what sanction, if any, is appropriate that would probably be doomed if either branch of Congress were to be controlled by the party to which the accused belongs.In effect, the justices gave a free press to future insurrectionists (and the past one, too by effectively eviscerating the “insurrection” disqualification clause.While the ruling overturning the Colorado ballot ban was unanimous, its reasoning was not identical even within the right-wing ranks. The three liberals, all Democratic women appointees, agreed with the outcome to avert ballot “chaos” across the land, took the occasion to blast the ex-President as an “oath-breaking insurrectionist,” a characterization equally unnecessary to the determination.But it was Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a card-carrying member of the conservative consortium, who came closest to getting it right. Calling for calm, rather than invective, she critiqued the majority opinion with Lincoln-like logic for exceeding the bounds of the issue before the tribunal and creating a virtually insuperable “insurrection” obstacle.What accounts for the ruling by these self-anointed proponents of judicial restraint?There are many possibilities, but the principle of Occam’s Razor, named after the 14th Century English philosopher, might apply: if there are multiple explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest one is usually correct.In this case, the simplest one may be that they want the former 45th president to become the 47th.It’s not the first time the right-wing wrecking ball that is the current high court has diluted or decimated Constitutional rights it doesn’t like. The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case two years ago, which nullified the Constitutional right to abortion, as established 49 years earlier in the Roe v. Wade decision authored by Minnesota’s Harry Blackmun, was another illustration of the tribunal shrinking long-standing Constitutional provisions into virtual oblivion.Of course, it’s not always that way. Two other Constitutional provisions have been treated with extreme deference. In nearly every decision going back close to two decades to the onset of Chief Justice Roberts’ appointment, the tribunal has upheld theological-based positions under a remarkably expansive view of the Freedom of Religion clause of the First Amendment, allowing public funding of parochial schools, religious school tuition and school prayer.Similarly, the Second Amendment right to “bear and keep arms” has been treated with undue breadth in striking down safety-geared measures that, in the court’s view, are inconsistent with “history and tradition.”So, when the Roberts Court venerates a particular Constitutional provision, its proponents prevail; when it doesn’t, they don’t.It might not have happened this way if the merits of the “insurrection” matter had been addressed in Minnesota, where the state Supreme Court four months ago decided not to decide the ballot bar issue.The jurisprudence in this state, derived from the 2014 case entitled Walsh v. U.S. Bank, follows the lore of Lincoln. The decision, written by Justice David Lillehaug, endorsed the principle known as “notice pleading” — a practice in which lawyers need only provide a short, concise description of a case, devoid of bloviation. In doing so, lawyers are encouraged to be Lincoln-esque in avoiding pleading “more than they ought” in order to avoid being hung on their own over-pleaded petard.But the five-member high court majority in the Trump ballot case deviated from this approach. In getting far out in front of their skis, something Minnesotans know a bit about, they addressed an issue not before them — the required procedures for disqualification of an insurrectionist — and in the delivery made the clause virtually a dead letter.For the misguided idealists who brought the cases in various states — Colorado, here in Minnesota and a handful of other places — the outcome was not only disappointing but an illustration of the old saw, “don’t ask for something you don’t want, you might get it.”Marshall H.

eugeneweekly_2024_36,"We ve got issues. Isn’t Pride a beautiful thing? It’s a time to honor who you are and what you mean to the world. A colorful celebration of everything the queer community has fought for. A space where everyone is respected and represented no matter their sexuality or gender identity. Almost. I went to my first Pride parade at 14 years old in Portland. I was decked out in a pastel rainbow-dyed dress shirt, necklaces depicting the female gender symbol and eyeliner too thick for my features. I saw flags for sexualities I’d never heard of: androsexual, omnisexual, sapiosexual and more. However, I didn’t see two identities that became rather important to me in the years to come represented: aromanticism and asexuality. People who identify as aromantic, or aro, experience little to no romantic attraction. Those who identify as asexual, or ace, experience little to no sexual attraction. There are a litany of romantic and sexual identities that fall under the aroace umbrella. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. I came out to my family as bisexual at 12 and as a lesbian at 13. Labels have always been fluid to me, sticking like Velcro rather than glue. In my freshman year of college, I began identifying with the aroace community. I realized that I’d yet to feel any sort of genuine romantic attraction, let alone sexual attraction, towards anybody. I’ll be honest when I say that this scared me more than any other “questioning my identity” experience ever had. I’d known what it was like to be different from others, but this was my first time feeling downright alone. I do know I’m not actually alone with an aroace identity. I just no longer quite fit in among those who are attracted to others. Even around those I considered generally accepting and well-versed in the queer community, I faced the most pushback when I spoke up about my lack of attraction. I was doubted. I was asked if I had an issue with vulnerability or if I just hadn’t found the right person. None of these comments came from a place of hate, but rather of misunderstanding. All the same, I was asked to defend myself and my identity in a way that I never had before. Things got especially confusing when I realized I wasn’t just aroace, I was demisexual and demiromantic. Those who identify as demi don’t experience attraction until a strong emotional bond has been formed. “Oh, so maybe you really haven’t met the right person!” Maybe! Who cares? Fuck off. Here’s the thing about Pride that I genuinely think the LGBTQ+ community and allies alike both forget: You don’t have to understand. You just have to accept and respect. Being aroace is an invisible identity, I know. All I ask is that as we celebrate Pride this year, we greet those who are out and proud about their asexuality and aromanticism, who make it visible in this period of celebration, in the same way we’d greet our allosexual and alloromantic peers rather than question whether they’re truly queer.

minnpost_2024_5,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.In 2004, I was a single mom raising three daughters on my own. I worked three jobs, including an overnight shift as a translator at our local hospital, to make ends meet. Every time I stood in line at the supermarket, I worried about what I would have to put back on the shelf to stay within our weekly $100 food budget.My daughters are all grown now. But whenever I’m buying groceries, I still get that horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach as I remember not knowing if we would have enough to eat, and how much — or how little — I could provide for my family with $100.Prices for all of us have gone way up since COVID, and$100 now buys about $65 worth of groceriescompared to five years ago. This puts a huge bite on working families, because we spend most of our income every month — as much as 90% — on food and other necessities. So when prices rise, we hurt the most.Big corporations tell us that policies and supply chains are to blame for rising costs, but there’s a big part of the story they don’t want you to know: These giant corporations are themselves largely responsible for higher prices.According toa new report by the Federal Trade Commission, the largest grocery retailers — which include Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon, which owns Whole Foods — used the pandemic as an excuse to raise prices across the board. The same is true for big agribusinesses like Tyson Foods and DuPont, which sell the lion’s share of meat products and seeds.These giant companies wrote themselves a blank check during COVID, which they now expect us to pay for.What all of these corporations have in common isthey always want to get bigger. Why?Because when consumers have fewer choices, corporations can force us to pay higher prices. This is especially true with food, which none of us can live without. And according to the FTC, a big reason for these higher prices is corporate greed.Time and again, big companies tell us that if they could only get bigger, they would pass savings on to consumers. This is almost never true. Instead, they give money back to their investors and reward executives — like Walmart’s Doug McMillon, who takes home over $25 million a year, and Kroger’s Rodney McMullen, who makes more than $19 million. That’s 671 times more than the amount an average Kroger’s worker makes.Corporate consolidation can have deadly consequences. In health care, which my organization tracks closely, we see that the domination of private insurance by a handful of companies — Aetna, United Healthcare, and Cigna — leads to bigger bills, worse health outcomes, and lost lives.The profits of retailers and agribusinesses have now risen to record levels, as much as five times the rate of inflation. How do companies like Tyson Foods, Kroger, and Walmart boost profits? The way they always do: by raising prices, while 65% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.No American should ever have to work three or more jobs just to survive: not in 2004, 2024, or 2044. We want a world in which every one of us has what we need not only to live, but also to dream.

Behind those combatants were 3,500 people who offered them safe houses and storage for their ammunition. Bolstering them was a much broader community of people who endorsed their efforts.Ultimately, decades of sectarian violence were perpetrated by a small group of people on each side; but it was the broader public’s support that gave extremists permission to carry out their carnage.Britain’s recent riots, instigated by anti-immigration protesters in cities across England following the stabbing deaths of three young girls, illustrate this point clearly. A violent eruption only spreads like wildfire when an environment of public support enables it to escalate.In the days when I was driven by an extremist agenda, our movement recognized the need and opportunity to increase broad-based support among the North American middle. To normalize extremist ideas, we attempted to take a position previously considered radical and make it palatable enough for the public to get behind. If we could repackage a concept that only 1 percent of people supported in a way that 5% would accept, we could expand our outer edge of extremism while simultaneously moving where the center lies.We paid close attention to public discourse in the middle, searching for signals of our efforts taking hold. Thankfully, we failed; but the lesson remains: Language of intolerance and dehumanization in the center ultimately enables radical extremism at the outer edges.In the aftermath of the Oct, 7, 2023 attack on Israel, I participated in conversations with people on all sides of the conflict. Often, I was shocked by the extraordinary comments made by very reasonable people. When this happened, I would interrupt my company and ask them to repeat themselves while listening closely to their own words — to the gross generalizations, dehumanizing rhetoric and support for extreme acts of violence. Even having gone through the process of radicalization and deradicalization myself, I remain shocked by how quickly sentiment can turn; how extremist ideas rapidly become normalized; and how many people can quickly be swayed to justify hate.In the current polarized political climate, I see this process occurring. Each side views the other through a binary lens and assumes moral superiority for their stances. To varying degrees, all of us have become influenced by a narrative of existential, all-or-nothing partisan crisis. Depending on which American friends and colleagues I speak to about the upcoming elections, the underlying assumption is that everyone will be doomed to either concentration camps or civil war.Endorsements for extremism don’t have to be outright calls to arms; they’re usually far more casual. When celebrities and musicians display the severed heads of their political opponents and joke about how the shooter shouldn’t miss his target next time, they give their support to radical elements. When we reduce entire swaths of the population to names like “criminal,” “rapist,” “weird” or “extremist,” terms which stigmatize and dehumanize the “other,” we tacitly condone ideas that lie outside of political norms. These notions inform an increased sense that “the ends justify the means” and widen our windows of acceptance for radical means. When we equate politicians with Hitler, for example, should we be surprised when an assassination attempt is made?The most extremist members of society, those bent on exclusion, hatred and suffering, are ready and waiting to seize upon our words to accomplish their destructive agendas. Almost universally, violent conflicts worldwide begin with slurs to denounce another group, painting them in a derogatory light. Through the gradual process of dehumanization through rhetoric, exclusion and microaggressions, each group frames “the enemy” as an existential threat to their value system, religion, way of life, privilege, culture and so on. Lazy language that defaults to stereotypes, generalizations and name-calling creates just enough fuel to light a fire in the outer fringes. With enough tacit support from the center, a spark can give way to an inferno with enough power to sustain itself.It is essential that the majority of people in the center maintain our values and humanity. As Friedrich Nietzsche said, “Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster.” We cannot lend our voices to the cause of extremism, even if we are doing so unintentionally. How we choose to show up, particularly on divisive issues, recalibrates the norms. It sends a signal to those around us that we demand better from ourselves; that we will not stoop to carelessness, fear and judgment to comfort ourselves or win favor in challenging times. When we choose our words intentionally, we help guide others to do the same. With curiosity and courage, we can halt the slide.Over this past year, I have traveled extensively throughout the United States, screening the film “The Cure For Hate – Bearing Witness To Auschwitz,” and implementing an accompanying curriculum that helps high school students explore the process of othering, dehumanization and polarization (then and now . We have gone from the bluest town in the bluest county in the bluest state — Battleboro, Vt. — to the reddest town in the reddest county in the reddest state — Rigby, Idaho.On the surface, these places seem to be worlds apart; but, when I talk with the parents of our student participants, they all express similar concerns for their children. They long for their kids to grow up safe and healthy; they want them to have access to a promising future. They have different ideas on how to reach these goals, but they start from a common place.When we adopt a mindset of “us vs. them,” we ignore this space where progress toward those shared goals can happen. When we break the pattern, that’s when we all stand a chance.McAleer is the author of “The Cure For Hate – A Former White Supremacist’s Journey From Violent Extremism To Radical Compassion.”Fumie Christine Cabral, 96, of Hilo died Aug. 26 at a private care home in Hilo.

But those investments are helping Americans at all income levels, in both small towns and urban areas. One example: The Biden administration is bringing clean, resilient solar power to federally funded health centers across the nation.As a senior vice president at the National Association of Community Health Centers, I can vouch for the importance of this work. The 1,400 health centers comprise a vital safety net, serving patients regardless of their ability to pay. Most of the centers’ 31.5 million patients are people with low incomes; many live in remote areas where other healthcare options are lacking.Those patients are especially vulnerable when disasters or power outages shut down their local health center. And both are increasingly common: In 2023, the United States saw a record-breaking 28 climate-related disasters with damages topping $1 billion each. Extreme weather, along with chronically underfunded utility grids, have caused a dramatic increase in power outages in recent years.During a power outage, lifesaving medicines go bad, staff can’t access electronic health records and essential medical equipment — such as x-ray machines and ventilators — shuts down. That’s what happened in 2021 when Hurricane Ida knocked out power lines across Louisiana. At CrescentCare Community Health Center in New Orleans, a diesel backup generator failed, spoiling refrigerated vaccines and rendering medical equipment useless. Doctors were unable to care for patients when they needed it most.But CrescentCare is better prepared for the next natural disaster. Thanks, in part, to generous new tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, CrescentCare is installing solar panels with a battery backup (solar plus storage that will keep the power flowing even when the grid goes down.CrescentCare will soon be joined by many others. Last month, the Department of Energy announced $57 million in funding for the CHARGE Partnership, which will install these panels at up to 175 clinics across the rural southeast — in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.In addition to ensuring access to care in a storm-prone region, the CHARGE Partnership anticipates that solar plus storage will enable the health centers to save up to $45 million in energy costs. The clinics will also reduce their greenhouse gas emissions — lowering the risk of future climate disasters.We know that solar plus storage is a game changer for community health centers. In 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico, shutting down many of the island’s health centers. Nearly 3,000 people died. Afterward, Direct Relief installed solar plus storage at eight community health centers. When a fire took down the island’s power grid in 2022, those health centers were able to continue operating at full capacity.In our evermore polarized nation, it’s easy to lose sight of our common interests. But we all need to be able to access healthcare, especially when the power grid goes down. The Biden administration’s investments in clean, resilient solar energy are not just for the privileged few.—Progressive Perspectives/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

leoweekly_2024_30,"Dear Oracle,After 50 years of working, I am starting off 2024 as retired. I’m looking forward to a few things, like traveling and spending time with my grandchildren, but It is a little daunting not knowing what my day-to-day will look like. How can I ease into this new stage of life?--Ready to retireCards: Two of Swords (rev. , Knight of Cups (rev. , Eight of Pentacles, Four of Wands (rev. Dear Ready,Congratulations on your retirement! Fifty years is a long time to keep your nose to the grindstone, so I hope these years offer you all the rest and relaxation that you need and the joy that you want.You aren’t the only one to be intimidated by the unknown after retirement. Traditionally, work offered structure: you had a schedule, you socialized with co-workers, you thought about your responsibilities. None of that is required in retirement. With enough money and lack of impulse control, you could very well spend the rest of your days drunk and naked on a boat, drifting aimlessly from port to port like some sort of boomer pirate.But there might be more fulfilling ways to spend your new free time.With the Two of Swords, it’s important to be intentional about your choices, particularly as they concern your mind. Without a set schedule, it’ll be thrilling to sleep in or spend hours watching TV without feeling guilty. And while that’s fine for a couple of weeks, it won’t offer much in the way of intellectual stimulation. You need to keep your mind sharp.The Eight of Pentacles is often a “nose to the grindstone” type of card, but it doesn’t necessarily mean your job-job. You could throw yourself into a creative pursuit, take classes in a subject you’ve been interested in, or hone a hobby into a full-time endeavor. Maybe it’s volunteering or learning Mahjong. Whatever it is, have something to give your mind to.With the Knight of Cups, I’d also encourage you to be social, investing more time in old friendships and trying to cultivate new ones. The Knight is charming and social but also vulnerable. He puts a great deal of love into his relationships, and they, in turn, fill him with purpose. Don’t second guess yourself when reaching out—they probably aren’t busy and do want to hear from you.Finally, spending time with family will be incredibly rewarding for you. The Four of Wands can show familial bliss and stability. Now that you have more time, you might get to take on a larger role in your grandchildren’s lives, expand your relationship with your children, or deepen your relationship with your spouse.With something to occupy your curious mind and relationships to fill your soul, I think you’ll have a wonderful retirement.(And, you know, maybe take up pickleball for your health. Dear Oracle,I’ve recently moved house to a new city. It’s a great choice for me: very “artsy,” far more affordable, and the people don’t seem to take themselves too seriously. It’s going to be a refreshing change of pace. I am worried how this move will affect my friendships (both existing and new ones. Any advice?--Social Life in The City?Cards: Knight of Swords, First Quarter, The Devil, The Fool (rev. Dear Social,The first two cards of this spread offer some basic, expectant advice, while the last two throw the whole question into a different light. It’s difficult to bridge the two without knowing more, but I’ll try.First, the conventional: As the Knight of Swords, you are a Romantic charging into the unknown. This makes sense: you moved to a new place based on the atmosphere. Very Romantic, very unknown. With the First Quarter moon card, it’s a time for action and getting out there. Fair.With The Fool reversed, I’d also say that to make friends, you’ll have to go down a new path—but everything hinges on what on earth The Devil is doing here.The Devil is a powerful card of passion, obsession, a bondage of our own making, or something that completely takes over our lives. It’s not necessarily a bad thing. A composer writing their magnum opus has Devil energy. So does a heroin addiction.Illness can often appear as The Devil. If you have deep social anxiety, for example, that might be a challenge you would need to overcome—a path of healing led by The Fool. If you, perhaps, tend to meet people out partying but struggle with substance abuse, you might need to follow The Fool toward recovery and sobriety.Or, The Devil might be a romantic partner, a toxic one that takes over your life and every waking thought and leads you to feeling ruined and wretchedly in love. (I hope not. I don’t know what your Devil is. I do know that it lurks in your new city, just as it lurked in the last, and you will have to confront it. But, the good news about The Devil is that he deals in deception. It might feel like you’re chained to this darkness—whatever it is—and there’s no escape, but that’s not true. You can slip them. It might not be easy, but it’s certainly possible.This brings us back to The Fool. Standing on the cliff’s edge with a song in his heart and a little dog at his feet, The Fool is pure optimism, a beginner’s mind ready to start.The Devil often robs us of a future. We can only see our situation. But The Fool is all future, all possibility, and taking chances and hope. A new path is open to you. It might take time to slip whatever chains you have, but again, it is possible.I hope this new city offers a change in perspective and a path forward. Good luck walking it, my dear, wherever it may lead. ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_249,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It was a late afternoon conversation on the back patio. Dot, my wife, and I were talking about major events that have occurred in our almost 70 years of marriage, and that’s a lot of ground to cover. “Do you recall a time like this when it seems the world is coming apart: COVID shutdowns, financial distress, the Ukraine war, the Middle East, and constant economic upheavals, and now a huge financial market sell-off”? Dot asked.After thinking a bit, I admitted that I could not recall anything quite like the last 15 years.Dot responded with a challenge: “If you were made economics czar in January and had full sway to change federal policies, what would you do to make things better? Taxes? Regulation? What?”After a long silence, which gave me a chance to think a bit, I suggested two things that I would do as economics czar. The answers? First, the right kind of nothing — a year-long ban on any changes in taxes, spending, regulation, tariffs and monetary policy, and during that pause, a call for a long conversation with the American people about their hopes, dreams and future promise.Now, some background.There’s no doubt about it, since the 2008 Great Recession, the U.S. economy has been roiled to look more like the Great American Scream Machine than the Great American Bread Machine. The Federal Reserve is still trying to reduce inflation from the high nines to a 2% goal while working to avoid another recession. Meanwhile, presidential candidates from both parties are calling for more tariffs, higher taxes for some and lower for others, and more or different kinds of regulation.Put another way, the economics medicine men and women are on the hunt. With external shocks aplenty, like energy interruptions, wars and a pandemic, we have been on a bumpy policy path with more potholes promised.Just to put some dimensions on the roller coaster turbulence experienced by the American people since 2007, consider this. The unemployment rate stood at 4.7% in October 2007. It rose to 10.0% in October 2009 during the recession, just two years later. The rate then plummeted as the economy became flush with stimulus money and hit 3.5% in February 2020. Then, with COVID shutdowns, the unemployment rate jumped to 14.8% in April 2020, the largest one-month increase since 1939. It then fell to 3.4% in April 2023, after the Fed continued to cut interest rates, but rose to 4.3% in July 2024 following a Fed policy reversal. We are almost back where we started in 2007. Whew!!! What a ride!The Fed’s goosing and then braking actions delivered higher interest rates, which in turn took a bite out of economic activity. The effects are seen in the average interest rate paid nationwide for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The rate paid in third quarter 2007 stood at 6.55%. This was before the 2008 Great Recession, COVID and the later battle against inflation. Long after the recession, in the fourth quarter of 2012, when the economy was flooded with money, the rate fell to 3.36%. Then, when the Fed reversed engines and began to tighten, the mortgage rate rose to 4.78% in 2018’s fourth quarter. In 2024’s second quarter, it hit 7.0%. When the trip started in 2007, the mortgage rate stood at 6.55%. We are almost back. What a ride!To get a handle on government intervention during all this, the Brookings Institution’s Hutchins Center produces a Fiscal Impact Measure that estimates how much local, state and federal spending adds to GDP quarterly growth. The measure’s four-quarter moving average stood at minus 0.25 percentage points in 2007’s third quarter. At the time, there was no meaningful government stimulus. After efforts to cushion the effects of the 2008 recession, the measure jumped to 2.62 percentage points in 2009’s fourth quarter. In 2018’s second quarter, the measure rose to 3.85 percentage points, and in 2021’s first quarter, 5.23 percentage points. Brookings predicts that the Impact Measure will register minus 0.08% in this year’s fourth quarter. This is close to where the ride started in 2007. Finally, real GDP growth was hitting 2.41% in 2007’s third quarter. The most recent estimate shows 3.1% for 2024’s second quarter.We are back! But as Jerry Lee Lewis might have put it, there was “a whole lotta shakin’ goin on.”So, with this background in mind and memories of the rough roller coaster ride still intact, let’s have a year-long policy pause and give the economy a chance to find itself, to regain balance and move forward. Of course, we will have to respond to external shocks, should they occur, but let’s not add any of our own making.And while catching our economic breath, let’s have a national conversation with hearings in major cities speaking to the fundamental question: What are our hopes and dreams, and what is our future promise?Bruce Yandle is a Distinguished Adjunct Fellow for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
minnpost_2024_139,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.On Earth Day, 2024, the Biden White House announced “Major Steps” toward the “Landmark American Climate Corps Initiative, Mobilizing the Next Generation of Climate Leaders.”What that amounts to thus far is awebsite, currently in beta, that, on day one, listed under 2,000 jobs. Many, if not most, already existed at other agencies. Yasmeen Shaheen-McConnell, the ACC’s point person at AmeriCorps, told me, “We are using existing authorities and funds to start the American Climate Corps.” Translation: There is no big new bucket of federal money for this program, yet.So, why make the announcement now? At the risk of sounding cynical, it might have something to do with shoring up the youth vote, where Bidenseemsto beslipping.During the last Presidential election cycle, the Sunrise Movement, Green New Deal Network, and other groups pushed Biden to guarantee more good, green jobs. Saul Levin, political and campaigns director at the Green New Deal Network, is one activist who told me the White House announcement is a win: “We certainly would like to see it dramatically scaled up, but I’m really optimistic. Any program has to start somewhere.”To be fair, this really is just the beginning. Throughout the first year, there will be 20,000 total American Climate Corps positions, ranging from summer jobs to one-year slots, Shaheen-McConnell said; 200,000 are planned within five years. Some of these will be created through three newly announced “corps” partnerships with AmeriCorps and other federal agencies and nonprofits: one for forests, one for climate-smart agriculture, and one for communities transitioning away from coal and other fossil fuel-based economies. In addition, Shaheen-McConnell said, 13 states — including Minnesota —thus far have launchedtheir own climate corps, most of which rely on some AmeriCorps funding.Sally Slovenski, the program director for Campus Climate Action Corps, told me a national call to action is “really critical.” She said it would “definitely help raise awareness and recruit.” Her group is thefirst nationwideAmeriCorps program focused only on campus-based and community-led climate action initiatives, and the source of many listings on the current American Climate Corps site.Carla Walker-Miller, CEO of Walker-Miller Energy Services, a Michigan-based energy efficiency company, is one business leader who’s excited about the recruitment potential of a national climate service program. “The new workforce demands training and innovation to support the new economy,” she said. “I really appreciate the fact that the Climate Corps exists. There has to be an easily accessible online clearing house – a one stop shop.”There’s some fuzziness, though, about what, exactly, makes something a climate job. Does wildfire fighting count? What about trail maintenance? Or educating park visitors on “stewardship”? Shaheen-McConnell said her agency intentionally took a “broad lens” because “every community is facing different climate challenges.”That wide focus may be confusing to potential applicants. “Young people don’t understand how climate-related service work falls into what I call ‘the 4 Rs’ – reduction, response, recovery, and resilience/preparedness work,” said Dana Fisher, a sociologist at American University who studies climate and social movements. AmeriCorps and other federal agencies have given her research funding to evaluate their climate-related service work and help them build it out in an effective way. For example, she’s developing a curriculum to help participants better understand how their service work relates to climate change.Rebecca Tarczy is a current AmeriCorps member with the Campus Climate Action Corps, Slovenski’s organization. Tarczy loves animals; she graduated with an environmental studies degree in fisheries and wildlife, and pictured herself working outside. Instead, her position at College of the Atlantic in Maine entails doing community education on energy efficiency.So far, she’s installed insulation in campus buildings, and held three public information sessions on and off campus, each of which had fewer than 10 attendees. She said it’s been a bit of a letdown for herself and peers in similar positions. “I think we were all a little disappointed that it was home-energy based.” For what it’s worth, by Fisher’s definition, this is very much a climate-action job; buildings account foraround 29 percentof U.S. carbon emissions.Tarczy, 30, is also pretty strapped for cash. AmeriCorps pays her an $18,000 salary, plus some student loan forgiveness benefits. She gets subsidized housing, too: $640 a month, including utilities and Wi-Fi. “Recently my car died and I kind of had to sell my soul to get a new one,” she said, adding that when she applied for an auto loan, “They were like, ‘Is that your correct salary?’”The stinginess of AmeriCorps stipends has been a long-time issue that critics say prevents the program from being as equitable as it could be. “We can do so much better,” said Walker-Miller, who notes that her own employees start at $19 an hour. “I think that all jobs should compensate people at a reasonable minimum wage.”Shaheen-McConnell said the president is calling on Congress to raise the minimum living allowance for AmeriCorps members to at least $15 an hour (which would be approximately $30,000 as an annual salary, although AmeriCorps positions vary in duration and hours . The American Climate Corps is also seeking partnerships with philanthropies to provide support like childcare for those who need it.The American Climate Corps is a clear historical callback to the Civilian Conservation Corps, created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression to put people back to work. But it’s a lot smaller. For nine years, CCC employed around 300,000 people per year, at a time when the U.S. population was about 40 percent of its current size. Those young people, all men, planted 2 billion trees, built over 125,000 miles of roads and trails, and fought forest fires (some say they wentoverboard in fire suppression .Standing up a big new public jobs program from scratch hasn’t been done in a long time. Fisher, of American University, said that growing the corps through a “distributed, federated” approach instead of one big, new program poses difficulties that could get in the way of the program’s effectiveness.Seven different federal agencies, with vastly different goals and mandates, signed the American Climate Corps Memorandum of Understanding: the departments of Commerce, Interior, Agriculture, Labor and Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and AmeriCorps.States, especially those with Republicans in charge, may have their own, very different view of what a climate job is.But hopefully, Fisher said, these differences can be overcome by careful evaluation and coordination. “I am a huge supporter of the ‘let many flowers bloom’ approach,” she said, “as long as they are all blooming to solve the climate crisis.”Anya Kamenetz is a journalist, author and senior advisor to the Aspen Institute’s This Is Planet Ed initiative.This commentary originally appeared inThe Hechinger Report."
eugeneweekly_2024_20,"We ve got issues. What makes the crisis of climate change so unique and compelling is the diversity of voices, past and present, that compete for the public’s attention. There are the voices of alarm coming from journalists and scientists. “We are deep in an emergency,” says Rebecca Solnit, a longtime climate and human rights activist. “The word emergency itself comes from emerge, to exit, to leave behind, separate yourself from, so an emergency is when you exit from the familiar and the stable.” “We are now doing that on a planetary scale, exiting the stability and reliability of the delicately turned systems of seasons, weather, relations between species, even the shape of the world for the past 10,000 years, as oceans draw new coastlines, lakes dry up, glaciers melt, and natural and human communities shift and migrate. It is an exodus into the unknown, and our task is to make a home there for ourselves and for the nature from which we were never separate.” There are the voices of songwriters and poets who dare us to jump off the treadmill of consumerism and consumption. Country singer Delbert McClinton wrote “Too Much Stuff”in 1997 and his lyrics ring true today: “Big house, big car, back seat, full bar / Houseboat won’t float, bank won’t tote the note / Too much stuff, there’s just too much stuff / It’ll hang you up dealing with too much stuff.” Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. There are Indigenous peoples who adopt an interdependent view that acknowledges our connections not only to the people and living beings around us, but also to generations who have come before and will come after us. In one Indigenous worldview, every decision that we make as a society should be evaluated based on its impact seven generations into the future. There are the voices of children and youth in Our Children’s Trust, which represents young people by bringing legal actions, including climate lawsuits in all 50 states. Currently in Virginia, 12 plaintiffs are awaiting a decision from their state’s Court of Appeals. These young people make the case that their government has violated their constitutional rights, including their rights to equal protection, dignity, liberty, health and safety, and public trust — which are all predicated on their right to a clean and healthful environment. There are also voices of hope through innovation. Advances in green technology are resulting in cheaper and more accessible ways to harness solar and wind to create more sustainable energy systems that, just a generation ago, were considered expensive and unrealistic. In our own state, by 2035, all new passenger cars, SUVs and light-duty pickup trucks must either be battery electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. There are the voices of the environmental justice movement. Eugene’s own Beyond Toxics is lobbying for the passage of three Oregon bills that would reduce electronic waste, support affordable and climate-resilient housing, and demand that the state disinvests from thermal coal companies. There are the counter argument voices of fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobile that claim to be innovators of cleaner energy while they continue to make huge profits through the extraction of coal and natural gas. The U.S. is now the largest exporter of liquified natural gas in the world. And let’s not forget the voices that are never heard: Those who have experienced deadly wildfires in South America, Hawaii, Australia and Canada; those who have become migrants due to drought-driven food scarcity; and those who have experienced the ravages of extreme weather events. The majority of these voices come from poor and oppressed peoples who live in developing nations that have a low carbon footprint. At 6 pm Wednesday, April 10, the Downtown Eugene Public Library will host a community discussion focusing on climate change. I will be joined by my colleague Caroline Lundquist in facilitating this discussion, which is free and open to the public at large. We hope that you can join us and add your own voice as we tackle one of the most pressing issues in our lifetime."

Unfortunately, many Minnesotans face food insecurity, which affects one in six Minnesota children and every county in the state. Rather than accepting this reality, DFL lawmakers took action to address it.This week marks the one-year anniversary since Gov. Tim Walz signed the Free School Meals bill into state law, guaranteeing every school in Minnesota the funding to provide all students with a free, nutritious breakfast and lunch. The impact has been remarkable: Minnesota schools served 4.3 million more breakfasts and 4.5 million more lunches this fall compared to the same period in 2022, representing a 37% increase in school breakfasts and a 15% increase in lunches. This change allows students to concentrate on their studies rather than their next meal, enables parents to save money and time previously spent on groceries and food preparation, and allows schools to focus more on supporting students rather than collecting lunch debt from struggling families.There was a time when bipartisan support would have been overwhelming for a program like this. However, today’s Republican Party has shifted so far to the right that GOP lawmakers cannot even support feeding children. Their attacks on the program and the DFLers who championed it are unwarranted. Rep. Natalie Zeleznikar has labeled the program as socialism, while others, like Sen. Steve Drazkowski, have gone as far as to deny the existence of food insecurity in Minnesota. Unfortunately, denying the existence of hunger does not make it disappear. Feeding children is essential.Despite these Republican state legislators’ efforts, the success of this program cannot be denied. It is already highly popular among Minnesota voters who understand that providing meals to all public school children benefits the state and working families alike. Nevertheless, Minnesota Republicans continue to oppose the program, openly stating their intent to roll it back if they regain power.Make no mistake: if Republicans repeal this program, the kids who would suffer most would be the ones from disadvantaged backgrounds and low-income families. It’s the ones whose parents couldn’t keep up with the paperwork required to get their free meal because they were working two jobs or battling a medical crisis. And the people that would benefit from the GOP regaining power in the Legislature would be the same groups that Minnesota Republicans have always tried to put first: corporations and the ultra-wealthy. Every time Minnesota Republicans take power, they have pushed to cut taxes for the rich at the expense of programs that benefit working families.Repealing the free school meals program would not be the only action taken by Republicans if they regain power. DFL legislators also passed a groundbreaking program to provide Paid Family and Medical Leave to Minnesota families starting in 2026. This program will ensure that thousands of Minnesotans who currently lack access to paid leave will no longer face financial ruin if they need to care for a loved one or take time off for a newborn child. History has shown that once a program begins providing real benefits to working families, it becomes much tougher to dismantle it. That is why I am certain that, in addition to targeting free school meals, a Republican majority would attempt to cancel the paid leave program before it can take effect.This year’s elections will determine the future of these programs. DFL leaders took action not only to combat child hunger but also to provide families with the support they need to help their children succeed in school and at home, including paid family leave and the largest child-tax credit in the nation.

We don’t mind it and here’s why.For a community news outlet that runs daily but only prints every two weeks, it makes sense — sometimes.I think it’s important that we realize how the day-to-day of a newspaper happens. Most days, we have a plan of things to write for the website (immediate things , and then weekly items from one of our underpaid freelancers.Now, as you all have witnessed, LEO has gone through some sprucing up and that hasn’t come without a price tag and cuts in other places — one of those being our freelance budget. With that time and frequency of our output in mind, it isn’t conducive for us to ask a local artist to illustrate something like a weekly food article. We try to save our asks for covers or other major pieces of the paper. And, we know that our creative community will support us but we don’t want to overstay our welcome, and ask too much. There’s a balance.I know that many will still have big feelings about this and want to disagree, and argue their side. Plus it’s easy to shout about it in the comment section. We do appreciate the feedback and especially when it comes with reason and compassion. We are happy that our creative community is passionate about keeping LEO in original art. However, sometimes there is no time, and how many asks is too many? Facts is facts. Funny enough, one of the comments disliked the AI art but also that there were human proofreading errors. We really liked that one for its cognitive dissonance. Damn the human hands for making a mistake... how dare you let the computer create an adequate representation of moldy steak.I am an artist in addition to my work at LEO and as much as I love to share my work with the community, if I were being asked repeatedly to give, give, give, there would be a hard limit. Art isn’t just an altruistic pursuit, it is also a pursuit of commerce and self-sustenance.If a corporation, no matter how loved, asks you for your free labor, how willing are you to offer it?So think of AI as a tool that the writer has taken the time to create a prompt for that then gives the output they desire. It isn’t completely unskilled.AI is developing, and we all have particular fears and reservations about its use. For us, AI learning to write articles could have meant the end of our jobs. We believed that for a while but AI is faulty and best used for minor tasks like creating an image of a moldy steak.The aim here isn’t to defend AI or to make our choice seem superior, but to put this in perspective. We’re not going to beg our local arts community endlessly for free labor. Period. That goes against our ethics more than creating the occasional AI image as an illustration. Labor should be paid and supported and we’re doing well that our freelancers keep writing for the tiny bit they are given.If a LEO filled with the hands of local illustrators, writers, and creatives is what you want… that means more dollars. We want that, too. Really. Here’s how we get it: buy ads, come to the events, visit our other advertisers, and support through your sponsorship, memberships (possible in the future .AI is simply a tool and we’re going to use all tools available to us to continue to bring you LEO.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_160,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°As we approach the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, a crucial question arises: Why are our nation’s schools experiencing increased segregation despite progress in neighborhood integration? A new study by Sean Reardon of Stanford University and Ann Owens of the University of Southern California provides a startling answer — more than half of the blame is due to the expansion of charter schools.While the courts’ lifting of desegregation orders played a role, the researchers’ analysis reveals that segregation would be approximately 14% lower if not for the expansion of charter schools.In an article on the report, Laura Meckler of The Washington Post provided the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District in North Carolina as an example. Researchers scored segregation on a scale of 0 (matching district demographics to 1.0 (complete segregation . In 1971, following a court-ordered desegregation plan, the district’s segregation score fell to 0.03. In 1991, it remained low at 0.10. Today, there are more than 30 charter schools in the district, and the district’s 2022 segregation score has risen to a whopping 0.44.As the Network for Public Education, of which I’m the executive director, and dozens of national and local organizations reported to the U.S. Department of Education in 2021, North Carolina’s education department aided and abetted the expansion of “white-flight” charter schools using money it received from a grant program. One of the schools that received funding was a former white-flight private academy, Hobgood Academy, which is now a charter. Other grants went to North Carolina charters in disproportionately white suburbs of Charlotte that were attempting to self-segregate their schools from the more racially diverse Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district.And, as we demonstrated in our recent report, the expansion of right-wing charter schools like the Cincinnati Classical Academy, which received a federal grant to expand, increases segregation with website messaging that encourages the enrollment of white children from conservative families, resulting in racially imbalanced student demographics.Do we see the same increases in segregation resulting from public school choice? Although the Reardon and Owens study did not explore that specific question, a separate study recently released by the Civil Rights Project at UCLA indicates that public magnet schools are far less segregated than charter schools.The report, written by Ryan Pfleger and Gary Orfield, examined more than 100 districts and compared the student demographics of their charter and magnet schools. The findings were clear: The charter sector has a higher proportion of intensely segregated schools than the public magnet sector, and this gap is widening over time.According to the study, “the proportion of intensely segregated charter schools, with less than 10% white students, increased from 45% to 59% from 2000 to 2021. A different trend was observed for magnets. The share of magnets that were intensely segregated was nearly the same in 2000 and 2021: 34% and 36%.”If we hope to heal the racial, socio-economic, and political divides in our nation, public schools in districts with policies designed to increase integration among schools and within schools offer our best hope.— Progressive Perspectives/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."

It’s not a widely-known principle but has undergirded the functioning of government for more than 40 years.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the overturned presumption “is misguided because agencies have no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do.” In isolation, this might make sense. Interpreting statutes is the judiciary’s whole bread and butter. If and when things aren’t laid out explicitly and in detail, we need an arbiter to make a final decision.But the courts have neither the ability nor knowledge to intervene in every case of ambiguity. The administration of a government the size and complexity of ours is not largely about resolving occasional broad statutory questions. Agencies all around the country rely on subject matter experts and career officials to make determinations about thousands of granular, often technical matters.These determinations are in furtherance of enacting the goals of Congress, because it turns out that Congress itself does not remotely possess the capability to do this itself. Legislators are sent to Washington to represent the interests of their constituents, not to understand the proper storage conditions for biohazardous materials on commercial transport flights or the control group requirements for human trials of heart drugs under FDA consideration. For that matter, judges should not be the ones parsing these things, basically because they can’t.On this Editorial Board, we do our best to dive into multiple areas of public policy and society, talking to experts and stakeholders to come up with informed opinions on everything from public transit to health delivery to immigration. We often disagree with certain policy decisions or their implementation; what we don’t do is believe that we have the capacity to overrule technical experts on the base-level facts.Do you, reader, know what polyfluoroalkyl substances are? These “forever chemicals” didn’t exist a few decades ago, but increasing bodies of research show that these chemicals are now in the bloodstream of practically every human on Earth, and are toxic in various ways. The Environmental Protection Agency is now endeavoring to limit the use and production of these chemicals. Does this fall into the EPA’s regulatory authority? What’s the proper way to safeguard public health and the environment in this matter?The query overlaid over all those others is: who should answer this question? Should it be medical doctors and PhDs in chemical engineering, or federal court judges, who will move even slower than internal agency deliberations?Now multiply that by every issue in every agency and you start to see the problem. Chevron’s detractors always maintained that companies wouldn’t begin to frivolously challenge practically every regulation enacted upon them by agency experts. Now we’ll find out, and we might all have worse air, worse products, worse consumer and labor protections and worse medical outcomes for it.—New York Daily News/TNS"
philinquirer_2024_29,"Joe Sestak, a former U.S. congressman and a retired rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, writes there is no one better than Tim Walz to have the back of working men and women in the White House.Gov.Tim Walzis the right vice presidential choice for our divided nation.He didn’t spend a quarter of a century focused on crafting a rising political career. Instead, he mastered his craft as working men and women often do: by handling several jobs at once — as an enlisted service member, a high school teacher, and a football coach. Each was a working man’s profession of service.At the end of those 25 years, Walz entered Congress, where his best salary until then — about $40,000 per year — was suddenly quadrupled. His working-class experience and roots mean he’s probably theleast wealthy vice presidential candidate in history, with a net worth less than the median for citizens his age.Why is this important? Because working-class citizens innately understand their too-often underrecognized achievements are as important as high salaries or elite positions.Take the enlisted, the military’s working service members.When Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, chief of the Soviet general staff, visited America in 1988, his U.S. counterpart, Adm. William J. Crowe, took him on a tour of military installations and ships. At the end, Crowe asked what most impressed the Soviet marshal about America. His reply: “Your enlisted men — we don’t have them.” Crowenoted that Akhromeyev“thought it was remarkable that enlisted people were not afraid to speak out and were not intimidated by their officers.”Walz wore the cloth of our nation for 24 years, and was selected by merit to rise to one of the top ranks available toour military’s treasure: its enlisted men and women. Who better to have the back of working men and women in the White House?I entered Congress with Walz, both of us representing mostly working-class districts that had been Republican for most of a century. Trusted by his constituents, he was always reelected.As fellow veterans, we’d sit around after votes, swapping stories from our pre-political careers. Mine included sailors who had saved my tail: just one example was how a young enlisted petty officer grabbed my elbow firmly as we sailed in a fog bank and commanded me, “Turn now, Captain!” after I had failed to heed him the first time. We just missed going aground, thanks to his willingness to tell me I was wrong.Some have questioned this working man about inartful or wrong statements regarding his working career. In answering, I believe that a politician complaining about political attacks is like a sea captain complaining about the sea. It’s better to put them into perspective.First, the attacks Walz is experiencing may seem minor compared with thedishonorable swift boatingof John Kerry, who had been awarded several Vietnam combat medals, including the Silver Star. Or the attacks on Adm. Mike Boorda, the first enlisted man and first non-Naval Academy graduate to be the chief of naval operations. Accused of having at one time inappropriately worn Vietnam combat medals, he walked out of his office and died by suicide — despite his then-commander in Vietnam, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, insisting he had verbally authorized Boorda’s medals.Nevertheless, the attacks must be addressed.Walz used “retired” in front of his last Army rank, and he said once that he’d been “in war.” The military’s tradition is one of accountability — answering for what you have done — so Walz owned his mistake and corrected his misstatements.As for Walz saying he had served in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, he is justified in doing so. There were routinely five to nine support veterans serving outside Afghanistan for every military member who was deployed inside the war zone itself. His medal was for the support he provided.Finally, in terms of the timeline of his decision to enter politics rather than deploy toIraq, a careful reconstruction of dates — deciding to run for Congress, rumors that the unit would deploy, and actual orders to deploy — shows that he had decided to serve his country as a congressman before his unit received the actual orders to deploy.One of our finest officers, Gen. Colin Powell, often said: “Your responsibility is to tell me what you know. Tell me what you don’t know. Then you’re allowed to tell me what you think. But you always keep those three separated.”This maxim should be adhered to today by those still making unproven claims about an enlisted leader who served with full honor.Joe Sestak is a former U.S. congressman (PA-07 and retired U.S. Navy rear admiral."
suffolknewsherald_2024_84,"Published 7:04 pm Tuesday, January 30, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor:After reading the article, “SPS continues to provide students with free breakfast and lunch,” published on Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024, written by James Robinson, I wanted to express my appreciation for the initiative taken by Suffolk Public Schools in providing free breakfast and lunch to students amidst the many challenges the pandemic has caused. This program not only addresses the needs of Suffolk’s students but also brings many benefits to our community.Providing free meals ensures that children in the community are fed and are not left hungry. It also helps families facing economic hardship during this time, as the cost of food has risen. Many families are left to decide to pay for the roof over their heads or food. This program alleviates some of that pressure.Outside of alleviating hunger, children who are well-fed perform better academically because they can concentrate not on being hungry but on their schoolwork. Proper nutrition is vital for concentration and cognitive skills. So, this program contributes to a more conducive learning environment.The City of Suffolk taking the steps to provide free breakfast and lunch to its students deserves acknowledgment. The initiative taken to implement this program proves that Suffolk wants the best for its residents and their students to succeed.Stefanie LarrySuffolkOn Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Despite DEI becoming a regular practice in many organizations, it has grown increasingly criticized and politicized, leaving many business leaders struggling to navigate such polarized terrain — so afraid of making the wrong step, they end up making no steps.At the Minnesota Chamber Foundation, we work with businesses representing all sizes, regions and industries to assess their opportunity to engage in DEI work. There are logical, attainable ways to approach DEI practices in the business community, regardless of where they are in their journey. As these organizations grapple with implementing effective DEI initiatives amidst an historic workforce shortage, the imperative is clear: activating the entire workforce is not just beneficial; it’s essential.Minnesota’s total labor force is projected to remain essentially flat this decade. Minnesota added nearly 822,00 people to the state’s workforce in the 23 years from 1978 to 2000. Since 2000, however, Minnesota added just 276,000 people to its workforce and is projected to add only 43,000 this decade. This is driven by an aging population where the number of working-age adults will plateau. Slow labor force growth will be exacerbated by a reduction in labor force participation that results from an aging population and by low (or negative net migration.DEI work has grown in Minnesota businesses, and now many organizations are revisiting and reassessing the ways in which they launch and implement these initiatives. Some businesses have yet to begin their journey, while others are making steady progress. But creating inclusive workplaces that welcome and support a diverse workforce will make Minnesota a better place to live, work and do business.Creating inclusive workplaces that welcome and support a diverse workforce is more than a moral obligation; it is a strategic business advantage. With diversity comes innovation, productivity, a broader skill set and enhanced creativity.Think about how innovation happens. Normally, it isn’t a brand-new idea thought of for the first time, but a combination of ideas. A diversity of backgrounds, ideas and thinking styles make these connections easier to attain. In addition, businesses that find ways to diversify business structures are more resilient and have more opportunities and avoid pitfalls that a homogenous team may fall into.Yet, organizational attempts to address and overcome historical inequities are sometimes met with resistance — despite these apparent organizational advantages.The need for DEI is fueled by the growing demand from potential employees and business partners and is promoted through local initiatives such as the Department of Employment and Economic Development’s Drive for 5 funding initiative, promoting partnerships across sectors and ensuring employers are bringing quality jobs to a diverse and representative workforce. With the diversification of our state, changing demographics and a competitive workforce, businesses not prioritizing the engagement of a diverse workforce will miss out on an essential talent pool.One of the biggest challenges the business community faces is creating an authentic and realistic DEI strategy that aligns with the overall mission and vision of the organization. Intentionality is key. What makes sense for one organization does not always work for another — as one-size-fits-all approaches are often flawed.Businesses must consider the multiple factors that can impact initiative success, such as geography, business size, industry and existing company culture. Step one should assess where the business is in its DEI journey and the opportunity it has to meet its goals. The business community has demonstrated that DEI success can look several different ways: implementation of internal training, launching on-site language lessons, securing transportation or housing for employees who experience those as barriers to employment.Recognizing the need for a more structured and tailored approach, the Minnesota Chamber Foundation developed a DEI assessment process available to chamber members. Thiscustomized tool is intended to help organizations create a realistic and attainable DEI strategy.The journey toward embracing diversity and promoting inclusion is ongoing and dynamic. It’s a journey that requires commitment, creativity and a willingness to adapt. For Minnesota businesses, this is not just a journey toward a more inclusive and equitable environment but a stride toward a more successful and sustainable future.It’s time to fully embrace this imperative — for the betterment of our businesses, our communities and our state.Whitney Harvey is the senior director of Workforce Diversity and Inclusion at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce."

(Chris Kleponis/AFP via Getty Images/TNS Joe Biden wants those disgruntled Democrats to get the hell off his lawn. But they’re not ready to put down the lanterns and pitchforks quite yet.Last Monday, the president, in a letter to House Democrats, reiterated his intention to remain in the race. He urged his fellow party members to quiet down about what they witnessed during his disastrous debate performance and to fall in line behind his candidacy.“We have 42 days to the Democratic convention and 119 days to the general election,” Biden wrote. “Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It’s time to come together, move forward as a unified party and defeat Donald Trump.”Yet as the president channels Chip Diller of “Animal House” — who screams, “Remain calm, all is well” as a parade descends into utter chaos — he brings more scrutiny on himself by limping through friendly interviews intended to deflect talk of his obvious mental decline.During an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” the host asked Biden about his efforts to unify Democrats. This is what he said: “Well look — Democrats — Joe (Scarborough , let me say it this way, the reason I’ve been on the road so much, all over the country, while Trump is riding around in a golf cart, filling out his golf card before, golf cart before he even hits the ball — but anyway, he hasn’t been anywhere in 10 days, I’ve been all over the country, No. 1.”That came on the heels of Friday’s interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, during which Biden attempted to explain his debate fiasco.“Nobody’s fault but mine,” he began. “I, uh, I prepared what I usually would do sittin’ down as I did come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized ’bout part way through that, you know, all I get quoted the New York Times had me down at 10 points before the debate, nine now or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is that, what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn’t, I mean the way the debate ran, not my fault, no one else’s fault, no one else’s fault.”Biden is operating under the notion that, if his party stays the course with his candidacy, talk about his frail mental state and his ability to serve as president through age 86 will evaporate. Even for a man who has spent five decades in Washington, this is a particularly bizarre delusion. In reality, this issue will dominate the campaign until Nov. 5 if Biden stays in the race. And even if compliant Democrats cover their ears, eyes and mouths to ignore the obvious, don’t expect independent and undecided voters to follow suit.—Las Vegas Review-JournalIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."

The number two cause of death is trauma, which includes strikes by cars, shootings and predation by animals such as dogs, mongoose and, occasionally, cats.These two causes comprise half of all the deaths studied.The third cause is inflammation, or infection, which includes toxoplasmosis along with about 20 other pathogens. Overall, of all the dead nene studied, about 4% were killed by toxoplasmosis. Not 4% of all nene, just 4% of those that died.The gosling the tragically died in Lili‘uokalani Park was emaciated and had blood and abrasions on its beak. Yes, it also had evidence of toxoplasmosis in its body, but that was not definitively proven to have killed it.Wouldn’t it make more sense for DLNR to focus its efforts on the issues that cause 50% of the deaths of endangered nene, rather than hype up fury at cats that contribute to 4%? Since habitat loss is caused by humans, perhaps DLNR should investigate the practicality of feeding stations so the birds are not starving to death.The park maintenance could leave patches of uncut grasses, even propagate healthy ones, for the geese to graze on. (Nene, by the way, are herbivores. They don’t want to eat cat food! . Have more substantial signage, speed bumps, speed limits in the areas where nene are habitually hit.The good news in all this is that the species is actually rebounding, not declining, so efforts are paying off. There is no urgent crisis to kill all the cats before the nene go extinct.If everyone would calm down and look at the facts, all the facts, we could work together to support the nene population and still allow the cats, and their feeders, to coexist.Elaine PartlowPahoaUse drug award toadd critical flightsGov. Josh Green: How are you planning to use the $916 million awarded to the state because of ineffective blood thinners purchased to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke? The May 22 article mentions there is no determination how many people have died from the ineffective drugs received.I’ve got a suggestion on how to spend some of that award money that will have a positive affect on those with heart disease and stroke. Use that money to invest in getting more flight crews for Hawaii Life Flight services within the state, especially transfers from the neighbor islands to Oahu.Hilo Benioff Medical Center states the average response time for stroke patients to be treated at the emergency room in Hilo, then get picked up by the next available flight crew, is 4.5 hours which includes waiting for availability of a flight crew but not the one-hour transport time.Stroke preventive messages stress the need to “be fast.” The quicker a person with stroke symptoms is treated, the lesser the damage to their brain.The delay in getting planes to the neighbor islands contradicts this message. Gov. Green, use that money to have dedicated planes for each island to avoid waiting for one crew that is responsible for an entire state in an emergency.If Maui can have a dedicated crew, why not the rest of the neighbor islands?Cynthia HonmaHiloA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_140,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°For shoppers who want to buy an electric car but have been put off by the steep price tag, the news last week that President Joe Biden has hiked tariffs on Chinese-made EVs to shut them out of the U.S. market is not good.It means that Chinese-made EVs won’t be sold in the U.S. anytime soon and American consumers won’t have access to affordable models, such as BYD’s Seagull, which sells for $12,000 in China. Similar EVs available in U.S. at the moment cost three times more.Right now the American car market is sorely lacking in smaller, cheaper EVs. Automakers in the U.S. have focused on electrifying bigger, more expensive models, including SUVs, trucks and minivans. The average price of an EV is $55,000, and the high sticker price is one reason EV sales are slowing; price-limited buyers are shut out of the market.Biden’s decision to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs stifles the possibility of competition in the lower end of the car market and means the affordability gap will continue. That will slow the transition to zero-emission vehicles at a time when the U.S. needs to rapidly reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.Admittedly, the politics of international trade policy with the United States’ leading economic competitor are complex. Biden is playing a long game. His administration, along with Congress, have committed billions of dollars to boost the manufacturing of electric vehicles and batteries in the U.S. so the country is not reliant on foreign imports.The Biden administration argues the tariffs are part of the larger strategy to grow the green economy by protecting the nascent domestic EV manufacturing industry and its good-paying jobs from competition from cheaper and sometimes better Chinese products. But it’s frustrating that the U.S. is in this position at all. China is winning the EV race because the government poured money into the development of zero-emission technology, knowing that EVs are the future.While China was looking forward, U.S. automakers spent much of the last decade trying to delay EV production mandates and investing in bigger, more expensive gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks. When Donald Trump was elected president, automakers persuaded him to roll back Obama-era vehicle pollutant standards that would have required companies to increase fuel economy and build more hybrid and electric vehicles.The U.S. government and the industry wasted years dithering over tailpipe emissions standards while China was figuring out how to get rid of tailpipes altogether.Now, at least there is forward momentum in the U.S. — though slower than needed — toward a zero-emission future. Still, it’s impossible to separate the tariff decision from election-year politics. Biden and Trump are competing for the “toughest on China” title. While Biden announced the 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, Trump said he would impose 200% tariffs on Chinese vehicles made in Mexico.Biden has yet to make the case that protectionism will help American consumers and the fight to slow global warming, and his administration should support more policies and financial incentives to balance the higher cost to Americans. The tariffs may be a temporary measure to help the U.S. catch up, but ultimately the nation needs to be a leader in the zero-emission future.— Los Angeles Times/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

The Steelers defeated the Raiders 23-18. (Ethan Miller/Getty Images/TNS Reggie Jackson is still hitting them out of the park.Not since the former Yankee slugger clouted three home runs in a World Series game against the Dodgers in 1977 has Jackson done more with a pitch in the strike zone.This time, it was Alex Rodriguez, of all people, serving up the fast ball.The occasion was a nationally-televised major league game last week honoring Willie Mays and the Birmingham, Alabama, ball field where the baseball legend began his professional career in the Negro Leagues.Mays, one of the few players to hit more home runs than Jackson, had just died a couple of days before at the age of 93.Rodriguez, another former Yankees slugger, asked Jackson during the Fox Sports broadcast how he felt about returning to Birmingham’s historic Rickwood Field, where he played in the minor leagues.What followed was more than three minutes of brutal, painful honesty, and a clip to rival any of Jackson’s home run highlight reels.Jackson, who played in Birmingham, spoke of the racism he endured with the Athletics’ Double-A team in 1967.“Coming back here is not easy,” Jackson said. “The racism when I played here, the difficulty of going through different places where we traveled. Fortunately, I had a manager and I had players on the team that helped me get through it.”“I walked into restaurants, and they would point at me and say, ‘The n—-r can’t eat here,’” Jackson said. “I would go to a hotel, and they would say, ‘The n—-r can’t stay here.’”Jackson said they went to team owner Charlie Finley’s country club for a welcome home dinner.“They pointed me out with the N-word: ‘He can’t come in here,’” Jackson recalled. “Finley marched the whole team out. He said, ‘We’ll go where we’re wanted.’”In his 21 big league seasons, Jackson was hit by a pitch 96 times. None of them stung more than what he endured during the 114 games he played for the Birmingham A’s.“Fortunately, I had a manager in Johnny McNamara that, if I couldn’t eat in the place, nobody would eat,” Jackson said.“We’d get food to travel. If I couldn’t stay in a hotel, they’d drive to the next hotel and find a place where I could stay. Had it not been for Rollie Fingers, Johnny McNamara, Dave Duncan, Joe and Sharon Rudi, I slept on their couch three, four nights a week for about a month and a half. Finally, they were threatened that they would burn our apartment complex down unless I got out.”Fans who like their history in neat little boxes like to think that it was only Jackie Robinson who had to endure the racist taunts. Many understand that players like Mays and Henry Aaron. former Negro leaguers, also paid a price to pave the way for others.But few would associate Reggie Jackson — who famously fought with Billy Martin, and clashed with Thurman Munson — with pioneers who suffered so future Black players could thrive in the game.Much has been said about greatness in the days since Mays died. There have been endless highlight reels and a trove of warm tributes.But no one, no one, did a better job of honoring Willie and Hank and Jackie, and Birmingham than the man known as Mr. October.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."

The idea was to spare the elderly from unnecessary exposure to contagious viruses and emergency room chaos.The hospital diversion programs worked so well during lockdown that healthcare providers are expanding in-home care for the post-COVID era. It’s not quite a return to the era of doctors making house calls, but Minnesota now has roving teams of nurses and paramedics to treat seniors in their living rooms instead of emergency rooms.Turns out that it’s often easier, cheaper and more convenient to deliver medical help at home.Today we know that hospitals are great at saving lives, but they also can expose people to other health complications. Studies show at leastone of three visitsto hospital emergency rooms is non-urgent or unnecessary. Only 18.3 million of the 139.8 million annual national emergency room visits last year — or just13%— resulted in a hospital admission.Relying on hospital emergency rooms for routine medical care is extremely costly and inefficient. An analysis of millions of healthcare claims found that theaverage ER visitcosts $2,715. That indicates more than $125 billion a year of healthcare money, both private and tax-financed through Medicare and Medicaid, may be wasted on unnecessary ER visits.It would be easy to point fingers at patients who treat the hospital as a doctor’s office, but the sad reality is that our current system leaves many people with few alternatives.Thewidening shortageof primary care physicians and geriatricians — America needs 86,000 more doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges — means standard medical appointments can take days or weeks to be scheduled. More than100 million Americansdon’t have a primary care doctor, a number that has more than doubled in the past decade.And the thicket of regulations and rules means many of the Americans who do have medical insurance don’t know how to use it. To bring home that problem to new healthcare workers, I once asked paramedics in training to pose as Medicaid recipients in need of medical care. After struggling with an endless cascade of online forms and automated voice messaging systems, most of our trainees simply gave up. It was all too bewildering. The easiest way to get medical care for too many people was to stop wrestling with the medical bureaucracy and just show up for treatment at a hospital emergency room.All these costs, all this hassle, all this inefficiency — this is why it makes sense to deploy medical teams into the field to treat seniors at home.Basic economics of acute medical care at home are straightforward: A paramedic or nurse with field supplies can be deployed to a senior’s home for $100 per hour or so. A $100 per-hour home visit is much cheaper than a $2,715 trip to the emergency room. It’s also much more convenient, and effective, for a senior than a full-blown ER visit.The key is to make sure our medical field staff is trained and equipped to evaluate the urgency of medical care. Our teams divide medical requests into five levels of triage, with Level 5 serving as an actual medical crisis that requires immediate ER care, while Level 3-4 are more urgent issues that can be treated by a paramedic or nurse at home, and level 1- 2 by our trained triage team of nurses.Seniors who have been served by our at-home system don’t have to deal with the complications that come with a trip to a medical office, including the battle with traffic, mobility challenges of getting from the car to the facility, and the exposure to viruses, bacteria, and other illnesses that come with sick patients in medical facilities.But in-home health offers advantages to medical providers, too. We appreciate the ability to get to know seniors at home. Seniors are usually guarded and not fully candid when visiting a doctor in an office, but in their home our medical professionals tend to hear more honest takes on their true condition. Home visits also allow our paramedics and nurses to evaluate the social determinants of health that sometimes carry greater weight than any professional medical treatment. Is the senior living in a safe place, with enough food, and a caring community?Another big plus of home visits is the ability to know seniors as a person instead of a collection of health issues. We understand their medical contingency plans and their advance care wishes. Even better, we know the emotional importance of upcoming life events, such as the marriage of their granddaughter next month.In some cases, when one of our seniors does go to the hospital with a Level 5 immediate medical crisis, we join them to help sort through the web of prescribed treatments and rehabilitation. This helps reduce the compartmentalization of medical care and puts us on the same page as the seniors.Community medical care isn’t just for private medical providers. Public safety and health officials inOregonandColoradoalso are reporting success providing on-site care for younger people with mental health and substance abuse issues.For decades, Americans have viewed at-home health care as a relic of a bygone era, like old reruns of Marcus Welby M.D. on a nostalgia cable TV channel. But sometimes the old ways carry solutions for modern times. At-home medicine for seniors is an idea whose time has come again.Pete Carlson is vice president of acute response services atLifespark, a Minnesota complete senior care company."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_286,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°President Joe Biden has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential election, stepping aside in the race to best Donald Trump in a contest over the basic identity of this country.Whatever one might think of the decision — whether you believe Biden was railroaded out by skittish Dems or stepped aside for the good of the country or something in between — the decision is made and will not be reversed.It took the president three weeks of public hand-wringing and is one of the most consequential decisions he has made in decades of making weighty choices. Now what we must look towards is the future.Biden also offered a full-throated endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, who won alongside him in the 2020 election, ousting Trump and Mike Pence. She is part of the ticket already, and runs into far fewer of the legal and logistical hurdles around ballot access and use of campaign cash as opposed to other potential candidates. She is also a former senator and state attorney general who’s proven effective at building an electoral case against Trump.There is no official nominee until the 3,939 delegates cast their ballots at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month, and there will be some Democrats who want to engage in some sort of brokered mini-primary at this stage, advancing their own preferences for a candidate who can defeat the threat of Trump.Despite some naysaying, it is true that the Democrats have a bench of real talent, with rising stars like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer having cracked the code of swing-state popularity and potent economic messaging.Yet everyone should keep in mind that the general election is now less than four months away. Primary season has come and gone. The successor campaign must get in full swing, and the most pressing consideration drawing the contrasts between the new Democratic candidate — who will no doubt hope to continue the Biden policies that have brought inflation under control and unemployment to historic lows, secured the strength of NATO and fought back against a wanton Supreme Court — and Trump, whose track record is well known.Maybe the Democrats will quickly coalesce behind Harris or maybe she will face a challenge. Either way, it will happen fast. The convention starts four weeks from today.But in this speed should not be forgotten the time to reflect on Joe Biden’s half century in high elected office instead of the issue of his age and fitness for office and acknowledge what the man has done for this country.Like anyone in the public eye and at the levers of power for this long, Biden has made missteps, but he has spent this term in the White House pushing through the country’s largest-ever infrastructure investment, combating the existential threat of climate change, advancing the cause of labor and the American worker, fighting for fairer taxation and competition by enforcing the antitrust laws. The nation owes him its gratitude.The Republicans have their team of Trump/Vance. The Democrats will now ready their own, likely leading with Harris. But so much has happened since that June 27 debate, which includes a failed assassination attempt and a presidential withdrawal, that predicting the future is impossible.— New York Daily News"

Not one broken window, makeshift noose or whiff of bear spray.But this rally wasn’t for him. It was for her.White Dudes for Harris hosted a Zoom fundraiser Monday in support of the vice president and her bid to win the White House. The online event raised over $4 million, drew 200,000 attendees and inspired a slew of jokes.“What a variety of whiteness we have here,” actor Bradley Whitford (“Handmaid’s Tale,” “West Wing” said in his opening remarks. “It’s like a rainbow of beige.”Leveraging identity politics for campaign cash is nothing new, but bringing together a bunch of white men to counter MAGA’s dire warnings — “White guys will be replaced if the Dems win!” — is genius.Democratic organizer Ross Morales Rocketto was behind the effort, and according to the New York Times, acknowledged the discomfort some might feel about the group’s name.“I don’t blame them,” he said. “Throughout American history, there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that when white men organize, it’s often with pointy hats on, and it doesn’t end well.”But who better to counter such hate than these other white dudes and their de facto leader: Jeff Bridges? The actor who played the Dude in “The Big Lebowski” kicked off the video call by referring to a White Dudes for Harris hat he saw online.“I qualify. I am white. I am a dude. And I love Harris,” he said.Co-opting the other side’s identity politics and then wringing the absurdity of their messaging for all it’s worth marks a new day for Democrats. The former fear and angst over President Biden’s low polling numbers has given way to a fresh enthusiasm since he announced he was leaving the race, and Harris stepped in.Racist and sexist attacks from the right on Harris — including those by Congressman Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and others who called her a “DEI hire”— are being repurposed and weaponized by the left. A “Cat Ladies for Harris” Zoom call is in the works, taking its name from the insult hurled at Harris from Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, who called the vice president a“childless cat lady.”The white dudes took their cues from previous Zoom fundraisers for Harris that were organized around racial identities. “Win With Black Women,” a group of high-profile Black women, raised $1.5 million for Harris in the hours after Biden announced he was stepping out of the race. Other groups who’ve gathered to support and donate to Harris include Black men, South Asian Americans and white women.Actor Mark Hamill delivered his classic “Star Wars” line: “I’m Luke Skywalker. I’m here to rescue you.” Other celebrities included actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Gad, Sean Astin and Paul Scheer, director J.J. Abrams and singer Josh Groban.But it was Democratic organizer Rocketto who best summed up the reason for the gathering. “The left has been ceding white men to the MAGA right for way, way too long,” he said. “That’s going to stop tonight because we know that the silent majority of white men aren’t actually MAGA supporters.”And they made their point without storming the Capitol or shooting up a Black Lives Matter demonstration. Righteous, dudes.NEW YORK — Coco Gauff’s U.S. Open title defence ended in a 6-3 4-6 6-3 loss to fellow American Emma Navarro in the fourth round on Sunday, the reigning women’s champion becoming the latest big name to make an early exit at Flushing Meadows this year."

More than 1 in 4 students missed 10% or more of the 2021-22 school year. That means millions of students missed out on regular instruction, not to mention the social and emotional benefits of interacting with peers and trusted adults.Moreover, two-thirds of the nation’s students attended a school wherechronic absence ratesreached at least 20%. Such levels disrupt entire school communities, including the students who are regularly attending.The scope and scale of this absenteeism crisis necessitate the implementation of the next generation of student support.Fortunately, a recent study suggests a promising path for getting students back in school and back on track to graduation. A group of nearly 50 middle and high schools sawreductions in chronic absenteeismand course failure rates after one year of harnessing the twin powers of data and relationships.From the 2021-22 to 2022-23 school years, the schools’ chronic absenteeism rates dropped by 5.4 percentage points, and the share of students failing one or more courses went from 25.5% to 20.5%. In the crucial ninth grade, course failure rates declined by 9.2 percentage points.These encouraging results come from the first cohort of rural and urban schools and communities partnering withthe GRAD Partnership, a collective of nine organizations, to grow the use of “student success systems” into a common practice.Student success systems take anevidence-based approachto organizing school communities to better support the academic progress and well-being of all students.They were developed with input from hundreds of educators and build on the successes of earlier student support efforts — like early warning systems and on-track initiatives — to meet students’ post-pandemic needs.Importantly, student success systems offer schools a way to identify school, grade-level and classroom factors that impact attendance; they then deliver timely supports to meet individual students’ needs. They do this, in part, by explicitly valuing supportive relationships and responding to the insights that students and the adults who know them bring to the table.Valuable relationships include not only those between students and teachers, and schools and families, but also those among peer groups and within the entire school community. Schools cannot address the attendance crisis without rebuilding and fostering these relationships.When students feel a sense of connection to school they are more likely to show up.For some students, this connection comes through extracurricular activities like athletics, robotics or band. For others, it may be a different connection to school.Schools haven’t always focused on connections in a concrete way, partly because relationships can feel fuzzy and hard to track. We’re much better at tracking things like grades and attendance.Still, schools in the GRAD Partnership cohort show that it can be done.These schools established “student success teams” of teachers, counselors and others. The teams meet regularly to look at up-to-date student data and identify and address the root causes of absenteeism with insight and input from families and communities, as well as the students themselves.The teams often use low-tech relationship-mapping tools to help identify students who are disconnected from activities or mentors. One school’s student success team used these tools to ensure that all students were connected to at least one activity — and even created new clubs for students with unique interests. Their method was one that any school could replicate —collaborating on a Google spreadsheet.Another school identified students who would benefit from a new student mentoring program focused on building trusting relationships.Some schools have used surveys of student well-being to gain insight on how students feel about school, themselves and life in general — and have then used the information to develop supports.And in an example of building supportive community relationships, one of the GRAD Partnership schools worked with local community organizations to host a resource night event at which families were connected on the spot to local providers who could help them overcome obstacles to regular attendance — such as medical and food needs, transportation and housing issues and unemployment.Turning the tide against our current absenteeism crisis does not have a one-and-done solution — it will involve ongoing collaborative efforts guided by data and grounded in relationships that take time to build.Without these efforts, the consequences will be severe both for individual students and our country as a whole.Robert Balfanz is a research professor at the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University School of Education, where he is the director of the Everyone Graduates Center.This commentary originally appeared in The Hechinger Report."

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images/TNS In 2022, the White House set ambitious goals to tackle the opioid crisis through the National Drug Control Strategy proposal. Collaborating with federal, state and tribal governments, as well as local communities and health professionals, the strategy focused on two things: harm reduction efforts and racial equity in drug policy.Harm reduction helps people who use drugs minimize health and legal problems. It empowers people to make informed choices about their health. Yet many community organizations still can not provide safer smoking supplies, a vital harm reduction strategy that would also advance racial equity.Supplies like glass pipes, mouthpieces and foil are crucial for people who smoke drugs like methamphetamine, opioids and cocaine. Without access to new or sterile equipment, people are at higher risk for infections and other health issues.Studies show that providing these supplies can significantly reduce hospital stays, soft-skin tissue infections and overdoses. Despite evidence supporting the effectiveness of safer smoking kits, there’s still significant resistance to their distribution.Current policies favor syringe needle exchange programs over safer smoking ones, yet Black individuals are less likely to inject drugs compared to their white counterparts. Expanding access to safer smoking kits would not only provide an alternative to injection drug use but could also broaden harm reduction services available to communities.Opponents often derogatorily refer to glass pipes as “crack pipes,” invoking a racially charged history of drug policy. This rhetoric exacerbates health disparities, particularly affecting Black Americans, who face higher overdose rates and less access to treatment and services, despite experiencing similar rates of substance use disorder as other groups.The expansion of harm reduction services has also been criticized as an “enabling campaign,” a sentiment amplified by social media and news outlets. Despite fact-checking news articles debunking claims of a federal pipe distribution program, harm reduction sites offering safer smoking supplies became heavily scrutinized. In 2022, the Biden Administration succumbed to public pressure and subsequently denied funding for kits.Without federal support, community aid organizations like Smoke Works have stepped up, distributing more than 1 million pipes in 2023 to programs in 46 states. These efforts have enhanced community engagement and reduced injection drug use. But to achieve a broader public health impact, federal backing is essential.The opposition to safer smoking kits is rooted in racist and divisive rhetoric that hinders progress and endangers communities. Some states have even passed laws prohibiting the distribution of safer smoking supplies, and federal bills have been proposed to ban their purchase using funds distributed for the treatment of substance use disorders.As the opioid crisis continues to roil communities across the country, we must unite to advocate for the drug policy reforms Biden promised.We’ve been here before. It took decades of advocacy to get the approval of federal funding for syringe services in 2016.Safe smoking kits are an effective and relatively inexpensive method to reduce drug overdoses and other negative health effects while reaching a community that for too long has been left behind by drug policy reforms.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_117,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°A truism of the Trump era is that every accusation is a confession. When Donald Trump hurls wild charges at his opponents, he is telegraphing what he plans to do to them, preemptively justifying the breaking of laws and norms by casting himself as the victim of the very misdeeds he’s going to commit.That is how we should understand Trump’s ranting in the wake of his 34 felony convictions last week. After he was found guilty, he told reporters gathered outside the courthouse, “This was done by the Biden administration in order to wound or hurt an opponent.” It’s tedious to fact-check such claims — the MAGA movement doesn’t care what’s true and what’s not — but President Joe Biden had nothing to do with the state case brought by Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney. And as if to underline Biden’s refusal to interfere in Justice Department decisions, the federal prosecution of the president’s son Hunter Biden begins this week. In spinning this fantasy about Biden, Trump is telegraphing that, should he return to the White House, he will try to use the Justice Department in exactly the way he’s pretending it was used against him. When the former president compares himself to Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died earlier this year in an Arctic prison colony, he’s giving himself permission to act like Vladimir Putin.In an interview with three Fox News hosts on Sunday, his first since his conviction, Trump all but promised that his second term would be even more corrupt and vindictive than his first. In his telling, he never called for Hillary Clinton to be imprisoned, and magnanimously resisted the entreaties of others to punish her. Next time, he suggested, he won’t be so nice. “They always said lock her up, and I felt — and I could have done it, but I felt it would have been a terrible thing,” he said. “And then this happened to me, and so I may feel differently about it.”Speaking to the Fox hosts, Trump denied saying the words that were the refrain to his first presidential campaign: “I didn’t say, ‘Lock her up.’” That is, of course, a preposterous lie, the kind that demonstrates Trump’s strongman ability to get his followers to accept absurdities. And “lock her up,” it’s important to remember, was never just rhetoric. As the Mueller report revealed, Trump demanded that his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who’d recused himself from investigations involving the 2016 campaign, go after Clinton. “According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions could direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton,” the Mueller report said. Eventually, attempting to placate his boss, Sessions tapped U.S. Attorney John Huber of Utah to probe the right’s allegations about the Clinton Foundation, but Huber came up empty.Sessions’ replacement, William Barr, proved more willing to bend ethical rules to do Trump’s bidding. Geoffrey Berman, a Republican who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York until Trump fired him, described Barr’s Justice Department in his book, “Holding the Line.” “Demands came down from Main Justice that were overtly political — among the most outrageous of them, pressure to pursue baseless criminal charges against John Kerry, who had served in the Obama administration as Secretary of State,” he wrote.Eventually, during Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, Barr discovered lines that even he wouldn’t cross. Given another chance, Trump will surely seek a Justice Department head who is a fully committed MAGA apparatchik; he’s said he’s considering the ultraright Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is currently under federal investigation because of allegations that he accepted bribes and abused the power of his office.The point here is not that Trump and his lackeys are lying about his record; it would be more newsworthy if they weren’t. What’s important is that Trump has already tried to use the power of the presidency to harass his enemies, and his allies have since identified the choke points in the system that previously thwarted him. As Reuters reported, people close to Trump have a two-part plan to “turn the nation’s top law enforcement body into an attack dog for conservative causes.” First, they want to flood the Department of Justice “with stalwart conservatives unlikely to say ‘no’ to controversial orders from the White House.” Then they want to restructure it “so key decisions are concentrated in the hands of administration loyalists rather than career bureaucrats.”Republican caterwauling about Trump’s felony conviction provides rhetorical cover for this planned transformation of America’s justice system by making it seem like that transformation has already been accomplished by Democrats.By projecting the authoritarian aggression of their movement onto others, Republicans absolve themselves.

After concluding on May 19, Minnesota Democrats failed, once again, to pass a law that would have mandated insurance companies to cover infertility treatments in Minnesota.The “Minnesota Building Families Act” aimed to require every healthcare plan to“provide comprehensive coverage for the diagnosis of infertility, treatment for infertility, and standard fertility preservation services…”. Despite strong advocacy by Minnesota families who have struggled with infertility, the bill did not pass due to cost concerns while the state faces already high spending.A public opinion pollin April of this year found that 67% of Americans support requiring health insurance companies to include coverage for IVF while a mere 7% opposed.However, there is one healthcare plan in Minnesota that is leading the charge with providing coverage for many of the most popular assisted reproductive technology procedures (ART , including in-vitro fertilization (IVF , intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI and cryopreservation with storage of an embryo for up to one year. TheMinnesota Advantage Health Plan, offered exclusively through Health Partners, covers two ART cycles and a maximum benefit of $30,000 in a patient’s lifetime. However, this amount does not include fertility drugs that often accompany treatment. Through this plan, patients are required to be diagnosed as medically infertile, which does not include oocyte cryopreservation (egg freezing that young women have begun to seek out to extend their healthiest years of reproduction.Some men and women already receive infertility treatment coverage by being state employees or working forcertain major companiesin Minnesota like Target, Amazon, General Mills and Ecolab. Yet many families and individuals are still left to pay for infertility treatments out of pocket. The average cost of one complete round of IVF in Minnesota is between $10,000 and $20,000 with no guarantee of achieving a live birth. Since IVF is still a relatively new technology (only losing its “experimental” title in 2012 , many families pursuing ART in hopes of having children come up empty-handed. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention data in 2021, 413,776 ART cycles were completed, leading to 91,906 deliveries. That is a success rate of only 22%.Even though ART is still evolving, usage rates are growing in popularity all over the world with many countries, including South Korea, Israel and France, even subsidizing the costs.In the United States, 22 States have laws that require insurance companies to cover some types of infertility treatments and only 12 that cover both IVF and fertility preservation. The inclusion of infertility treatment coverage in Minnesota would not only help young families and individuals struggling with infertility, but it also has benefits extending far beyond the exam room.There are three benefits to expanding ART access that often go unnoticed. First is the increased number of babies as a result of IVF at a moment when Minnesota is seeing declining birth rates. Even though Minnesota saw a slight increase in births in 2023 due to the pandemic, Minnesota has followed the national trend of seeing an average of 2% decrease in its crude birth rate each year. The United States has not neared concerningly low birth rates like inEast Asia, but an increase in ART access would increase birth rates on the margins.Another benefit could actually reduce the costs of ART in the long run with the use of the best quality technologies and practices available. Cheaper forms of ART often lead to more high-risk pregnancies and multiple births. The more complications experienced through a pregnancy, the more costly it becomes. Then add twins or triplets into the mix and you have a much higher degree of risk for both mother and babies. The best option is to do a single embryotransferwith an egg that was extracted from a womanunder the age of 30.Lastly, extending ART coverage could be another avenue to further eliminate barriers to access based on economic status. Those who have had access to ART in the past have been high to middle-class individuals with enough money to cover multiple ART cycles out-of-pocket. Breaking down barriers to another form of healthcare regardless of economic status would lead to more individuals and families being able to achieve their dreams of having children.ART has evolved from a radical and worrisome new technology in the 1980s to a staple in reproductive care today. Now that ART is more popular than ever, lawmakers must start seeing ART as the necessary healthcare that all Minnesotans deserve to fight infertility.Annika Peterson is a Minnesota native who recently completed a master’s degree in Asia/Pacific Studies in Taipei, Taiwan. Her research interests include women’s health and assisted reproductive technology policy in East Asia and the United States."

Greggor Ilagan in crafting 10 bills which were introduced into the Legislature that addressed some of these insurance issues. As we predicted, all 10 bills failed. No one was interested; this was just Puna complaining.We long ago realized that the Puna district has negligible legislative clout. When we in Puna sounded the insurance alarm, we were virtually ignored. We should have been, and demand to be, part of any insurance discussion or plan!Gov.

It’s up to the Democratic Party to sort this out.But it’s time to refocus attention on the only candidate in the race who is patently unfit for office — any office — and an imminent threat to democracy: Donald Trump.It’s unbelievable that the nation is spending so much time on the question of Biden’s verbal acuity, when the greatest concern ought to be that his challenger is a self-aggrandizing felon and twice-impeached election-denier.Trump fomented the Jan. 6 insurrection, shows contempt for the rule of law and shamelessly lies in pursuit of more power.He’s an authoritarian who admires murderous despots, wants to jail his political enemies and has publicly flirted with declaring himself a dictator on his first day back in office.With fervent support from the Republican Party, he peddles cruelty, racism and misogyny, demonizing immigrants as “poisoning the blood of our country,” demeaning women‘s looks and intelligence, and using disgustingly fascist language to criticize his opponents as “vermin.” He’s a man who lied about his wealth for years to cheat on his taxes, whose business was convicted of criminal tax fraud, and who’s been denounced by many former aides and Cabinet members as a“malignant narcissist” who recklessly puts himself before the American people.Trump is the only man in the presidential race manifestly unworthy of holding a position of power, and has no business ever returning to the White House.If the GOP had any decency left, its members would be discussing whether to dump Trump for a candidate who isn’t out to bulldoze democratic institutions in favor of autocracy.Voters should resist viewing this contest through the politics-as-usual lens of past elections.This November is not about dueling personalities, middle-of-the-road policy differences, or as some might see it, an 81-year-old man being the lesser of two evils compared with a 78-year-old man.It’s nothing short of a referendum on our 248-year democracy, and a choice between a trustworthy public servant who upholds American values and a serial liar who wants to push the country into authoritarianism.Leaders of the Democratic Party have to stop the self-defeating discussion about Biden’s fitness and decide whether to replace him or unify behind him. And Americans must start hearing more about how the records, positions and character of Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and any of the prominent Democrats being floated as possible replacements make them all unquestionably superior to Trump.— Los Angeles Times"

The disease robs patients of their personality, often replacing it with someone who is angry and unrecognizable. I cared for Alzheimer’s patients for years, but I didn’t fully grasp caregivers’ desperation until I watched my dad disappear into a torrent of rage and volatility.My father was always our rock. He was a hard-working truck driver who built his reputation on his dependability. Then things started to slip. My mother received a call one day that he had forgotten to turn the A/C on when delivering baby chickens to a farm. They were all dead when he arrived. At the time, I wondered, how could this happen? He was never forgetful.As my father slipped further into Alzheimer’s, my mom and I discovered that the disease is much more than just memory loss. About half of the six million Americans with Alzheimer’s suffer from a related condition called agitation. These patients exhibit aggressive behavior, frequent verbal outbursts, and even physical violence. My father was one of these patients.Treating these conditions related to Alzheimer’s present their own unique challenges. In the case of agitation, doctors, nurses, and family caregivers can’t always decide the best treatment options for patients because of outdated policies that dictate what medicines certain health providers can prescribe. These policies need to be updated to provide relief to patients, their families, and the people in the facilities that wind up caring for them.One example is the rules around prescribing medications for people living in long-term care or skilled-nursing facilities. These antiquated policies often discourage doctors treating patients living in these facilities from prescribing certain medicines to treat dangerous conditions, including agitation, or force them to gradually reduce dosages. In some cases, those restrictions apply to medicines approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat those conditions.As I experienced firsthand, there are dangerous consequences for patients, their loved ones, and the people caring for them when agitation and other conditions related to Alzheimer’s go untreated. Doctors need more flexibility to prescribe effective treatments to these patients.My father’s descent snowballed quickly. He went from forgetting to put away the dishes to more violent outbursts. It was scary to see my once-gentle father become violent. The disease robbed him of his mind, but it didn’t initially take his physical strength. He could be violent toward nurses and aggressive toward his family. He once berated me for 15 minutes straight while I drove him to a medical procedure. I know my father did not want to live like this. He was very religious and would have been appalled by his behavior.I have cared for Alzheimer’s patients for years in my role as a nurse in long-term care facilities, so I know my father’s experience is not isolated. In the case of agitation, his doctors tried to work with us to prescribe medications that would blunt its effects, despite the repercussions for their organizations. But rules, overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, forced prescribers to gradually reduce his dosage. We were eventually forced to move him to another facility that was able to provide better care, but the gradual dose reductions resulted in multiple hospitalizations and more expensive medications.These conditions associated with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia often make it harder for families to care for their loved ones at home, increasing the likelihood that patients must be cared for in a professional setting — the same professional settings that are limited in how they can prescribe FDA-approved treatments. We need to update outdated rules that force caregivers like my family to shoulder unnecessary burdens in seeking the best care.They say Alzheimer’s patients die twice — first at diagnosis, then once they eventually pass. My Father lived for almost 15 years. At the end, he had a few moments of clarity when he was calm enough to recognize me as his daughter. Absent a cure for the underlying disease, our health care system should provide patients with as many of those moments as the disease allows.Amy Stewart, an Ely, Minnesota, resident, is the chief nursing officer for the American Association of Post-Acute Care Nursing and was a practicing long-term care nurse for decades."

Oh, yes, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump — you know, the guy Harris and fellow Democrats believe is an existential threat to the future of American democracy and whom they repeatedly lampoon as addled and at times incomprehensible — has made ending taxes on income earned from tips a centerpiece of his campaign. He’s so focused on that particular proposal that often it’s the only specific policy featured on many of his billboards; that’s been the case for two months now.It was no accident, of course, that Harris was campaigning at a Nevada rally when she thundered her support for making tipped income tax-free.Nevada is home to an unusually large number of workers dependent on gratuities, given DENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."
minnpost_2024_158,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.What makes a city a good place to live? Practical features are important, such as well-maintained streets, good public transit and reliable trash collection. So are amenities that make cities attractive and interesting, such as museums and public parks. Access to green space is especially valuable for residents who may not be able to travel easily beyond city limits.On May 22, 2024, the nonprofitTrust for Public Landreleased its annualParkScore report, which ranks U.S. cities based on the quality of their parks. Beyond tallying how many parks a city has, the rankings also consider the share of residents who livewithin 10 minutes’ walk of a park. This recognizes that in the U.S. and other wealthy countries,affluent white neighborhoods often have more parksthan low-income areas and communities of color.Access is important, but I believe making people feel included and welcome is equally important. If parks do this well, people will be more willing to use them.I aman urban geographerand study how parks affect social interaction in diverse communities.My studentsand Iare examininghow people interact with the built environment ofPhalen Regional Parkin St. Paul to understand what leads people to experience this park as awelcoming and inclusive space. I believe Phalen Park offers useful strategies that other cities can emulate.Phalen Park is among St. Paul’s largest parks, covering 494 acres (2 square kilometers —three times the size of Disneyland. It includes a 198-acre lake encircled by a trail, watercraft rentals, scenic views, a golf course, an amphitheater,sculptures, a playground and two pavilions for picnics, performances and other gatherings.One important feature is St. Paul’s sole public beach with lifeguard services. Many low-income households around the park don’t have access to places where they can swim for free. Providing a safe place to swim helpsreduce this inequity.People in the Twin Citiesuse parks in a variety of ways. For example, Asian American park visitors are 2.5 times more likely than others to attend family events in parks, while Black park visitors are 1.75 times more likely than others to go fishing there. InsurveysandinterviewsI have conducted, people from many social groups report that they use Phalen Park because there are so many things to do there and there are diverse groups of people in the park.Community organizations use the park’s green spaces and shoreline for year-round public events and festivals. The park hosts cultural performances, community gatherings such as movie screenings, and regional events such asfreshwater stewardship activitiesanddragon boat races.These free events cater to many different age groups, attract diverse crowds and promote cultural learning and positive interracial encounters. Phalen Park is one of the most-visited parks in the Twin Cities, with anestimated 1.1 million visits in 2021.There are many practical reasons for cities to invest in public parks. Studies have found that visiting green spacesreduces stressand that people who live within half a mile of a public parktend to get more exercisethan those who lack access to safe places for walking, biking and recreation. Public parks provide spaces where people can gather for free, or sometimes for a nominal permit fee.However, it’s important for visitors tofeel safe and welcome. Due to a legacy of racial segregation, and to uneven investment in parks, that doesn’t always happen.In Chicago, for example,white and Hispanic groups have clashedover using certain segments ofThe 606, an elevated park that follows the path of an old rail line. These encounters have led some Hispanic visitors to avoid using parts of the park. In turn, white visitors say this distancing makes them feel suspicious of groups of Hispanic people in the park.The Twin Cities typically perform well in ParkScore ratings — for 2024, Minneapolisranks secondamong U.S. cities, followed by Saint Paul — but there’s still room to improve. The Trust for Public Land has identifiedsignificant differencesin park access between people of color and white residents in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Neighborhoods in St. Paul where people of color are the predominant group have access to24% less park space per person than the city’s average neighborhood.St. Paul has a diverse population that measures 54.3% white, 18.3% Asian, 15.6% Black and 8.6% Hispanic,according to 2023 census estimates. Neighborhoods within a mile of Lake Phalen Parkare comparably mixed, with 34.8% white residents, 34.4% Asian residents, 14% Black residents and 11.2% identifying as Hispanic.I analyzed data fromStreetLightData.com, which gathers mobile phone user data, to study visitor demographics at Phalen Park from 2019 to 2021. During that time, 54.8% of visitors were white, 23.9% were Asian, 11.8% were Black and 8.9% identified as Hispanic. These findings show that the park attracts a mix of people that mirrors St. Paul’s demographics.What else would increase the park’s appeal as a place for diverse communities to gather? Visitors say they want more restroom facilities in the park andwant them to be cleaner. Restroom availability affects how long people will stay at a park or whether they will even come. Perceptions that a park’s restrooms are dirty threaten visitors’ sense of safety and welcome.People also wantclearer guidanceabout park amenities, such as signs explaining public art and offering multilingual directions for using the beach, boat ramps and trails. Addressing these concerns can help reduce uncertainty and foster a sense of safety and belonging.Expanding or proving paved trails canreduce conflictsover common spaces, such as clashes between cyclists and pedestrians. Themaster plan for Phalen Regional Parkcalls for widening the park’s trails and separating walking from biking. These changes have occurred in a few locations but not throughout the park.Parks are like a city’s living room. Designing, building and managing them well makes people more likely to go there and stay a while. Investing resources to make parks attractive to different groups and inviting for everyone is a sure way to boost inclusion. As city leaders digest this year’s ParkScore ratings, Phalen Park offers a model for other diverse urban communities.Dan Trudeau is a geography professor at Macalester College.This article is republished from The Conversation."
leoweekly_2024_3,"When Julius Caesar led his army from Gaul into Rome – against a constitution which forbad that and also kings or emperors - the river he crossed gave its name to momentous decisions from which there is no return. Historians also mark it as the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic.Romans knew exactly when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and knew its significance. Americans in 2024 can’t be so sure. We may have already crossed our Rubicon, or, perhaps it has crossed us. Either way, it’s no longer hyperbole to suggest that we, too, may be at or beyond the beginning of the end of our Republic.People rarely have the perspective or clarity of understanding the times they live in, or at least the labels later applied to them. No one at the time called it World War I. No one asked “Do the Dark Ages start tomorrow or Friday?” or said “Let me tell you buddy I can‘t wait for the Gilded Age to begin”. There’s a chance that the times we live in now will be recognized in the future as The End of the American Republic (though it will need a catchier name - a time past which the candle had been extinguished and we dwelled in the darkness not yet noticing.“There once was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish“. Marcus AureliusLike armies in retreat it happened gradually at first and then all at once. It took 42 years for us to go from a president caught covering up a burglary resigning in shame with the support of his own party in the interest of the nation, to that same nation electing an obviously unprincipled thief, sexual predator, and corrupt businessman who “gets all his money from Russia” on a platform of immigrant hate and White Nationalism. It‘s taken only the last 7 years for the Republican Party, from its bottom to it’s Senate Leader, to pledge loyalty to this man and his campaign that makes explicit plans to subvert the Constitution, jail his opponents, and declare himself President For Life.Visiting my hometown last week I read the local newspaper. The political cartoon, pulled from a national syndicate, showed a couple talking while watching the TV news. As an aside, this is the worst of the genre. Anyway, an image of Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is on the TV screen saying Trump supporters threatened to kill her when he is elected. The husband in his easy chair casually says to his wife “As if I needed another reason to vote for him”. The danger in this is its banality. Political cartoons don’t change minds, they reinforce and reassure them, like campaign bumper stickers. We’re beyond considering whether partisan murders and jailings are acceptable. We’re riffing on them.That mud on your shoes may be from the Rubicon you stumbled through a while back.Yet, still today, the Democrats waste their time trying to convince Trump’s supporters that he’s not a good person. That he’s gross and not worthy of respect. Clueless as ever, they don’t realize that his supportersdon’t care. Some of them wallow in their deplorable baskets and celebrate his filth. Most find him repulsive, and perhaps even bemoan as an academic exercise the demise of democracy. But theydon’t carebecause he serves their very specific interests. Support for his first presidential campaign jumped from 5% to, ultimately, victory, nearly overnight when he declared war on Mexicans and people of color. He has the unbreakable support of Christian Nationalists for whom he is clearing space in this Earthly Kingdom. They don’t care who he is, only that he will protect and expand their White Supremacy. These Christian Nationalists are the direct descendants of the White Southern Christian Evangelists who based their opposition to Civil Rights in the 1960’s and since on the same Bible with which the Supreme Court is today replacing the Constitution.Newspapers in hometowns across the country now repeat and amplify the previously unthinkable. Perhaps this is not a surprise in the country that leads the developed nations of the world only in military spending and prisons. Not education. Not health care. Not responsible wealth sharing. Not child care. Not equality. Not justice. We’ve made it too easy for future historians to reflect on the former USA and its demise and conclude “Well, yeah. That was always going to happen”.Where Caesar actually crossed the Rubicon isn’t known for sure. Centuries passed before the Rubicon itself was even identified. Trump is no Julius Caesar and our own river may already be months or years to our rear. Perhaps a nation built upon slavery started on the wrong side in the first place. Either way, here we are.What will they call these times? The Dark Ages were undemocratic and anti-intellectual. These may be the Darker Ages, because we knew better. Or just the Dumb Times. ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_77,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Artificial intelligence is advancing at a speed and in ways that were unanticipated even by the foremost AI experts. Just a few decades ago, AI was largely theoretical, existing primarily in the realms of science fiction and academic research. Today, AI permeates nearly every aspect of our lives, from the algorithms that curate social media feeds to the autonomous systems that drive cars. This rapid advancement, while promising in many respects, also heralds a new era of uncertainty and potential peril.The pace at which AI technology is evolving outstrips our ability to predict its trajectory. Breakthroughs occur at a staggering rate, often in areas previously deemed infeasible or far-off. For instance, the development of GPT-3, an AI language model capable of producing human-like text, astonished even seasoned AI researchers with its capabilities and the speed at which it surpassed its predecessors. Such rapid advancements suggest that the future of AI holds both immense potential and significant risks.One of the most pressing concerns is the increased likelihood of emergencies exacerbated by AI. More sophisticated AI could enable more complex and devastating cyberattacks, as malicious actors leverage AI to breach security systems that were previously impenetrable. Similarly, advances in AI-driven biotechnology could lead to the creation of more deadly bioweapons, posing new and unprecedented threats to global security. Moreover, the rapid automation of jobs could lead to widespread unemployment, causing significant social disruption. The displacement of workers by AI could further entrench economic inequality and trigger unrest, as societies struggle to adapt to these changes.The likelihood of an AI emergency paired with our poor track record of responding to similar emergencies is cause for concern. The COVID-19 pandemic starkly highlighted the inadequacies of our constitutional order in emergency responses. The pandemic exposed deep flaws in our preparedness and response mechanisms, demonstrating how ill-equipped we are to handle sudden, large-scale crises. Our fragmented political system, with its layers of bureaucracy and competing jurisdictions, proved unable to respond swiftly and effectively. This deficiency raises serious concerns about our ability to manage future emergencies, particularly those that could be precipitated by AI.Given the profound uncertainty surrounding when and how an AI accident might occur and the potential damage it could cause, it is imperative that AI companies bear a significant responsibility for helping us prepare for such eventualities. The private sector, which stands to benefit enormously from AI advancements, must also contribute to safeguarding society against the risks these technologies pose. One concrete step that AI companies should take is to establish an emergency fund specifically intended for responding to AI-related accidents.Such a fund would serve as a financial safety net, providing resources to mitigate the effects of AI emergencies. It could be used to support rapid response efforts, fund research into preventative measures, and assist individuals and communities affected by AI-driven disruptions. By contributing to this fund, AI companies would acknowledge their role in creating technologies that, while beneficial, also carry inherent risks. This approach would not only demonstrate corporate responsibility but also help ensure that society is better prepared to respond to AI-related crises.The establishment of an emergency fund for AI disasters would require a collaborative effort between the private sector and government. Congress could mandate contributions from AI companies based on their revenue or the scale of their AI operations. This would ensure that the financial burden of preparing for AI emergencies is shared equitably and that sufficient resources are available when needed. To safeguard the proper use of the funds, Congress should establish an independent entity tasked with securing contributions and responding to claims for reimbursement.In conclusion, the rapid advancement of AI presents both incredible opportunities and significant risks. While we cannot predict exactly how AI will evolve or what specific emergencies it may precipitate, we can take proactive steps to prepare for these eventualities.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_156,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.09°The toxic smoke choking swathes of the Midwestern U.S. this week is a helpful reminder to Americans that Canada exists, and its wildfire season has come early. But Americans shouldn’t forget their own season starts much earlier these days, too. In fact, it’s getting to the point that wildfire season is all year long.A new study by the non-profit group Climate Central finds the flame-conducive combination of hot, dry air and strong winds has become more common as the planet gets warmer. In some parts of the Southwestern U.S., wildfire season is now two months longer than in 1973, with about half of that increase coming in the spring.The Texas panhandle, which now experiences 34 extra days of wildfire weather per year, suffered through the worst fires in the state’s history earlier this year after a freak winter heat wave, putting the nation’s biggest nuclear-weapons facility at risk. One apocalypse at a time, please!It’s not exactly breaking news that the Southwest is bursting into flames earlier and more often. But no region of the contiguous U.S. is immune. Northern New Jersey has 10 more wildfire-friendly days each year than it did 50 years ago, according to the study. Massachusetts has 9 more days, as does southern Alabama. Not coincidentally, the number of U.S. acres burned annually has doubled since the turn of the century.And this has happened after just 2.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming in the Lower 48 since 1970, by Climate Central’s measure. Without more effort to stop spewing greenhouse gases, we are on track to possibly double that amount of warming by 2050. The research firm First Street Foundation has estimated that nearly 80 million properties across the U.S. will be under some wildfire threat by 2052, with pretty much everyone west of the Mississippi River at particular risk.Climate change made 2023’s wildfires in eastern Canada twice as likely, according to the group World Weather Attribution, contributing to a record-smashing year for the whole country. Continuing heat and drought have kicked off what will likely be a sequel, with the assistance of “zombie fires” that kept burning under the snow all winter. I wrote last month about how the U.S. wasn’t ready for another summer of smoke from these wildfires. It’s also clear we’re not ready for our own future of longer and more-intense wildfire seasons.The most obvious first step in preventing them is probably the hardest: We have to admit we have a fossil-fuel problem and stop abusing the climate in ways that will make today’s fire-sparking heat and drought seem mild in comparison. While we wait for that miracle to happen, we can take other steps to make the fires that do occur less destructive. Better forest management, including controlled burns, can limit the fuel available to runaway wildfires. Smarter development and more affordable housing can make people less likely to live in the wildland-urban interface, where fires are more likely to take lives and destroy property. Insurance companies are abandoning fire-prone places, leaving only the wealthy to rebuild on risky but scenic lots, a sort of “gentrification by fire,” as the Washington Post once put it. Instead of subsidizing that trend with disaster relief, our federal tax dollars would be better spent on a managed retreat from such places. And people who think they’re not in harm’s way should heed the lesson of longer, further-reaching and more-intense fire seasons: Climate change will find us all eventually.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

minnpost_2024_73,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Editor’s note:John Dewey was one of themost important educational philosophersof the 20th century. In the following Q&A from news outlet The Conversation, political science professor Nicholas Tampio, editor of aforthcoming edition of Dewey’s famous book, “Democracy and Education,”explains why Dewey’s work remains relevant to this day.I think it is time to revisit Dewey’s philosophy about the value of field trips, classroom experiments, music instruction and children playing together on playgrounds. This is especially true after the pandemic when children spentsignificantly more timein front of screens rather than having whole body experiences.Dewey’s philosophy of education was that children “learn by doing.” Dewey argued that children learn from using their entire bodies in meaningful experiences. That is why, in his 1916 text, “Democracy and Education,”Dewey called for schools to be “equipped with laboratories, shops, and gardens.”Dewey argued that planting seeds, measuring the relationship between sun, soil, water and plant growth, and then tasting fresh peas made for a seamless transition between childhood curiosity and the scientific way of looking at things. Dewey also encouraged schools to create time for “dramatizations, plays, and games.”In his 2014 book, “An Education in Politics: The Origin and Evolution of No Child Left Behind,” the political scientistJesse H. Rhodesshows how business groups and certain civil rights groups advocated federal laws that required states to administer high-stakes tests. This focus on tested subjects means that public school students in placessuch as Texashave less time for arts education.Nicholas Tampio: For Dewey, modern societies can use schools to impart democratic habits in young people from an early age. He argued that the “intermingling in the school of youth of different races, differing religions, and unlike customs creates for all a new and broader environment.” Dewey was writing asmillions of European immigrantswere arriving in the United States between 1900 and 1915. Dewey believed that schools could teach immigrants what it means to be a citizen and incorporate their experiences into American culture.Dewey’s view of the schools remains relevant today. In the2020-21 school year, more than a third of the country’s children attended schools where 75% of the student body is the same race or ethnicity – hardly the ideal conditions for Dewey’s vision of democracy.Deweyopposed “racial, color, or other class prejudice.” Segregated schoolsviolate Dewey’s idealof treating all students as possessing intrinsic worth and dignity. Deweybelieved thatdemocracy means “that every human being, independent of the quantity or range of his personal endowment, has the right to equal opportunity with every other person for development of whatever gifts he has.” Democratic schools, for Dewey, empower every child to develop their gifts in ways that benefit the community.NT: I would argue that the education system resembles the vision of modern testing pioneers likeEdward Thorndikemore than Dewey’s.Dewey thought that standardized tests serve a small role in education.He believedthat “the child’s own instincts and powers furnish the material and give the starting point for all education.” Dewey maintained that teachers need to use student interest as the fuel to propel students to learn math, reading and the scientific method, and standardized tests serve mainly to help the teacher identify whereeach student“can receive the most help.” In his lifetime,Dewey opposedproponents of intelligence testing, such as Thorndike.But the testing proponents seem to be winning. According to a 2023Education Weeksurvey of teachers, nearly 80% feel moderate or large amounts of pressure to have their students perform well on state-mandated standardized tests. According toone principal, “There’s too much pressure put on these kids for testing, and there’s too much testing.”Dewey’s vision of education is teachers nurturing each child’s passions and not using tests to rank children. For many teachers, U.S. public schools arefar from realizing that vision.NT: Dewey’s ideas were controversial during his lifetime. They remain so to this day.In 2023, Richard Corcoran, the president of New College of Florida, criticized “the Dewey school of thought” for training students to become “widget makers.” According to Corcoran, Dewey thought that “if we can teach (people just enough skills to get on the assembly line and help us with this Industrial Revolution, everything will be great.” Corcoran is right that Dewey thought that schools should teach children about industry, including with hands-on tasks. But Dewey opposed vocational education thatslotted children from a young age into a career path.“I am utterly opposed,” Dewey explained, “to giving the power of social predestination, by means of narrow trade-training, to any group of fallible men no matter how well-intentioned they may be.” Dewey thought that children could learn about history and economics from using machinery in schools. However, he opposed a two-tiered education system that denied working-class children a well-rounded education or that equated human flourishing with making widgets.Educators and scholars such asDiane Ravitch,Deborah MeierandYong Zhaocite Dewey and apply his insights to current education debates. Those debates include topics such as the place of standardized testing in schools, the freedom of the classroom teacher and the need for schools to build trust with families and community members.Zhao, for instance, argues that Dewey outlined a way to address education inequity that does not rely on closing gaps in test scores. Dewey’s idea, according to Zhao, is that all children should have a chance to express and cultivate individuality, learn through experiences and make “the most of the opportunities of present life.”Dewey believed that “democracy is a way of life.” He also believed schools could teach that lesson to young people by allowing people in the school to have a meaningful say in the aims of education. For many people who read Dewey today, his call fordemocracy in educationstill resonates.Nicholas Tampiois a professor of political science at Fordham University.This article is republished from The Conversation."

His thumb crushed by an automobile tire. What did they do? Gave him paperwork to fill out!Any compassion was woefully lacking. After hours of waiting, I walked out. The young man still hadn’t been seen. Neither had anyone else in the room. Disgraceful.There has been a huge influx of people and money into Kona the last few years. What is our state government doing with our hard-earned tax dollars?The people of Kona deserve good health care.

They previously sought a 40-year lease extension, which resulted in strong pushback from the community.They want the area redeveloped into more housing after the current lease expires in 2042.This is a bad idea in my opinion. Prince Kuhio Plaza sits in an industrialized, and commercialized , area that is inappropriate for homes. I understand the need for more housing for Native Hawaiians, but jobs are needed also.If this area is redeveloped, a critical economic driver for jobs and tax revenue in the greater Hilo area will disappear.I propose that a shorter lease of 15 to 20 years is granted instead with a community benefit package. This would preserve a critical economic driver for the Hilo area and still give Brookfield the ability to amortize the cost of mall improvements over several years. It also makes all the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands’ commercial ground leases in this area of Hilo set to expire around the same time.As I alluded to above, I understand the need for more housing for Native Hawaiians. However, I strongly believe it would be a mistake to phase out this anchor economic driver to satisfy that need.Aaron SteneKailua-KonaRecord-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hawaii military veterans can apply for a free tour to Washington, D.C., in recognition of their service.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_290,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°I’m sure it doesn’t feel this way to President Joe Biden now, given the fighter he is, but stepping down was the right thing for him to do.Not because members of Congress were calling for it, not because donors had started to withhold funds and certainly not because of that awful debate performance. Deciding not to seek reelection was the right thing to do because doing so fulfills a campaign promise he made to voters shortly after Super Tuesday in 2020.“Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” he said at the time. “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.”He was 77 then.Few progressives questioned his ability to work with Congress or bring a sense of normalcy on the world stage. But many voiced concerns about him being an octogenarian when it was time to seek reelection. To ease their anxiety, he said he wanted to undo the damage caused during the Trump administration and to get the country pointed in the right direction. He told us the Pete Buttigiegs and Gretchen Whitmers wouldn’t be hamstrung by a Biden reelection bid.As he noted in his letter on Sunday announcing the decision to not seek reelection, he fulfilled many of the campaign promises he made to the American people.“Today, America has the strongest economy in the world,” Biden wrote. “We’ve made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We’ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today.” Perhaps achievements such as those are why he found it so hard to keep that one campaign promise — the one about being a bridge to the future.I guess teaching us how to say goodbye is a lot harder in practice than it is to sing in a popular Broadway musical.Rarely is the decision to not seek reelection celebrated as honorable. Usually it’s an indication of legislative disappointments or morality shortcomings. Like when a coach says he is stepping down to spend more time with his family. It’s difficult for us Americans to imagine someone willingly relinquishing power. This is particularly true when that person is as effective as Biden has been. To step out of the presidential election must feel like a gut punch, particularly given the risk of the Republican nominee becoming president.Donald Trump is the first convicted felon nominated by a major party. He has been found liable for sexual abuse and business fraud. For stretches during his presidency, he had trouble denouncing white supremacy. Four years ago at this time, unemployment was over 10% and we were struggling to find hand sanitizer and toilet paper in our stores.Biden, like many of us, grew up at a time when evangelical voters in this country would have never considered supporting someone like Trump. Now this con man is worshipped like a demigod.And yet, Biden has been projected to lose to him.Not because the president isn’t good at his job but because the concerns raised about Biden’s age back in 2020 have come to pass. He is a good man. He is also dangerously close to looking like Michael Jordan with the Washington Wizards. Politics, like the NBA, is for the young.In 1972, when he was first elected to the Senate, I was still in diapers. Since then he has dedicated his life to serving this country. And those years of service are very much appreciated.He did not deserve to be beaten up in the press as badly as he has been by members of his own party. Had he stayed true to his promise to be a bridge candidate, that would not have happened. This year could have been a celebration of Biden’s leadership, alongside a robust primary competition to choose a younger nominee.Instead there is a scramble heading toward the convention in Chicago next month. I hope that Vice President Kamala Harris, with Biden’s endorsement, can step smoothly into the top spot on the ticket, and can bring in a running mate such as Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, the former astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. That would reset the narrative surrounding the ticket, to be less focused on Biden’s age and more on the dangers of the geopolitical policies of Trump and the domestic implications of Project 2025.Biden’s decision to remove himself from the race does not reflect on his administration’s effectiveness. It doesn’t cast a poor light on his career. What it does is better position the party and the country to avert the threat of a second Trump administration.I’m sure it doesn’t feel this way to Biden now, but history will remember this day as one of the most patriotic moments of his career.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
philinquirer_2024_48,"While politics may be a headache for platforms to deal with, social media sites have an ethical obligation to protect civil discourse.In late March, I awoke to the news that Instagram, perhaps the biggest social media platform for young people in the United States, wouldautomatically limit recommending political content to usersunless they proactively opt in.As someone who has spent most of my career focused on engaging young people in the political process, this decision was deeply troubling. But perhaps what was more troubling was the shocking lack of coverage and outrage on this wildly consequential decision. While many were preoccupied with theproposed forced sale of TikTok, Instagram’s policy went quietly under the radar. Yet this ill-timed decision will likely have disastrous consequences for speech online, and the future of our democratic process.I am an organizer in Pennsylvania in my early 20s, and Instagram has been the single most useful tool for engaging with young people in politics. Compared to platforms like TikTok, users on Instagram largely decide what they see in their feed. This has led to the rise of local networks in which information can be distributed to members of a community, rather than to everyone on the platform. Using this, organizers can share information, highlight upcoming gatherings, and give important updates to just those following them.But to organizers, the primary benefit that Instagram offers is that it is themost popular social media platform of its kind for young adults. It is where most young people my age interact, discuss issues, and most importantly,get their news. Politicians need young people to vote, and cutting out social media threatens the youth vote.Politics is a messy business, and platforms have historically struggled with regulating political speech on their websites. While users can ostensibly post whatever they want, nearly all online platforms have guidelines on what constitutes acceptable speech on their sites. Meta — the parent company of Instagram — has content moderation guidelines that have been well-documented as particularly labyrinthian,taking context into account in some regards, and not others. This leads to seemingly disjointed and convoluted outcomesthat have made them no friends on Capitol Hill.Over the years, Meta has been at the center of numerous political scandals,from Cambridge Analyticato theremoval of Donald Trumpfrom the platform. In the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel,Meta has been accused of censorshipand promoting misinformation from both sides of the political spectrum on posts relating to the ongoing war in Gaza.Hosting a functioning public forum necessitates a commitment toward moderation, limiting the spread of misinformation, and ensuring that bad actors stay off the platform, all of which requires a whole lot of effort — something that tech companies seem increasingly disinclined to do.Thus, in recent years, platforms have begun to disincentivize news and political content. In 2016, YouTubewas widely criticized for demonetizing contentthat was primarily focused on the news or political discourse. This led to many creators whose content was based in these subjects to find alternative revenue streams or pivot the type of content they made.After launching Threads in 2023, Meta also revealed thattheir site would avoid political and news-related content, much to the disappointment of many Twitter users eager to leave the platformafter the Elon Musk buyout. This change in Instagram’s policy toward political content suggests a continued reluctance of companies like Meta to continue to allow and promote political content on their platform.I do not envy Meta’s position here. Maintaining political speech on a platform is difficult and thankless work. But the idea that we can easily return to a prelapsarian world where these platforms are exclusively for cute animal photos and targeted ads is a fantasy we cannot tolerate.While politics may be a headache for platforms to deal with, I argue that as proprietors of the largest channels of public discourse, social media sites do in fact have an ethical obligation to protect civil discourse, and a failure to do so is a dereliction of this duty.Imagine if bars and cafés forbade discussing current events, or if news outlets no longer felt it was worth the money and hassle to cover politics. What use would our freedom of speech be in a world where we had no venue to discuss the issues that matter most?Our democracy was conceived and founded in bars and meetinghouses,“third places”outside of home and work in which people could meet on neutral ground and discuss the issues of their time. In the last few decades,these places have gradually begun to disappear. Without them, future generations have fewer and fewer places to meet and discuss politics, with social media partly filling the gap left behind.While social media is certainly not the only solution to this issue,in a world where people are gradually becoming more isolated, the role it plays in maintaining our political life has only grown, and thus the responsibility of platforms has grown as well.Pennsylvania is a key swing state in November’s presidential election, and I am concerned that this trend will work to diminish youth engagement in the political process. At a time whenless than half of young Americans plan on voting in the general election, we cannot sit by and allow this attempt by platforms like Meta to skirt their responsibilities by depoliticizing the internet.Jacob Fuller is an activist, policy writer and organizer based in Philadelphia.

minnpost_2024_174,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Gov. Tim Walz and the DFL majorities are pushing legislation at the state Capitol that would prohibit the banning of books in public school libraries. In his newfound quest for national political attention, the governor regularly repeats the lie that literature suppression is on the rise. And the Star Tribune recently echoed that falsehood in its praise of the bill in an editorial last week. The record should be corrected.Walz grounds his alarm ondata from PEN America, a left leaning advocacy group. But, as the Educational Freedom Institute has noted, 74% of the books that PEN America claims are “banned” are in fact available in the school districts where they’re supposedly prohibited. That’s because PEN America alleges for political convenience that a volume is “banned” if any action, such as simply reclassifying it for a more age-appropriate section, or routine administrative review of it is undertaken by school staff.PEN America attests, as has Walz, that such classics as Anne Frank’s diary, “Of Mice and Men,” “The Color Purple” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” have been “banned.” That would be very troubling indeed! ButEFI’s studyfound that in every school district where PEN alleges those books have been barred, copies are actually listed as available.It is true that some school libraries have refused space on their shelves for certain books. And rightly so. EFI found that of the ten most actually banned books, all contain sexually charged, borderline pornographic storylines that are unarguably inappropriate for young students. PEN America suggests that anti-LGBTQ hostility is behind these literary prohibitions. But most of these books actually contain heterosexually explicit content. The ones that do feature homosexual acts include instructions on how to use Grindr to find sex partners, a portrayal of underage incest and pictures of oral sex. Decency, not discrimination, motivates restricting these tomes in schools.Even if one accepts PEN America’s ludicrous findings that book bans are a growing national epidemic, the group’s own study found not a single instance of one here in Minnesota. With his state facing a sluggish and uncompetitive economy, population and investment exodus, failing schools and rising crime, Walz should focus on real problems facing his constituency instead of imaginary ones.Andy Brehm, of St. Paul, is a corporate attorney, longtime political commentator and former press secretary to U.S. Sen.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_204,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Anyone who was at Columbia University in the spring of 1968 cannot help but see a reprise of those stormy, fateful and thrilling days in what is happening on the Morningside Heights campus today.But there is a troubling and significant difference. If the students back in ‘68 were divided into rebellious, longhaired pukes and conservative, close-cropped jocks, with a lot of undecided in between, the current protests at Columbia — and at the growing number of other campuses to which they have spread — have witnessed personal and often ugly divisions between Jewish students and Arab or Muslim students or anyone perceived to be on the “wrong” side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.That, in turn, has thrust the protests squarely into the polarized politics of the land, with politicians and pundits on the right portraying the encampments as dangerous manifestations of antisemitism and wokeness and demanding that they be razed — and many university administrations calling in the police to do just that.The transformation of the protests into a national political football is perhaps inevitable — everyone up to President Richard Nixon sounded off about students in ‘68 — but it is still a shame. Because student protests, even at their most disruptive, are at their core an extension of education by other means, to paraphrase Carl von Clausewitz’s famous definition of war.The hallowed notion of a university as a bastion of discourse and learning does not and cannot exclude participation in contemporary debates, which is what students are being prepared to lead. From Vietnam to apartheid to the murder of George Floyd, universities have long been places for open and sometimes fiery debate and inquiry. And whenever universities have been perceived by students to be complicit or wrong in their stances, they have been challenged by their communities of students and teachers. If the university cannot tolerate the heat, it cannot serve its primary mission.The counterargument, of course, is that without decorum and calm, the educational process is disrupted, and so it is proper and necessary for administrations to impose order. But disruption is not the only byproduct; protests can also shape and enhance education: a disproportionate number of those who rose up at Columbia in 1968 went into social service of some sort, fired by the idealism and faith in change that underpinned their protests and by the broader social movement of the ’60s.I was a first-year graduate student at Columbia in ‘68, living in the suburbs and so more of a witness than a participant in events of that spring. But it was impossible not to be swept up in the passions on the campus.The catalyst was a protest by Black students over the construction of a gym in Morningside Park, which touched on many Black grievances against the university — the way it was pushing into Black neighborhoods, the gym’s limited access and separate door for area residents, many of them Black. The slogan was “Gym Crow must go.”The Black sit-in quickly galvanized students from all the other social and political causes of that turbulent era — a war that was killing scores of American boys and countless Vietnamese every week, racism that just weeks earlier took the life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and, yes, a celebration of flower power and love. The gym issue at Columbia was quietly resolved, but by then, other students were occupying several buildings. Finally, Columbia’s president, Grayson Kirk, called in the police.I have a snapshot embedded in my memory of groups of students milling about the grounds, which were littered with the debris of the confrontation, many of them proudly sporting bandages from the injuries inflicted by the violent sweep of the Tactical Patrol Force. Psychedelic music blared from some window, and a lone maintenance man pushed a noisy lawn mower over a surviving patch of grass.The sit-ins had been ended, and order was being restored, but something frightening and beautiful had been unleashed, a faith that mere students could do something about what’s wrong with the world or at least were right to try.The classic account of Columbia ‘68, “The Strawberry Statement,” a wry, punchy diary by an undergraduate, James Simon Kunen, who participated in the protests, captures the confused welter of causes, ideals, frustrations and raw excitement of that spring. “Beyond defining what it wasn’t, it is very difficult to say with certainty what anything meant. But everything must have a meaning, and everyone is free to say what meanings are. At Columbia a lot of students simply did not like their school commandeering a park, and they rather disapproved of their school making war, and they told other students, who told others, and we saw that Columbia is our school and we will have something to say for what it does.”That’s the similarity. Just as students then could no longer tolerate the horrific images of a distant war delivered, for the first time, in almost real time by television, so many of today’s students have found the images from the Gaza Strip, now transmitted instantly onto their phones, to demand action. And just as students in ‘68 insisted that their school sever ties to a government institute doing research for the war, so today’s students demand that Columbia divest from companies profiting from Israel’s invasion of Gaza. And students then and now have found their college administrators deaf to their entreaties.Certainly there’s a lot to debate here. Universities do have a serious obligation to protect Jewish students from antisemitism and to maintain order, but it is to their students and teachers that they must answer, not to Republicans eager to score points against woke “indoctrination” at elite colleges or to megadonors seeking to push their agendas onto institutions of higher learning.Like Kunen, I’m not sure exactly how that spring of 1968 affected my life. I suspect it forced me to think in ways that have informed my reporting on the world. What I do know is that I’m heartened to see that college kids will still get angry over injustice and suffering and will try to do something about it.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

A city of pride, innovation, history, and community that all has been erased or destroyed from the inside out.What happened?The simple truth is, as the old saying goes, bigger is not better.

My brother and I are the fifth generation to do so. Honestly, I’m sick of the city pushing their agenda while paddling their own pockets. But what I’m sick of the most is our city council and mayor completely ignoring the people. The people don’t want more neighborhoods, more traffic and more warehouses. We want the council to just stop and look at the disaster they are making and listen to the people that put them in those positions and stop with the smoke and mirrors show they put on at every city council meeting.

The intensity of drugs like fentanyl combined with increasing levels of personal trauma has made recovering from substance use disorders (SUDs today complex and sometimes fatal.The conventional approach to SUD treatment has primarily focused on clinical interventions and professional counseling. But today the path for many to recovery is different, often fraught with challenges that are as much psychological and emotional as they are physical. These new barriers to recovery hold people back from the help and support they need to stay on a better path.To overcome these obstacles and better address the new intensity of addiction requires a different approach to meet people where they are and in a format that connects with their individual situations.This new normal in SUD is why recovery work has evolved to include connecting a person needing help with a peer who is there to help in a way that often has more impact. Peer specialists are individuals who have walked a path of addiction and recovery. They have lived through the very experiences that those they are helping are currently navigating.Peer recovery specialists support individuals through addiction challenges in a way that is not just beneficial but crucial for a multitude of reasons — including that this approach is proven to be significantly more effective. This shared experience fosters a unique bond of trust and understanding to help the people embracing SUD be better able to use recovery practices to master the basic skills of recovery.The peers doing this work are balancing their own lives as they help others. They are connected to recovery community organizations (RCOs across Minnesota and work in a non-traditional way that both works for them and the people they help.Most of them do this work not as “full-time,” 40-hours-a-week employees but instead as people finding the time they can give, balancing their own lives, and helping those in need. For some in an addiction crisis, peer recovery specialists are a lifeline to hope because of their own issues from past trauma and other complex challenges.Today, Minnesota does not have enough peer recovery specialists to adequately help those in need. If potential changes being considered by Minnesota legislators are adopted, there will be even fewer of these lifelines doing this work. Many peers will be forced to leave this space and no longer be able to serve a community Minnesota cannot leave behind.The changes being considered by lawmakers would only allow a peer specialist to do this work if they are employees of RCOs. Not only does this work structure not fit the lives many peers are trying to live while serving, but it will also likely financially cripple many of the RCOs.The debate over an employee versus independent contractor work model typically focuses on gig workers or others who work a non-traditional schedule like Uber and Lyft drivers. What has not been part of this work model conversation is what happens to people across Minnesota fighting addiction who depend on a peer to give them hope for a better life?While making sure someone can make a living driving for a ride-share service is important, making sure someone in the darkest moments of addiction has access to help and support is more pressing.Peer recovery specialists are living, breathing examples of the possibility of recovery. They are proof that despite the seemingly insurmountable challenges that addiction presents, there is hope. This can be incredibly empowering for individuals in the throes of addiction, offering them a tangible vision of what their future could look like.Peer recovery specialists convey that recovery isn’t just a possibility; it’s a reality for many. Changing how these amazing peers work with an RCO to serve others will create a harmful impact we can absolutely predict; hopefully, legislators will prevent it from happening.Matt McLane is the managing and interim executive director of Refocus Recovery."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_195,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°By the end of the decade, new cars and trucks in the United States will be required to have automatic emergency braking systems that can save hundreds of lives each year.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which announced the requirement Monday, called it the most significant safety rule in two decades. This is an important milestone. But why did it take so long? This technology has been available for years, though often sold as a luxury feature.Most automakers voluntarily include some form of automatic braking in new models, but the capabilities can vary. The regulation makes the technology mandatory by 2029 and sets a minimum standard that all cars must be able stop and avoid contact with the vehicle in front of them when traveling up to 62 miles per hour.Carmakers have been slower to install automatic braking designed specifically to detect and avoid pedestrians, a problem because pedestrian fatalities have been increasing in recent years. The regulation will require that vehicles be able to avoid hitting pedestrians when traveling up to 40 mph and detect pedestrians in the dark, which is when more than three-quarters of such fatalities occur.Since the 1980s, the number of people killed each year in car crashes in the U.S. has declined, thanks in part to safety requirements such as seat belts and airbags. That decline in fatalities stalled a decade ago, and traffic death spiked in 2020 and 2021. Experts attribute the rise to an increase in speeding and reckless and distracted driving.Automatic braking is projected to save about 360 deaths a year, a small but necessary drop. There were 41,000 vehicle fatalities in 2023.While humans deserve the blame for dangerous driving, there is growing recognition that engineering and technology, from cars to roads, can prevent crashes and reduce the likelihood of serious injury and death when they occur.Automatic braking is great, but it’s just one safety feature. The federal government should be far more aggressive in promoting and requiring others; limiting heavier, taller trucks and SUVs that take longer to stop and strike with more force; and reducing reliance on dashboard touch screens that require drivers to take their eyes off the road.Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended — it doesn’t have the power to require — that all new cars have systems to alert drivers when they are speeding. Such systems are required for new cars sold in the European Union starting in July.California State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, this year proposed requiring technology that automatically slows speeding drivers, but his bill was revised to require a speeding warning instead.There is no reason for Americans to tolerate 41,000 traffic deaths a year. Most are preventable, and there are tools and design features available to make vehicles safer for everyone on the road. We just have to demand them.—Los Angeles Times Editorial Board/TNSBOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

philinquirer_2024_64,"In recent years, families across the Philadelphia suburbs have faced a barrage of racist incidents. Their experience echoes that of families across the country.The details in the recentdiscrimination complaintfiled against the Pennridge School District in Bucks County are appalling.Some students reportedly derided the “slanty” eyes of their Asian classmates. Others wielded the N-word as a weapon in school hallways and on school buses, in Snapchat conversations, and during school art projects. Still others responded to a lesson about Frederick Douglass by calling a Black classmate a slave.Even more troubling is the district’s alleged response. According to thecomplaint— filed bylocal group the Pair UP Society, the NAACP of Bucks County, theEducation Law Center, and the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School’s Advocacy for Racial and Civic Justice Clinic — Pennridge teachers ignored requests for meetings sent by parents of color worried about their children’s safety.Pennridge administrators, meanwhile, allegedly handed out some short suspensions to students who used racial slurs — but harshly punished the children of color who fought back, not just with lengthy suspensions, but with criminal charges and 45-day bans from extracurricular activities. Not to be outdone, then-school board members, five of whom were reportedlyaffiliated with the right-wing group Moms for Liberty, disbanded the district’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, sparking a bitter fight for control of the board.The elimination of DEI initiatives was a particularly bitter blow; the complaint against Pennridge’s 7,000-student school district describes an institution that suspends Black students at three times the rate of their white peers, even as white children are nearly five times as likely as their Black classmates to be enrolled in Advanced Placement courses.“A lot of families think that’s just what we have to deal with if we want to live in the suburbs. But it takes a toll,” Adrienne King, an African American mother of two and the founder of thePair UP Society, told me recently. “We’re taxpayers, too. We should be able to send our children to the public schools we’re paying for without fear of them being continually subjected to race-related bullying, harassment, and discrimination.”Perhaps most alarming, however, is how pervasive such problems have become.In recent years, families across the Philly suburbs have faced a barrage of racist incidents, from white children in Tredyffrin-Easttownrecording themselves using the N-wordto Quakertown studentshurling rocks and slursat football players and cheerleaders of rival Cheltenham. Such abuse — and the anger, frustration, and disillusionment that follow — all echo the stories of families living outside of Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh whom I spent the past four years following for anew bookon the challenges facing suburbia, and the families who’ve pinned their hopes to its public schools.The repetition suggests a deeper malady.The roots of the tensions now tearing at suburban schools can be traced to the post-World War II suburbanization of America. The residential development boom was supposed to spread opportunity across the country. And it succeeded — at least for those first few generations of mostly white families like mine, who received guaranteed mortgage loans, massive tax breaks, and sparkling new infrastructure, including the public schools we spent decades molding in our own image.Americans embraced the myth that endless, outward expansion could deliver the “suburban lifestyle dream” in perpetuity. When an older suburb’s infrastructure began to crumble, its tax base dwindled, and its test scores slipped, we refused to face facts and start the hard work of repair and renewal. Instead, millions of mostly white families like mine fled inner suburbs to newer suburbs one ring farther out, restarting the same cycle somewhere new, blithely confident we could outrun the debt, disinvestment, and disrepair we left in our wake.There’s a term for trading quick bursts of short-term wealth for massive long-term liabilities that are pushed off onto future generations. It’s called aPonzi scheme.It’s called a Ponzi scheme.In suburbia, this scheme has been fundamentally racialized, with Black, brown, and immigrant families all too often fighting to get into suburban communities, only to be met with racial hostility and fresh rounds of white flight, followed by an even more horrible realization: They’ve been stuck with the bill for all the opportunity whiter and wealthier families already extracted.As tends to happen with Ponzi schemes, however, this cycle is starting to unravel.One big reason is accelerating demographic changes. Bucks County, for example, was 91% white at the turn of the century, but has since seen itswhite population dropby more than 18,000 people as its Hispanic population grew by more than 26,000 people. Such change underpins the racial tensions inside Pennridge schools, which in the past decade alone lost roughly 20% of their white students, nearly 1,400 children in all.Once, a critical mass of families would likely have fled such change for a newer suburb somewhere else. Now, though, many of those families feel stuck in place.Hypothetically, the resulting racial tensions in suburban school districts like Pennridge could present an opportunity to acknowledge the corner we’ve painted ourselves into, learn from our mistakes, and proactively minimize the harm done to our children as we search for a way out.Instead, we’re seeing concerted efforts toban books by Black authorsand scrub the curriculum of references to racial oppression.From the content school systems teach to the budgets they enact, the discipline policies they impose to the enrichment opportunities they extend, there are countless facets of suburban schools that desperately need to be critiqued and improved.But for the disillusioned suburban parents of color forced to have adult conversations with their young children, the core issue is at once more simple and far deeper than that.“It feels like we’re taking our kids’ innocence away, and it just gets normalized,” King told me. “That’s why I try to impress upon people that what’s happening and how it’s being responded to are not OK.”Benjamin Herold is a Philadelphia-based journalist and the author of “Disillusioned: Five Families and the Unraveling of America’s Suburbs.” Learn more atbenjaminherold.com."
suffolknewsherald_2024_26,"Published 2:27 pm Wednesday, June 19, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardTypically, Suffolk News-Herald coverage of the last day of school is full of fun, complete with photos of happy students and teachers, ready to embark on the adventures that await them during summer. There may be a few tears from a student here or there who will miss their friends or a particular teacher, but overall, most everyone is having a good time when the buses roll out on the last day of school.The school year ended very differently for one Suffolk elementary school on Friday. Students of Kilby Shores Elementary spent their final hours of the 2023-2024 school year in a code red lockdown because an adult male had gained unauthorized access to the school and occupied a girl’s bathroom while students were occupying the same bathroom. We can only imagine what was going through those young students’ minds and how terrified those children in the bathroom must have been on a day that was supposed to be a joyful one. Many of us on the staff of the Suffolk News-Herald are parents and hearing your child’s school is on code red lockdown for unauthorized access is on the top of the list of things that puts a pit in your stomach. While this event was particularly unsettling and poses more questions than answers, there is one thing that can’t be questioned right now. In our opinion, that is the quick response time of our Suffolk Police Department.Based on the information the City of Suffolk provided, SPD was on the scene two minutes after receiving the call.The whole ordeal was over without any injuries in approximately seven minutes — let us say that again: seven minutes from call to custody. Although it must have felt like a lifetime to those students and staff, the speed and accuracy of our police officers prevented this situation from being anything more than unauthorized access.Just as you and I are not perfect, neither are police officers. However, they put their lives on the line day in and day out for our community—people they may or may not even know. They purposely put themselves in trouble, which is especially evident when it comes to protecting our children. They did just that on Friday, and we like to think they did so without hesitation.For that, as parents and as citizens, we owe them a tremendous amount of gratitude. We know those children in the bathroom will carry this experience with them for the rest of their lives. That is an incredibly unfortunate fact and one that begs more questions about how this event was able to occur in the first place. Unfortunate as it may be, it is equally as fortunate that this story didn’t end differently. We are glad that our Suffolk Police force was there within minutes and that we did not have to go on to report the unthinkable on what should be one of the happiest days of the hundred and eighty.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_253,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°America’s heartland is commendably getting the political recognition it’s due this year, with Republicans and Democrats tapping a pair of Midwesterners to balance out presidential tickets headed by a New Yorker and a San Franciscan.Of two newly minted running mates, only one brings an authentic Midwest voice and sensibility to the race. It’s Minnesota’s Carhartt-clad governor, Tim Walz — a former teacher and football coach, an Army National Guard veteran, a former congressman, and a Democrat now in the middle of his second gubernatorial term.On Tuesday morning, Kamala Harris, the California-born vice president and Democratic presidential nominee, announced that she’s selected Walz to run as her vice president. It’s a historic moment in Minnesota, already home to two vice presidents, Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale, and now potentially a third.Walz is an experienced, pragmatic leader at both the state and federal levels. He has the temperament and constitution to serve. And he brings to the race rural America bona fides that beat by a country mile those of Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, a venture capitalist and Ohio senator far removed from his family’s Appalachian roots.Like Humphrey, Walz was born outside Minnesota but made his home here. Humphrey was a South Dakota native. Walz grew up in small-town Nebraska before settling in Mankato, where he taught and coached at Mankato West High School. He ran for the U.S. House in 2006, defeating GOP incumbent Gil Gutknecht to represent southern Minnesota’s mostly rural First District.Walz’s new national prominence comes as no surprise to the Star Tribune Editorial Board. We saw Walz’s political potential when he first ran for Congress. In 2006, the Editorial Board endorsed him, writing then that he “radiates energy, optimism and critical thinking — qualities that Washington could use right now.” Those qualities should sound familiar to the new fans Walz has made after recent high-profile national media appearances.We’ve had policy differences with him through the years, but Walz has continued to earn our support for elected office. In fact, there may not be another Minnesota politician with a longer string of Editorial Board endorsements. In addition to 2006, Walz earned our support for U.S. House in 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2016. There’s no 2012 endorsement because the Editorial Board concentrated on other races that year as Walz cruised to a fourth term.Walz went on to earn our gubernatorial endorsement in 2018 and again in 2022. Across the years, there’s a through-line we’ve admired: his work ethic, down-to-earth style and focus on issues important to Minnesota.In Congress, Walz was an energetic advocate for Minnesota’s farmers and veterans, reaching out across political lines to craft solutions after a scheduling-delay scandal enveloped the Veterans Affairs medical system. He championed a milestone ethics reform — the STOCK Act — which banned congressional insider stock trading.His service as a noncommissioned officer in the Army National Guard brought an enlisted soldier’s perspective to Congress, a welcome change. His foreign affairs analytical skills also served him well. One particularly memorable moment from endorsement interviews: Walz telling the Editorial Board of the threat posed by Russia years before Putin’s aggression became an international crisis. That alarm stands in in notable contrast to Vance’s disdain for Ukrainians battling the Russian invasion.As governor, Walz’s teaching skills played a vital role in leading the state through the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 2022 editorial noting that Minnesota bested many others on two key indicators: the per capita death rate and the state’s economic performance. Another analysis, one done by Politico, also favorably rated Minnesota’s pandemic response.Critics contend that Walz has morphed from moderate to liberal during his time in the governor’s residence. Voters concerned by that should delve more deeply. The policy accomplishments earning what’s supposed to be a derogatory liberal label instead have broad appeal.They include: one of the nation’s most generous child tax credits, universal free school lunch, abortion access protections, new safeguards for those with medical debt and sensible gun control measures such as stronger penalties for straw gun buyers. Another laudable policy: a tuition-free college pathway called the North Star Promise Scholarship Program for students whose families earn below $80,000 annually.These measures may have cost Walz some rural support from his first gubernatorial election to his second, but he gained ground in 2022 in the state’s most populous counties, including metro suburbs. That suburban voter appeal is a key asset Walz brings to the Harris campaign.While there’s much to like about Walz’s policies, he should still face tough-but-fair questions about the violence after George Floyd’s death and how it was handled. The Feeding Our Future scandal also happened on his watch. The “One Minnesota” platform he ran on in 2018 has also been elusive. It’s also important to note for this editorial that the Star Tribune’s publisher previously worked in the Walz administration.Walz’s Midwest-dad style has been a formidable force on the campaign trail. In media appearances, he’s prosecuted the case against Trump with positivity and memorable one-liners, such as dubbing the opposition “weird.” This “Happy Warrior” vibe worked well for another Minnesota VP candidate, Hubert Humphrey, and is a refreshing change in the 2024 race.In contrast to Walz, Vance’s connection to heartland voters feels forced. He’s a Yale Law grad with ties to Silicon Valley billionaires. Despite his best-selling book “ Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance grew up in Middletown, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb. Vance, in his book, also seems to blame Appalachian residents for poverty, drug use and other problems. Yet what this region needs isn’t an elegy but a helping hand, like Minnesota’s universal school lunches or North Star Promise Scholarship Program.Walz, who graduated from Nebraska’s Chadron State College, spent much of his adult life as a teacher and a noncommissioned officer before entering politics. His path to this moment is self made, and one that should feel both familiar and reassuring to voters in the Midwest and elsewhere.— Star TribuneDENVER — The Colorado athletics department informed The Denver Post that head coach Deion Sanders and anyone else within the Buffs football program will no longer take questions from columnist Sean Keeler.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday.Not a single hat hit the ice to celebrate Jason Robertson’s first career playoff hat trick that paced the Dallas Stars to a 5-3 road win over the Edmonton Oilers on Monday night in Game 3 of the Western Conference final."
minnpost_2024_123,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Today’s competitive business environment is rapidly changing how companies attract and keep employees. Beyond the more tangible specifics of a job and package, prospective employees have a range of considerations when taking a new job, including work-life balance, workplace environment, community engagement, location and commute time. Companies need to appeal to these essential outside-the-office factors to create a positive and rewarding environment for their workforce.To better meet these shifting priorities, businesses located within urban centers – recognized as hubs of economic and social activity – offer unique advantages, including access to robust transit systems and proximity to cultural enrichment. Community involvement and accessibility to attractions and transportation are key perks for being in the heart of a city and will help a business thrive.The synergy between business and cities goes both ways. Urban centers depend on businesses to bring people, money and growth into the economic and social fabric, fueling its long-term resilience. The stakes are notably high, as history provides stark examples of cities that faced downturns due to shifts in business and residential patterns, as companies and residents moved away. These dramatic changes in population and business presence result in diminished cultural vibrancy and economic and social challenges.This underscores the critical need for strategic urban planning and investment to prevent urban decline and foster sustainable economic growth and community well-being. Efforts to revitalize these and other cities are making significant strides with strategic foresight and economic, social and infrastructure improvements. Urban and business success are clearly intertwined.In our own city of Minneapolis, a decision to relocate businesses to downtown locations means even more than convenience, accessibility and growth – it’s about contributing to a sustainable urban ecosystem that avoids the pitfalls of major economic shifts. By choosing to be in the city’s heart, businesses can help ensure a vibrant urban core, attracting not only other businesses but also residents and visitors.At HNTB, we have seen the benefits of an urban center with increased accessibility firsthand. We recently relocated our office to downtown Minneapolis. Following the move, we observed a significant boost in employee morale and in team growth and engagement. When I asked my team about the shift in our culture, many mentioned that being closer to transit had improved their commutes, reducing both travel time and stress. Additionally, this move led to a 35% increase in our team size.The dynamic atmosphere of downtown Minneapolis is also a key factor in our employees’ improved satisfaction. Right outside our office doors is a vibrant setting, brimming with cultural and social activities which significantly enhances our workplace’s appeal. This lively environment offers our employees access to theater performances, art exhibitions and outdoor events, enriching their work-life experiences. Such opportunities attract talent and foster a connected and satisfied workforce, which is crucial in today’s job market.Our decision to move downtown also puts us in an optimal position to leverage significant infrastructure investments aimed at revitalizing transportation systems and public amenities in Minneapolis. Locating near transit hubs encourages public transportation over personal vehicles, contributing to reduced urban congestion and pollution. Additionally, developments likeMinneapolis’ Downtown Improvement Districtbeautify the city and provide communal spaces that promote public health and well-being.Looking to the future, the decisions businesses make today will shape the communities we want to live in tomorrow. I encourage other business leaders to consider how relocating to urban centers could benefit their organizations and contribute to revitalizing urban areas – creating a stronger Minneapolis for us all.Sara Hage is the Minnesota office leader atHNTB, a firm that designs and advances transportation infrastructure."

But increasingly seniors are returning to work to merely make ends meet. Low savings, longer lives and a rickety safety net are combining to present new challenges, especially here in Florida. It’s a reminder that society benefits both from ready employment and from protecting Americans’ golden years.A survey released last month by AARP puts the sobering facts into perspective. One in 5 adults over age 50 say they have no retirement savings, and nearly two-thirds are worried they will not have enough money to support themselves in retirement.Nearly one-third of older adults who roll over credit card debt report carrying a balance of $10,000 or more, while more seniors are racking up heavier debt from a year ago. While about one-third expect their finances to improve over the coming 12 months, a larger percentage is worried about prices outpacing their incomes and their ability to cover basic expenses.The gloomy outlook raises red flags both for America’s seniors and states like Florida that have long sold themselves as retirement havens. The figure of 1 in 5 adults over age 50 with no retirement savings came from interviews completed with more than 8,000 people, the AARP said. One-fourth also expect to never retire, a share that has steadily increased in the twice-yearly survey since 2022.The AARP’s findings echo a recent report by Times staff writer Lauren Peace, who chronicled how rising prices and depleted savings are driving some Tampa Bay area retirees back into the workforce. As Peace reported, Americans are living longer, and many seniors are finding their fixed budgets cannot cover rising household costs, medical bills, food and other essentials.Seniors bring a wealth of value to the workplace, from life experience and varied skill sets to a reputation for being dependable. The number of seniors in the workforce is growing at a rate greater than all other age groups combined; by 2030, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 12% of people ages 75 and older will be working, more than double the rate in 2000. They are a key age group whose participation in the workforce fills a critical need in the economy. Beyond earning a paycheck, many seniors also credit working with staying mentally sharp and socially engaged.But it’s one thing for Americans to work as long as they’re able and interested; it’s another when seniors are reentering the workforce because their finances and the social safety net forces them there. According to the latest annual reports, Medicare — the government-sponsored health insurance that covers 65 million older and disabled Americans — will run short of paying full benefits by 2031, while Social Security will run short of full benefits to 66 million retirees only two years later.Every American, as the AARP noted in the introduction to its report, “deserves to retire with dignity and financial security.” Yet more are feeling the heat, suffering anxiety and changing their lives to adapt to an uncertain future. That’s especially true in Florida, where rising housing and insurances costs, coupled with rapid growth, are raising financial pressures on already-strapped households.Government and business need to work across a range of fronts to protect pensions, bolster Medicare and Social Security and promote retirement savings plans to younger workers.—Tampa Bay Times/TNSIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.BOULDER, Colo. — Minutes earlier, Deion Sanders’ Colorado team had survived a frantic final drive from a proud North Dakota State team.

minnpost_2024_49,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.America’s media institutions have had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad start to 2024.The Messenger, a well-funded, high-profile news site, dissolved after less than a year. Big newspapers from the Los Angeles Times to the IndyStar saw major layoffs. And Sports Illustrated fell into licensing limbo while sites like BuzzFeed, Vice News, or Complex found themselves at best on life support.The over500 media jobseliminated so far this year reflect a broader, worrying trend. By this year’s end, according toone recent estimate, America will have lost one third of all its newspapers — and two-thirds of all its newspaper staff — since 2005.The losses have been particularly acute in poor and rural communities, leaving ever expanding news deserts all across the nation.The collapse of news outlets, especially local papers, is robbing our communities of indispensable watch dogs. The disappearance of reporters from city council meetings and public safety hearings is creating oversight vacuums that leave citizens in the dark and enable shady dealings that let the wealthy exercise undue — and undetected — influence.How did a country once chock-full of influential newspapers morph into a land of news deserts?One major factor, says University of Pennsylvania media studies scholar Victor Pickard, has been the disintegration of the advertising model. In short, search engines and social media sites are eating up revenue that once went to local papers.Hence the rise of paywalls everywhere as more outlets resort to subscriptions. That works well for some, but subscriptions haven’t been enough to replace ad funding in most cases — especially for larger publications or those that serve less wealthy audiences.Other outlets have counted on the benevolence of billionaire buyers. But that creates real concerns about the influence of exorbitantly wealthy owners — who have been increasingly unwilling to foot the bill for quality journalism.The Washington Post — owned by Jeff Bezos, who recently became the richest man alive again — offered buyouts to 240 employees this past fall. And Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong’s net worth of nearly $6 billion didn’t save the jobs of the 115 workers the paper laid off this January.Is there an alternative to for-profit journalism? To be sure, we’ve seen some exciting developments in nonprofit and worker-owned journalism. But these proposals remain limited in scope.Given all this, some experts are calling for a fundamental rethinking of how we value journalism.“The information produced by journalism should always be — and should have always been — treated as a public good,” Victor Pickard told me. “And that, by its very nature, is not something that’s easily monetized.”Good reporting simply takes more resources to produce than it can easily recoup in digital ad dollars or fundraising. The answer? A real commitment to public media funding.The United States does, of course, invest some money in public media.Last year Congress allocated $535 million to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit corporation tasked with investing in public radio and television. And some promising experiments are taking place at the state level, with California, New Mexico, and Washingtondevotingpublic tax dollars for local news coverage.But that funding is a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed.A 2022studycomparing funding globally found the U.S. spends just $3.16 per capita on public media, compared to $142.42 per person in Germany and $110.73 in Norway. Spending as much on journalism as the United Kingdom does on the BBC would mean $35 billion a year going to sustaining coverage.We need, as The Nation’s John Nichols recentlyargued, a “Marshall Plan” for journalism — a robust new era of public funding. Our democracy deserves better than to rely on ad dollars that are rapidly drying up.Chris Mills Rodrigo is the managing editor of Inequality.org at the Institute for Policy Studies.This op-ed was adapted from Inequality.org and distributed for syndication by OtherWords.org."
eugeneweekly_2024_0,"We ve got issues. With the 2024 election just 75 days away as I write this there is a renewed sense of determination similar to “hope and change” vibes summoned by Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. President Joe Biden — who achieved more in office than anyone could have dreamed — kept yet another campaign promise by passing the torch and demonstrating selfless leadership that America can believe in. It is refreshing to see a politician listen to their constituents and follow the will of the people rather than serving their own ego. Biden’s decision to step aside for a new generation speaks volumes about his character and commitment to our democracy. It is a leadership lesson Americans will recount to their kids and grandkids. Vice President Kamala Harris has also risen to the occasion and demonstrates leadership, resilience and unwavering commitment to justice as is required to galvanize Americans to re-engage and defeat the dangerous MAGA offensive. Many of us have felt the weight of politics in recent years, with some (including me expressing a need to step back for the sake of their well-being. Self-care is important, but we cannot afford to disengage entirely. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. There is a difference between retreating into apathy and cynicism versus strategically choosing how to participate politically while protecting personal well-being. Apathy and cynicism are the fertile ground in which authoritarianism takes root; collective action is the force that pulls that weed from the civic soil, leaving a communal flowering blooming in its place. And it doesn’t hurt that the Kamala Harris/Tim Walz ticket has leaned into a message centered on hope and the joy of campaigning for a better future. In 2020, 81 million Americans stood together in what Biden described as “a battle for the soul of our nation.” Today, the stakes are even higher. A former president, now convicted of 34 felony counts, adjudicated a sexual abuser, and facing dozens more felony counts, is again seeking the nation’s highest office. This same man shattered our nation’s proud tradition of the peaceful transfer of power, putting our democracy in jeopardy. The significance of this election cannot be overstated. While constant political engagement can be exhausting, we should not retreat into complacency. Instead, finding a balance between self-care and civic duty, ensuring that we contribute to preserving our democracy, is the way to go. As citizens, it is our responsibility to make a meaningful impact in this election. We don’t need to let politics dominate our lives, but we should commit to strategic, impactful action. Whether it’s donating to a campaign, supporting efforts in key battleground states, or simply talking to friends and family about the stakes of this election, every action counts when elections are this close. The 2024 election will no doubt again come down to several thousand votes in the battleground states. In 2019, I lost a younger brother to suicide and subsequently was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. I felt hopeless in the wake of my brother’s loss, yet as I watched President Donald Trump’s deadly mismanagement of the COVID pandemic, I could not remain idle with so much at stake. I found an opportunity to work as a field organizer in Wisconsin and spent the final 75 days reaching out to Wisconsin voters, making the case for new national leadership. I was among tens of thousands of Americans who could not stand by and allow an unfit fraudster to remain in the White House. We grabbed an oar and started rowing — and together we won. Little did I know, being a part of that movement of Americans who found meaning in engaging in the democratic process was exactly what I needed to pull out of the throws of depression and hopelessness I experienced after losing my brother. The best medicine for apathy and cynicism is social connection with civic purpose. That’s the lesson I learned in 2020. This election is our chance to define the course of history, to rise against the threat of 21st-century authoritarianism, and to ensure that democracy prevails. By taking measured, thoughtful action, we honor both our responsibility to ourselves and our duty to the greater good. In 2020, Biden secured victory by a margin of only 44,000 votes across three key swing states (Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia . Now, we must again rally to consign the dangerous MAGA movement to the dustbin of history where it belongs along with its hooded and jackbooted progenitors. As we approach the 2024 election, let us jointogetherwith a sense of purpose and hope. Let us dedicate time, resources and energy to making a difference, no matter how small it may seem. When the electorate is this polarized and elections are so close, every action matters. History will judge us by the choices we make in this moment, and together we can ensure that democracy not only survives but thrives; and in the process, you may find that your efforts revitalize your own sense of purpose and well-being. By taking care of our nation together, we lift up ourselves as individuals as well. Let’s get to work.

And naturally, I was the only Black student in the entire school.It was there I experienced what DuBois called the “color line,” for every evening I came home to an upper middle-class but entirely segregated Black residential neighborhood — populated by my grandparents and their friends and neighbors, most of whom taught at nearby North Carolina College where my granddad was the law school dean.But Durham Academy was, at best, lily white.When the comparatively mild North Carolina winter rolled around, the antiquated facilities at Durham Academy lacked any gymnasium or any indoor playground — so the Durham YMCA had to suffice. But in 1964-65 there was a catch: the Y was still segregated.So I stayed home over the noon hour inside a makeshift home room/study hall while my white fellow 10-year-old classmates (and everyone else boarded a charter bus to the Durham Y.Then a strange thing came to pass: a few of my white classmates began staying home with me — eating cold lunch and dutifully studying geography and French.I didn’t know why. I only knew they stayed away from the Y.They were the children of some of Durham’s likely wealthy and influential — a child of a physician and a daughter of wealth — even the son of the head of the Research Triangle over in Chapel Hill. They stayed at school with me.It would only be in the coming New Year — after I had been admitted to the Durham YMCA — that they returned to the Y. After we rode together on the same bus. After we swam together in the same pool.Nobody ever told me why they stayed away from the Y during every lunch hour until the Durham YMCA relented — eating with me quietly in that stuffy home room — but somehow we all knew why.We silently knew it was their quiet and unspoken courage — even in the face of peer pressure — which helped end one tiny vestige of what we now call “Jim Crow.”It was their private lives making a public statement that it was time to end another senseless chapter in America.So when I hear about certain public figures in this era who attack or question our nation’s progress through an imagined and false nostalgia for our racist past, I can only wish they knew our past and that they had the compassion and the courage of a 10-year old.Goins lives in White Bear Lake."

Suffolk residents should consider themselves among the lucky ones to live in an area that is still rich with the treasures that Mother Nature has to offer. Suffolk has about as much as one could hope to find to be more in touch with nature, from miles of open fields of the latest crops, an assortment of different waterways, beautiful parks, and even a national wildlife refuge.It’s one of the things I love best about living in Suffolk. Especially since I have a love for photography. Whether I’m behind the camera or admiring someone else’s photos, some of my favorite photographs are of wildlife or landscape. Specifically, I like macro photography, which showcases subjects that are larger than life. Something about being able to see the individual specks of pollen on a bee’s legs as it hovers over a flower is so magnificent to me.That’s why I’m so excited that this year, joined by presenting sponsor Visit Suffolk, theSuffolk News-Heraldis hosting the first annual Wild Suffolk Photo Contest.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_245,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°Our presidential folklore is awash with animal stories. Remember Franklin Roosevelt’s dog Fala? No? Well, it was a while ago. President Joe Biden is a big dog lover, but his pets were exiled to Delaware after multiple biting episodes. Jill Biden brought in a cat to fill the void.Kamala Harris has been photographed cuddling puppies, but if there’s going to be any Republican animal stories during the campaign this fall, chances are they’re going to be sort of unpleasant. Donald Trump doesn’t like animals — naturally, since they draw attention from him. And now he’s got a new supporter who’s famous for his run-ins with their corpses.Yeah, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. once allegedly chain-sawed the head off a dead whale on a beach, bungee-corded it to the roof of his car and drove it five hours to the family home. Some years ago, Kennedy’s daughter Kick Kennedy called the episode “the rankest thing on the planet.”People, does that remind you of anything? Back when Mitt Romney was running against Barack Obama, his son once told the story about a family vacation in which Romney put Seamus, their pet Irish setter, in a roof crate for a 12-hour drive to Canada. Apparently, Seamus weathered the trip fine, but the presidential campaign in 2012 was very boring. As a diversion, I decided to try to see how many times I could mention the story before Election Day. Diligent readers counted around 80 mentions.How would you compare the whale incident with that? Does it make you miss Romney? Yes, he was boring, but we’ve certainly learned how much worse a candidate can be. Don’t forget: Kennedy also dumped a dead bear cub in Central Park. His explanation was that he’d found it on the side of a road and decided to take it home to refrigerate its meat. Then, upon realizing that he was late to a steakhouse dinner, he changed his mind and left the carcass in the park, creating a stir he called “amusing.”Kennedy, you may remember, says he once suffered from memory issues because of a dead worm in his brain. He’s now supporting Trump for president, and Trump might even consider giving an administration job to his new pal.No further comments seem necessary. Just remember that whale.This article originally appeared inThe New York Times.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
philinquirer_2024_72,"Like so many others in Philadelphia’s arts community, I ache over the challenges local art institutions face — and I can t help but reflect on their role in my own artistic growth.Becoming an artist isn’t a straight line.For me, it wasn’t even a single art school. It was a single city.Until this spring, Philadelphia offered, and I have, over the years, attended, thePennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia College of Art (as the University of the Artswas known for much of its life ,Moore College of Art, and theFleisher Art Memorial.Now, one of them — PAFA — finds itself onprecarious financial footing, and another — UArts, the former PCA — announced last weekthat it would be closing Friday.Like so many others in Philadelphia’s arts community, I ache over the challenges these institutions face. But, mostly, I feel for the students who will not have the benefit of the life-changing programs now on the chopping block, and for their teachers whose dedication animated those programs. I can’t help but reflect on the vital role so many of their predecessors played in my own artistic growth.My extensive sampling of Philadelphia’s art schools began in my suburban high school, when our “art” project was to cut out flowers in magazines, tape them down in an “arrangement,” and then trace them onto a surface we could then paint. Voilà!Art.Not amused, my mother enrolled me at Moore College of Art Saturday classes for high schoolers. We used real art materials on real easels. No clipping and tracing. My eyes were opened to a new world of real art (and being able to hit Sansom Street on the way back to the train . Recently, I’ve hired three terrific Moore grads to help organize an archive of my drawings and cartoons.Returning from my art-desert college, I got back into art at Philadelphia College of Art evening classes. I still have an egg tempera painting from a magical class taught by John Grauer. Now, decades later, a PCA grad and great designer helps me untangle my fraught relations with Photoshop when preparing cartoons for print.After PCA, I enrolled part-time at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where teachers followed in the footsteps of artists likeThomas EakinsandCecilia Beaux.Instructors, themselves practicing artists, helped me learn to really look at what I wanted to draw and paint.Robert Beverly Hale, the late artist and art curator, who was nearly 80 at the time, would train down from New York City to teach anatomy by quoting Leadbelly and drawing with a long stick topped with charcoal to impress on us that being able to render a hand — that supple, always in motion appendage at the end of our arms — can express as much as a face.My interest in graphic art bloomed in PAFA’s lithography and etching classes, then located in a building on Chestnut Street. PAFA did not, thankfully, have a cartooning department, but the basics PAFA taught are applicable to all sorts of art and design. My etchings began to express my political opinions, one winning a nod at the annual student show.In the last few years, I’ve been taking classes at the Fleisher Art Memorial, which is not a degree-granting institution but offers classes in everything from oil painting to ceramics to jewelry and photography. Classes are taught by working artists including PAFA, PCA, and UArts grads.Their children’s programs have produced artists likeAllan Edmunds, who went on to found South Broad Street’s Brandywine Workshop, andTariq “Black Thought” Trotter, who cofounded the hip-hop group The Roots. Their remarks at Fleisher’s fundraising dinner last fall were brimming with love and gratitude for how Fleisher opened their eyes to the wider world of art.Fleisher continues to be a community treasure where many PCA, PAFA, and UArts alumni teach. Drexel’s Westphal College of Media Arts and Design and Temple’s Tyler School of Art and Architecture offer really good art programs. And Moore is thriving — according to the college’s president, Cathy Young, this is the school’s 23rd year running an operating budget surplus, their applications rose 12% over last year, and 97% of their students find employment within a year of graduation.Perhaps it’s time to send the leadership of PAFA and UArts to one of Philadelphia’s really good business schools.Signe Wilkinson, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize, spent 35 years as an editorial cartoonist at The Inquirer and the Daily News. She will speak on June 11 at 6 p.m. at the opening of the Pennsylvania Historical Society’s exhibit “Cartoons as Political Speech in Colonial America,” which includes some of her cartoons."

This led to the injuries that ended her life.Minutes after she was hit, another vehicle crossed a bike lane on Allegheny Avenue, striking and killing a pedestrian. The same day, a young woman was hit by a car while crossing the street inGermantown, and remains in critical condition.The media calls these tragedies “accidents,” yet they are wholly preventable.

At our pediatric hospital in Philadelphia, we see these children in our emergency departments, traumatized and injured, and think to ourselves — “this could’ve been much worse,” and “this should have never happened in the first place.”Children under 17 years old account for 37% of all cyclistsand have more than four times the rate of bicycle-related deaths as compared to adults. In fact, over 10 years, 2 million children nationwide were treated in emergency rooms for bike-related injuries.Pediatricians play a critical role in preventing and treating bike- and traffic-related injuries. In our primary care offices, we counsel our patients on wearing helmets, using bike lanes, and riding with an adult. We treat acute injuries. We provide long-term medical care for children and families affected by devastating neurological outcomes and lifelong trauma.We all deserve to survive our journeys home.Yet, pediatricians can only do so much to prevent traffic-related injury and death without policies that safeguard and protect our children and families.Our city government is failing to invest in safer streets.

And in spite of overwhelming scientific and public support,the Washington Avenue Repaving & Improvement Project which would have improved safety was blocked by City Councilpersonman Kenyatta Johnsonin 2022.The safety of all Philadelphia’s cyclists, pedestrians, and motorists requires authentic investment in policies and infrastructure that protects them.

However, the county only chose certain mostly high-priced areas: Paradise Ala Kai, Puako and gated Kona Bay Estates.There are several other oceanfront roads with numerous vacation rentals that charge visitors less per night, but that would reduce the taxes paid by visitors.So, therefore, the owners of those vacation rentals that are still considered nonconforming still have to pay an extra $500 per year.The other Vacation Destinations are Volcano, which has been a true vacation destination for a long time, and all of Kehena — could it be the nude, hard-to-climb-down to, dangerous black sand beach?This does not seem to be fair and treats wealthier people preferentially!Magdalene PhillipsPahoaObsession with crowdsize is mind-bogglingThe upcoming election is a very serious one for our country.

suffolknewsherald_2024_67,"Published 5:31 pm Tuesday, August 13, 2024ByStaff ReportsDennis EdwardsI called my Suffolk High School Football Coach the other day. Left a message for Dr. Mike Debranski, who coached us in the falls of 1973 and 1974 and was my Gym Teacher. Just wanted the Former Suffolk School Board Chairman to know how every time I see the soon to be Democrat Vice Presidential Nominee and Governor of Minnesota Tim Walz, I think of him.Both have the same upbeat personalities as well as optimistic and go-get-em personae. Like coach Waltz, coach Debranski challenged, pushed and inspired us with an ever present enthusiasm that always had our best interests at heart.He produced some really good players like former Virginia Union University Quarterback Garfield Mizelle, VUU Linebacker Calvin Young and Suffolk’s Circuit Court Clerk Randy Carter.Perhaps my fondest memory of Coach Debranski was when we unexpectedly beat the Franklin High School football team one year. Coach was beside himself. On that occasion, or after another victory, coach was so excited he kind of stepped outside himself in candor, gratitude and joy. Said something like “I’m so proud of you guys I could take anyone of you home with me as my son”. He then followed the statement up with a hilarious reference to his attempts to have one. “I don’t know guys, I keep trying but I just keep coming up with girls!”I was laughing and listening pretty intensely that night. I stood there dumbfounded, actually wondering what it would look and be like to have coach Debranski as a dad. Then I thought “I wouldn’t have a problem with that”. It would have been quite the adventure.To be sure, the thought was simply a notion, a “flight of fancy” so to speak, emerging from a moment of extreme excitement. No reflection on my mom or stepdad. Just the idea coach thought that much of us made me feel great. A feeling I never forgot and will always remember.Of course, I told my mom about coaches statement. She just smiled in the way mothers do at the more odd ideas their children share with a look on her face that said, “wouldn’t be long before he brought you back!” He probably would have. But the thought was more than a humorous diversion. I considered it a very nice complement.So while watching Coach and Governor Walz on the campaign trail, seeing and hearing his kindness, optimism, my mind goes back to Coach Debranski. I remember the things he said and how I always liked the way he pronounced my name.Coach Debranski was and still is what the Latin describes as “sui generous”, one of a kind. In my mind’s eye, I can see him always doing the same thing Walz is doing. Leading with joy, determination as well as vision. Pointing the way to excellence and making all of us want to follow him home. Even, if just for a little while.Dennis Edwards is a Major Market Emmy and Virginia Associated Press Broadcasters Award Winning T.V.

minnpost_2024_162,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.May in Minnesota is when spring starts really humming. As trees begin to bud and flowers bloom, Minnesotans dust off bicycles and remove blue tarps from boats. In typical years (unlike this past winter , along with the early spring potpourri of Chinese crabapples and rhododendrons, there’s almost a whiff of desperation in the air. Because the time has come for cramming in the fun.And Minnesotans, deep down, know there isn’t much time. Always, we feel in the dim corners of our minds the cool draft of winter. But for now, we are on the other side of it, the far side. And so we beat the dust from rugs and swap the Santa Claus holiday welcome mat for the one with brightly colored flowers or hummingbirds and await our guests, whom we have not seen in some time.Since moving to the Twin Cities more than 20 years ago from South Dakota, I’ve always felt like there is an urgency to early spring here. It’s an excitement that you can almost feel, a vibration in the buzz of hungry bees recently sprung from hibernation, a tone in the chatter of birds looking for love after returning from their southern adventures.There are concerts and movies in parks, art-a-whirls and farmers markets, and small towns with ice cream shops we’ve heard about. And there are the North Shore’s roadside antiques and smoked meats, not to mention camping and hiking and more than 10,000 lakes, only a handful of which we’ve had the pleasure to fish in.I’ve long considered myself a person who needs all four seasons. An “absence makes the heart grow fonder” kind of outdoorsman, I take it all in for three seasons of the year with the rest of the desperates, and then take myself in when the longest season arrives, always much too soon.I know this puts me into the category of “not a true Minnesotan,” but what can I say? I am akin to those among us (legions of us who root for Minnesota’s Timberwolves, Vikings and Twins when they are doing well, but who bemoan our collective plight through viewing abstinence when they are not. In short, I am a fan of fair weather.It’s just that for me, the experience of winter is more of a philosophical question. Can good exist without evil? Right without wrong? Winter without summer? Happiness without suffering? I believe you can’t enjoy one without the other — not fully, anyway.In popular wintering places like Arizona and Florida, snowbirds and the aged search for never ending sunshine, and is it any wonder that these places attract so many in the waning years of life, when you simply don’t have the time to be stuck inside, or be fooling around with 10 inches of snow, battling with the well worn tools of our trade that so many of us would love to trade: the shovel, the roof rake, the ice scraper, the snowblower. After all, who wants to shovel when your days are numbered, the number only ever growing smaller? Give us our birds year round, and outdoor restaurants as, at least, an option.The flip side of this philosophical question, of course, is whether Minnesota summers can truly exist without punishment — without the suffering of winter. If your days are all the same, it seems to me that you’re likely to stop noticing what’s around you. The subtle unraveling fiddleheads of ferns, the tulips first up and first eaten by rabbits, the squirrels not yet chubby from picnicking on spring’s bounty and their rampant theft of seeds meant for our flying, beaked friends.I have been to Hawaii, where one can expect much the same forecast for 365 days per year: A paradise front moves in and is unlikely to leave. Every day, sun and sand, sun and sand. That’s no way to live.And it feels as though this year, despite our mild winter, that the fun cramming desperation is still with us, perhaps even more so, as though many of us suspect the worst next year. We know from past suffering that we will pay the debt owed — with interest — for our most recent winter with the next.And so when spring gives way to summer and then fall, we beat the rugs harder.Adam Overland, a writer/editor in Robbinsdale, writes about his travels and other experiences atadamoverland.com."
suffolknewsherald_2024_88,"Published 5:16 pm Tuesday, January 23, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardSo far, in 2024, there have been more than five safety threats against Suffolk Public Schools. Fortunately, all were deemed a hoax – likely a ploy to get out of class or school, but we are merely speculating on the reasoning here. Unless the perpetrator is apprehended, we have no concrete evidence of why these threats are being made.Making safety threats against a school poses severe risks, jeopardizing the well-being of students, staff, and the entire school community. Such threats can manifest through various means, including verbal expressions, written messages, or gestures. Threat assessment processes have been established to evaluate these threats within their context and determine their credibility. The consequences of making safety threats are dire and extend beyond the immediate fear instilled in the school environment.Safety threats create an environment of fear and anxiety, affecting both students and staff. The fear of potential harm can lead to emotional distress, impacting the mental well-being of those involved.Schools are meant to be safe spaces for learning and personal development. Safety threats disrupt this conducive environment, hindering the educational process and impeding the overall growth of students.Addressing safety threats requires deploying significant resources, including the involvement of teachers, administrators, counselors, law enforcement, fire and rescue personnel, and other school personnel. This diverts attention and resources away from the primary focus of education and the protection of our community.Perpetrators of safety threats can face serious legal consequences. Threat assessment and management involve prompt and efficient investigation, leading to potential legal actions against those responsible. For example, Virginia Code § 18.2-83 says,“A.Any person (i who makes and communicates to another by any means any threat to bomb, burn, destroy or in any manner damage any place of assembly, building or other structure, or any means of transportation, or (ii who communicates to another, by any means, information, knowing the same to be false, as to the existence of any peril of bombing, burning, destruction or damage to any such place of assembly, building or other structure, or any means of transportation, is guilty of a Class 5 felony, provided, however, that if such person is under 15 years of age, he is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.B.A violation of this section may be prosecuted either in the jurisdiction from which the communication was made or in the jurisdiction where the communication was received.”Furthermore, Incidents involving safety threats can tarnish the reputation of the school. The perception of a lack of safety may deter prospective students and create concerns among parents and the broader community.Making safety threats against a school not only instigates fear and anxiety but also has far-reaching consequences that extend to the overall educational environment, resource allocation, legal ramifications, and the school’s reputation – in short, it is plain old dumb. It is imperative to foster a culture of safety and open communication within schools to prevent such threats and ensure the well-being of everyone involved.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

Thankfully, several individuals and companies have announced plans to fill the void both rideshare giants will leave, but these replacement services will need help getting their operations up and running.The very first step that these companies must take is to think of a name and the right branding. After all, this will define their very identities, and advertise to potential customers the nature of the services they will be providing.This branding is perhaps more important in Minnesota than in any other state. That isn’t because the Twin Cities is home to so many advertising and marketing agencies, but because Minnesotans appreciate things that are creative, funny and, for many reasons, just weird and different. Think of the people and brands who’ve all come from this land of 10,000 lakes — SPAM, Snoopy, the Vikings, Prince, the Lakers (however that related to basketball , Betty Crocker, the Green Giant. These are all very clever and unique.So, to help these rideshare endeavors along the road to success, here are ten names and logos that will appeal to Minnesotans’ high standards and peculiar sensibilities.1. MOOberThis is an easy one to start with — just copy the original and add one of the things Minnesotans love most of all, the dairy cow. It’s also aligned with the same attitude the original started with: push the boundaries of the law and violate the spirit of the law until there are consequences. With this example, that could be trademark infringement.2. Lypht Ride ShareBut Uber isn’t alone in being vulnerable to creative copycats. The pronunciation of Lyft can also be lifted for an alternative, especially when accompanied by branding that alludes to our many lift bridges — from St. Paul to Stillwater to Duluth. And this might even be able to withstand the inevitable legal challenges (but probably not .3. LEGENDAIRY Taxi ServiceReturning to Uber’s absurdly arrogant branding and Minnesotans’ adulation of cows, LEGENDAIRY is an obvious spiritual successor. The message that this brand conveys is that both the passenger and the experience are superior to all other rivals, like the lake of the same name. And the pun obviously helps.4. SwinesotaBut it isn’t just the cow that has a special place in the heart (or stomach of many Minnesotans; it’s also the pig. Perhaps most important, this brand conveys that the cars will not be pigsties, but clean and well-kept spaces — a quality very high on any rider’s list.5. EGG’stra MileSpeaking of pigs, nothing else pairs better with bacon than eggs. And everyone would want to hire a rideshare service that goes above and beyond expectations or, rather, eggspectations.6. CORN’r Pick Up Drop OffBut Minnesota is more broadly a state with a rich agricultural heritage. As part of that heritage, a person could wager that corn is found in nearly every corner of the state. This play on a homophone would clearly signify to riders that they will be transported to the exact coordinates of their choosing. And it continues the confusing trend in tech branding to simply drop, add or change a letter in a word, like Fiverr or Lyft itself.7. WILD MinnesotaIn addition to agriculture, Minnesotans appreciate our wild places — our lakes, forests, rivers, river valleys and prairies. These are places we visit and where we recharge. Perhaps no quality is more important in a hired car than this same sense of sanctuary and safety. While the bear might scare people, the point is that the car will not.8. Loon’r Ride AlongContinuing with this theme of nature, a rideshare company would be certain to find success by pairing with the loon. This is our state bird, and it was almost on our state flag. It is on our state quarter, and a very lucky few residents of St. Paul have it on their library cards. It is as beloved as any pig or cow, and it is surprising that more local companies haven’t associated themselves with it in some way.9. Catch & Release Quick RidesMinnesotans also love fish and to fish — so much so that people do so on cold, barren, frozen lakes. Aligning this activity with a taxi company just makes sense. A rider is picked up and quickly deposited at their destination, just like they’re a magnificent sturgeon.10. ALL PLOWED STREETS CAR RIDESFishing and ice fishing bring us to Minnesota’s inevitable winter. And as the people who put away their window scrapers early this March so painfully learned, winter weather is always a threat. It will never leave anyone here safe, even in the heat and humidity of July, as the downward cycle has already begun and the days are getting shorter. That’s a depressing characterization, but it’s the reason that riders want to be assured that the car they hire will get them to their destination.This is only a partial list of the possibilities, and there are certainly many names a start-up ride share service would want to avoid. But these are all helpful ideas for good Minnesota brands, and hopefully some of these endeavors will take this advice and use it to find success for riders and drivers alike. The meter is ticking.J.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_7,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Overshadowed by the wonderings about President Joe Biden’s vigor was the actual purpose of the NATO alliance’s 75th anniversary summit in Washington last week. It marked three quarters of a century since Harry Truman hosted leaders of 10 nations from Western Europe, as well as Canada, to create a new, permanent defense pact in 1949.America had had allies before going back to the Revolutionary War, when the French came to the aid of the rebellious colonists. And there were many military partnerships in the years that followed, most extensively during World War II, when the Allies fought Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan on battlefields across the planet under the banner of the United Nations, which led to the birth of the world body. But all those groupings coalesced during wartime.The new North Atlantic Treaty Organization, was, as the National Archives put it, the “first peacetime military alliance ever concluded by the United States.” In doing so, the nation was going directly against the admonition of George Washington, who in his 1796 farewell address, wrote: “It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.”Washington, who relied on French assistance to beat the Redcoats, noted that to have a “respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.” But NATO was not to be temporary.George thought that the Atlantic Ocean would insulate the U.S. from Europe’s chaos, but as Truman said when he spoke to the assembled foreign ministers, “Twice in recent years, nations have felt the sickening blow of unprovoked aggression. Our peoples, to whom our governments are responsible, demand that these things shall not happen again.”Of the treaty they were signing: “It is a simple document, but if it had existed in 1914 and in 1939, supported by the nations who are represented here today, I believe it would have prevented the acts of aggression which led to two world wars.”Truman was an artillery officer in combat in France during World War I. A generation later, he was commander in chief when World War II ended.Half of the original 12 NATO countries — France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and Norway — had been overrun and occupied by Nazi Germany and were only liberated from the genocidal regime’s jackboot four years earlier. Britain was never conquered by Hitler and with the Americans and Canadians, brought freedom back to the Continent.Italy had overthrown their own dictator and declared war on Germany, while the last two members, Iceland and Portugal, provided valuable bases to Atlantic convoys during the war. All 12 members pledged to protect each other if attacked.When Soviet troops invaded Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, NATO could not defend them. After the Iron Curtain fell, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia joined NATO, along with others from the former East Bloc. Today the membership has grown to 32, with the accession of Sweden on March 7, which followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.NATO vows an “irreversible path” to Ukraine’s membership. When that happens, Ukraine will be protected like the rest.—New York Daily News"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_11,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°President Joe Biden, as you’ve no doubt heard, has had a rough few weeks. Yet last Tuesday, he signed a bill into law that could well prove transformative for America’s energy future. Here’s hoping — whatever happens in November’s election — that more progress lies ahead.Known as the Advance Act, the bill seeks to remedy some long-standing flaws in nuclear-energy regulation. To reach net zero, the world will need to roughly double its nuclear capacity by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency. Yet constructing new nuclear plants in the US is expensive, time-consuming and encumbered by red tape. Partly as a result, the industry has stagnated: The share of electricity generated by nuclear is projected to decline to about 12% by 2050, from about 18% today.The Advance Act should help reverse that trend. As a start, it makes useful reforms to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, allowing the agency to hire more staff, reduce licensing fees, speed application processing and ease the burden of environmental reviews. It also makes a small but consequential change to the commission’s mission, requiring it — after decades of focusing on potential threats — to also consider the vast public benefits of nuclear energy when making regulatory decisions.The bill could be especially helpful for advanced reactor designs. Small modular reactors have a lot of potential: They’re likely to be cheaper and easier to build, more flexible, and safer than traditional plants, while providing reliable energy for both electricity and industrial uses. Scores of iterations are under development. So far, though, these businesses have faced significant licensing barriers, partly because the rules were written with conventional reactors in mind. In addition to streamlining that process, the bill offers prizes for the first companies that meet specified benchmarks. Combined with tax credits contained in the Inflation Reduction Act, this should set the stage for real progress.Several other provisions could in aggregate prove significant.One would ease the conversion of retired fossil-fuel plants into nuclear facilities, which should both reduce costs and help areas that might otherwise lose out during the energy transition. Another will facilitate the export of nuclear technology to global markets, which will likely have both commercial and diplomatic benefits. Other provisions aim to boost workforce development, ease supply-chain issues and encourage safer fuels.Finally, the bill should spur development of nuclear fusion, an embryonic but potentially game-changing industry. With dozens of startups hoping to commercialize various fusion designs, the bill affirms that such reactors — which are inherently safe — won’t be subject to the full panoply of rules that governs the traditional fission industry. That should encourage investment and experimentation with an elusive but promising technology.Nuclear energy won’t solve the climate challenge, but it must play an indispensable part.That this effort passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support — building, in fact, on provisions passed during Donald Trump’s presidency — is further cause for optimism. The green transition has forced the US to confront decades of accumulated red tape, veto points and legal obstacles, which combined have made it all but impossible to build new things at a reasonable cost. At long last, change is in the air.— Bloomberg OpinionSomething incredible happened four years ago. People suddenly realized that my grocery store co-workers and I are essential. It had a lasting effect on me, but some people clearly need a reminder — especially the leaders of the conglomerates that dominate the industry.

Spring signifies a time of renewal, hope, and the promise of brighter days ahead. Yet, for many, it also carries the weight of loss, reminding us of those who are no longer with us.As we journey through life, loss becomes an inevitable companion. Whether it’s the passing of loved ones, the end of relationships or the fading of dreams, each loss leaves an indelible mark on our hearts. And as we grow older, the weight of these losses can seem to grow heavier, casting a shadow over the joyous arrival of spring.However, amidst the pain of loss, spring offers solace and the opportunity for healing. Just as nature sheds its winter coat and embraces the warmth of the sun, we too can let go of our grief and welcome the dawn of a new chapter. Spring teaches us the invaluable lesson of resilience, showing us that even in the face of loss, life continues to bloom.One of the most powerful ways to honor the memory of those we’ve lost is through remembrance. As the world around us comes to life, take a moment to reflect on the cherished moments shared with loved ones who are no longer here. Celebrate their lives through storytelling, sharing fond memories and holding onto the lessons they imparted.Yet, while remembrance is essential, so too is the act of moving forward. Spring beckons us to embrace change and to find beauty in the new beginnings that lie ahead. Just as flowers push through the earth to reach for the sky, we too can find the strength to persevere and grow, even in the face of adversity.Finding support in community and loved ones can provide a source of comfort and strength as we navigate the complexities of grief. Lean on those who offer a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on or simply a hand to hold. Together, we can find solace in shared experiences and forge connections that help us weather life’s storms.As we stand on the threshold of spring, let us embrace its message of hope and renewal. Let us remember with love those we have lost, and let their memories inspire us to live our lives with purpose and gratitude. And as we journey forward, may we find solace in the beauty of new beginnings, knowing that with each passing season, we are reminded of the precious gift of life itself.Deb Taylor is the CEO ofSenior Community Services, a Twin Cities nonprofit with a mission to empower people as they age, committed to serving compassionately, connecting communities and supporting independence."
suffolknewsherald_2024_83,"Published 4:26 pm Tuesday, February 6, 2024ByStaff ReportsThis past Saturday, I spent a few hours with a group of guys that I hunt with, clearing some brush in the woods. We were making it easier to walk to, and see from, some hunting stands. Nothing major in scope—some branch trimming here and there, mostly. It was a good postseason January day for it.Some pruners, loppers, a few chainsaws and a couple four-wheelers. Throw on the work bibs, boots and worn-in gloves. Nothing too mind-boggling, and yet satisfying work. Hard to beat for someone like me.At one point, I was pulling on a vine, the kind of vine that went way up to the top of the tree. The plan was to pull it all the way down, which I did. Unfortunately, as the vine finally broke free from the last of the branches, so did one of the branches. It hit me square on top of my head. Let’s just say that it “rang my bell” pretty loudly. I mean, it hit hard. It was about 2 inches in diameter and broke in half on my bald head with only a baseball cap.The guys who saw it immediately looked concerned and checked on me. “Are you OK?” My first response was, “I think so.” Because I had felt and heard that hit, it didn’t make sense to me that I would be OK. Turns out, though, I felt a little off the rest of the day, and only a tad bit tender on top of my head; I was no worse off than before the branch hit me. Don’t worry, I checked in with some medical professionals and followed advice.I spent the rest of the day walking to the other locations while most of the crew rode the four-wheelers. I like walking and getting to know the land better. Also, I needed some time to process, and put away, what could’ve been a much worse, even fatal, injury.I noticed that while I had to be cautious with my steps to avoid sinking in mud too deep or getting water above my boots; some of those on the ATVs were sometimes less cautious. I guess they had more faith in their power equipment than I had in the tape on my old boots. Understandably, they got stuck. Typically, I arrived at the next location on foot around the same time, or even before, some traveling by machine. Also, I arrived having enjoyed the walk and not frustrated by spinning wheels or worried about having broken parts. With the exception of my noggin, of course.I’m realizing recently how much closer to the age of 50 I am getting. I am probably well past the halfway point of life. Learning how to be comfortable with realizing that I may need to walk more carefully in some places and maybe not power through some things.There’s wisdom in taking a close look at what may fall down on my head, or others, before yanking on a mature vine. It’s smart to look ahead on your path and contemplate the next few steps before trudging ahead.I know 2024, and beyond, is going to be tricky for me. As a pastor, a friend, a neighbor, or any other relationship I have. The discussions and conversations of the coming year might have some metaphorical loose branches waiting to hurl toward my head, or some thick and deep mud awaiting a misstep.While I wish I had learned the lesson a little less painfully, I’m glad to learn from a branch that broke on my head, instead of losing a relationship that would break my heart.Tread wisely this year, my friends. While our passions and beliefs are good fuel for the soul, sometimes our mouths might be moving too quickly toward mud and injury.Past the halfway point of my life, I’m more interested in the valued relationships I have than getting stuck in “the mud.”“Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what ishelpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit thosewho listen.” – Ephesians 4:29The Rev.

minnpost_2024_42,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.When my mother and I went through my grandmother’s possessions after she died last year, we found a piece of paper. The paper was crinkled and well-worn, as if it had been folded and unfolded a hundred times. On this paper, in shaky cursive, was every procedure my grandmother had gone through since she became ill in 2005. For 18 years, she had been poked and prodded in hospitals from the Mayo Clinic to the University of Michigan, enough procedures to create a laundry list of surgeries.My grandmother had a saying that originated in her child-rearing days: “You get what you get, and you don’t pitch a fit.” In the beginning, this was the advice she gave toddlers to rein them in. In my adult life, this was the advice she gave me during challenging times. In her later years, this was the advice she gave herself as she attended her many appointments and procedures. Her life came at the cost of these appointments, and she accepted that. I never heard her complain about it — “You don’t pitch a fit.”Last spring, my grandmother died from cancer at age 84. Her illnesses had finally surpassed the capacities of modern medicine.She went into hospice when her health degraded to the point where we were unable to care for her in her home. That day, I made the commitment to visit her every single day. You need people to visit you when you’re in places like that, because a day sick and alone can make 24 hours feel like thrice that.Every day, I traveled an hour and a half with my toddler and mother to see my grandmother in hospice. Have you ever tried to keep a two-year-old quiet in a hospice facility? We got side eyes from the staff who disapproved of this choice to bring my daughter. I had to bring her, because her name is Verity Doris, named after my grandmother Doris. And Verity Doris had only recently met Grandmother Doris, because COVID had kept us away since Verity’s birth.Verity is named after Doris because of Doris’s enormous heart for children. More than anything, Doris loved children. The matriarch, she had a hand in raising more than two dozen members of our family. If you were ever looking for Doris, you’d find her with the children. This is why Verity shares her name, and why Verity needed to spend this brief, but treasured, time with Doris.Doris spent 30 days in hospice before drawing her last breath after her body had — very slowly — completely shut down. She spent nearly two weeks in “the end,” and I watched this “end” unfold every single day. Every day was more painful than the last, for Doris and loved ones who witnessed her slow disappearance from life.She inexorably lost the elements of life that allowed her to live with dignity. “Comfort measures” were unable to keep her physically or psychologically comfortable. Through most of this time, she was completely lucid, and completely aware of what was happening to her body.For the last weeks of her life, she consistently expressed her wish to die. “Every night when I go to sleep,” she told me, “I pray that I won’t wake up.” Doris lost the capacity to live her life with dignity.Her body disintegrated while her mind remained, and this combination resulted in torment and agony — for her and for those who loved her.Would she have taken medication to expedite her exit from this world? I never asked and I don’t know. Would I take it? I also don’t know. I’m not dying and I can’t make decisions about that inevitability until I am there.The End-of-Life Options Act (HF1930/SF1813 moving through the Minnesota Legislature would allow terminally ill patients with stories similar to my grandmother’s, with less than six months to live, the opportunity to choose when the elements of life — as they define them — are gone. It gives people the choice to self-administer medication to end their suffering. It allows people to have autonomy over their bodies, a universal human right according to the United Nations.There are protections against misuse — two physicians must confirm the terminal diagnosis, and the patient must be deemed mentally competent by both physicians. This excludes patients with Alzheimer’s, or patients with any form of cognitive impairment. Worldwide, there are 300 million people who can access Medical Aid in Dying (MAID . In the US, there are 74 million people who have this option. In the ten states plus Washington, D.C., that have MAID laws, there have been zero instances of coercion or abuse of this procedure. Zero.We can’t assume what we would do, or what someone else should or should not do, at the end of their lives. After all, as my grandmother Doris said, “You get what you get.” We won’t know what we get until the end.Rachel Hall Beecroft is the communications director for World Without Genocide at Mitchell Hamline School of Law.

eugeneweekly_2024_27,"We ve got issues. We need to have a serious conversation about when life begins. It is a question that has very serious consequences for public policy. Chief Justice Tom Parker of the Alabama Supreme Court made it perfectly clear that the premise of the court’s recent decision regarding frozen embryos was based on religious doctrine, writing, “Even before birth, all human beings bear the image of God.” Parker devoted eight pages of his opinion to Christian scripture and authors without a hint of recognition of differing religious viewpoints. Note, people living in Biblical times did not think of conception the way we do. The genealogies of Jesus seldom mention mothers. Why? Aside from the patriarchal standards of the time, the assumption was that women were the fertile ground in which men planted their seed and hence children were descended from “the loins” of their fathers. Thus the author of Hebrews would claim that Levi “was still in the loins of his ancestors” generations before he was born. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. Those like Parker like to claim that this country is founded on “Judeo-Christian” principles. I would note first that most Jews I know wish we would remove “Judeo” from that claim as they want nothing to do with most of the principles being so claimed. If the principles regarding conception were in fact inherited by Christianity from the Jewish tradition, then one would expect that Jewish tradition would show some evidence of treating the “unborn child” as a full human being with all associated rights. It does not. To the contrary, an injury that caused the loss of a fetus is not regarded as manslaughter in Hebrew scripture but as the loss of property (Exodus 21:22-25 . What is abundantly clear in that scriptural tradition is that life is associated with the breath of God. The creation tradition, Parker cites, couldn’t be clearer when the first human being “became a living being,” namely, when God “breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” (Genesis 2:7 . It is most telling that the Chief Justice did not cite this particular verse of the creation tradition for he surely knows that it at least calls into question the whole notion of life beginning at conception if not undermining it altogether. It is my most sincerely held religious belief that we are, as Parker also affirms, created in the image of God. And if we know anything about the created order, creation does not happen in a single moment, but through a creative process. Even if we take the Biblical story of creation as a literal account, which it surely is not, it is still a process over many days. Psalm 139:13-15 has this beautiful image of our evolution in the womb: “You knit me together in my mother’s womb… intricately woven in the depths of the earth.” I love that image of God knitting us into being, much the way my wife knit a baby blanket for our first grandchild, every stitch made with love. I suspect many on the left are reluctant to make a case for life beginning at birth instead of conception because they also understand that human pregnancy, whether at one month or nine, involves something fundamentally more than a fertilized egg. Upholding the sanctity of life, however, does not require that we be forced to choose between binary options. The beginning of life is truly something equally miraculous and mysterious. We should not shy from affirming the life at each stage of development from zygote (the fertilized egg to a fully developed fetus. At each and every one of those moments life is beginning and therefore should be regarded with utmost care and respect. But the blanket is not complete until the last stitch has been cast off and taken from the knitting needle. So I argue for the beginning of life as a process rather than an event, a process which does not end until the child is born. It is at that point, and only at that point, that what began months prior has now become a full human being, filled with the breath of life. I fully expect U.S. laws to be neutral on religious doctrine. They should not promote any particular religious belief. That is why we have the First Amendment. The ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court is not only a threat to reproductive health — promoting one religious interpretation over another — it is a threat to religious freedom."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_46,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°The good news is that business interests are getting support during an election year. The bad news is that the business is crypto. Less than two years after the industry’s highest-profile political donor was exposed as a criminal, the lure of campaign donations from the digital-money crowd is once again proving irresistible.Last time, Sam Bankman-Fried lavished cash on candidates in hopes of laxer regulations (before he ended up in federal prison on fraud charges . This time, crypto advocates are raising some millions to oppose unfriendly politicians. That’s led some candidates to abandon common sense in pursuit of cash.Although the industry is good at grabbing headlines, the stakes aren’t especially high. Not even the most skeptical U.S. politicians are proposing to ban Bitcoin and other such currencies, as China and about 20 other countries have done. Instead, the debate has mostly focused on whether digital tokens should be regulated like other types of investment products. (They should be. President Joe Biden’s administration has done a good job limiting the risks that crypto poses, including by taking legal action against several companies and individuals — Bankman-Fried among them — for violations of money-laundering requirements and securities laws. So far Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t said whether her own approach would differ from Biden’s, but she’s under pressure to adopt a more lenient position. A policy adviser indicated this week that she wants to help the industry.Her opponents have thrown caution to the wind. Former President Donald Trump rattled off a series of promises when he spoke to the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. They included: appointing a council of “people who love your industry” to write crypto regulations; firing Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman (and crypto skeptic Gary Gensler; banning the Federal Reserve from creating its own digital currency; establishing a strategic Bitcoin stockpile; and commuting the prison sentence of Ross Ulbricht, convicted in 2015 for creating a crypto marketplace for illegal goods. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent, has gone even further: Calling Bitcoin “the currency of hope,” he has pledged to direct the U.S. Treasury to invest hundreds of billions in crypto.It’s hard to square this kind of thing with the broader national interest. In the 15 or so years since Bitcoin was invented, digital tokens have proved to be of essentially no practical value. Just 1% of Americans say they used them for a payment or money transfer last year. More often crypto is used to move money outside of government oversight. That’s helpful for criminals, terrorists and anyone under sanctions. But these are hardly the constituencies that a presidential candidate should be soliciting. Nor should policymakers be encouraging people to park their savings in digital wallets instead of stocks, bonds and other assets that support the real economy.Instead, candidates should promise to work with Congress and regulators to ensure that the rules applied to cryptocurrencies are consistent with existing laws on fraud, money laundering and sanctions enforcement. If the technology is as innovative and useful as its advocates assert, then playing by the rules shouldn’t be a problem. No amount of campaign cash should lead candidates to think otherwise.— Bloomberg OpinionA new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round."
leoweekly_2024_21,"Just after the onset of the pandemic, my friends, a married couple with two young children, put their Indianapolis house on the market, threw all their stuff on a utility truck, and moved to British Columbia. Forever. I admire them. They left behind successful careers, family, friends, and all the roots that one lays down by age 40 or so for the sake of their kids, who are thriving. In their school, they go hiking by the mountains every day. They are immersed in the French language. And they don’t do active shooter drills. Why would they? That’s an American thing.The adjustment has been harder on the adults, as it always is. One of them was born in Canada, so it’s a little easier for her. The American half, however, is a trial lawyer from New York who landed in Trump country a few years back. “There’s not enough fighting,” he says. “Not enough conflict. Everyone’s too nice. It’s fine, I guess.”I, too, am used to constant trauma and stupidity as a way of life, and so I find the dispatches from my Canadian friends almost offensively charming. They describe a sanitized, Bizarro America, a Norman Rockwell painting drenched in maple syrup, an idealized version of human group life that only ever existed in the fever dreams of our upper-middle-class liberals. Democratic Socialists are in a dead heat for parliamentary seats against Liberals, with Greens not too far behind. Conservatives would never dare suggest getting rid of universal healthcare, which now includespharmaceuticalsandbirth control. People are able to livewithout the use of moneyat all. The big policy debate in my friend’s new hometown is what to do with the unhoused population — set them up in abandoned hotels, or build something nicer for them? The most violent thing that ever happens is that occasionally anorca will snag a stray moosefrom the beach.In this setting, a twenty-first century American is like a rabid bull on methamphetamines in a shopping-mall Swarovski. We don’t know how to comport ourselves in the face of all this empathy, civility, and decency. An example: my friend caught a couple of neighbor kids shooting off fireworks too close to his house, and they wouldn’t stop after being asked. So he did what any of us Indiana folk would do: he went out with a chef’s knife and told them to FUCKING CUT IT OUT or ELSE you GODDAMN little MOTHERFUCKERS. The Mountie from down the street came and knocked on my friend’s door. “Hey, uh, is everything alright? Kids said you had a knife out…? Oh, gosh. We don’t do that here, okay? You folks have a good night!”A society this nice is bound to tip over and catch fire at some point, especially when its nearest neighbor is on a constant cocaine-whiskey bender. Nearly thirty years ago, my friend says, his eighth-grade science teacher told a class full of American kids that the U.S. would someday invade Canada. That sounded preposterous at the time — hell, it might have sounded a little nutty even a decade ago. But now it seems inevitable.Think of the civilizations that kept to themselves but were nonetheless gobbled up by Alexander, or the Romans, the Ottomans, the Aztecs, or whoever. The Portuguese, British, Spanish, and Dutch traveled entire oceans to steal the resources of people who posed no threat and didn’t see it coming. Why wouldn’t America do the same to its nearest neighbor? Our long list of prior offenses strongly suggest that we will.Even if we assume that we’ve diluted enough of our barbarian DNA over the last century to resist the biological impulse to conquer, some basic resource math hints at impending annexation.Conservative luminaries, the kind who used to make policy for the U.S., have known for a while that we will have to do something about our water shortage. What’s the easiest “something” to do?Take it from Canada. I amnotthefirsttopointthisout, and I guarantee I won’t be the last.The Reaganites might have whispered about this sort of thing, and eventually come up with a deal to quietly enrich some billionaire ghouls by diverting water from a few Canadian communities. But that sort of political maneuvering distorts when cast through the lens of QAnon-paranoiac conservatism. Amoral capitalism doesn’t sound as nice a moral conquest for the “liberation” of Canada, and that’s what the turds who pass for right-wing intellectual soothsayers are saying out loud now. Lauren Boebertsaidtwo years ago that Canada “needed to be liberated.” Around the same time, Candace Owens got her required megadose of attention for the week bytweeting“Send American troops to Canada to deal with the tyrannical reign of Justin Trudeau Castro.” Most recently, Kremlin toady Tucker Carlsonannouncedthat “we are coming to liberate Canada.”Like it or not, these dunderheadsarethe true forecasters of political winds in America. The stupid shit they say today becomes the GOP platform in just a few short years, and eventually on-the-ground reality. It is now theofficial positionof the Idaho Republican party that Canadian Marxists are crossing the border to somehow vote in American elections, and Trump himself has called Canada a nation of “left-wing fascists.” Thus, the supposed takeover of Canada (by, uh, Fidel Castro? I guess? becomes the flimsiest version of aGulf of Tonkin incidentin recent memory, but still enough to justify a righteous occupation of the entirety of the Great White North (which, coincidentally, is rich in natural resources .World history in a sentence: a bunch of idiot hegemons, brains callused by normalized violence, displace docile, peaceful people upon some sham reasoning or no reasoning at all. And so it must be with the U.S. and Canada. Apologies to my friends, but when you headed north, you played yourselves. We* are coming for you. We will eat your caribou. We will turn your Tim Hortonses into gun shops. We will cut down all your trees to make way for billboards. We will convert your syrup into soft drinks and vape cartridges. And we will do it in the name of freedom — or whatever we want.*When I say “we” I don’t meanme.If the U.S. actually invades, MAGA types will have long since run the academics and anarchists out, or put us in camps, or dropped us out of helicopters.*** ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_167,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Last week, the White House unveiled new rules to more quickly reach asylum denials for people considered national security and public safety threats, something of a prelude for more expansive expected restrictions.Ultimately, this policy will have limited impact, and it’s sure not to satisfy anyone, neither the hawks calling on President Joe Biden to more fully adopt his predecessor’s extreme stance, nor the advocates who have been disappointed by the president’s refusal to fully step back from the Trump-era dynamics. Whatever the outcome, it should not be a system run through the whims of the current executive. Congress, having tried and failed to pass a limited border bill earlier this year, seems content to abdicate this responsibility, only to be pulled out as an electoral cudgel, never to be fixed.Meanwhile we’re squandering time and talent, as businesses clamor for labor and innovation and migrants find their way to costly city shelters as opposed to being integrated into the economy and reversing population declines in towns and cities across the country. The can gets kicked down further, and everyone loses.The most damaging thing is the persistent myth that this has to be all or nothing. Either we have some sort of immoral and illegal absolute border closure, abandoning our principles and obligations to the people so aptly described by the Statue of Liberty, or we have no process, no restrictions, no standards. This belief is both wrong and incredibly persistent, poisoning the dialogue and standing in the way of meaningful reform, which all parties claim to want.We do not have to remake the wheel. The bipartisan border deal that collapsed in Congress in February had had a lot not to like, including the reinstatement of a version of the always misguided Title 42 restriction. However, there were worthwhile elements that should be resuscitated, notably an effort to take many new asylum claims out of the slow and confrontational setting of the immigration courts and place them in an internal agency process, where trained government personnel would evaluate the applications like they already do for countless other immigration matters.Applicants would either quickly get approvals or quickly get denials, which could then be appealed to another panel of experts. Faster resolutions help everyone: those who qualify for protections can receive them expeditiously, giving them runway to begin their new lines in the United States without the unstable limbo of drawn-out removal proceedings. Those who do not aren’t left to start building lives here only to, in a year or two, have the rug pulled out from under them.There are real questions to be hammered out around how to speed things up without infringing on due process, and there are structural obstacles like a widespread shortage of attorneys who can take on these often complicated cases. These considerations must be taken into account in order for us to avoid the worst-case scenario of sending people back to danger.But these are not insurmountable obstacles, certainly not for a nation with the resources, breadth and ingenuity of the United States — the very qualities that many immigrants are both seeking and have contributed to. In all but giving up, Congress shows they have less grit than the immigrants they’re failing.—New York Daily News/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

philinquirer_2024_79,"At Lakeside School in North Wales, the focus is on healing students trauma. More schools should follow their example.Three and a half years ago, Sebastian Fink-Locke was having a hard time. As a ninth grader at North Penn High School, he was misbehaving to the point where his school said he would no longer be allowed to attend.He was told he had to go to an “alternative” school — Lakeside School in North Wales, Pa., roughly a dozen miles north of Philadelphia. He had no idea how different his experience would be.Lakeside operates from a premise that is deceptively simple, but rare in education circles: every student sent there is dealing with something heavy, which is affecting their behavior and ability to learn. To break that cycle, the school centers its curriculum around how trauma affects the developing brain, and helping students process unresolved feelings.So when Fink-Locke would act out, he wasn’t handed a detention; he was given afinger pulse oximeter, which measures your heart rate. He was told to use it, and figure out ways to get his heart rate down. There were many options — he could do some deep breathing, play with a fidget toy, or leave the classroom (yes, even in the middle of a lesson for a cardio break, to ride an exercise bike or walk an outdoor track. And once he had calmed himself down, he could meet with his counselor to talk about what was behind his behavior, and how to handle those feelings differently next time.At first, “I hated it,” Fink-Locke told me.But over time, something clicked.He started following the program. His behavior softened. He began focusing on his schoolwork. He spent a lot of time at the school’s greenhouse, learning tolandscape the campus’ 40 acres, as well as selling flowers and offering landscaping services to the public.I spoke to Fink-Locke last month on a beautiful spring day in the school’s greenhouse, surrounded by a sea of flower starter trays and the woodsy aroma of mulch. He’s about to graduate, and has enrolled in the Army. Afterward, he wants to get into farming, inspired by his time at the greenhouse. “This school definitely helped me put my life on a very good path,” he told me.For Fink-Locke, Lakeside’s distinctive approach to the challenge of educating students with disciplinary problems worked.As I walked around Lakeside, I saw what Fink-Locke was talking about. I watched students who were once too disruptive to remain in traditional classrooms walk the halls of Lakeside at a normal pace, speak to each other at a normal volume, and direct their attention to their teachers. Yes, some were standing, or rocking, or wrapping themselves in a weighted blanket. But to my eyes, they were learning.Leaving Lakeside, I had one thought: They’re on to something here.As adults, we like to tell ourselves that kids are resilient. That may be true — but only to a point.Lakeside’s executive vice president,Kathy Van Horn, decided to revamp the school’s curriculum roughly 10 years ago after noticing over the course of her 40 years at the school that most of the students transferred there had experienced some type of trauma. According to school officials, one quarter of Lakeside students have a history of abuse or neglect, nearly one-half are (or have families that are struggling with drugs or alcohol, and more than 40% have a history of depression or suicide attempts. Some have experiences with homelessness, have been in foster care, or have a parent who is incarcerated.It makes sense that many of the students who are struggling most at school are having problems at home. But let’s get real: What young person you know isn’t dealing with some type of stress or trauma right now?This is especially true in a place like Philadelphia, where children areshot and killed nearly every other week, creating aseemingly constant cycle of trauma and grief. More thanhalf of the city’s school-aged children are in poverty, living withconstant worryabout access to basic needs like food, shelter, and electricity.But almost every child deals with something heavy at some point — maybe their parents split up, a sibling got sick, or abeloved grandparent died from COVID-19. Call it stress, call it adversity, call it trauma — most kids have feelings they don’t know how to process, which get expressed in all sorts of ways.With so many children in Philadelphia dealing with so much hardship, it should come as little surprise thatmost public school studentsdon’t meet state standards in math, science, and reading. That’s because research shows children who have experienced trauma or some other heavy stress aremore likely to struggle to learn, get lower grades, or exhibit behavior problems that get them suspended or expelled.I realize there are many explanations for why so many students in Philadelphia are falling behind,including decades of underfunding, massive social disparities, andproblems with standardized testing.But there’s one explanation that doesn’t get nearly enough attention and resources at most of our schools: student stress and trauma.Most schools can’t afford what Lakeside offers: a roughly 3:1 ratio of students to staff (all trained to handle trauma , therapy dogs that greet students when they arrive in the building, counselors for everyone, an outdoor track, and a pool. Even thetrauma-informed workshops, training, and coachingthe school provides is probably out of reach of many districts.But many of the tools Lakeside uses to help students soothe their stressed brains, such as the pulse oximeters (less than $20 each , are affordable. And perhaps the most important aspect — the understanding of how childhood stress affects the brain, and how stress/trauma can interfere with learning — is free.The walls of Lakeside are lined with poster-sized diagrams of the human brain, with different sections highlighted in different colors. Here, students learn that acting out is often an expression of a brain that’s been exposed to stress or trauma, which then overreacts to a trigger. To a non-traumatized brain, losing a favorite writing utensil or getting a side-eye from a classmate is annoying, but to people with unresolved trauma or stress, that can lead to an explosion of feelings and behavior.Using the pulse oximeters, students learn to figure out what helps them slow down their heart rates (a proxy for stress . For some, it’s the primal tools that often work for babies, such as rocking, swinging, swaddling, or deep breathing; others may benefit more from physical movements, big and small — walking, cardio, doodling, or gardening. Classrooms include rocking chairs, standing desks, and weighted blankets. Piped into every space is the faint sound of instrumental music at exactly 60 beats per minute, which research suggests canlower heart rate and blood pressure.Once the school added these tools, Van Horn told me she noticed a difference right away. There were fewer student fights; traditional schools who accepted students back after a stint at Lakeside noticed other improvements.After a few months at Lakeside, Fink-Locke learned that when he starts to feel agitated, he needs to remove himself from the situation — maybe take a loop around the outdoor walking track, or go to the sensory room, a staffed room for students to cool down that includes fidgets, hammocks, and an exercise bike. “If I get frustrated, I take a 10-minute cardio break, then go back to class.”For Jimmy Galeana-Bruno, now 20, who went to Lakeside in 2019 from Wissahickon School District due to issues with his grades and behavior (skipping class, for instance , it was the pulse oximeters that made the difference. “That was a really good way to just kind of acknowledge to myself that, you know, I am really agitated at the moment.” When his pulse rose, he’d ask to take a walk. Eventually, “I stopped wanting to engage in activities like misbehaving.”Galeana-Bruno has since graduated and now works as a landscaper (but hopes to start welding , and told me he still employs some of the tools he learned at Lakeside when he feels agitated. “Passing through Lakeside helped me a lot.”According to data I got from Lakeside from the 2022-2023 school year, students’ GPA increased by an average of 0.26 from what they received at traditional schools (Fink-Locke told me he’s now trying for As and Bs . And 76% of Lakeside seniors graduated — notable, because most thought they would never earn a diploma. What’s more, 90% of the parents and guardians of students said they believed Lakeside was helping their child deal better with problems.(That doesn’t mean Lakeside is a problem-free utopia. During my visits to the campus, I watched students file into the “resolve room,” where they go for help from counselors when their usual calming tools aren’t working. During my first conversation with Van Horn, we were interrupted by a PA announcement for all staff to come to the parking lot; a van transporting students had a behavior incident and needed some help. There aren’t many schools like Lakeside, Van Horn told me, even though it has conducted trainingknown as NeuroLogicat other schools in our region and throughout the U.S. (and in other countries as well . Even if other schools have implemented other tools to help kids deal with trauma, “I do not know of any schools who are doing things to the extent that we are,” she said.Unfortunately, too many schools don’t understand how the traumatized brain works, and use outdated thinking to manage kids and their feelings,Sandra Bloom, associate professor of health management and policy at Drexel University, told me.That includes not letting kids take physical activity breaks (or cutting recess to only minutes per day , and punishing kids for not sitting still, said Bloom, who isnow working with Lakesideto manage the online training she provides to organizations to help them become more trauma-informed.But research shows that letting kids fidget — play with a fidget toy, doodle on their papers, or click a pen, for instance — canhelp them focus and learn. And giving them “brain breaks” — where they can dance, go outside for a few minutes, or just be silly —boosts blood flow to the brainand learning.“I think it’s wonderful what they’re doing, and I just wish it would become universal education,” said Bloom.Jayme Banks, the deputy chief of prevention, intervention and trauma for the Philadelphia School District, has visited Lakeside, and told me she thought it was “wonderful,” but that there is no one way all schools should look. “I think we have to have variety, because our kids are all different.”She estimated that Lakeside has conducted training in roughly 50 to 60 district schools, and 25 to 30 schools have taken part in the more detailed NeuroLogic training.Philadelphia school officials are also trying to adopt some of the same tools Lakeside uses, such as creating calming corners, or swapping some traditional desks with flexible seating that enables students to move around. Her office also works with other departments in the district to help teachers identify their and their students’ triggers, and incident responses that work best for each child. “Maybe Johnny needs a walk,” she said.Not all schools are doing this work.That said, not all schools are doing this work, Banks noted — in some, a few teachers have really embraced it, but there are likely only a “handful” of schools that are integrating trauma healing system-wide. For teachers and administrators who already feel stretched thin by the basic tasks of teaching reading and writing, Banks reminds them that healing from trauma is part of that, too. “Johnny will never be able to read if we do not incorporate all of this,” she said.Crystal Edwards, principal of William D. Kelley School in North Philadelphia, told me that she agreed that just about every student in our city has something heavy on their minds. “We’re talking about all students, at all schools, being affected by some type of trauma,” she said, which “distracts from the learning that they need to be able to do inside of their school.”Her school is one of three working with Temple’sPhiladelphia Healthy and Safe Schools (PHaSeS programto help teachers address their own traumas, and do the same for their students — by, for instance, journaling, drawing, using fidgets, or counting their breaths. She told me she “definitely” believes it’s helping her students’ academics, because “it allows teachers to be able to do their job: to teach.”To Edwards, programs like this should be used across the district. “Every school needs it.”"
eugeneweekly_2024_31,"We ve got issues. As an oppressed person, it’s hard to write this. I think of how my oppression is so socialized and normalized by everyone and everything within our society. Even within our own community we practice the tools our oppressor used against us to justify who is better or best. Nowadays, the KKK isn’t as easy to name as other terrorist cells around the world. Whentheydecided to maintain systems that were designed to exclude Black and Brown people, and especially Black and Brown women, by proxy of patriarchal practices and those deep beliefs hammered in by modern religion. When they said, “Take off the robes, and hide in plain sight,” they upped the game. They didn’t hide in hospitals to try to “make plans of attack” on Black people alone. They maintained their practices and process of oppression through indoctrinated ignorance and holding tightly to power. What is the best way to maintain power of an entire system? Well, maintain access to every necessity needed to live a daily existence. Be their (the oppressed teachers, their bankers, their physicians, their “friendly” neighborhood police officers, their newscasters, their grocer. Give them no other choice but to assimilate to two options in order to eat, to be sheltered, to maintain education and personal growth. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. You have this, or that. There is no in between, and within that choice, you will only succeed so far, and if you do succeed you still will be considered lesser than because of “what you represent.” Now, when we pinpoint the oppression it is easily gaslit because how could “everything be racist?”; although our collective experience is evident. History tells us the narrative is held by the powerful, and their narrative given to us is that our value is inherently less because of “what we represent.” What we represent is also a narrative that was given to us to help justify their oppressive practices and their unhinged hatred. The narrative all along has been one sided and incomplete. Just like the fight for freedom and equity for Black and Brown people — the reason for the oppression and the need for freedom is only heard from those who hold systemic power, to maintain that power. So you know it is a lie. From a Black perspective, collectively, since the end of the institution called slavery technically ended, should we avenge our ancestors, and somehow fight back in ways that would obliviate the oppressive community’s complete existence? Alas, we cannot, and we — collectively — have not. We never gained the power to do so, we are still actively and consistently held “in our place.” I don’t agree with violence as an answer to violence, but I get it. To be an anti racist, past pain has to be the reason you do not behave or condone the same behavior that caused that same pain to continue. I am a cycle breaker. It is not convenient, it is a lived commitment in all that I do. As a human who lives a life of an oppressed person, the most balanced approach to life for my spirit is to be anti oppression and to insist on the freedom of every person on this globe. I am anti racist."

Those familiar with this disease know that it makes a normal life extremely difficult to manage. Although the Black community is disproportionately impacted by SCD, it remains a blood disease that can affect any person of any race. In fact, in Minnesota, all babies born are automatically tested for SCD in hopes of detecting it sooner to begin early treatments.While there have been some drugs and treatments available to help manage the disorder, it remains a consuming part of everyday life for those living with it. Between the medications, pain management, doctor visits, and expenses, it can be overwhelming. With the emergence of a cure through an FDA-approved cell-based gene therapy, those living with SCD could save thousands of dollars and be spared years of pain and hardship.But with any new treatment, there are high costs associated with it and each patient will require varying degrees of an in-patient treatment plan. With the legislative session coming to an end, we need lawmakers to address this new therapy to ensure that everyone has fair and equal access to this life-changing treatment.Those living with SCD will have to patiently wait to see if the state Legislature will allow for additional funding to cover excess costs required for cell-based gene therapy to potentially cure SCD for people living with the disease here in Minnesota. These funds would provide necessary cost coverage for those who undergo this treatment. With any novel treatment, there are many variables linked to the cost. This includes the length of treatment required, the in-patient stay, the specialty doctors needed on-site during the treatment, and continued monitoring before, during, and after.Therefore, we must make sure that there is adequate funding set aside that will not create barriers for those seeking to change their life today through this treatment option. If our state allocates the necessary resources, it will send a powerful message that every Minnesotan, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, deserves access to quality healthcare. In doing so, we can continue to prove our commitment to equitable health care.I have personally witnessed the pain and resilience of relatives and friends living with this disease. Any delay in their ability to regain a normal life due to recklessness or partisan divide at the Legislature would be profoundly unfair. They deserve the opportunity to begin their journey towards reclaiming their lives after SCD.Recently, the Minnesota Senate included the funding to cure SCD in its initial budget. But this funding must remain in the budget as the House and the Senate negotiate and vote in the coming weeks. This is one of those times when the parties can come together on an issue that we can all agree on and change the lives of thousands of people who are suffering daily from SCD. As cell-based gene therapies uncover new treatments for other diseases, we can lay the foundation and set the precedent to make future treatments and cures accessible without any restrictive delays.Andrea Jenkins represents Ward 8 on the Minneapolis City Council."
minnpost_2024_54,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Joe Biden’s exit from the presidential race transformed the 2024 election from anintragenerational battle between him and former President Donald Trump to anintergenerational campaign between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump.The key to Harris’ electoral college victory is adeptly playing this intergenerational game across five or six swing states where the election will come down to what 150,000 to 200,000 voters will do. While Harris needs to motivate voters across several generations, she especially needs Millennials and Gen Z.Harris’ decision to select Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice-president indicates that she understands this generational contest, selecting a candidate potentially appealing across generations, but especially to an emerging Millennial and Gen Z voting bloc.The presidential race is now a new campaign reset along many dimensions, including a generational contest between Trump and Harris. What we know is that across the five generations voting this November — the Silents, Baby Boomers, GenXers, Millennials and GenZers — there are profound policy preference differences, with the latter two generations being far more liberal on a range of issues including reproductive rights, voting rights, immigration, LGBTQ+ issues, gun regulation and many other social issues.We also know that, in general, the Republican and Democratic Parties are divided along many dimensions, there being a generational split with more Silents and Boomers favoring the former and Gen Xers, the Millennials and GenZers favoring the Democrats. But while Biden was a candidate, he was unable to motivate these generational voters — especially in the six or so swing states that will decide the election.Harris’ choice of Walz challenges conventional wisdom of picking a political moderate in a swing state. Her selection of Walz — a liberal from Minnesota — suggests her campaign is going fully progressive, seeking to motivate these new generations. It sets up a contrast to Trump, whose selection of Sen. JD Vance sets up a clear liberal/conservative and generational voting divide. Both presidential candidates and parties are playing generational base politics.Harris may be better positioned to play this generational politics than Trump, but the simple fact is that generational ascendency and descendancy are factors in this election.This election features the last gasp of the Silent Generation in terms of its influence in American politics. Beginning in 2020, the Baby Boomers no longer were the largest generational voting bloc in America, and are now being eclipsed by the Millennials and Gen Zers, who in 2020 made up 37% of the voting bloc. Now they’re nearly 40%. The voters and constituencies Trump is appealing to are literally dying out while Harris supporters are coming of age. However, the Trump supporters have thus far been more motivated to vote, and they still constitute a major bloc of voters.The Millennials and Gen Z view the two major parties as two stores with two different menus. They are not completely sold on either the Democratic or Republican Parties and would like to see more mixing of the different items on the policy menus. This again suggests appealing to them by emphasizing themes of unity and cross-party policy. They are generally liberal on most social issues, more centrist on fiscal issues. They remain worried about college education affordability, health care affordability and buying a home, as well as crime, the environment and guns.The key to this election is both generating communications that appeal to specific generations, as well as cross-generational themes. Each generation looks to different media for its sources of information, and successful campaigns need to use those media to target them with different symbols and themes based on defining events in their life that help them to continue to frame their perspective on the world. Generational politics is real. But it is real in the context that perhaps five or six swing states will decide this presidential election.Demographics are not destiny. Demographics portend possibilities. Candidates need to understand how campaigns, themes, symbols and messages matter in motivating voters across generations. The key to the upcoming presidential election is understanding the intersection of generational and swing-state politics and how Harris needs to move 150,000 to 200,000 voters into voting for her.David Schultz is a distinguished professor of political science at Hamline University. His most recent books are Presidential Swing States and Generational Politics in the United States."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_171,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°It probably escaped your attention, but the Internal Revenue Service recently piloted a program to help Americans cope with their notoriously complex tax system. Direct File was meant to help taxpayers in 12 states prepare and submit their returns electronically. Some 19 million people were eligible to use it. Thanks partly to a rollout late in the tax-preparation season, fewer than 1% of them actually did.The IRS was pleased with the results nonetheless: Taxpayers who used the system said they liked it, according to a survey, and the idea all along was to “start small, make sure it works and then build from there.” Fine. So what about next steps? “No decision has been made about the future of Direct File at this time,” the agency says.Dull as the topic of tax administration might seem, it demands far more ambition and urgency. Each year Americans spend roughly two billion hours and more than $30 billion on personal tax-preparation fees. This compliance burden falls disproportionately on the less well-off. The system’s complexity also means that credits often go unclaimed; again, in relative terms, the lower-paid suffer the biggest losses. At the top of the income scale, in contrast, complications yield loopholes — and every loophole dictates higher taxes for the rest. A working Direct File system would be a start, but it’s the least of what’s required to disentangle the mess Congress has created. Next year, legislators will have to think about tax reform as changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire. They should use the moment to simplify the system and follow the example of many other advanced economies: Spare taxpayers the need to fill out any return at all.Two complementary strategies would make this feasible.First, go one better than Direct File by tasking the IRS to pre-populate the main tax form for most taxpayers. The agency already has much, and in many cases all, of the information it needs. According to one recent study, roughly 70 million returns — upward of 40% of the total — could be accurately pre-filled.Second, simplify the code. This is desirable in its own right, because endless accretion of complexities is self-defeating. (Each new incentive or accommodation confounds the others. In addition, a simpler code would allow more comprehensive use of pre-filled returns. A recent report from the Brookings Institution suggests some options. To be sure, even the least ambitious of these ideas is radical by contemporary standards. It would repeal itemized deductions, preferential rates for capital gains and dividends, head-of-household filing status and the alternative minimum tax, and replace existing personal credits with refundable ones of $1,000 for each family member and a work-related credit that phases out as income rises.A tall order, politically speaking — yet consider the benefits. By design, it would be both revenue-neutral and fairer than the current code. It would also be vastly easier for the IRS to administer and for taxpayers to understand and endure. With such a system, pre-populated returns could be standard practice.As it stands, the US system delights the tax-prep industry but imposes enormous avoidable costs on the country’s citizens. It’s abysmal by international standards and violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.—Bloomberg /TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Record-setting University of Hawaii quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy finalist Colt Brennan has died, his father Terry Brennan told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser.Fumie Christine Cabral, 96, of Hilo died Aug. 26 at a private care home in Hilo.

(Matt Winkelmeyer/BoF/Getty Images/TNS About a year and a half ago, it occurred to me that if I didn’t start working out again, I’d be sliding into a sloppy, flabby late middle age.I had always been a runner. For more than 30 years, my workout partner and I ran regularly along the oceanfront, from Venice to Santa Monica. Rain or shine, through pregnancies, child-rearing, PTAs, marital conflict and all the things that Zorba the Greek once described as “the full catastrophe,” we talked as we ran, becoming each other’s best therapist.And then, sometime before the COVID-19 pandemic, my partner discovered a hot new form of exercise. Our running life as we knew it was basically over as I effectively became a pickleball widow.In 2020, when the pandemic forced us inside, I pretty much stopped running.Around the same time, my left knee began to ache and swell. I was certain it was a result of my rambunctious golden retriever smashing into my legs. But no, said the doctor, it was arthritis. (Me? So young? She referred me to physical therapy. The physical therapy office never returned my calls.Desperate (and chubby , I decided to try Pilates. Why? Because all the women streaming in and out of the nearby Pilates studio had the kind of bodies I dreamed of having. And my knee was killing me.My first, 45-minute Pilates class was a disaster. I was lost when the instructor called out the various positions — dancing bear, French twist, reverse kneeling crunch. I sat on the Megaformer machine, panting and feeling defeated.“Why don’t you try a few private classes until you get the hang of it?” the studio owner suggested after I complained that she didn’t offer classes for rank beginners like me.Over the course of the next year, I spent enough money on private lessons to buy a used car. In fact, I was spending so much that I was actually relieved when my cherished instructor told me she was moving to Amsterdam.With trepidation, I began taking group classes again. This time, it was different. I knew what to do (mostly and could keep up (mostly .“Booty, booty, booty,” my class instructor, DeNae D’Auria, calls out as we, on all fours, donkey kick with a bungee cord over one foot to increase resistance.“We don’t talk about pelvic floor stability enough,” says D’Auria, who is trained in Lagree, which expands on the core concepts of Pilates but is more intense.“Love to see those shaky shakes,” she says, our muscles trembling as we do squats, lunges and planks enough to fill a lumber yard. “Remember to slow down and breathe. The secret is time under tension.”I first encountered a Pilates machine almost 25 years ago at the home of the iconic hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, whom I was profiling for The Times. It seemed eccentric, but he looked fantastic for a man of 71.Pilates classes are dominated by women, but the exercise was used to treat wounded and disabled soldiers soon after it was developed by Joseph Pilates, a German bodybuilder and gymnast who was interned by the British on the Isle of Man during World War I. He improvised the first versions of his famous machines by attaching bed springs to headboards and footboards to create resistance.He called his system of exercise “Contrology,” focusing on breathing, the postural muscles of the back and the abdominal muscles we think of as the “core.”After decades as a “little-known form of exercise with a devout but small following that included dancers, singers, circus performers and actors,” Pilates exploded in the mid- to late 1990s, according to the authors of the 2011 book “Pilates Anatomy.” Celebrities such as Madonna and Uma Thurman touted its benefits.“It suddenly started appearing in Hollywood movies and television commercials, in cartoons and comedy shows, and on late-night television,” wrote Rael Isacowitz and Karen Clippinger. “It became synonymous with going to Starbucks and indulging in a low-fat triple-shot soy latte (no whipped cream, please! .”The Pilates Foundation estimates that some 12 million people worldwide practice the exercise regimen. That’s a tiny fraction of the estimated 300 million or so who practice yoga.“Scientific research does support an array of impressive health benefits for Pilates,” the New York Times reported in 2022. “Studies suggest it may help to improve muscle endurance and flexibility, reduce chronic pain and lessen anxiety and depression.”Pilates’ place in popular culture was solidified in April, when “Saturday Night Live” took it on in a sketch that mocked the love-hate relationship it inspires in practitioners.“Pilates,” says a deep-voiced narrator. “From the creator of ‘Saw X’ and the marketing director for Alo comes a chilling new look at girl horror.”For people like me who came of age during the insane era of high-impact aerobics — thanks for the sciatica, Jane Fonda! — the low-impact nature of Pilates is appealing.I usually do four 45-minute classes a week. I wouldn’t say I look like those lithe young women who surround me there — most are so young that I could be their mother — but a taut core has developed beneath my midriff bulge.Oh, and that awful knee pain? It’s been gone for months.The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of Hawaii.A 71-year-old Hilo man pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree negligent homicide for the Oct. 3, 2023, traffic collision death of a 79-year-old Hilo woman.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_258,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Politics aside, Americans are united on some of the basic things their government should do better: Make sure air travel is safe, simplify the process for filing tax returns, streamline applications for student loans.At the same time, many are frustrated by the blizzard of new federal rules that rain down on them each year, which hit a record 4,429 in 2021.That looks set to change. A pair of Supreme Court decisions this year will make it easier to challenge both new and old regulations. With their rulemaking powers clipped, perhaps federal workers should be free to focus more on basic execution. That could be a boon for taxpayers and for Americans’ trust in government. But Congress needs to help.It should go without saying that elected leaders need to prioritize effective administration. Yet agencies tend to get more attention for their policy proposals than for the quality of their implementation or customer service — at least until there’s some kind of blunder. The leaders of the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., for example, were rarely asked about the attentiveness of their bank supervisors and examiners until several banks collapsed last year and emergency rescue measures were needed.With millions of employees to manage, the federal government is always going to make mistakes. But minimizing them is crucial. Research shows that negative experiences with the bureaucracy corrode Americans’ trust in government much more than positive experiences improve it. So addressing basic problems can make a real difference in how people view their government.As a start, Congress needs to ensure that agency leaders have the flexibility to hire competent workers. A recent effort to focus on skills, rather than credentials, in government hiring is on the right track. More programs like the US Digital Service and the 18F office — which act as in-house consultancies for the executive branch and recruit private-sector workers with needed skills for temporary tours in government — should also be under consideration. .Technology should also be part of the answer. In recent years, the executive branch has been cautiously introducing artificial intelligence systems. Research suggests that, in time, these could have pronounced benefits. One study estimated that aggressive AI investment could free up as much as 30% of federal staffers’ time.Ultimately, responsibility will fall to Congress to write laws with less ambiguity and clearer directions for regulators. To meet that challenge, more and better legislative staff will be crucial. Restoring the Office of Technology Assessment, a team of experts that provided Congress with technical research from 1972 until it was defunded in the mid-’90s, would help lawmakers understand new challenges and weigh their options for addressing them. So would more investment in the Government Accountability Office’s science, technology assessment and analytics team.Americans disagree on many things. But a civil service that competently serves their interests shouldn’t be controversial. Congress should see these court rulings as the opportunity that they are.— Bloomberg Opinion"
minnpost_2024_128,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Children with autism and disabilities sometimes wander away from their homes, outings or school. These incidents are known as eloping. Children may elope because of executive functioning differences that cause a lack of impulse control, a difference in social skills that makes them not understand “stranger danger,” or because they become overwhelmed by sensory input, creating a fight or flight reaction. If a child is non-speaking, they may have a hard time communicating that they need help when they elope. All of these issues make elopement particularly dangerous for children with autism and disabilities. Here are eight strategies to help keep your child safe.1.Take note of elopement triggersMany children with autism have sensory processing differences, which can make sensory input from loud noises, bright lights and crowds overwhelming. A child who is overwhelmed may shut down as a result of too much stimuli; others may run to calm down. Children who find running calming are going to be an elopement risk.If your child tends to elope, notice what is happening in their environment prior to those episodes. Ask your child if there is something they find particularly overwhelming in your home. Then, work with your child to modify that environment, or offer sensory regulation tools that work for them. If your child just loves to run, plan regular outings to the gym, visit a nearby school’s track or create an obstacle course in your backyard.2.Teach your child their contact informationTeach your child their address, your phone number and how to dial 9-1-1. Give children who are non-speaking an identification bracelet with their name and your contact information. Look foridentification bracelets designed for young children, which are hard to remove, made of fabric and can alert people about autism or other medical information. Children with autism may not like the feel of traditional ID bracelets and may try to remove them.3.Install alarms on your doors and windowsConsider installingdoor or window alarmsthat signal when a door or window is opened. This might stop your child, or at least alert you that your child is trying to leave the house. Another idea is to put an image of a stop sign by windows and doors as a visual reminder to your child that they shouldn’t elope. Sometimes, causing them to slow down and think about what they’re doing can make a big difference. While window locks or keypad locks might seem like a good idea, before installing, reach out to your local fire department to ensure these are safe in the event of an emergency.4.Consider getting your child a smartwatchIf your child is prone to elopement, having a smartwatch with GPS capability can help you find them if they wander off. You can also text or call with many smartwatches, which can help you quickly contact your child if you get separated. If your child is reading but nonspeaking, texting provides a quick means of communication. You could also attach an AirTag to your child’s keys or place an AirTag bracelet on a regular watch band.5.Befriend your neighborsIf your child often tries to elope, get to know your neighbors. Introduce yourself and explain that your child has autism or a disability and is prone to eloping. Introduce your child to neighbors so they know what your child looks like, and your child understands that your neighbors are safe people.6.Get your child swimming lessonsChildren with autism are often drawn to water, which is dangerous without supervision. Teaching your child how to swim is another safety precaution. Kids with autism and disabilities may need swimming lessons adapted specifically to their unique needs. Local companies, like Swim Possible, “provide safe, calming, and fun lessons that are customized for students who need a personalized approach — adapted to their needs for learning how to swim.” Here are a few other organizations which offer swimming lessons to people with autism and disabilities:​Clownfish Swim ClubMr. Blake’s Swim AcademySwim 4 Life Swimming Schools7.Teach your child what to do instead of elopingInstead of focusing on what not to do — don’t run away — make sure your child has positive options for dealing with sensory issues. Teach them to use their preferred communication system — words, pictures or a speech-generating device — to ask someone to stop. Or teach them to say, “I don’t like that” if something is distressing to them. Identify a predetermined safe space so your child can take a break from stimulation that’s feeling overwhelming. You can also give your child a coping tool like noise-reducing headphones or a strategy like deep breathing to help them self-regulate. Role-playing these options when your child is calm will help them know what to do when they encounter something upsetting.8.Plan strategies for community activitiesAttending community events can be particularly challenging for children with autism and disabilities, particularly if your child often elopes. Before you attend, read as much information about the event as possible and plan how long you’ll stay. Some venues and events have “Know Before You Go” information, letting you know what to expect and where to find accessibility accommodations. You can also work with your clinical team — which may include an occupational therapist, speech therapist or family therapist — to create an individualized plan that helps your child navigate community activities and events safely. Your plan might include bringing helpful sensory tools like noise-canceling headphones, fidgets and weighted items. You could also create a rotating schedule with your partner, children and other family members to ensure your child always has a buddy.“Promoting safety awareness in children with autism and disabilities is essential,” says Gina Brady, Fraser Sensory Supports and Training Manager. “It empowers them to navigate their environment confidently while minimizing risks, thereby enhancing overall quality of life for the whole family.”Gina Brady is the sensory supports and training program manager atFraser, a Minneapolis organization that provides healthcare and inclusion services for people with autism, mental health issues and disabilities."
philinquirer_2024_80,"In Philadelphia, people in wealthy areas live 18 years longer than those in poorer areas. Community care can close that gap.There’s a lot to love about Philadelphia — our culture, people, and sports. However, there are times when it’s hard to fully appreciate all the city has to offer knowing it is ranked as one of theworst in the country for health outcomes.For instance, compared to other large cities, Philadelphia has higher rates of premature death (including among children , diabetes, HIV, and frequent mental and physical problems.Those Philadelphians who are most impacted by our city’s health disparities are Black men, women, and children who don’t have the privilege of living in communities that have adequate access to quality health care — this, despite making upclose to half of the city’s population. The result is appalling: the average life expectancy in most Black and Latino areas such as Nicetown/Tioga is18 years shorterthan in majority-white areas such as Center City.We suspect that at least part of the explanation for that wide range in lifespan between neighborhoods is that Black Philadelphians aremore than twice as likelyas their white counterparts to be hospitalized for conditions that could be prevented with primary care. That doesn’t mean that Black Philadelphians don’t prioritize their health; in fact, when we engage in the Black community, it’s clear to us that the opposite is true. They just have less access to it.» READ MORE:Don’t use Colin Powell’s death to bolster anti-vaccine sentiments | OpinionIn Philadelphia, neighborhoods with more Black residents havefewer or no accessible health care centers or providerswho can offer screenings, vaccinations, and thorough education, prevention, and treatment for conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and maternal health conditions, with both patience and empathy.These disparities come at a tremendous cost to our economy and — most importantly — to the many Black children and adults in Philadelphia. We deserve better.To bridge the health-care gap and create positive health outcomes, quality care must be more accessible. But these neighborhoods need more than just health clinics — these centers mustprovide care that is culturally sensitiveand integrated into our city’s Black communities. Because trust starts from within communities, a place of comfort and familiarity that we must place at the heart of care delivery. With many hospitals and academic institutions not reflective of our community, these localized centers are a crucial bridge.Notably, last year, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health released itsfive-year plan for addressing Health and Racial Equity. A key tenet of this plan is community engagement.How can we effectively engage and mobilize a community-based approach? To create an enduring solution that actually serves Philadelphia’s residents of color, the city must develop a three-pronged approach.First, to build on the department’s plan, we must identify the specific health resource gaps a community is facing. This requires an integrated and intentional strategy that brings together multiple stakeholders, including health-care providers and community members and organizations.For instance, North Philly’sCenter for Health Equity, which was founded by one of us (Ala Stanford , isin the heart of the community— near a high school, a church, and residential housing. What’s more, most providers look like the patients they serve and provide holistic, compassionate care regardless of their ability to pay. In addition, they have implemented a model of care that encourages involvement from all community members: educators, coaches, and faith leaders assist residents of all ages with scheduling and obtaining preventive care, working side by side with nurses and doctors.While not in Philadelphia, there are similar efforts underway in other regions such asMary’s Center, which has served 65,000 people in the Washington metro area for 35 years. The center integrates health care, education, and social services to offer individualized care.Second, we must invest inbuilding a more diverse health-care workforceinclusive of community members and local leaders. We should focus our efforts on recruiting, training, and upskilling these individuals who often have an intimate understanding of the community’s distinctive needs and challenges and have earned residents’ trust. Furthermore, Black and Brown patients are more apt to articulate their health-care challenges and follow medical advice when receiving care from a provider who looks like them.We are partnering with universities, hospitals, and health-care organizations to increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their talent pipeline and workforce, promote culturally conscious care, and help support innovative health-care solutions that aim to improve health outcomes for communities of color. Such strategic partnerships can be implemented at the community level and are key to cultivating inclusive and accessible health-care solutions for Black Philadelphians.Third, entities like the one where one of us (Howard Reid works, Johnson & Johnson, must continue to invest in all community-based health care providers and organizations. As the burden of diseases continues to rise and more people leverage their local resources, long-term investments will increase the permanence of community-based organizations and ensure Black residents have access to proper health care regardless of where they live.The support must come from everyone who loves the city as much as we do, including local officials, health-care companies, benefactors, and community members who live within and outside of the impacted communities. We all have a role to play.Everyone deserves the right to accessible, compassionate, and high-quality health care. It’s time that we take steps to widely implement long-term solutions for historically marginalized communities.Ala Stanford is a pediatric surgeon, founder of Black Doctors Consortium, former presidential appointee regional director, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and author of “Take Care of Them Like My Own: Faith, Fortitude, and a Surgeon’s Fight for Health Justice,” forthcoming in August 2024.

As mayor of Hawaii County, I take these concerns very seriously and appreciate our community’s engagement in seeking solutions to enhance safety and security in our public spaces.First and foremost, the security of our public facilities, including parks and pools, is a top priority for our administration. The incidents of vandalism and other unacceptable activities at Kawamoto pool are deeply troubling, and addressing these issues is a kuleana all of us bear.Our administration has taken proactive steps to directly address the immediate concerns at Kawamoto pool and other aquatic facilities and prevent future occurrences. This includes installing camera systems at Kawamoto, Kona Community Aquatic Center and Pahoa pools. These systems, which we are procuring, are not just a deterrent but also a reassurance that we are committed to your safety and the security of our public spaces.In fact, over the past three years, we have significantly increased our investment in security islandwide. Our coverage has expanded from seven to 17 park facilities, with a budget allocation of $2,652,018. This expansion is necessary to ensure that our community spaces are safe and welcoming for everyone.Beyond security, we are focused on improving the overall safety of our facilities. This includes increased fumigation and pest-control budgets — from $68,800 to $369,392 — and comprehensive tree-trimming and roof repairs.By addressing long-standing maintenance issues, we are making our parks and community centers safer, more accessible and enjoyable for all residents, including those with disabilities.In all, we have taken our parks’ maintenance and repair budget from $450,000 in 2020 to over $6 million this fiscal year, underscoring our continued dedication to maintaining and enhancing our community spaces.While physical enhancements like security, maintenance and repair play a critical role in the safety and longevity of our parks, community involvement is equally important. Our community facilities belong to all of us, and we must work together to protect and preserve them.This is why we ask you to stay vigilant and partner with us in reporting and discouraging inappropriate behaviors in our public spaces. The safety and security of our community facilities cannot be the responsibility of the government alone; it must be a communitywide priority.Together, with continued investment and cooperative efforts, we can ensure that places like Kawamoto pool remain safe and inviting for everyone.Thank you for your attention and commitment to our community’s collective kuleana!Mitch Roth is mayor of Hawaii County.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

philinquirer_2024_38,"I m highly skeptical of the Philadelphia Reparations Task Force.As the nation approaches what’s arguably its second Independence Day, Juneteenth, I can’t help but ponder the wrongheaded way weoften think about reparations.This year will mark the 159th anniversary of June 19, 1865, when thousands of enslaved African Americans found out — 900 days after the Emancipation Proclamation took effect — that they had been legally freed under federal law. Even before that day, the nation has been gripped by the debate over reparations, or how to compensate enslaved Black Americans and their descendants forthe nation’s original sin.As an African American man who was born, raised, and has lived his entire life in our city, I greeted thenews about the Philadelphia Reparations Task Forcewith great skepticism. Much of the media coverage about reparations focuses on “slavery’s lingering impact on the Black community.”But I have a serious problem with those who use a system that was dismantled almost 200 years ago to paint the picture of my people as victims who are so weak-willed, so traumatized, and so haunted “by the peculiar institution” that we can’t make headway in American society.We are not victims, we are victors — and I take issue with anyone, male, female, Democrat or Republican, who tries to make us see ourselves otherwise.In Philadelphia, one can definitely make the argument that racism has caused great harm to the city’s Black community. Mass incarceration, redlining, and educational apartheid are all problems that — despite all of the various programs supposedly targeting those ills — remain pervasive.» READ MORE:It’s no easier for Black Philadelphians to become homeowners now than it was 30 years agoBut let’s look at what thePhiladelphia Reparations Task Forceintends to do regarding reparations, and how it proposes to do it.The task force identifies those eligible for reparations as “Black and African American descendants of enslaved Africans in the United States, the descendants of Black and Negro and Colored Americans since 1865, and the descendants of American Freedmen emancipated from slavery, and may include identified ‘Blacks’ and ‘African Americans’ of mixed race or heritage so long as one of their native born American parents is a due member of the descendant group.”As towho would pay reparationsto the descendant group, here’s where it gets complicated. Reparations, the task force says, should come from “the churches, universities, units of government, families and family estates, and businesses who were enslavers, pillagers, ravagers, and thieves of land and property.”Frankly, each of those entities that directly benefited from slavery pre-emancipation may no longer exist or have died out. Those surviving family estates, businesses, and universities might not have the financial means to pay reparations in an amount that would change much for our people.And while we’re talking about families and their estates, let’s not excludefree Black Americans who enslaved their own people. And what about the African tribes who were also part of the slave trade? Shouldn’t they chip some funds into the reparations pot?If we keep peeling this onion, things could get messy.Let’s look at what is realistic that would have a significant and positive impact on Black Philadelphia’s economic future.So let’s look at what is realistic, and what would have a significant and positive impact on Black Philadelphia’s economic future and help dramatically reduce violent crime.Last year, Gov. Josh Shapirosigned an executive orderdirecting up to $400 million in federal dollars over five years to reimburse organizations that train new infrastructure workers on the job. The money is coming from $19 billion in federal funds from two federal programs for infrastructure projects.According to reports, “organizations doing infrastructure work — such as repairing roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes and expanding high-speed internet — could receive up to $40,000 for each new worker they train. A maximum of $400,000 could be reimbursed through the program, which will be managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.” (Those of us who know our history may be struck by the number 40 in that figure — reminiscent of the “40 acres and a mule” emancipated African Americans were supposed to have been given by the federal government, but never received. I say let’s focus those training efforts on Black citizens returning from incarceration and others who may have committed low-level offenses in the criminal justice system. Let’s help this cohort — who aredisproportionately represented in the systemand often denied the opportunity to gain meaningful work — a chance to learn how to do these infrastructure jobs. These are the kinds of jobs that sustain families and put things like buying a home within reach. This approach, and other initiatives like it, would have a bigger and more lasting impact on Black Philadelphians than direct reparations payments.As African Americans, we can’t disregard the power of our votes, and that means demanding the Democratic Party live up to its commitments to our community. So many Philadelphia ills can be traced to decades of what’s essentially been one-party rule. The Democrats havetaken our support for grantedfor far too long and given back far too little in return.Six months into her tenure, Mayor Cherelle L. Parker seems to have her mind and heart in the right place. Let’s see if those progressive elected officials who talk about racial justice put the money where all the talk is.

suffolknewsherald_2024_95,"Published 6:43 pm Tuesday, January 9, 2024ByStaff ReportsByDrew VarnerAt the dawn of the 20th century, America is flourishing globally as an independent nation, rapidly advancing due to the Second Industrial Revolution. Meanwhile, oligarchs have thrived from the First Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe, particularly in the UK. Yet, their dominance was being challenged by regional powers, and America, the emerging power, stepped onto the side stage in the initial phase of the Great War. America’s fate in the 20th century was sealed when the nation, torn between isolationism and interventionism, was swayed by the British to defend their cause.The declining British Empire recognized the need to reshape the political and cultural influence surrounding America’s pride in its 1776 independence. It aimed to establish an Anglo-American presence on American soil, influencing the United States’ foreign policy towards Europe. Consequently, Cecil Rhodes, an Oxford figurehead and English colonialist, founded the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford University. His intention was to recapture the minds of American statesmen and “reintegrate the USA as an integral part of the British Empire,” as outlined in his 1877 will. Rhodes bequeathed his wills and amassed fortunes to select members of his Rhodes Society, a group whose key members and objectives were chronicled by Dr. Carrol Quigley in ‘The Anglo-American Establishment.’America experienced cultural and political infiltration by the British Empire. According to Harvard scholar Dr. Quigley, elite individuals were dispatched by the Rhodes Society after completing their Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford. They established themselves in American politics, business, and academia. According to Quigley, a notable figure among them was Frank Aydelotte, an influential American Rhodes Scholar and society member. Aydelotte, pivotal in opening the American mindset to British perspectives, championed globalism centered on British superiority post-WWII. His tenure as a Rhodes Scholar from 1905-1907 marked the beginning, but not the end, of such influential figures. Subsequent generations have seen key Rhodes Scholars occupy significant positions in American government. Recent examples include President Bill Clinton, Ashton Carter (Secretary of Defense under President Bush Jr. , Susan Rice (National Security Advisor to President Obama , Charles O’Brien (National Security Advisor under President Trump , and Jake Sullivan (current National Security Advisor to President Biden , indicating a discernible pattern.Rhodes Scholars, dating back to the early 20th century, have heavily influenced American politics, advocating ideals such as interventionism, globalism, and rejecting national sovereignty in favor of the United Nations. These institutionalized beliefs, which led to the World Wars, are steering us toward another global conflict in the same region. America must reconsider its historical stance, opting for isolationism to safeguard its homeland. Independent combat journalist and former Green Beret, Michael Yon reports on the clandestine support and funding of Chinese and Hezbollah camps in Panama. Given the ongoing border crisis, American national security should prioritize South and Central America rather than the agendas of these Rhodes Scholars and their European engagements.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

minnpost_2024_97,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.We’re disturbed by the speech former President Donald Trump gave last week, telling a gathering of Christians that they would not need to vote ever again if they elect him.Given the context of any of Trump’s rambling speeches, it’s easy to see how people fit this into the story that Trump is out to attack American democracy, fitting as the comment does with a number of other narratives about “being a dictator” and taking over other parts of the government via the Heritage Foundation’s 2025 plan.Trump made the remarks at a Turning Point USA rally July 26, telling the Christian group, “In four years, you won’t have to vote again.”This obviously strikes at the very heart of American democracy, but Trump seems to have not grasped the meaning of his own words as he becomes more delusional at public rallies. At a St. Cloud rally, he went on about President Joe Biden’s flaws and then acknowledged he wasn’t running against Biden.But the rejection of the need to vote seems even more puzzling and bizarre. Now, even Democrats such as former Biden administration press secretary Kate Bedingfield explained that Trump was saying they didn’t have to vote because in four years he would no longer be on the ticket, no matter what.“I realize this will earn me the ire of many Dems, but … I don’t think that here he’s saying there will be no more elections. I think he is saying I won’t be on the ticket either way, so who cares,” she said. “Which is hideously damning in its own right, ‘cause this is what the Republican Party has turned itself inside out and shredded its credibility for — to become a stan account for this one awful, narcissistic guy,” Bedingfield wrote on social media.Others, like Trump critic and columnist Bill Kristol, echoed that sentiment.But neither Trump nor his spokespeople seemed too interested in clarifying and did not appear to respond to press inquiries. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, said on CNN that Trump was obviously “making a joke.”Bedingfield also clarified that she still considers Trump an existential threat.“I am not suggesting Trump isn’t a threat to democracy or that he hasn’t said and done despicable things — like Jan 6, like saying he’d be a dictator on day one — he has and it is unacceptable and appalling,” she said.The outrageous statement strategy is one Trump has used before, effectively diverting media attention to himself and away from the issues.The not-voting screed follows a long line of other Trump implausible, if not outrageous, statements, including plans to have the biggest deportation program ever and saying he has nothing to do with the Heritage Foundation 2025 blueprint, among other Trumpisms.The episode offers another reason that Trump has difficulties with either reality or communication. Either is a drawback for a job as leader of the free world."
minnpost_2024_78,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.A remark by Ogidi-born Prof. Chinua Achebe that “until the lions have their own historians, the history of the hunt will always glorify the hunter” is reminiscent of the inspiration behind Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson’s work.Woodson, referred to as the “father of Black history,” was born in 1875 in New Canton, Virginia. After working as a sharecropper and miner to support his parents and siblings, he moved on to receive bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Chicago. He obtained a Ph.D. in history from Harvard University in 1912, becoming only the second Black American to do so after W.E.B. DuBois, also from Harvard University in 1895.Woodson “witnessed how black people were underrepresented in the books and conversations that shaped the study of American history.” James Baldwin, the renowned Black American author and journalist, captured the frustration that must have led to Woodson’s crusade to instigate research and studies involving Black educators and scholars to unearth and bring to the fore the immense contributions of Black Americans to American experience, history, and nation building. Writing about the shortcomings of his education in 1964, Baldwin narrated his experience at school thus: “I began to be bugged by the teaching of American history because it seemed that that history had been taught without cognizance of my presence.”In 1915, 50 years after the 13th Amendment abolished slavery, Woodson and the Rev. Jesse E. Moorland — a well-read Black American clergy and leader — co-founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH , later renamed the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH . The association’s purpose was to promote studying black history as a discipline and celebrate the accomplishments of Black Americans and other peoples of African descent. Moorland was a member of Phi Alpha Fraternity, an organization that vigorously promoted the study of Black American History, and was publishing a regular column in the Fraternity’s official Sphinx Magazine prior to the inception of Negro History Week in 1926.In 1916, Woodson reportedly singlehandedly launched the Journal of Negro History, where he and other researchers brought attention to the achievements of Black Americans. For additional message outlets, Woodson turned to his fraternity, Omega Psi Phi, “which created Negro History and Literature Week in 1924.” However, it was during Woodson’s tenure as the President of ASNLH that he gave a press release in February 1926 announcing the inception of the first Negro History Week, intentionally designating the second week of February for that purpose.The second week in February contained the birthdays of both President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, “two prominent men whose historic achievements African Americans already celebrated. President Lincoln’s birthday was Feb. 12, and Douglass, born into slavery, did not know his actual birthday but had celebrated the occasion on Feb. 14: Valentine’s Day. (February was Dr. Woodson’s choice and not anyone else picking the shortest month of the year out of prejudice . Woodson envisioned extending the timeframe for the study of Black history beyond one week, but he died suddenly from a heart attack in 1950, ten years after Moorland’s death in 1940, also of heart attack. That milestone shift to a month-long Black History Month came to fruition in 1976 when ASALH made the official proclamation.Since this change, every United States President has issued a proclamation honoring the spirit of Black History Month, including the first African American 44thPresident of the United States, Barack Obama. President Gerald Ford put the presidential seal of approval of the change with a proclamation the same year, remarking that the celebration enabled people to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”In his first Black History Month proclamation, President Ronald Reagan remarked that “understanding the history of Black Americans is a key to understanding the strength of our nation.” In proclaiming February 2016 as National African American History Month in the 40thyear of its inception, President Obama enjoined us all to “reflect on the sacrifices and contributions made by generations of African Americans, and … resolve to continue our march toward a day when every person knows the unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”Proclaiming February 2022 National Black History Month, President Joseph Biden Jr. recalled American experience as reason “why it is essential that we take time to celebrate the immeasurable contributions of Black Americans, honor the legacies and achievements of generations past, reckon with the centuries of injustice, and confirm those injustices that still fester today.”The celebration is right and just!Anthony Akubue is a resident of St. Cloud, Minnesota."

minnpost_2024_104,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.A recent commentarypieceby Chris Knopf, executive director of Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness, has spread misinformation about the state of labor and mineral mining here in Minnesota. In his column, Knopf claimed that a vote at the Minnesota DFL convention that had the backing of “labor giants” like the AFL-CIO is actually Big Labor working in cahoots with mining companies related to the stalled NewRange Copper Nickel project.With a party convention vote to support hearings on copper-nickel mining that ended up passing, Knopf seems to believe that the political establishment is somehow bowing to big business.However, the reality is that continued delays to projects like NewRange only hold Minnesota back, both economically and in terms of the clean energy transition to achieve net-zero environmental goals. Continuing to stifle projects such as this will have a direct impact on jobs in rural Minnesota and make any hope of an energy transition in our state more costly, difficult, and needlessly pushed years into the future. With the increasing global, federal, and state demand for clean energy and technology, critical mineral mining is more imperative than ever.The Biden administration has touted $17.5 million ininvestmentsfor critical mineral projects nationwide to recycle coal byproducts that contain rare earth minerals needed for everything from solar panels to computers to electric vehicles. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has even been supportive of critical mineral expansion going back to 2013,saying“m any of the industries that drive our economy and keep us safe rely on these minerals.”TheMinnesota Minerals Coordinating Committeefurther reported that the Duluth Complex is one of the great copper-nickel deposits in the world, with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources estimating the identified copper-nickel resource of the area at about 4.4 billion tons averaging 0.66% copper and 0.2% nickel. The Superior Province in the northwestern third of the state is also part of the incredibly mineral-rich Canadian Shield, providing even greater mining benefits for our state.NewRange Copper Nickel itself haspledged$100 million in water treatment infrastructure, along with removing “more than 1,500 tons of existing sulfate … from the St. Louis River system annually.” It has also planned to recycle 19,000 tons of steel, pursue a negative carbon footprint, and set aside $75 million for proper site closure and reclamation.In addition to the environmental and economic benefits, NewRangeestimatesthat such mining can produce enough copper for 1.4 terawatts of wind capacity, palladium to supply 38 million catalytic converters further reducing air pollution, and nickel resources to help build over 20 million electric vehicles.NewRange also estimates that projects like this will create hundreds of well-paying jobs, fueling local and rural economies in Minnesota. NewRange alonepromisesto create over 360 full-time jobs and 700 during peak construction. It also plans to invest $170 million initially and responsibly develop these resources with over $1 billion for future economic growth for St. Louis County. Projects like these take advantage of Minnesota’s natural resources while providing tangible economic benefits for rural Minnesotans, reviving key communities outside major cities.Unfortunately, what Knopf is really advocating for are unnecessary increased permitting costs and delays that continue to plague mining and infrastructure projects nationwide. TheAmerican Clean Power Associationestimates that permitting delays and needless red tape is costing our nation $100 billion of lost investment, 150,000 lost American jobs, and 550 million metric tons of additional carbon emissions this decade alone. Unnecessary investigations into such projects will only prolong the energy transition, make it more expensive, and create greater harm to our environment.The truth of projects such as NewRange must come to light. These projects are a win-win for our clean energy transition, the economy and rural Minnesotans. With such widespread demand for critical minerals to accelerate our energy ambitions, getting these projects online should be a no-brainer. However, unwanted calls for delay persist here in Minnesota to the detriment of our state government and our citizens. It’s time for projects like NewRange to be part of the environmental conversation to move us forward, not a boogeyman needlessly holding us back.Mark Ourada is a former member of the Minnesota Senate who represented Sherburne and Wright Counties from 1995 to 2005, serving on the Commerce & Utilities, Jobs, Energy, and Community Development Committees."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_274,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Although the U.S. and its allies agreed recently to put Ukraine on an “irreversible path” to NATO membership, there’s no avoiding the obvious: A Trump presidency could well render such pledges meaningless.Former President Donald Trump has threatened to hollow out U.S. support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization — even if Congress puts up some legal hurdles to pulling out entirely — while his running mate, Senator JD Vance, has been a prominent opponent of aid to Ukraine.The alliance’s future, not to mention Ukraine’s, is therefore uncertain. That makes it all the more important that NATO’s European allies move beyond vague pledges and bridge metaphors. They need to act decisively to ensure Ukraine can still defend itself.Europe seems to be waking up to the challenge. Defense spending among European NATO members and Canada is up by 18% this year, with 23 of 32 members now meeting the group’s requirement of 2% of GDP. (Poland spends more than 4% on defense. The allies approved €40 billion a year of financial assistance for Ukraine and agreed to offer more training and military support, something the U.S. had been providing successfully but which risks disruption under Trump. Yet all this is still catch-up work after many years of neglect; a sizable gap remains. Measures taken to reinforce NATO’s eastern flank and boost the number of troops at high readiness were commendable but insufficient to defend the Baltic nations if they came under attack.Indeed, if Russia wound up its war in Ukraine sometime in 2025, analysts reckon it would take all of two years for Russian President Vladimir Putin to rebuild forces and stockpiles sufficient to pose a serious threat to Europe. NATO’s new commitment merely extends current levels of assistance for Ukraine; it’s less than half the amount that Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg argued for.The alliance’s most important pledge at its last meeting — to expand defense-industrial capacity — was as vague as its promise to Ukraine. That won’t do. Europe’s unduly fragmented defense industry hampers both its support for Ukraine and its own capabilities. While procurement has long been considered a national responsibility, E.U. states need to look hard at the price of such inefficiency and underinvestment. E.U.-level efforts to procure ammunition show what’s possible when cooperation wins out over narrow national interests.Allies can also do more to hamper Russia’s own defense-industrial capabilities, which rely heavily on sourcing machine tools, spare parts, software, microelectronics and other essential dual-use supplies from NATO countries as well as Taiwan, South Korea and elsewhere. Shutting down the holding companies and fronts that are funneling these supplies is painstaking but essential work.Ukraine is belatedly receiving additional ammunition, air defenses and fighter planes, though supplies remain too stretched to match battlefield needs in most cases. Putin’s bet (supported by North Korea, China and Iran is that a distracted, disengaged and more China-focused U.S. will lack the will or the means to deliver decisive support to Kyiv, ultimately allowing Russia to dictate the terms of a truce. Should his bet pay off, NATO’s own future credibility looks far less certain than its recent celebrations suggest.— Bloomberg Opinion"

The team should honor the crucial role immigrants play in its success.Nine years ago, I moved to Philadelphia from France. I had always loved the U.S., its culture and history, so when I got a job in sales, I jumped at the opportunity.I loved so much about Philadelphia right away — including, of course,the food. (I believe it is thebest food city in the nation, thanks, in part, to thediversity of the culinary scene. But other aspects of the place took a bit longer for me to embrace. One was baseball.I was raised playing soccer and watching soccer and always thought baseball was boring. I know many people — including Americans — who agree.But as I’ve watched the Phillies over the years, I’ve gotten hooked. And I see so many other immigrants who love baseball as much as I do, including many who play for the team. Nine of the team’s 26 players, or nearly one-third of the roster, wereborn outside the U.S.For this reason, and many others, Citizens Bank Park should add an Immigrant Heritage Night every year.» READ MORE:How a Phillies game connected a bunch of strangers (and started an epic group text chain | OpinionThis month is the perfect opportunity, asJune is Immigrant Heritage Month. Every year, the city of Philadelphia’s Office of Immigrant Affairs asks for submissions fromevents that promote immigrants, their cultures, and what they contribute to our great city. It’s an important time for me, as an immigrant myself, because I spent most of my career in Philadelphia working with immigrants.Immigrants have become an increasingly important part of Philadelphia. Today, people born outside the U.S.make up nearly 16% of the city’s population, the largest proportion since the 1940s, and we are driving Philly’sgrowth in jobs and population. If anything, Philadelphia needsmore immigrantsto fill open jobs and pay taxes to boost our city’s revenue and economy.Ensuring that immigrants are recognized, valued, and respected has been part of my journey in the U.S., and this is why this is personal to me.Over the years, baseball — specifically, the Phillies — has become personal to me, too.For years, baseball was one aspect of American culture I just didn’t get. To me, it looked like a bunch of overpaid dudes standing around, waiting for a ball to fall from the sky into their gloves. Then, during the 2022 season, when the Philliesmade the playoffs (and the World Series! after a long stretch of bad years, my wife’s American family forced me to watch all the games. They went all in, waving towels at home in front of the TV, and talking constantly about the team. I figured, if I was going to get into it, I might as well get into it.I bought theBaseball Field Guideto start understanding the rules. And my mind was blown.I had no idea how much control the pitcher must exert, trying to put the ball exactly where he wants in the tiny rectangle of the strike zone so that the ball is hit in a certain way. There are so many different types of pitches to choose from, and all of the details of the sport — including the data and statistics gathered every game — made it feel different from any other. Plus,this team feels special, like theygenuinely like each other; they’re easy to root for.Last season, I watched probably 150 out of the 162 games they played, and I don’t expect this year to be any different. (Especiallygiven their current streak. I consider myself a die-hard fan, and I spend more money than I should on Phillies gear.More than the sport, what I love is its diversity. There’sno other major sport in the U.S.that has a higher proportion of immigrants playing the game at the highest levels. According to the MLB,264 players — nearly 28% of the league — are foreign-born. Nearly 20 countries are represented. (Still no French players, but I can be patient. More than the sport, what I love is its diversity.Both of last year’s MVPs —Ronald Acuña Jr. and Shohei Ohtani— are immigrants. Ranger Suárez, who is from Venezuela,just made history as the first Phillies pitcher to go 9-0in his first nine starts of the season. Reliever José Alvarado made national news last year because of thestruggle he had to go through to be reunited with his familyafter the visa process was thrown into turmoil when the U.S.suspended diplomatic relations with Venezuela. This is something only immigrants can understand and relate to.The Phillies should do something to recognize these important players and theirexperiences as immigrants.Hosting an Immigrant Heritage Night could also help restore the Phillies’ historic — and historically bad — reputation over race. In 1947, the Phillies manager led the team inshouting racist taunts at Jackie Robinson, and the Phillies didn’t admit their first Black player until 1957, thelast in the National League to do so. The team’s first Black player to reach star status, Dick Allen, wasnever given the treatment he deserved, receiving boos, jeers, and death threats; he wore a helmet to protect himself against fans’ glass bottles.But in 2020,the Phillies finally recognized Allen for his incredible talent by retiring his number. This is proof that change and recognition can happen.All year long, the Phillies celebrate different communities and important issues. Next month, there aregames devoted to Pride and Jewish heritage, and later this season, the park will honor German and Italian heritages. This is commendable, and something the organization should keep doing.I simply suggest adding one more theme event, an Immigrant Heritage Night, to recognize immigrants the same way we recognize many other communities. Let’s celebrate the great players and fans who made Philly their home and have a huge impact on the team.And when it happens, I’ll be there at Citizens Bank Park, cheering for the best team in baseball.Ben Rush-Goebelis director of programs at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.

philinquirer_2024_14,"Despite everything stacked against them, Philly teachers show up for the kids, again and again, with a smile and a sense of humor.Abbott Elementary, the hilarious show that highlights the day-to-daystrugglesand triumphs ofteaching in Philadelphia, kicks off Season Three on Wednesday. Like thousands of other fans, I am eagerlyawaiting its return.Although Willard R. Abbott Elementary is a fictional school, there is a lot of truth in its portrayal.From 2010 to 2015, I was employed as an instructional coach for a literacy nonprofit, traveling to elementary schools across Philadelphia. Many neighborhoods were riddled with drugs, crime, and poverty, likeKensington, where dealers hid their goods in the wheel wells of parked cars.“This is exactly what it looks like,” I told my teenage children as we watched the pilot together. The set was virtually identical to what I remembered: the blue and khaki uniforms, the large metal entrance doors, the murals painted outside. Even the characters reminded me of educators I had known. Ms. K, the bubbly rookie, was like Janine, played by Quinta Brunson (who recently won an Emmy for best comedy actress, thesecond Black actress ever to receive the award, and the first in 43 years . Ms. C, the streetwise, South Philly native I met who liked Babar books, drew parallels to Melissa Schemmenti.My role was to support the teachers with literacy instruction, modeling and planning lessons, observing, and providing feedback. Nervous, I wondered if they’d welcome me into their classrooms. Would my coaching really make a difference?My first assignment was with Ms. J, a veteran third-grade teacher, who kept her students in a perfect “single file” line, likeBarbara Howard. As I sat in a conference room waiting for her to arrive, I silently rehearsed my coaching lingo: “I am here to support, not evaluate.” “Let’s partner together to help the students succeed …”Ms. J was petite, well-dressed, and at least 10 years older than me. This only added to my insecurity, as she clearly had more years of experience. But as soon as we started talking, we clicked instantly.“I was so nervous before that my palms were sweating,” she confessed later. “But I didn’t need to be,” she added, smiling. “I’m excited to learn something new.”Over five years, I worked in dozens of buildings across Philly, with multiple teachers. And the majority of them did welcome me. Like Ms. J, they hoped to “learn something new,” or at least refine their instruction. They were even willing to relinquish their precious planning time to meet with me, all in the interest of helping their students.In many schools, the staffscrambled to get what they needed. In one classroom, we rifled through dusty, falling-apart textbooks, many with ancient copyright dates. In another, we sorted through decades of outdated materials, filling the rolling gray trash cans to the brim.Just like onAbbott, these teachers faced less-than-desirable conditions: old carpets (or none at all , peeling paint, dingy bathrooms, flickering lightbulbs. Maybe that’s why I loved the episode where Melissa found a creative (albeit illegal method to procure classroom rugs: “I’ve got a guy for that.”In reality, Philly teachers deal with similar situations all the time. Themajority of the buildings were built prior to 1978, and at least five schoolsclosed due to asbestos in 2023. The district reimburses teachers $200 per year to stock their classrooms, yet educatorsstill lack supplies. I have heard of teachers forking over upwards of $500 to cover their needs.Perhaps what’s most similar between the Philly teachers and the ones on the show is that they all care deeply about their students. Despite everything stacked against them, they show up for the kids, again and again, with a smile and a sense of humor.As Barbara states inSeason 2, Episode 20: “But if you come back here tomorrow, ready to do your job, having not given up on yourself or that student … well, that is not a failure. Sometimes, that’s what success looks like.”Lucky for us, Janine and the rest of the cast will be back.Lisa Mazinas is an elementary reading specialist who writes from Ardmore.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_223,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°We’re living in an upside-down world, aren’t we?It’s a world in which scientists whose research findings that COVID probably originated as a spillover from wildlife have been validated by dozens of scientific studies, but got them hauled before a Republican-dominated House committee to be brayed at by the likes of Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and accused of academic fraud.Meanwhile, the purveyors of claims that COVID’s danger was overstated and could be met by exposing the maximum number of people to the deadly virus in quest of “herd immunity” have been offered a platform to air their widely debunked and refuted views at a forum sponsored by Stanford University.The event is a symposium on the topic “Pandemic Policy: Planning the Future, Assessing the Past,” scheduled to take place on campus Oct. 4.No one can doubt that a sober examination of the policies of the recent past with an eye toward doing better in the next pandemic is warranted. This symposium is nothing like that.Most of its participants have been associated with discredited approaches to the COVID pandemic, including minimizing its severity and calling for widespread infection to achieve herd immunity. Some have been sources of rank misinformation or disinformation. Advocates of scientifically validated policies are all but absent.The event is shaping up as a major embarrassment for an institution that prides itself on its academic standards. It comes with Stanford’s official imprimatur; the opening remarks will be delivered by its freshly appointed president, Jonathan Levin, an economist who took office Aug. 1.The problem with the symposium starts with its main organizer. He’s Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford professor of health policy. Bhattacharya is one of the original signers of the “Great Barrington Declaration,” a manifesto for herd immunity published in October 2020. The university didn’t respond to my question about Bhattacharya’s role. He didn’t respond to my request for comment.The core of the declaration is what its drafters call “focused protection,” which means allowing “those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk” — chiefly seniors, who would be quarantined.Focused protection, the promoters wrote, would allow society to achieve herd immunity and return to normalcy in three to six months.The quest for herd immunity from COVID has several problems. One is that infection with one variant of this ever-evolving virus doesn’t necessarily confer immunity from other variants. Another problem is that COVID can be a devastating disease for victims of any age. Allowing anyone of any age to become infected can expose them to serious health problems.Bhattacharya’s name doesn’t appear in the event announcement, but he has identified himself on X as its “main organizer.” Among the announced speakers is epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta of Oxford, another of the declaration’s original signers.The date of the symposium, by the way, is the anniversary of the signing of the Great Barrington Declaration. It’s also Rosh Hashana, one of the High Holy Days of the Jewish calendar. Stanford says the “overlap” with the holiday is regrettable, but it hasn’t offered to reschedule.Stanford responded to my request for comment about the event by simply reproducing language from the event announcement.“The conference was organized to highlight some of the many important topics that public health officials and policymakers will need to address in preparing for future pandemics,” the university said. “The speakers, including those already listed and others who will be added over the next several weeks, represent a wide range of views on this issue. We look forward to a civil, informed, and robust debate.”That won’t do. Stanford’s argument that it’s merely providing a platform for “robust debate” among speakers with a “wide range of views” is belied by the roster of speakers, in which members of a discredited fringe of pandemic policy advocates are heavily overrepresented.“Knowing who the speakers and panelists are,” wrote the veteran pseudoscience debunker David Gorski, “I know that ‘assessing the past’ will likely consist of highly revisionist history … claiming that public health interventions didn’t work.”The description of some of the daylong symposium’s sessions should give one pause. The precis of a panel titled “Misinformation, Censorship, and Academic Freedom” states as fact that “governments censored information contrary to public health pronouncements in social media settings.”It asks rhetorically, “Does the suspension of free speech rights during a pandemic help keep the population better informed or does it permit the perpetuation of false ideas by governments?”Yet who among these speakers lost their “free speech rights”?A look at the speakers list should tell you where this event is heading. On a panel on “Evidence-Based Decision Making During a Pandemic” is Anders Tegnell, the architect of Sweden’s pandemic policy. Sweden has been held up by critics of school closings and lockdowns and advocates of herd immunity as a success story, the theme being that by keeping schools and restaurants open, the country beat the pandemic.The truth is just the opposite. As I’ve reported, the Tegnell record is disastrous. Sweden’s laissez-faire approach sacrificed its seniors to the pandemic and used its schoolchildren as guinea pigs. Swedish researchers concluded in retrospect that its policies were “morally, ethically, and scientifically questionable.” The death toll rose so high that the government was eventually forced to tighten up the rules.Then there’s Scott Atlas, a radiologist and former professor at Stanford medical school, who is currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution, the right-wing think tank housed on the Stanford campus.Atlas was recruited to join the Trump White House as a COVID advisor in July 2020 after having volunteered to Medicare Administrator Seema Verma that the government’s pandemic policies were “a massive overreaction” that was “inciting irrational fear” in Americans.Atlas estimated that the coronavirus “would cause about 10,000 deaths,” which “would be unnoticed” in a normal flu season. By the end of 2020, as it happens, COVID deaths in the U.S. exceeded 350,000. As of today, the toll is more than 1.2 million.At the White House, Atlas promoted scientifically dubious prescriptions for the pandemic.Atlas’ prescriptions disturbed his Stanford colleagues, about 110 of whom wrote an open letter in September 2020 alerting the public to “the falsehoods and misrepresentations of science” that Atlas was preaching.The Stanford administration also formally disavowed Atlas’ statements and prescriptions. “Dr. Atlas has expressed views that are inconsistent with the university’s approach in response to the pandemic,” the university said.“We support using masks, social distancing, and conducting surveillance and diagnostic testing.”Yet now Atlas appears to be back in the university’s good graces, judging from his presence on the roster. Stanford didn’t respond to my questions about Atlas’ role, and he didn’t reply to my request for comment.Allowing this symposium to proceed along the lines laid out in the announcement will be a black mark for Stanford in the scientific community.NEW YORK — Coco Gauff’s U.S. Open title defence ended in a 6-3 4-6 6-3 loss to fellow American Emma Navarro in the fourth round on Sunday, the reigning women’s champion becoming the latest big name to make an early exit at Flushing Meadows this year."
suffolknewsherald_2024_56,"Published 5:34 pm Tuesday, August 13, 2024BySuffolk News-Herald Editorial BoardAs the remnants of Debby spawned rotations that prompted an afternoon of Tornado Warnings for much of Suffolk and South Hampton Roads, it was a stark reminder of the importance of staying weather-aware. Whether it’s a sudden storm, a heatwave, or a cold snap, being informed about the weather can make a significant difference in how we prepare and respond.Weather awareness isn’t just about avoiding inconvenience; it’s about safety. For instance, knowing about an impending severe storm can give you the time needed to secure your property, plan an alternate route, or even evacuate if necessary. As we found for much of July, during heatwaves, being aware of the temperature and humidity levels can help prevent heat-related illnesses by encouraging hydration and limiting exposure to the sun.Moreover, staying weather-aware fosters a sense of community. When we’re informed, we can share that information with others, particularly those who might be more vulnerable, such as the elderly or those without access to reliable news sources. This collective vigilance can help reduce harm and build resilience within communities.In our digital age, there’s no excuse not to be informed. Weather apps, alerts, and news broadcasts are readily accessible and provide real-time updates. By taking a few moments each day to check the weather forecast, we can make smarter decisions, protect our loved ones, and contribute to our overall well-being.Staying weather-aware is not just a good habit; it’s an essential part of being prepared for whatever nature might throw our way.Corbin Burnes will toe the rubber for the Baltimore Orioles (79-59 on Monday, September 2 against the Chicago…Gunnar Henderson and the Baltimore Orioles will attempt to defeat Luis Robert and the Chicago White Sox when…Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

minnpost_2024_153,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Last week the NCAA and the five “power conferences” ratified a proposed antitrust settlement. If it is approved by the federal judge presiding over House v. NCAA, the agreement will result in colleges paying athletes.Yes, after decades of the college sports power structure insisting that amateurism is essential, the laborers in this multi-billion dollar enterprise will officially and openly share in the wealth.There remain hurdles for the settlement, not least of which is that a good share of the bill is to be borne by colleges that are not parties to the lawsuit and were not involved in the settlement negotiations. A sensible judge should inquire why such Division I “mid-majors” as South Dakota State and St. Thomas must pay to keep the power conference likes of Minnesota and Alabama out of court.But whether it’s under the framework of this settlement or in some other form, athlete pay is inevitable. And when that comes, college sports will not be the same. What it will become is a mystery.Among the questions and uncertainties involved in this settlement:• Will colleges try to use this settlement to evade the federal Title IX requirement for equal opportunities for female student-athletes?• How will athletic programs divvy up the $20 million in athlete pay envisioned? How will athletic departments coordinate that with the NIL collectives mushrooming around major programs?• Amateurism may have been a sham, but it was a sham that helped sustain non-revenue sports. If colleges need to come up with millions to pay the quarterback, will they continue to support the sports that don’t pack arenas and stadiums?• Will colleges now welcome unionization of athletes? Perhaps so, as collective bargaining will negate further antitrust claims by players and settle the question of who gets how much.Perhaps the surest sign that college sports is both broken and lucrative are the reports that private equity groups are looking to “invest” in programs — cash up front for a share of the revenue. Universities would be wise to avoid such vultures, who are better at picking apart enterprises than at sustaining them. But wisdom is frequently a scarce commodity, and there has been no shortage of short-sighted cash grabs in college sports of late."

This month we want to recognize the founding of the precursor to our modern-day VA. Most of the programs and benefits we feature each month are offered through the VA. We often take time on our own service’s anniversary to reflect on it, so it is only appropriate that we all similarly acknowledge the VA and all it does for us veterans.Negative press about individual facility issues and problems, notwithstanding, we are sure most of you who use their services find they meet your needs. If you do not use them, recommend you contact one of the service organization’s veterans services officer to help you get into their system. In 1921 due to efforts of U.S. President Warren Harding the Veterans Bureau was created to address the issues World War I veterans who were having issues with access to care and services to address their medical and personal needs. It would evolve over the years into the current Veterans Affairs and Veterans Benefits organizations. The Veterans bureau built hospitals and established neuropsychiatric services. Any veteran who had served since 1897 was permitted to seek care.One of our readers kindly referred us to the Maritime Injury Center which focuses somewhat on Merchant Mariners, but has a ton of great information and resources for vets and merchant mariners alike. These range from advice on military and maritime careers to civilian transition, maritime law, mental health, continued education and much more. It might be of use to veterans who were in the sea services. Check it out https: www.maritimeinjurycenter.com/.Veterans can now make appointments at the VA using the MyHealthVet link to VA.gov appointments. (https: www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/ss20231103-try-appointments-va If you have not subscribed to this site, we suggest you do so immediately; it is a portal to a number of VA resources for veterans in their system. (https: www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/user-registration . This might be a simpler way to request your VA appointments than running the phone options gauntlet when you call Hampton or another VA center. You can currently login directly, but next year it will be through VA.gov. More on that in a future Veterans Corner.Over the years PTSD, or posttraumatic stress disorder, has been known as shell shock, combat fatigue, or battle fatigue (https: www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/what/ptsd_basics.asp . Although PTSD is often linked with combat, not all PTSD is combat-related. Any experience that threatens your life or someone else’s can cause PTSD. Some changes that come with aging may make a veteran feel more vulnerable, making PTSD symptoms more noticeable. Aging can cause symptoms to come back after many years or even occur for the first time. The PTSD Coach App is available to any veteran or family member to learn more, view treatments and ways to manage symptoms. https: mobile.va.gov/app/ptsd-coach One feature we recommend is a self-assessment capability for anyone reluctant to directly approach a healthcare provider with their concerns. Related to PTSD is individual feelings of being all alone..The VA through its Million Veteran Program has recognized that America, particularly some Veterans, has a loneliness epidemic. Without getting into the details on this, we want to emphasize to our Veteran readers that there are any number of Veteran’s Service Organization within which they will find a common bond and fellowship.

minnpost_2024_39,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.This question has been one that I have pondered and thought deeply about for many years. As a small-town native of Minnesota, returning to practice medicine in a small town has always been my dream. As the years have passed, I have watched many medical professionals come and go from my hometown, often only staying for one or two years before moving on. This is not only disheartening as a prospective employee, but discouraging and disruptive to all those patients within that health system. In a time when patients are more complex and comorbid than ever, continuity of care is beyond important. We know that rural America is no exception to this and, in fact, is more of the rule.So, what can we do to keep good doctors in small towns? The answer is complex, but the mission is not impossible.First of all, focusing attention on the bright, young, aspiring medical professionals early on should be at the top of the list. We know that practitioners who grew up in rural areas are much more likely to return to these areas and, most importantly, stay. Rural health systems should be using this to their full advantage, working with local high schools, community colleges, and even middle schools to foster connections early. Helping them achieve their goals will only increase their desire to pay it forward and work for the place that helped them become who they are.Secondly, rural health care institutions should not just focus on hiring the provider but must consider the provider and their entire family, as well. How far away do their in-laws live? What activities are their children involved in? What are their spouse’s hobbies? All these factors will greatly contribute to the provider making rural their home for the long run. On-site visits should be a must, as it is the perfect time for the institution to put its best foot forward and display the features that not only the hospital system, but also the community, have to offer for a potential employee. This means showing prospective physicians the schools, potential real estate options, a good restaurant and, perhaps even more so, inviting the patient’s family to join in this experience. Rural health care institutions are not just hiring a provider; they are hiring them and their family.A significant piece of what drew me to my future practice in rural Minnesota was the ability to make critical decisions within a growing healthcare institution that very clearly valued physician quality of life. One of the greatest assets a successful rural healthcare institution has is its ability to integrate healthcare providers’ feedback into the way the institution is run. In the times we are living in, burnout is higher than it has ever been, and with thousands of providers leaving the field since the pandemic, things are not looking up for us. When an institution sees this, and proactively allows its providers to work to a level that they feel comfortable with without repercussions, happiness is found. My future job will allow me time to spend with my family, travel, and still do what I love — something that I’ve never seen offered in a large academic institution. I will work three-day weeks and, if I choose to work more, I will make more. This model of practice allows professionals to feel that by having time off, they are not not meeting the expectations of an institution. Instead, this model asks professionals to take time off, and rewards them should they decide to increase their time worked.If rural hospitals and healthcare systems used these strategies to recruit the right people the right way, I truly believe that patients would have a better chance of thriving, and rural healthcare systems would continue to grow. When time and family are valued, it reaps benefits for everyone. Though this model will not work for everyone, it is certainly something to consider and aspire to.For more information on what your health system can do to promote rural provider retention rates, visit RuralCancer.org.Emily Westergard, DO, is a fellow in hematology and oncology who will be starting her practice at Lakewood Health System in Staples in September."
minnpost_2024_145,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The sun brings both heat and energy. In the deep north, it is cold in the winter but also sunny. Solar power has some of the highest efficiency rates in the cold, so the heat of the sun can still be harnessed. Using solar thermal to create heat reduces heating costs and provides a secure form of heat in the deepest of winter.Here’s why that’s important in Indigenous lands and beyond.Tribal communities face the same economic issues as many other marginalized groups. But often these issues are exponentially worse in Native communities that face limited income and employment opportunities and an ever-present energy burden. In short, low-income families are at the mercy of rural electric cooperatives, propane suppliers and rising prices.In impoverished Indigenous reservations, “fuel poverty” is a real issue. Heating bills can consume a good portion of a family’s income, leaving some with the stark choice to eat or to heat. On the White Earth reservation, like in many other places, heating bills can soar to $700 a month or more, and energy assistance funds can run short.Native Americans only represent 1.4% of the 5.7 million people in Minnesota; however, in 2019, 31.3% of Native peoples lived in poverty. In contrast, only 7.3% of “white individuals” were living below federal poverty standards. The White Earth Nation faces much higher residential energy and economic burdens than much of the rest of Minnesota — the worst in the country at the 97th percentile nationwide. White Earth communities face average energy burdens of up to 9%. A household is considered to have such a burden if average energy bills cost more than 6% of household income.Following the money, we see it leads to off-reservation utilities and other businesses. Every year, millions of dollars directly transfer to energy companies like Minnesota Power, rural cooperatives and Ferrellgas, with no hope for a way off that treadmill. Tribal economies bleed, and tribal peoples suffer.Price fluctuations in these energy markets can readily create dire consequences, leading to heating scarcity. The Clean Energy Resource Teams (CERTS reports that one solar air heater directly reduces a household’s fossil fuel use and can save a family up to 30% of their monthly heating cost for 20 years. A single panel alone can reduce a modest home’s fossil fuel use and carbon emissions by 20%-40%, depending on the building.The benefits of solar thermal heat extend way beyond the reservation into non-Native communities and businesses. The world is finally awakening to the benefits of solar heating in a variety of settings, however slowly; Climate News reports that the U.S. had 373,055 solar thermal systems in operation at the end of 2021,according to the International Energy Agency(IEA — not a lot given that it’s less than one-tenth the number of solar photovoltaic systems in the country.As of the end of 2023, the total operational solar thermal capacity reached 560 GWth (giga-watts thermal , equivalent to 800 million square meters of collector area, according to IEA-SHC (the Solar Heating and Cooling Programme . The annual solar thermal energy yield of this installed capacity amounted to 456 TWh (terawatt hour , which correlates to savings of 49.1 million tons of oil and 158.4 million tons of CO2.Even as fossil fuels still dominate heating energy, incremental change matters. So would offering the high 30% rebate for solar thermal systems that the more popular and visible photovoltaic systems receive today.Retired sales professional Jeff Edington is a firm believer in the future of solar thermal after he bought an old uninsulated concrete airplane hangar near the Twin Cities and added solar thermal heating panels to the hangar’s exterior south walls. After completing the installation and using the system early in the 2023 heating season, Jeff then became something of an advocate for both the product and the company. In full disclosure, he purchased the panels from the non-profit company I work for,Eighth Fire Solar– made in Native America!A small repair shop in South Dakota, a residence high in the Colorado Rockies, a machine shop in Great Falls, Montana, and others are likewise happy users of solar thermal panels manufactured on the White Earth Nation in Pine Point, Minnesota. This micro manufacturing business provides much needed jobs and training to Native folks in an area where work is often scarce.Should we be hopeful about growing solar thermal heating? A 2023 IEA thinks so. But the planet continues to overheat at alarming rates, and the impacts are increasingly widespread: The IEA Renewables Report 2023 assumes that the share of heat from renewable energy will increase by more than 40% worldwide in 2023-28. However, this growth corresponds to only 70% of the projected global increase in total heat demand, leading to a rise in fossil fuel consumption for heat and the associated CO2 emissions.Photovoltaics systems have already transformed the quality of life in many parts of the world. But harnessing the sun’s energy through solar thermal panels to also heat homes and businesses is an idea whose time has come. It’s a natural solution that combines traditional Indigenous views of land stewardship and environmental empathy with modern, renewable technology. It’s ready to take center stage — if given the chance.Gwe Gasco is the Program Coordinator for 8thFire Solar in Pine Point, Minnesota, where a small Native workforce manufactures, markets and installs thermal solar panels."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_235,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Faced with an election loss, an autocrat can generally take one of two paths: moderate his approach and policies in a bid to continue appealing to the electorate, or crack down to show that he won’t tolerate this dissent.The government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has decidedly gone in the latter direction, intensifying a campaign against political opposition after even friendly governments have raised concerns about Maduro’s phony claim of victory in the presidential election late last month.The despot faced off against Edmundo González, largely because opposition leader María Corina Machado had been barred from running. Even without the opposition’s most popular politician, all reliable observers had González winning a decisive victory.Now, The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. government is attempting to broker a deal to offer amnesty to Maduro and top allies — who are under investigation on various drug-related and trafficking charges — in exchange for his ceding power.Would this be a satisfying resolution? Not particularly; Maduro deserves some accountability for his actions. Yet sometimes diplomacy is about picking the least bad out of a slate of bad options. Washington should work to finalize this deal, and Maduro should take it. He should learn from history that attempting to suppress public will for long enough rarely turns out well for the oppressor.The lack of stability in Venezuela impacts New York, as Venezuelans have been the largest number of migrants coming here. A new legitimate government could only bring improvements.Instead, Maduro is using “Operation Knock Knock”— the regime’s name for the effort to round up suspected opposition supporters in late-night raids — taunting both the Venezuelan public and the international community. The intelligence services have gone so far as to make propaganda videos of these raids, set to soundtracks like a rhyme from slasher film “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” They know that the objective is to create a generalized climate of fear to keep the population at bay.Some of the people who have already self-exiled to get away from Maduro’s regime will undoubtedly be less than thrilled about the prospect of the former president having the red carpet rolled out to do the same, where he’ll likely get to enjoy a leisurely retirement among some of the very people his government persecuted and antagonized. Some people still in Venezuela will likewise find it infuriating to see the man go without repercussions in the country he and his predecessor Hugo Chávez helped sink into economic despondency despite extraordinary domestic riches, while the top-level cronies made off with the bags.Nonetheless, if that’s what gets Maduro to accept the election results, step aside and allow the Venezuelan public to rebuild some of its civic and political life, so be it. This is all much more straightforward if he can be convinced to voluntarily relinquish power; otherwise, it’s not clear how exactly the true results of the election could be vindicated. After all, elections matter only inasmuch as those with the power to make them matter agree to do so. Only once this sordid chapter is closed can the country hope to embark on a brighter and more democratic path.— New York Daily News"

minnpost_2024_81,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.While the lawyers representing former President Donald Trump have generally been derided by commentators, observers, savants and other know-it-alls, it might be time to take another look at their performance, particularly those engaged in the four federal and state felony-level criminal cases, irrespective of their less than stellar performances in the civil fraud and defamation lawsuits against him and his business organization.Doing so yields a much more favorable evaluation, for they have achieved their principal objective of delaying the various criminal cases by their advocacy, appeals, and strategies, aided by some unforced errors and blunders by their adversaries and other lucky breaks.As a result, the prospects are dimming that there will be any trials, let alone convictions or other outcomes, prior to the Republican nominating convention this summer, which their client seems to have locked up, or the election this fall, when he stands a decent (some would say indecent chance of winning.If that occurs, the two federal cases of election interference and improper handling of governmental materials, including classified data, will probably be extinguished by Presidential fiat about as fast as he can pardon the Jan. 6, 2021, rioters, whom he and some of his acolytes have referred to variously as “patriots,” “heroes” and, lately, “hostages.” Not harmless “tourists” visiting the Capitol any longer.That leaves the two state court cases in New York and Georgia, both plagued with their own prosecutorial problems.The initial case that was filed, the one concerning “hush money” payment to porn star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 election, has fallen off the radar screen. Since its initiation in New York state court last year, it has advanced nary at all; its major product seems to be jump-starting his MAGA base and enriching his coffers from supportive contributors. To compound its inertia, a vital prosecution witness, former Trump attorney and “fixer” Michael Cohen, a felon himself, has muddied the waters with his own misconduct, including his recent use of fabricated legal citations in a different proceeding.The election interference case in the nation’s capital, being handled by special counsel Jack Smith, is hamstrung by appeals. While the outlook for Team Trump on the pending issue of his “absolute immunity” from any criminal prosecution now lodged in the D.C. federal appellate court looks bleak, it has had the effect of derailing the proceeding and more pit stops are yet ahead. (Editor’s note: The appeals court on Tuesday ruled against granting Trump immunity .The Mara Lago purloined documents case, which once seemed like a slam-dunk, has been slow-walked by the Trump-appointed judge Aileen Cannon and seems to be dry docked.Then, there’s the sprawling Georgia state court case brought by the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, whose immense prosecution of 19 alleged racketeering co-conspirators may have bitten off more than it can chew. While it has achieved a few guilty pleas by small fish, it will have a whale of a time getting to the former President, who also has raised the immunity defense there, too.The case is now marred by the bad optics of the D.A. enmeshed in an unbecoming romantic imbroglio concerning her hiring and designation of an apparent romantic partner as lead attorney in the case, a predicament that, while not necessarily illegal or unethical, is likely to cripple the prosecution for a long time as Team Trump and other various defendants, including those who have pled guilty, attack the arrangement and seek to use the stench emanating from that inconvenient arrangement to wound, if not scuttle, the prosecution.Although not a criminal case, the effort to keep the former President off of the March 5 primary ballot in Minnesota under the “insurrection” clause of section 3 of the post-Civil War 14th Amendment failed here due, in part, to successful lawyering by his attorneys and affiliated ones representing the state Republican Party. The state Supreme Court last fall punted, deeming the case premature until the fall election. But the issue is likely to be resolved soon by the U.S. Supreme Court in connection with litigation challenging decisions barring him from the ballot in two other states, Colorado and Maine.The various squadrons of lawyers working for the former President, all at rather hefty price tags, warrant considerable credit for managing to keep these cases at bay without blatantly crossing any legal or ethical boundaries.While they have yet to achieve any victories, the Trump attorneys have managed to succeed in accomplishing another objective: not losing.That deserves some degree of grudging admiration, not condemnation.Marshall H.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_85,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°In yet another airliner scandal, Boeing and Airbus jets have been manufactured using titanium sold with forged documentation. The problem was uncovered after a parts supplier found small holes in the material from corrosion. Whether the parts are usable despite the faked paperwork is being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration.Why did this happen? The companies outsourced their manufacturing to China, and what manufacturing remains in the United States has been subject to intense cost-cutting. Outsourcing and cost-cutting often mean lower quality, more errors and more cover-ups.The parts in question are handled by Spirit AeroSystems, which was a division of Boeing until 2005, when it was sold to investors as a separate company. Right before that move, an internal report by John Hart-Smith, a Boeing engineer, questioned “whether or not a company can continue to operate if it relies primarily on outsourcing the majority of the work that it once did in-house,” according to The Seattle Times.Problems caused by outsourcing aren’t exclusive to the airline industry.In 2008, Ward Stone, a wildlife pathologist, and his daughter, Montana Stone, used over-the-counter tests and discovered hazardous levels of lead in children’s necklaces and bracelets. This led to a recall of half a million pieces of children’s jewelry made in China and an agreement between the companies and the state of New York that allows the state to fine the companies if it finds lead in their products again.In 2010 an investigation by The Associated Press found that children’s jewelry from China contained cadmium, a highly toxic and carcinogenic anti-corrosive material that is similar to lead but less regulated. In response, California and other states outlawed the use of the metal in children’s jewelry, and testing found that by 2012, cadmium was no longer present in trinkets for children. There were no laws about it for adult jewelry and little testing.In 2018, the Center for Environmental Health, a nonprofit, decided to check adult products. It quickly found that many items for adults contained cadmium, some at very high levels. Oops.Because the airline industry is so heavily regulated, it tends to discover problems. And because planes have multiple safety mechanisms backing up one another, the problems rarely lead to major loss of life (although two Boeing Max crashes in recent years are reminders that there are no guarantees .© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 71-year-old Hilo man pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree negligent homicide for the Oct. 3, 2023, traffic collision death of a 79-year-old Hilo woman.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
philinquirer_2024_55,"All our fears about AI have come to roost in Gaza, as a report links Israel s Lavender program to mass killing of women, childrenThe war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas markedits grim six-month anniversaryon Sunday, and one of the most jarring things about this very 21st-century conflict has been the almost daily headlines about Israeli airstrikes obliterating the homes of notable Palestinians — sometimesknown Hamas operatives, but oftenjournalistsorphysiciansoraid workers. In many of these attacks, large numbers of family members,including young children, die under the rubble.In one of the war’s most notorious incidents, the prominent Palestinian poet and professorRefaat Alareer—so haunted by the daily devastation and the likelihood he and his own family would be targeted that in his final weeks he wrote a poem called “If I Must Die” — had sought refuge at a family home when an Israeli airstrike killed not only him but his brother, sister and four children.It’s a similar story for journalists in Gaza, whose death toll —at least 90 Palestinians, according to the conservative tally of the Committee to Protect Journalists — has exceeded any other modern conflict, in just half a year. Just two days after Alareer’s death in December, an Israeli airstrike on the home of reporter Ola Attallah killed not only herbut nine members of her family. That same week, Abdalhamid Abdelati, head of the Al Sawt Al Sha’b radio station, wasn’t home when an Israeli bomb struck, but his mother, brother, sister and four other family memberswere killed.This frequent death from above — in a war that has claimed the lives ofmore than 33,000 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children — has raised some uncomfortable questions about Israel’s conduct in the conflict. Just who are Israeli commanders targeting for these deadly strikes? And how are there targets selected?This week,an investigative reportfrom +972 Magazine and Local Call — led by independent, left-leaning Israeli journalists covering the region from Tel Aviv — offered some answers that are deeply disturbing, posing questions about the blurred lines between artificial intelligence and real morality that cut to the core of our basic humanity.The +972 Magazine report, which it confirmed in interviews with six Israeli intelligence officers, said an AI program known as “Lavender” has been used by the Israeli Defense Force to identify targets in Gaza since the start of the war on Oct. 7.The IDF has confirmedthat AI is used by its intelligence officers in guiding its tactics in Gaza, but the military and the magazine differed sharply on the issue of human involvement. IDF claims the computer-driven data is only advisory and that humans are still making the key decisions for targeting bombs, but the +972 report said human reviews of the AI targets were often “a rubber stamp” as brief as 20 seconds.The 20-second finding is deeply troubling, and yet arguably not the most bothersome disclosure in the magazine’s investigation. For one thing, our faith in computers is centered on the notion that advanced technology might reduce the fatal mistakes that occur during the fog of war, but +972 reported that Lavender’s error rate in targeting is still 10% — bombing someone with the same name as a Hamas member, for example, or even someone who just inherited a phone number.But even when Israeli intelligence, with the help of AI, pinpoints a target that it suspects of ties to Hamas — whichtriggered the warwhen it killed 1,200 Israelis in a surprise attack and which still holds 130 or so hostages — it faces a decision on the fate of civilians who might be in the home or nearby. In the early weeks of the war, +972 reported, Israeli commanders deemedit was OK to killas many as 15 or 20 innocent civilians for every low-level Hamas operative targeted, a number that rose to the hundreds for higher-level Hamas leaders.What’s more, the intelligence sources told +972 that alleged low-level Hamas operatives were targeted withso-called dumb bombs, less-precise weaponry that leads to more collateral killing, in order to save more expensive “smart bombs” for their higher-ups.In an earlier reportlast fall on Israel’s use of AI, a military source told +972: “When a 3-year-old girl is killed in a home in Gaza, it’s because someone in the army decided it wasn’t a big deal for her to be killed — that it was a price worth paying in order to hit another target.” The devolution from Biblical commandment in the Book of Exodus of “an eye-for-an-eye”justice to a 20-1 kill ratio is hard to fathom.Yet not as unfathomable as this: +972 also reported that the Lavender AI excelled at tracking its selected targets to their homes, where it was deemed an airstrike would be most successful. Of course, the target’s home is also where their wives, children and other family members would be killed in their sleep. Even worse, the AI was better at finding the target’s home than at determining if he was actually there. “It happened to me many times that we attacked a house, but the person wasn’t even home,”one source told +972. “The result is that you killed a family for no reason.”The Orwellian name for this particular operation? “Where’s Daddy?”In one sense, the exposure of Israel’s Lavender program is the latest twist on a story that goes back hundreds of years — the use of new technologies not to better humankind but to destroy it. Think about themachine guns that made a mockeryof front-line warfare in World War I, the Nazis harnessingZyklon B gasfor their death camps, or America dropping atomic bombs on the civilians ofHiroshima and Nagasaki. But the rise of AI brings this to a troubling if inevitable level: The fantasy that we can escape moral culpability by assigning life-or-death decisions to a machine.» READ MORE:We interrupt this Super Bowl for a massacre | Will Bunch NewsletterIf nothing else, these disturbing stories coming out of Gaza should confirm that the rise of AI, and the decisions we have to make as a society about how to deploy it, is the issue that will come to define who we are in the 21st century. How can we make the most out of this remarkable technology — identifyingcures for diseases, for example — while avoiding the many pitfalls fromclassroom plagiarismtorising unemploymentas machines learn to perform human jobs?But are we even asking the right questions? The ultimate fear around AI has always been that the machinesbecome sentient, rise up, and overthrow humankind. It’s not wrong to worry about that dystopian scenario, but isn’t it just as bad when we abdicate our morality by farming out mass death to a computer program? Perhaps someday artificial intelligence will evolve to a higher state of consciousness, but right now Lavender is issuing death warrants for toddlers and their mothers because it reflects the inhumanity that we programmed it with.The +972 report happened to come out at a moment when Americans, including our leaders, may be more receptive to hearing it. We don’t yet know if AI played a role in Israel’s decision last week to target a convoy of aid workers for renowned chef Jose Andrés’ World Central Kitchen,killing seven people, including aCanadian American veteranof the war in Afghanistan. But the shocking incident has led even some of Israel’s staunchest allies in Congresslike former Speaker Nancy Pelosito call for restrictions on the massive flow of U.S. weapons, unless the bloodshed is reduced.Afterjust one phone callfrom a clearly angered President Joe Biden to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel approved a newfood corridorinto famine-stricken Gaza. That one small step for humanity also begged the questions of why Biden and U.S. officials didn’t use their leverage sooner, and why an attack on Western workers for politicians’ favorite Beltway chef provoked a response when the killing of innocent Palestinian babies did not?The reality — whether the fighting is with sticks and stones or cruise missiles guided by supercomputers — is that the horror of war always hinges on our tragic flaw to see some people as more human than others. Last week, former U.S. State Department official Aaron David Millertried to explainto the New Yorker’s Isaac Chotiner why Biden had a more visceral reaction to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel than to its massive retaliation, even as the deaths of children mounted. “Do I think that Joe Biden has the same depth of feeling and empathy for the Palestinians of Gaza as he does for the Israelis?” Miller asked rhetorically. “No, he doesn’t, nor does he convey it. I don’t think there’s any doubt about that.”Whatever flaws exist in an AI program such as Lavender, the real computer bug is the lack of human love and understanding that we program it with, the ghost in the machine. Artificial intelligence won’t have the capacity to distinguish between a Hamas killer or an acclaimed poet or the baby in a crib nearby unless we input the values that cherish all innocent human life equally. It wasn’t AI that named a poorly discriminating murder program “Where’s Daddy?”; it was humans, who programmed it with a moral compass that is spinning out of control. Until we can rediscover our depth of feeling and empathy, war by computer is merely garbage in, garbage out.» READ MORE:SIGN UP: The Will Bunch Newsletter"
suffolknewsherald_2024_17,"Published 7:06 pm Wednesday, June 26, 2024ByStaff ReportsDr. Carletta ArtisOur kids are all grown up. Can you help me and my wife find our way back to each other?Congratulations on reaching the milestone of raising your children to reach adulthood. That accomplishment should be celebrated, and you both should be very proud. I also congratulate you on holding your marriage together while raising children. Research shows that marriage is a major life event and so is parenthood. Embarking on both can create a major onset of stress, even if it is good stress. This can often make individuals feel like they are barely making it through life and unable to give 100% to either the marriage or the children. However, as most will agree, you do the best that you can with love, effort, and I believe you must learn to be the best spouse and parent that you can be. The fact that you are asking me how to help you and your wife find your way back to one another tells me you are ready to let your children be adults. I also congratulate you on this, as some parents are afraid to let go of their children for fear that they will not be needed anymore, and some are unable to face the quiet that is present when children aren’t around. However, you seem to be ready to embark on a new journey so here are my thoughts. Some would call what you are going through: the Empty Nest Syndrome or the Empty Nest Stage. Well, instead of grieving your children leaving home, I want you and your wife to celebrate that accomplishment. I want you and your wife to see this as an opportunity to date one another, fall in love again, and get to know the new, wiser, and mature person you married all those years ago. Life may add some years to our looks and make us feel like we are hot stuff with our fancy titles and accomplishments, but to the one you love, you are just that boy next door. Lay down the many roles and expectations you have picked up along the way and redefine yourself as a man, as a spouse, as a partner, and as friend. Have fun together doing nothing, sleep in or get a hotel room for the night, watch television, or go to the movies, make lunch dates or dinner dates to try new restaurants, go to an amusement park (even if you only attend the shows or enjoy sightseeing , take a class together, or attend a marriage retreat. Talk and listen to one another’s goals, make new goals as a couple, don’t underestimate words and displays of affection, exchange cards just because, and reminisce about fun times in your courtship and marriage. Lastly, make the person you love feel special every day and celebrate special dates like Valentine’s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries because they are an opportunity to celebrate with one another and show appreciation for the gifts you are to one another. Whatever you do, always appreciate the one you love and know that everyone wants to be treated as though they are special.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_262,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°The largest number of migrants streaming into the U.S. and to New York City are from Venezuela and so Americans are directly impacted by stability in that country. Now comes a suspicious election favoring President Nicolás Maduro, with his puppet electoral council granting him a dubious victory over challenger Edmundo González that could cause even more chaos there.Maduro is a continuation of a regime, launched by Hugo Chávez, that has robbed Venezuelans of a chance to enjoy the vast wealth that the country could have generated with its vast oil reserves. Chávez was freely elected in 1998, with a promise to fix things.He did not. Chávez was convinced that he and his party alone had the right and ability to govern the country, and moved to abolish the legislature and independent courts, muzzle the press and bring independent watchdogs and civil society to heel.Programs that had initially relied on sky-high oil prices and to dent poverty and increase social services were not sustainable, and Chávez had increasingly little oversight and opposition to keep him in check and provide alternate governing visions. Quality of life plummeted, and every subsequent election got a little more suspect, until Maduro took over as Chavez’s handpicked successor when Chávez died in 2013.Now we find ourselves here, with international governments across Latin America casting doubt on this election, which takes place after Maduro used the levers of power to crack down on the opposition and bar opposition leader María Corina Machado from running at all. Venezuela once had free and fair elections, which is how Hugo Chávez first won.But an unpopular president refusing to be voted out by the public is not something that only happens in Latin American countries. Let’s not forget that the prior president of the United States tried to do the same four years ago. Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 insurrection was a last-ditch effort to physically prevent the transfer of power, but his earlier attempts were rooted in using or trying to use the formal levers of power to tilt the outcome of the election in his direction.Entreaties for the Georgia secretary of state to “find” enough votes to put him over the top are no different than Maduro leaning on his electoral council to fudge the numbers in his favor, or stop counting before they all come in.The main difference is that Trump’s gambit failed, in part because of the decentralized nature of U.S. elections. He could pressure state officials here and there and gin up fake electors, but he did not directly oversee the machinery of the election. Still, we shouldn’t take it for granted that his coup did not succeed; a lot of people in different jobs around the country had to make the decision not to go along, and we’re all lucky they did.In this country, the rightful winner took power and we can only hope that the rightful winner in Venezuela, probably González, somehow manages to prevail over Maduro and his forces. Democracy requires people of good will on both sides; for the loser to accept the results and for the winner to rule within the bounds of the law.And that’s the same in English and Spanish.— New York Daily News"
minnpost_2024_112,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The announcement from NewRange Copper Nickel that it would study new ways to make its proposed copper-sulfide mine into a more environmentally friendly operation needs to be seen for what it is: A publicity campaign to make this dangerous project appear more palatable and, more than anything, an admission by NewRange that this mine cannot meet the legal standards to operate.Minnesotans and clean water organizations have known this for years. With growing frustration we watched as the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR worked with the mining industry to issue permits that failed to meet environmental standards. The EPA already determined that there are “no conditions” under which the mine could comply with the Fond du Lac Band’s water quality standards. Friends of the Boundary Waters and other organizations have successfully blocked other key permits in court.The studies NewRange says it is about to embark on is a dressed-up way of saying, “We need to go back to the drawing board.” NewRange’s seeming admission that its project is hopelessly flawed comes cloaked in apress releasethat is a run-of-the-mill example of greenwashing. Words and phrases likesustainable,enhanceenvironmental safeguards,carbon reduction,clean energy transitionpepper the document. NewRange even goes so far as to spin the tailings facility — where the toxic waste rock from the mine would be stored – into an environmentally friendly “clean-up” of an old iron mining site.Greenwashing a copper-sulfide mine is no small task. Afterall, this type of mining has a track record of polluting surrounding waterways. There is no proof that this kind of mining, which the EPA has listed asthe most polluting industryin the United States, can be done without polluting.Behind the veneer of greenwashing, NewRange’s Canadian and Swiss owners are conceding that its mine plan is flawed and cannot meet environmental or regulatory standards. This is not so embarrassing for NewRange as it is for MPCA and DNR. These agencies have greenlit and defended a mine so flawed that its owners are now looking into ways to change it. They have been defending a mine that we believe should never have been permitted in the first place. And they have done this by using millions of dollars from Minnesota taxpayers. Two years ago, we learned that the MPCA and DNR paid $6.4 million in taxpayer dollars to outside law firms to handle the legal challenges to permits that simply did not meet environmental standards. But rather than try to correct these errors and meet the basic legal requirements to protect our air and water, the agencies doubled down and used tax dollars to defend the interests of a foreign-owned mining company.And for what?Now NewRange might completely change this project, requiring the agencies to redo these permits anyways. What a waste.Whatever NewRange’s ultimate strategy, the question that hangs over all of this is: After being duped before, how much more government resources and tax dollars will MPCA and DNR need in order to defend a project that, time and time again, has proven to be fundamentally flawed?It’s time to move on from this dangerous, undeniably flawed mining proposal. Let’s use our common sense and not spend more years and millions of more dollars trying to force through a project that is simply located in the wrong place. The risk to Minnesota’ clean-water heritage is too great.NewRange should not go back to the drawing board. Instead, the project should be thrown on the scrap heap and never resurrected.Chris Knopf is the executive director of the Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness, a nonprofit organization committed to protecting the Boundary Waters Wilderness area from the threat of sulfide mining."

Are these the lessons we want the next generation to learn?Recently, I ran to the El train station on 15th Street after being caught in the cold rain after school, feeling relieved as I stepped onto the train platform. When the train finally came, I made my way through the heavy crowd of other students and midafternoon travelers to the inside of the car and found a seat, relieved to rest after a long day of classes.But the train didn’t leave the station. I could hear some of the students around me talking about what was going on, and someone mentioned there was a man in the next car who was unresponsive. One student walked over to investigate; she soon came back but said little about it. Just acted like it was no big deal.Thenan announcement came over the train saying we all had to exit as a result of a medical emergency. As I shuffled out of the car along with the large crowd, I caught a glimpse of the man in the next car over, lying on the floor with a needle sticking out of his arm. The crowd started whispering, “I think he OD’d,” and, “Is he dead?”I texted my friends to tell them what happened. Theconversation lasted about two seconds before we went to talk about something else.

minnpost_2024_165,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Once again, the U.S. is entering a presidential campaign with some votersexpressing curiosity about independent and minor-party candidates. None of those candidates has a real shot at victory in November, but they might influence the race and politics beyond the election.There was a time about a century ago when minor-party and independent candidateswere a prominent feature of the U.S. political system. While mostly limited to victories in state and local elections, they offered perspectives screened out by the Democrats and Republicans, on issues ranging from immigration to trade.Occasionally, a promising presidential candidate will bring issues from outside the two-party system. Wealthy businessmanH. Ross Perot won 19% of the popular vote in 1992on a message opposing free trade and federal budget deficits.George Wallace’s segregationist platformallowed him to win electoral votes in five southern states in 1968.Progressive Robert La Follette picked up 16% of the vote in 1924while railing against corporate power and corruption.As ascholar of political parties, I find these cases remarkable because the U.S. political system generally reinforces two-party dominance.Scaring away minor partiesAtheory outlined by French scholar and jurist Maurice Duvergersays that a system where a single person who gets the most votes wins office — as is the case with most prominent elections in the U.S. — will tend to foster two big parties.The effect of what’s known as “Duverger’s law” oftenscares away minor-party supporterswhen the major-party race becomes competitive. Those minor-party supporters want to avoid spoiling the election by tilting it to the party they like least.In addition,growth of the federal governmenthas discouraged local alternatives to the two major parties that pop up in more decentralized systems. It seems that the more political discourse is focused on national political issues rather than state and local concerns, the more that state parties come to resemble their national counterparts.Making it hard to runThe Democrats and Republicans are not passive observers of Duverger’s law. The two major parties have largely run minor-party competitors out of business in intentional ways.First, Democratic and Republican officeholders adopt laws making it more difficult for others to run. Creation of the secret ballot around the turn of the 19th century provided one such opportunity. In nearly every state, lawmakers adopted state-created ballots and then bannedballot “fusion,” a once-widespread practice that allows multiple parties to nominate the same candidate.Fusion would allow small parties to hitch a ride on big-name candidates without their supporters being concerned about “spoiling” the election. For example, if the Libertarian Party also endorsed a Republican presidential candidate, voters inclined toward the Libertarians could vote for the candidate that both parties endorsed. This allowed voters to support their preferred parties without jeopardizing the GOP’s chances of defeating the Democratic nominee.Legislators also implemented“sore loser” lawsover the course of the 20th century. These laws prevent candidates who fail to win primaries from running in the general election, stopping a candidate initially inside a party from then running outside the two-party structure.While major parties guaranteed themselves lines on the ballot by making sure state laws put their parties on ballots, minor-party and independent candidates must gather signatures on petitions to compete. Requiring more signatures tends toreduce the number of candidateswho appear on the ballot. Although lawsuits brought by candidates have led to some rules around petitioning to be struck down, it remains a significant hurdle in many states.The major parties often marginalize minor parties by co-opting minor-party concerns into their platforms. Especially when a new party or independent candidate attracts support around a neglected issue, at least one of the major parties will try to weave it into their appeals.In the New Deal era, Democratstacked in a liberal directionafter being challenged by the Populist Party, which had championed policies for labor unions and farmers. After seeing Perot draw so much support for his reform proposals in 1992,Republicans corralled many of his supportersin the 1994 midterm elections by advocating for ideas Perot had advanced, such as a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution and congressional term limits.Nationalized politicsCurrent times might seem ripe for an independent or minor-party candidate for president. Thepublic generally wants more than two choices. There is widespread dissatisfaction with the two major parties and thepeople they will likely nominateto run for president.There is little doubt that the Democrats and Republicans have become highly polarized on policy issues and their political styles. It is tempting to believe that polarization of the major parties opens more opportunities for less ideological parties to compete. This would mimic the late 19th century in the U.S.,when major-party polarization was highand minor parties were frequent competitors.Butpolarization actually discourages flirting with a minor partybecause the costs of losing are greater.The current era differs from the late 19th century because in earlier periods of U.S. history voter concerns were more parochial, media outlets were more locally oriented and parties were mostly state-based entities. That left a lot of room for third-party progressives in the upper Midwest and conservative Dixiecrats in the South to find support.Lately, party politics has become nationalized, and national issues dominate even local politics. Thehomogenization of party politicsacross the country over the past century has led to greatersimilarity in a party’s platforms across the states. Nearly every political issue that arises coincides with the alignment between the major parties, rather than being taken up by a splinter group in a state or region.Chicken and eggThere are substantial hurdles to minor-party success. On one hand, a campaign organized around a single individual such as Perot or Wallace can get hung up on the liabilities of that person, and the organization can evaporate when its leader leaves the scene.On the other hand, a campaign organized around a larger movement or set of ideas can suffer from the lack of a compelling figure to lead it. The Green Party is reasonably well organized and often gets on the ballot, but it is missing an attention-grabbing leader. The group No Labels tried to gain ballot access for a bipartisan ticket in 2024 but failed because itcould not identify compelling candidates.Although a third party is not likely to have much electoral success anytime soon, they do enrich American politics.The campaigns ofPerotin 1992 andRalph Nader and Pat Buchananin 2000 increased overall voter turnout.

suffolknewsherald_2024_60,"Published 5:32 pm Tuesday, March 19, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,Fifteen months ago, BECO and 7-11 lost their lawsuit, which attempted to throw out the decision by the Harborview Architectural Review Board not to allow for the building of a 7-11 convenience store/gas station at the corner of Harborview Blvd and Champion’s Way in Suffolk. They (BECO/7-11 have appealed that decision. The case will be heard on March 26. Oral arguments on the case have been set by the Virginia Court of Appeals for March 26 at 9 a.m. at the Norfolk Circuit courthouse, room 6A.My question is, how can the City of Suffolk, in all good conscience, allow this to go ahead? Never mind the fact that this intersection is dangerous and also a school bus stop. Let’s only consider that the city approved this location, knowing that a minimum of two 20,000-gallon storage tanks for gasoline will be installed 20 feet from the Children’s Harbor daycare center/school. These tanks will release Benzene gas, a known carcinogen, into the air 24/7. Most states have laws against this. Virginia has left it up to local authorities to determine a safe standoff distance for these types of storage tanks.I’m shocked by our city officials’ reckless decision-making. Is it their ultimate goal for Children’s Harbor to close its facility at this location? God knows there’s way too much childcare in the area (said with sarcasm .Please, Suffolk planners and leaders, come to your senses and opt to protect the ‘born’ children of the community by overturning your decision to allow this gas station/convenience store to be built. I would think the revenue generated by the 13 other stations in the city would be enough. There are already nine within five miles of this site.Mark DowningSuffolk, VirginiaEzequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_215,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Last week, employees at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted by almost 3-to-1 to join the United Automobile Workers. By the numbers, this wasn’t a big deal: It involved only a few thousand workers in an economy that employs almost 160 million people. But it was an important symbolic victory for a labor movement that even in its heyday never made significant inroads in the South.And it’s not silly to imagine that historians will someday look back at the Chattanooga vote as a milestone on the road back to the more or less middle-class society America used to be.Why did unions decline? It’s tempting to assume that their diminishment was inevitable in the face of global competition and the falling share of manufacturing, their traditional stronghold, in employment. But other advanced economies are still strongly unionized; in Denmark and Sweden, for example, about two-thirds of workers are union members.So what happened in America? The most plausible explanation is that beginning in the 1970s, employers became very aggressive in fighting unionization efforts and were empowered to do so by a political climate, especially after the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, in which Republicans were hostile to organized labor, while Democrats were at best weakly in support.Some existing unions — most famously, the air traffic controllers — were broken. More important, unionization didn’t spread as America increasingly became a service economy. There was and is no fundamental economic reason giant employers like Walmart or Amazon couldn’t be mostly unionized. But they became giants in an era when employers were effectively free to pull out all the stops in blocking and, in some cases, persecuting union organizers.Which brings us to the current moment, which may be an inflection point.Right now, there are two forces bolstering workers’ bargaining position. One is a tight labor market: We’ve just experienced the longest stretch of unemployment below 4% since the 1960s. This tight labor market is probably the main reason we’ve seen an “unexpected compression” of wages in recent years, with earnings rising much faster at the bottom than at the top.The other is a shift in the political climate. President Joe Biden, who joined a UAW picket line in Michigan last September, is arguably the most pro-labor president since Harry Truman. This involves more than gestures. On Tuesday, for example, the Federal Trade Commission issued a ban on most noncompete clauses, which prevent a company’s employees from taking jobs with rival businesses; such clauses cover, roughly, an astonishing 30 million workers and have been a major force reducing labor market competition.There’s a reason, then, that Biden has been getting early and enthusiastic endorsements from major unions, including the UAW in January and, this week, the Building Trades Unions, which represents about 3 million workers in the United States and Canada.But has American labor really turned a corner? We won’t know for a while whether things are actually looking up for American workers.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

philinquirer_2024_22,"Should Kamala Harris choose Josh Shapiro as her vice presidential running mate? Despite the buzz, Harris may conclude that she has better options, writes the Commonwealth Foundation s Erik Telford.ShouldKamala Harrischoose Gov.Josh Shapiroas her vice presidential running mate?That’s what many in the media — both in Pennsylvania and nationally — are calling for. Shapiro’s youth and reputation for moderation and electability seem to make him an interesting contender. So does his status as the governor of a crucial swing state. If Kamala Harris is going to win in November, she needs to win Pennsylvania first.But despite the buzz, Harris may conclude that she has better options than the governor. She almost certainly wants a running mate with a record of achievement. But Shapiro has only been in office for 18 months and has struggled to govern, despitevery colorfully promising to deliver.My colleagues at the Commonwealth Foundation recentlydocumentedwhat Harris and her vetting team are likely discovering. We compared Shapiro to governors in other states with divided government. Pennsylvania has a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democratic-controlled House, putting the commonwealth in a similar situation as Virginia, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, and four other states. Their governors have worked with the opposing party to pass numerous laws — from 162 in North Carolina to more than 1,600 in Virginia.Yet, in Pennsylvania, Shapirohas signed only 111 laws through the end of June. That’s a pitiful record, made even worse by the fact that Pennsylvania is one of the few states with a full-time legislature. Every other state executive with a divided government has accomplished more.And to be clear, this isn’t a Pennsylvania problem — it’s a Shapiro problem. Many of his predecessors in the commonwealth also faced divided government, including four of the last six governors. Yet, ourresearchshows that they all signed more laws than Shapiro.In failing to deliver on key campaign promises — like cutting red tape, lowering taxes, and delivering scholarships for disadvantaged kids — Shapiro now blames the divided legislature that heonce claimed a mandate to unite. Unfortunately, rather than forging a record of bipartisan leadership,Shapiro’s office now complainsthat he’s the victim of “bad faith attacks from all sides.”After capitulating to pressure from fellowDemocratsin the House,Shapiro was forced to veto his own campaign promiseproviding Lifeline/PASS Scholarships to low-income kids trapped in failing and unsafe schools. In doing so, he violated the deal he struck with SenateRepublicans, resulting in lost trust and strained relationships with the legislature. Worse yet, despite repeatedly pledging to “fight for your kids as if they were my own” and calling the scholarship program “unfinished business,” Shapiro again turned his back on our most vulnerable children by refusing to fight for them in this year’s budget negotiations.Pennsylvanians are already starting to show how the rest of America would likely react if Shapiro joined a national ticket. Innew polling, we found that 54% of voters either don’t think or don’t know if the governor has delivered major accomplishments. That’s not the kind of ringing endorsement that Kamala Harris wants or needs.And even those who think Shapiro has delivered accomplishments are hard-pressed to name any. They generally praise his public statements or simply say he’s “doing a good job” or he’s “for the people.” Only 7%can point to a single concrete action: repairing the collapsed bridge onI-95last year.Rebuilding a bridge is undoubtedly important, but when it comes to governing, Shapiro has proven more adept at burning bridges with fellow lawmakers than building them.These aren’t the actions of a vice president in the making. Just the opposite: They paint a picture of a governor who’s overhyped in the national media yet underperforming in his own state. Kamala Harris is surely giving Shapiro a look, but if she’s smart, she’ll pass him over for someone else — someone with a record of achievement.It would be truly shocking if Josh Shapiro was on the national ticket in 2024. And if he doesn’t start doing the hard work to deliver moderate and bipartisan wins, he won’t have much of a chance at claiming any other national office down the road, either.Erik Telford is senior vice president of public affairs at the Commonwealth Foundation, Pennsylvania’s free-market think tank."
minnpost_2024_19,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.If you pay any attention to politics and polling, you have likely heard that your friends and neighbors are not very happy with the direction of the country. You might not be, either.OneABC News/Ipsos surveyin November 2023 showed three-quarters of Americans believed the country was on the “wrong track.” Only 23% believed it was headed in the “right direction.”And the survey was not an outlier. Poll after poll shows a sizable majority of the nation’s residents disapprove of its course.Have Americans —long seen as upbeat, can-do optimists— really grown dour about the state of the nation and where it’s headed?The answer, we think, is yes and no. Or, to be more direct, as the researchers who run theAmerican Communities Project, which explores the differences in 15 different types of community in the United States, we believe the surveys are asking a question with no real meaning in the United States in 2024 — a question that may have outlived its usefulness.“Do you feel things in the country are generally going in the right direction, or do you feel things have gotten off on the wrong track?”That question or one very much like it is well known to anyone who has glanced at a poll story or studied the data of a survey in the past 50 years.These public opinion surveys, often sponsored by news organizations, seek to understand where the public stands on the key issues of the day. In essence, they tell the public about itself. Political parties and candidates often conduct their own surveys with a version of the “right direction/wrong track” question to better understand their constituencies and potential voters.The American Communities Project, based at Michigan State University, uses demographic and socioeconomic measures to break the nation’s 3,100 counties into 15 different types of communities — everything from what we label as “big cities” to “aging farmlands.” In our work with the project, we’ve found a strong reason to be skeptical of the “right direction/wrong track” question. Simply put, the divisions in the country have rendered the question obsolete.In 2023,we worked with Ipsos to survey more than 5,000 peopleacross the country in all those community types. We asked the survey participants what issues they were concerned about locally and nationally. How did they feel about the Second Amendment? About gender identity? About institutional racism? We found a lot of disagreement on those and other controversial issues.But there were also a few areas of agreement. One of the big ones: In every community we surveyed, at least 70% said the country was on the “wrong track.” And that is an astonishing finding.Why was that response so surprising?The community types we study are radically different from each other. Some are urban and some are rural. Some are full of people with bachelor’s degrees, while others have few. Racially and ethnically, some look like America as it is projected to be in 30 years — multicultural — and some look like the nation did 50 years ago, very white and non-Hispanic. Some of the communities voted for President Joe Biden by landslide numbers in 2020, while others did the same for Donald Trump.Given those differences, how could they be in such a high level of agreement on the direction of the country?To answer that question, we visited two counties in New York state in January that are 3½ hours and several worlds away from each other: New York County, which is labeled a “big city” in our typology and encompasses Manhattan, and Chenango County, labeled “rural middle America” in our work, located in the south-central part of the state.In 2020,Biden won 86% of the vote in big metropolitan Manhattan, and Trump won 60%in aging, rural Chenango.When we visited those two counties, we heard a lot of talk of America’s “wrong track” in both places from almost everyone. More important, we heard huge differences in “why” the country was on the wrong track.“If something don’t change in the next election, we’re going to be done. We’re going to be a socialist country. They’re trying to tell you what you can do and can’t do. That’s dictatorship, isn’t it? Isn’t this a free country?” said James Stone, 75, in Chenango County.Also in Chenango County, Leon Lamb, 69, is concerned about the next generation.“I’m worried about them training the kids in school,” he said. “You got kids today who don’t even want to work. They get free handouts … I worked when I was a kid … I couldn’t wait to get out of the house. I wanted to be on my own.”In New York City, meanwhile, Emily Boggs, 34, a theater artist, bartender and swim instructor, sees things differently as she struggles to make ends meet.“We’ve been pitched since we were young, that like, America is the best country in the world. Everyone wants to be here, you’re free, and you can do whatever you want,” Boggs said. “And it’s like, well, if you have the money … I’ve got major issues with millionaires and billionaires not having to pay their full share of taxes, just billionaires existing … It’s the inequality.”A lifelong New York City resident, Harvey Leibovitz, 89, told us: “The country is on the wrong direction completely. But it’s based upon a very extreme but significant minority that has no regard to democracy, and basically, in my opinion, is racist and worried about the color of the population.”To be clear, we are not saying that asking people about the direction of the country is completely worthless. There may be some value in chronicling Americans’ unhappiness with the state of their country, but as a stand-alone question, “right direction/wrong track” is not very helpful. It’s the beginning of a conversation, not a meaningful measure.It turns out that one person’s idea about the country being on the wrong track may be completely the opposite of another person’s version of America’s wrong direction.It’s easy to grasp the appeal of one broad question aimed at summarizing people’s thoughts. But in a complicated and deeply fragmented country, a more nuanced view of the public’s perceptions of the nation would help Americans understand more about themselves and their country.Dante Chinniis the director of the American Communities Project at Michigan State University.Ari Pinkusis the manager of the American Communities Project at Michigan State University.This article is republished from The Conversation."

The team should honor the crucial role immigrants play in its success.Nine years ago, I moved to Philadelphia from France. I had always loved the U.S., its culture and history, so when I got a job in sales, I jumped at the opportunity.I loved so much about Philadelphia right away — including, of course,the food. (I believe it is thebest food city in the nation, thanks, in part, to thediversity of the culinary scene. But other aspects of the place took a bit longer for me to embrace. One was baseball.I was raised playing soccer and watching soccer and always thought baseball was boring. I know many people — including Americans — who agree.But as I’ve watched the Phillies over the years, I’ve gotten hooked. And I see so many other immigrants who love baseball as much as I do, including many who play for the team. Nine of the team’s 26 players, or nearly one-third of the roster, wereborn outside the U.S.For this reason, and many others, Citizens Bank Park should add an Immigrant Heritage Night every year.» READ MORE:How a Phillies game connected a bunch of strangers (and started an epic group text chain | OpinionThis month is the perfect opportunity, asJune is Immigrant Heritage Month. Every year, the city of Philadelphia’s Office of Immigrant Affairs asks for submissions fromevents that promote immigrants, their cultures, and what they contribute to our great city. It’s an important time for me, as an immigrant myself, because I spent most of my career in Philadelphia working with immigrants.Immigrants have become an increasingly important part of Philadelphia. Today, people born outside the U.S.make up nearly 16% of the city’s population, the largest proportion since the 1940s, and we are driving Philly’sgrowth in jobs and population. If anything, Philadelphia needsmore immigrantsto fill open jobs and pay taxes to boost our city’s revenue and economy.Ensuring that immigrants are recognized, valued, and respected has been part of my journey in the U.S., and this is why this is personal to me.Over the years, baseball — specifically, the Phillies — has become personal to me, too.For years, baseball was one aspect of American culture I just didn’t get. To me, it looked like a bunch of overpaid dudes standing around, waiting for a ball to fall from the sky into their gloves. Then, during the 2022 season, when the Philliesmade the playoffs (and the World Series! after a long stretch of bad years, my wife’s American family forced me to watch all the games. They went all in, waving towels at home in front of the TV, and talking constantly about the team. I figured, if I was going to get into it, I might as well get into it.I bought theBaseball Field Guideto start understanding the rules. And my mind was blown.I had no idea how much control the pitcher must exert, trying to put the ball exactly where he wants in the tiny rectangle of the strike zone so that the ball is hit in a certain way. There are so many different types of pitches to choose from, and all of the details of the sport — including the data and statistics gathered every game — made it feel different from any other. Plus,this team feels special, like theygenuinely like each other; they’re easy to root for.Last season, I watched probably 150 out of the 162 games they played, and I don’t expect this year to be any different. (Especiallygiven their current streak. I consider myself a die-hard fan, and I spend more money than I should on Phillies gear.More than the sport, what I love is its diversity. There’sno other major sport in the U.S.that has a higher proportion of immigrants playing the game at the highest levels. According to the MLB,264 players — nearly 28% of the league — are foreign-born. Nearly 20 countries are represented. (Still no French players, but I can be patient. More than the sport, what I love is its diversity.Both of last year’s MVPs —Ronald Acuña Jr. and Shohei Ohtani— are immigrants. Ranger Suárez, who is from Venezuela,just made history as the first Phillies pitcher to go 9-0in his first nine starts of the season. Reliever José Alvarado made national news last year because of thestruggle he had to go through to be reunited with his familyafter the visa process was thrown into turmoil when the U.S.suspended diplomatic relations with Venezuela. This is something only immigrants can understand and relate to.The Phillies should do something to recognize these important players and theirexperiences as immigrants.Hosting an Immigrant Heritage Night could also help restore the Phillies’ historic — and historically bad — reputation over race. In 1947, the Phillies manager led the team inshouting racist taunts at Jackie Robinson, and the Phillies didn’t admit their first Black player until 1957, thelast in the National League to do so. The team’s first Black player to reach star status, Dick Allen, wasnever given the treatment he deserved, receiving boos, jeers, and death threats; he wore a helmet to protect himself against fans’ glass bottles.But in 2020,the Phillies finally recognized Allen for his incredible talent by retiring his number. This is proof that change and recognition can happen.All year long, the Phillies celebrate different communities and important issues. Next month, there aregames devoted to Pride and Jewish heritage, and later this season, the park will honor German and Italian heritages. This is commendable, and something the organization should keep doing.I simply suggest adding one more theme event, an Immigrant Heritage Night, to recognize immigrants the same way we recognize many other communities. Let’s celebrate the great players and fans who made Philly their home and have a huge impact on the team.And when it happens, I’ll be there at Citizens Bank Park, cheering for the best team in baseball.Ben Rush-Goebelis director of programs at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_242,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°With President Joe Biden now locked in the basement, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are engaged in a two-step over where and when to debate. The standoff reflects poorly on both campaigns and on the state of American politics.Trump has appeared in one debate — a June performance on CNN at which the doddering Biden sealed his own fate. Panicked Democrats responded by sending the president to the showers and replacing him with Harris. Trump and Biden had previously agreed to a second debate on Sept. 10 to be hosted by ABC. Now that Biden is out of the picture, however, Trump has other thoughts. He says he instead wants to debate Harris on Fox News on Sept. 4. The Harris campaign, of course, wants no part of that.But here’s a radical thought. How about both? And how about adding Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to the stage, along with any other candidate who appears on enough state ballots to win the Electoral College? It is a blight on many modern-day politicians that they cower at the challenge of a potentially hostile audience or questioner. Insisting on only controlled or friendly environments — and embracing a two-party monopoly on the debate process — reveals a lack of intellectual confidence and is the opposite of statesmanship. It is certainly no way to build trust or an accord with voters.Trump, to his credit, did agree to the Biden debate on CNN, a network not known for regarding the former president with warmth. He also recently spoke at the annual conference of the National Association of Black Journalists, many members of which are openly hostile to his existence. Harris, meanwhile, has been kept on a short lease since Democrats unceremoniously tossed Biden out the back door of the campaign bus.The Harris campaign accused Trump of “running scared” regarding debates. It’s an odd charge from a candidate who hasn’t made an unscripted media appearance since being anointed the Democratic standard-bearer.Trump should gain the upper hand and agree to the Sept. 10 ABC event and then insist on a second debate with Harris on Fox News. If the vice president refuses to attend the latter, it would speak volumes about her courage and mettle. If she’s hesitant to answer demanding questions about her record or agenda, she’s in the wrong line of work and is ill-prepared to handle the rigors of the toughest job in the world.— Las Vegas Review-JournalNestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.A new website launched recently helps Hawaii residents and visitors easily find recreational services available across the state."

Worse yet — a public health crisis they are in no hurry to address.In a related Times article, Murthy said,“I don’t think we can solely rely on the hope that the platforms can fix this problem on their own… They’ve had 20 years.”SAVE-Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, a 35-year-old suicide prevention organization based in Minnesota and working throughout the U.S., applauds the Surgeon General for raising this issue to the level he has in recent years.Do we believe warning labels on social media apps and platforms is a good idea?Absolutely. The quicker we can do it, the better.Warning labels can make clear that social media platforms are addictive, unleash predators on children, and foster an environment that harms youth mental health, leading to increased suicidal ideation and suicide.Are they the end-all-be-all solution to the clear and present danger to youth from the harms of social media?Absolutely not.The real solution is in the hands of state and national policymakers. It is time to pass legislation that responds not to Big Tech grievances about lost profit but to the concerns of parents who are losing their children.Even in his New York Times op-ed, the Surgeon General made it clear that warning labels aren’t the primary solution. According to the Times in its related piece,“He also called on tech companies to make changes: to share internal data on the health impact of their products; to allow independent safety audits; and restrict features like push notifications, autoplay and infinite scroll, which, he says, “prey on developing brains and contribute to excessive use.”In Congress there is a bill in both the House and Senate called the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA that has burgeoning bipartisan support. If the bill were called up for a vote in the U.S. Senate today, there are at least 70 Democrat and Republican votes to pass it. In the House, a growing chorus of bipartisan voices are pushing the legislation forward.KOSA would require reasonable measures be taken to prevent harm to youth — to protect them from online bullying, harassment, sexual exploitation, predatory marketing and other features. It doesn’t block access to social media, it doesn’t censor content, and it doesn’t violate the First Amendment rights we should all hold sacrosanct.In Minnesota, the Minnesota Kids Code would require Big Tech to design their products and services to protect children, and to prioritize online privacy and safety for children by restricting data collection and profiling of minors.Unfortunately, Big Tech’s financial backing stopped the Minnesota Kids Code from passing this legislative session. SAVE and a growing coalition of supporters intend to bring it back in the next.The same money that blocked passage of the Minnesota Kids Code is hard at work today in Washington, D.C. Online companies are spending millions trying to undermine and defeat the Kids Online Safety Act.A recent pollrecent pollby Public Policy Polling shows that 81% of Americans want President Biden and Congress to pass laws addressing social media’s harm to children and teens.A whopping 78% support passing the bipartisan Kids Online Safety Act.So, what are We, the People, to do? Faced with a crisis that is threatening the lives and futures of our children, do we allow Big Tech to block the passage of laws to protect youth from social media in defiance of the will of the People?Or do We, the People, fight back by calling on our elected officials in Minnesota and Washington, D.C., to do the right thing for our children?SAVE is fighting because our mission of suicide prevention requires us to raise our voices and be heard: There is a clear and present danger facing our youth.

eugeneweekly_2024_7,"We ve got issues. I’m not an avid social media user, so when “influencer” Alex Haraus (@alex.harauson Instagram , who hit the big time with his activism working to stop the Willow Oil Drilling Project in Alaska, got involved with the effort to call attention to how important our last remaining old-growth forests are, and wanted to help drive public comments on a proposed national policy to protect these public forests last summer, you could color me skeptical. Half a million public comments later, call me a believer in the power of these platforms to raise awareness and transform casual video viewers into action-takers for our forests and climate. Now, as a more comprehensive draft plan for old-growth forest protection is rolled out for public feedback, I’m hoping Haraus’ feature-length film,Crown Jewels, can inspire even more action for our forests this summer. Back in December, the U.S. Forest Service announced a proposed nationwide forest plan amendment to advance protections for the remaining old-growth trees in all of the country’s national forests. A draft environmental impact statement for this amendment was just released in June, and it could add new restrictions on old-growth logging. It’s a step toward fulfilling the President’s Earth Day 2022 Executive Order 14072, which directed federal agencies to develop policies to protect mature and old growth forests on federal lands as a natural carbon and climate solution. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. But one step doesn’t win the race. While this could be the first-ever national policy to protect old-growth forests on Forest Service-managed lands from commercial logging, it needs to eliminate loopholes that can still send old-growth trees to the mill, and it needs to include meaningful protections for mature forests (future old-growth as well. The outcomes of this process, and how meaningful they actually are, will depend on how far the public can push the agency and the Executive Branch to establish enforceable protections. Here in Oregon, we know full well how important our last remaining ancient forests are. They’re home to imperiled wildlife, they filter and cool our drinking water, and we visit them for recreation, renewal and to practice cultural traditions. Many of us have been working for decades to stop old-growth logging sales, protect roadless wildlands and enact policies that keep these forests intact for the many benefits — practical and intrinsic — they provide. Haraus’ film, debuting in Eugene next week, explores these themes as his film crew travels from the rolling hills of West Virginia to the serene valleys of Wisconsin and to the temperate rainforest of Oregon. More than that, through grassroots storytelling, the film makes a case for protecting mature and old-growth forests across the federal estate and shows how the audience can help. Watching a film is also just one step. With hundreds of thousands of acres of mature and old-growth forests still on the chopping block on our federal public lands, much is at stake. After decades of clearcutting Oregon’s ancient forests, and as we stand on the brink of a climate catastrophe, protecting mature and old-growth trees is a critical natural climate solution that will have a meaningful impact on the climate and biodiversity crises. We have a moral imperative to act boldly for future generations. These forests could be lost forever, unless we can demonstrate widespread support for protecting them. Let’s get to work.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_184,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°Bill 121 will cause‘financial harm’Bill 121 will cause‘financial harm’For months, in response to public outcry, proponents of Bill 121 have been saying “the public is just confused” or they “misunderstand.”At the Windward Planning Commission hearing last month, these comments turned accusatory: “The public is being fed misinformation” and they are testifying to “what they have been told to say.”Setting aside the offensive nature of these comments — which would suggest that the public is either too stupid to understand or too gullible and is being manipulated — I assure you most of the folks testifying do, in fact, understand the bill as it applies to them. Certainly, better than the county does.Under current law, hosted rentals do not require a permit. There is no verified data specific to hosted rentals, operators or their properties, and the county hasn’t performed any studies to try to comprehend the scope of the proposed impact to Hawaii County.The Appleseed report referenced by the drafters was published prior to Bill 108, does not perform independent research, nor does it address the differences between hosted and unhosted rentals, and doesn’t contemplate the economic impact of its various recommendations if enacted.Hawaii Island is not San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York. And we are not Maui. Contrary to the current narrative, according to the 2023 annual Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism publication cited by the Appleseed report, since 2017 the number of vacation rental units on Hawaii Island has decreased by 3.6%.To paint this island with the broad brush of generalized statistics is a disservice to the community at best and a grave economic miscalculation with ripple effects, at worst. The county needs to listen to its residents, perform an economic impact survey, and work on fair, consistent and accountable enforcement of existing laws.This legislation is clumsy, overreaching and short-sighted. The only guaranteed result is financial harm. Do better.Jennifer WilkinsonKailua-KonaMore EV stationsare sorely neededEvery week, I read about the upcoming bills which almost always have funding or other kinds of support for affordable housing. I never see anything that includes charging stations in the parking lots of these buildings.Mohouli Senior Residence, a relatively new complex, has around 200 people in its three phases, but not one place to charge an electric vehicle. Where does this lack of planning originate? Is it the contractor, the County of Hawaii rules or the mayor himself?We are watching China bust out EV, and I’ll bet they understand that whoever buys these cars must charge them.Some forward thinking individuals have their homes set up to do this, but what about apartment buildings and condos?I did see a station in front of the mayor’s office, so I guess his car is taken care of.Toby S.

minnpost_2024_124,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Last month marked two years since — thanks to Donald Trump — the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and erased nearly five decades of precedent that gave women across the country the right to abortion care and kept the politics of MAGA Republicans out of the doctor’s office.Since then, we’ve been witness to the power grabs of extreme Republicans as they continue to implement draconian bans and endanger women’s lives.Minnesota has become an island for abortion access for women who have fallen victim to the bans made possible by Trump and his MAGA Republican allies — including the over three million women in the Midwest who now live under a ban. Hundreds of women travel every week to our state to access the care they need; in fact, the need for abortion care in Minnesota has risenalmost 36%since the fall of Roe.Minnesota has had to expand our clinics to ensure that we can see every single patient who has been forced to travel to receive the care they need. However, even as we face the pressure and consequences of Trump and Republicans’ cruelty, I’m proud that our state remains a beacon of light for women.Our role as a refuge for abortion seekers can’t be overstated. Now that the Iowa Supreme Court hasdecided to enforceMAGA Republicans’ draconian ban — one that bans abortion before many women even know they’re pregnant — that role will become even more essential.Every abortion ban that goes into effect is a result of Trump’s radical, anti-choice agenda. He has continuously boasted about his role in orchestrating the fall ofRoe, even going so far as to say he was “very honored” to have terminated it, and thinks that these bans that are putting women’s lives at risk are “working very brilliantly.”Trump’s war on women’s freedoms didn’t stop withRoe’s overturn. Republicans in states likeAlabama,Texasand, yes,Iowahave put IVF in jeopardy. Louisiana legislators justcriminalizedthe possession of safe and effective abortion medication, and Trump recentlyleft the door opento banning it nationwide. And now, women across America are anxiously waiting as the Supreme Court weighs women’s ability to access mifepristone and emergency reproductive care.Minnesota is a staunch, pro-choice state. I was proud to join my DFL colleagues in the Legislature and Gov. Tim Walz in aligning with the beliefs oftwo-thirdsof Minnesota voters byfurther enshriningabortion rights into state law and safeguarding women’s freedom to travel for abortion care. We believe in protecting the autonomy of every single woman in our state — and of all those who have had to shoulder the burden that Trump and Republicans have created.Meanwhile, Trump continues to tout his anti-freedom agenda to ban abortion nationwide. The horror-inducing bans we’re seeing states enact across the country and across the Midwest — including the same bans that have required womento carry nonviable pregnanciesand forced young girlsto give birth— have made our state a health care island. His crusade against reproductive freedom is why we’re committed to reelecting President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in November.President Biden and Vice President Harris are the only people at the top of the ticket who will defend women’s freedoms. They’re fighting toensure accessto emergency medical care, protect women from Republicans’ efforts torestrict contraceptionand safeguard women’s ability to travel for care. Minnesota will continue to be a shelter for women who need access to abortion care, including women in Iowa.However, our fight can only continue if we send President Biden and Vice President Harris back to the White House. If Trump receives a second term as president, he will enact a national ban and overturn all of the work our DFL leaders have done to make Minnesota a safe haven for abortion access — not just for Minnesotan women, but for all of the women who need it.Minnesotans don’t take attacks on our freedoms lightly. We have already rejected Trump and his anti-freedom agenda twice — and we’ll do it again this November.State Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Burnsville, represents Senate District 55 and is co-chair of the Legislature’s Reproductive Freedom Caucus."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_254,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°It’s outrageous that the Supreme Court is allowing states and cities to criminalize homelessness and that Gov. Gavin Newsom is ordering encampments dismantled.I was homeless for 6½ years, from 2002 to 2008, a story I’ve told before in these pages. I know what it’s like when no one cares about you or your living situation.I never pushed a shopping cart, never slept in a city park or on a sidewalk or in a tent encampment, never took drugs and never panhandled. I paid for all my food and for nightly stays in my Toyota pickup in state, city and federal parks.I worked the whole time I was homeless, mostly on computers in libraries, maintaining a freelance writing business and doing public relations consulting. I intermittently had cellphone service, and I had an email address, so most of my clients had no idea of my situation. But during an economic downturn, I couldn’t make enough money to rent a room or apartment.Campgrounds have limits on how long you can stay, so I moved around a lot, mostly in Southern California, sometimes in Montana, where I once lived.I met a lot of people on the move and out of luck. At one campground’s entrance, a school bus picked up a homeless family’s child every morning. A guy I met collected cans on his bicycle and was able to pay for food; he never begged. Once he stashed his cans in a church parking lot; they were thrown out by staff, and he was told never to come back.Eventually, I started getting Social Security and became eligible for Medicare, and my situation improved. I stayed in a cheap motel occasionally. I got needed cataract and knee surgery, recuperating in my pickup or a motel room.When I had enough income to rent an apartment but not enough money for both rent and a deposit, a religious organization helped me out. Finally, I had a shower and a washing machine and a kitchen. I got my stuff out of storage. Finding my family photos and other mementos was like doing an archaeological dig on my former life.I’m 80 now, and fortunate to have Social Security and Veterans Administration income, and I haven’t had to have housing assistance for years. Being homeless seems like a long time ago. But I never forget it.When I see people panhandling, I don’t give them spare change, or even a dollar; I give them a five or a ten or a twenty — and a kind word. At Christmas, I keep $10 bills at the ready. I don’t care if someone is drunk or on drugs. I make no judgment.I don’t like to see tent encampments on sidewalks, or by the freeway, or in parks. But clearing out tents isn’t an answer when there’s no place to go. We need more housing, more programs for mental illness and drug addiction, universal healthcare, maybe even a minimum basic income. And this: more facilities for the homeless to shower and go to the bathroom.I know California has spent billions; it will cost more.A rich nation like the United States should be capable of compassion. Feed the hungry, help the poor, heal the sick, house the homeless, clothe the naked, welcome strangers. Until the Supreme Court and Newsom find a better solution, they ought to start there.In presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."

philinquirer_2024_63,"It’s a huge downer, I know. But I m living proof that giving up alcohol isn t so bad — I sleep better, feel better, save money, and still find plenty of ways to have fun.Dry January is as good a time as any to face a sobering reality: No amount of alcohol is “safe.”This contradicts the story we’ve been told for years, which was that having small amounts of alcohol — say, a glass of red wine at dinner — is healthy, andbetter than not drinking anything at all.That belief was rooted in science — namely, studies that showed moderate drinkers were healthier than people who abstained. But much of that research was imperfect. When studying something as complicated as human beings, there are a lot of factors that can influence a finding. For instance, moderate drinkers may have been wealthier, exercised more, and followed other healthy habits that could explain their longevity, while many people who didn’t drink at all were former heavy drinkers who stopped because they developed health problems.In short, in these studies, the amount of alcohol people drank could have had little to do with how long they lived.Asweeping 2023 reportthat took a fresh look at more than 100 studies published over a span of 40 years concluded that even small amounts of alcohol — less than two drinks per day for women and three drinks for men — is bad for you.That same year, the World Health Organization went even further, declaring thatno amount of alcohol was safe, noting that its risks — at least seven types of cancer, as dangerous as asbestos and radiation — “start from the first drop.”» READ MORE:Even one drink a day may shrink your brain, Penn study suggestsThis is a huge downer, I know. But it’s time to face facts, and we’re not: Despite therecent trendy surge in sober “mocktails,”alcohol remains an integral part of our social infrastructure. According to government data,80% of Americans over the age of 12 have had a drink; according to what I see, even that number feels like an underestimate.Our public health agencies aren’t doing nearly enough to disseminate the fact that alcohol isn’t healthy, even in small amounts. And it’s taking a toll.I get it: Drinking can be great — it can play a key role in calming first date jitters, making it easier for shy coworkers to bond after hours, or surviving an Eagles season. Almost nothing soothes jangled nerves better than thepop-sighsound of opening a beer at the end of a hard day. All of this makes alcohol hard to break away from. I discovered this when I decided to stop drinking a few years ago.I’ll have a glass every few months, maybe, but I gave up my nightly wine with dinner as I rounded middle age, when even a few sips started derailing my sleep. It was an easy decision to make, as in my 40s, feeling well-rested became far more valuable than an extra laugh or two the night before. Plus, I watched alcohol take a toll on my family: three of my four grandparents were extreme alcoholics (evenlost a family business as a result , and my father hid his own habit from me for years.It wasn’t untilhe developed dementiaand I became hisfull-time caregiverthat the truth came out. On one of our many emergency room visits, a doctor who’d never seen my father before took one look at the pattern of blood vessels on his stomach and turned to me. “He’s a heavy drinker,” the doctor said, with a look of certainty that told me this was fact, not opinion.Watching your father’s body break down over the course of 10 years — to the point when hecouldn’t walk, talk, or understand anything happening around him— would be enough to turn anyone off of alcohol.But I found that choosing not to drink put me somewhat on the outs. As a mom, I’m surrounded by wine — or “mommy juice,” as many call it (that alone is telling . Drinking is a part of every parent social event; snow days and weekend meetups become excuses to break out the bubbly before 5 p.m. We’re even supposed todrink wine during art lessons.As a mom, I’m surrounded by wine.The wine culture among moms has created a dangerous trend. Over the last 20 years, alcohol-related health issues have increased among all groups — but the highest spike has been amongwhite, middle-aged women.And in Pennsylvania, where the opioid crisis hasdecimated neighborhoodsand deaths are rising, recent data show thatalcohol kills more people than overdoses.I’ve hesitated to write about this because, like I said, huge downer. But the evidence is irrefutable: Alcohol, even in small amounts, isn’t harmless, and we need to stop pretending that it is. Since I gave it up, I sleep better, feel better, andsave a lot of money. And there’s no shortage of fun in my life.So I encourage everyone (especially women to try Dry January — and Dry February, Dry March, and all the months that follow."

A new Harvardstudyfound that half of U.S. renter households now spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities. And rent increases continue to outpace their income gains.Withother studies confirming thathomelessness grows alongside housing costs, this means many more people are vulnerable. Last year, homelessness hit an all-time national high of653,100 people.In the wealthiest country on the planet, this is unacceptable.The pandemic revealed the full extent of the U.S. housing crisis, with roughly580,000 peoplein 2020 living unhoused during “stay at home” orders. But it also proved that federal intervention could ease the crisis. Eviction moratoria and unemployment reliefhelped keep more people housed, fed, and secure.But these initiatives ended too quickly. With homelessness spiking alongside hunger and child poverty, we need to bring those programs back — and more. We need to prioritize making housing affordable, accessible, and habitable for everyone.Over the past decade, according to the Harvard study, the majority ofgrowthin renter households has come from Millennials and Gen Zers who continue to be priced out of homeownership while also paying more for a declining supply of affordable units.Meanwhile, construction in the high-end “luxury” rental market, which drives up rents for everyone else, remains in anupward trend. And private equity firms like Blackstone, the largest landlord in the U.S., have beenexpandingtheir real estate portfolios. These trends have fueled increasedhousing costsandevictionsacross communities.The Harvard study revealed that our nation’s aging rental stock also needs crucial investment.Nearly half of renterswith disabilities live in homes that are minimally or not at all accessible. Further,around 4 millionrenter households live in units with structural problems and lack basic services like electricity, water, or heat.The lack of decent, affordable housing is a policy choice that can be overcome if our federal, state, and local governments prioritize taking much-needed action. Increasing the supply of affordable housing and expanding rental subsidies for lower income renters will help address this housing crisis. But they will not fully resolve it.Ultimately, it is long past time for our country to change its approach to housing. We need to recognize housing as a human right fundamental to every person’s life, health, and security — instead of as a luxury commodity limited to those who can afford it.International law already recognizes housing as ahuman right. Countries are legallyobligatedto respect, protect, and fulfill this right by enacting relevant policies and budgets to progressively realize adequate housing for all.What might that look like?Possibilities includerent controls, housing assistance programs, reining in corporate landlords, and creating community land trusts and housing cooperatives to build permanently affordable rental units and homes.These affordability measures must be combined with legal protections againstforced evictionsand housing discrimination, along with regulations toensurethat housing is physically habitable and connected to essential services.The housing justice movement keeps growing, thanks to the sustained advocacy of community groups across the country.InCalifornia,Connecticut, and elsewhere, they are pushing for legislation that would recognize the right to housing at the state level. Colorado lawmakers are consideringlegislationthat would offer tenants “just-cause” eviction protections. In Congress, the “Housing is a Human Right Act” introduced last year wouldprovideover $300 billion for housing infrastructure and combating homelessness.The song “Rent” concludes, “Cause everything is rent.” But it shouldn’t have to be.Farrah Hassen, J.D., is a writer, policy analyst, and adjunct professor in the Department of Political Science at Cal Poly Pomona.This commentary was originally published byOtherWords.org."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_192,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°It is never OK to use physical violence against people with whom you disagree. This should be obvious, but the events that unfolded on the UCLA campus early Wednesday show the consequences when that message is lost.Late Tuesday night, a large group of people attacked the anti-war encampment on the Westwood campus. They weren’t campus authorities acting on the university’s order that the camp was “unlawful,” but rather people who disagreed with the pro-Palestinian protesters and decided to clear the camp themselves. It turned ugly quickly.In this era of a video camera in every pocket, we can watch it all in jarring clarity through the many clips posted on social media. It’s shocking to view people rush the barricades, trying to remove the metal and wood barriers and attack one another with fists and sticks and pepper spray.It’s disheartening to hear the vile slurs hurled by counterprotesters and the screams from protesters after a firework launched into the middle of the encampment explodes. This violence continued over the course of hours, although campus officials knew it was going on, and had summoned law enforcement to the campus. Student journalists covering the incident were attacked.Looking back it should have been easy to see this clash coming. Tension had been brewing since the pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment last week and it escalated after Israel supporters set up a protest space nearby, as has been documented by the Daily Bruin.University of California President Michael V. Drake was right to call for a review of the campus administration’s actions. We hope it can determine whether the university could have done more to prevent this from blowing up Tuesday night, why campus security stood by as the violence escalated and why it took about three hours for officers from the Los Angeles Police Department and California Highway Patrol to control the situation. UC leaders have a responsibility to maintain safety and the melee made the campus unsafe for students and personnel.Several faculty have criticized the response as a failure by university, city and state authorities. “Why didn’t the police, UCPD and LAPD, show up? Those in the encampment were defenseless in the face of a violent band of thugs. And no one, wherever they stand politically, is safer today,” David Myers, a professor of Jewish history at UCLA, said.Anyone who is found to have participated in the violence should be held accountable, as Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday, otherwise such attacks are bound to continue as the campus protest movement grows nationwide.Protesters in encampments on college campuses know they could face arrest over trespassing or failure to disperse, which is what happened Thursday morning as police cleared the UCLA encampment and arrested more than 200 people. That’s part of the deal when undertaking acts of civil disobedience. But protesters should not be subject to physical attacks from people who disagree with them.Free speech and protest are foundations of the United States — and it’s been a cornerstone of American university life for decades. It’s unacceptable for anyone to try to silence an opinion they don’t agree with through intimidation and violence.—Los Angeles Times/TNS"
philinquirer_2024_34,"Antisemitic incidents in Pennsylvania have risen 246% since last year. Here s what we can do to combat hate — and give our children a world where they can celebrate their milestones without fear.Last weekend, agroundbreaking took place for the new Tree of Lifesynagogue in Pittsburgh that will have a memorial dedicated to the 11 worshipers who werekilled in 2018, simply because they were Jewish.That same weekend, my family celebrated a significant milestone: my son’s bar mitzvah, a Jewish rite of passage that marks the transition from childhood to adulthood at the age of 13.The bar mitzvah day began with ancient traditions such as prayers and a reading of the Torah, followed by a reception with family and friends. It’s a time for the community to come together to celebrate the young person stepping into their new role, to reflect on childhood and gaze forward to the future.But for my son’s bar mitzvah, I felt something I didn’t expect on one of the most significant days of my life: fear. I was concerned for the safety of my family and guests.I was concerned for the safety of my family and guests.Leading up to the day, I felt compelled to hire security for both the service and the reception. A few years ago, this thought wouldn’t have crossed my mind. However, with the rise in antisemitism, this decision became starkly clear.I’m not the only one living with this fear right now.As second gentleman Doug Emhoff noted at the groundbreaking at the new Tree of Life, “It is a crisis of antisemitism we are undergoingright now in America and the world.”In Pennsylvania alone,nearly 400 antisemitic incidents were reported in 2023, ranging from assault to yelling slurs at Jewish people, to vandalizing property, often with a swastika — an increase of 246% from the previous year.Leading up to my son’s big day, I raised my concerns with community members, who told me that hiring security was a very necessary precaution. A friend reminded me that Jewish communities in Latin America and Europe have relied on such measures for decades.Early in our son’s life, back in 2012, we connected with a family at our local Jewish Community Center. The mother, a Jewish woman from Croatia, told us she thought we in the U.S. were fortunate to not experience the same level of violence andharassment Jews faced in Europe.When I saw her at her own son’s bar mitzvah this past Memorial Day, her sentiments had shifted dramatically. “We now know real antisemitism here,” she said, reflecting an all-too-common sense of unease and vigilance.When I mentioned that I had hired security to friends and family, the overwhelming response was supportive. It was seen as a prudent measure to keep everyone safe.How times have changed.When I was growing up, my family synagogue’s doors were never locked, and guards were unheard of. That was the world I knew and the world I wish for my son or any person seeking a peaceful place to worship. I am angry that we have turned into a society where guards are now needed in a synagogue.The bar mitzvah was a success, filled with laughter, love, and a sense of achievement. Yet as soon as I sat down in the sanctuary, I could feel the presence of a guard. It elicited feelings of both comfort and frustration, and served as a stark reminder of the challenges we face.I don’t want this to become our new normal. We owe it to our children to create a world where they can celebrate their milestones without fear, where the joy of their accomplishments isn’t overshadowed by the threat of violence.It is imperative that we, as a society, address the current climate of antisemitism, racism, and hate in all forms. We must be vigilant and proactive in combating hate. We must work together to ensure that our places of worship, our schools, and our communities are safe for everyone.Of course, changing minds isn’t easy. But there are things each of us can do.Individual actions are crucial. Show pride in your identity — whatever it is. Speak out against antisemitism and all forms of hate, and support anyone who has been targeted.» READ MORE:My Yom Kippur experience in Germany ‘broke my heart open’We must all build alliances across communities, as hatred against one affects us all. Cosponsor events, engage in dialogues with people of other faiths, and participate in community service projects. All of this helps foster mutual respect and understanding.When it comes to antisemitism, we must all promote education about Jewish culture and antisemitism in schools, communities, and workplaces to counteract ignorance and stereotypes. If kids can learn hate, they can also learn tolerance and love.In the short term, although it makes me sad to say it, religious institutions and communities of all faiths must consider enhancing their security.Let’s draw strength from our traditions, our community, and our shared commitment to a better future. I want to ensure that the next generation of Jewish kids celebrating their bar and bat mitzvahs can look back on nothing but fond memories, free from the fear of being hated for who they are.Andrew Goretsky is the regional director for the Philadelphia office of the Anti-Defamation League, serving Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Delaware."

Community violence interventions (CVI and comprehensive reduction programs incorporate a blend of suppression and prevention strategies to address the multifaceted nature of the problem. These initiatives prioritize community engagement, acknowledging that local residents are instrumental in identifying and implementing solutions tailored to their specific needs.To effectively combat gun violence, stakeholders from various sectors, including government agencies, law enforcement, healthcare professionals, educators, community leaders, and advocacy groups, must collaborate closely. This interdisciplinary approach enables the pooling of resources, expertise, and perspectives to devise holistic strategies that address root causes, such as socioeconomic disparities, inadequate access to mental health services, and systemic inequalities.Moreover, fostering partnerships between local governments and businesses can facilitate resource mobilization and support community-based initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. By leveraging the strengths of each sector, these collaborations can enhance the efficacy of prevention efforts, promote early intervention, and provide comprehensive support services for individuals and communities affected by gun violence.Addressing gun violence requires a united front working together to implement evidence-based strategies, engage communities, and advocate for policies that prioritize public safety.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_203,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°California Democrats are demonstrating that they view Sacramento as their own little club, where duly-elected Republicans have no power. This malignant feature of California’s one-party state results in a legislature that seems to us like a mere puppet of the Governor.On Thursday, the state Assembly Democrats made a quick and quiet kill of a bill that would have banned non-disclosure agreements in legislation negotiations in a move that was conniving and obvious proof of an unapologetic cabal with narrow membership — you just need a D next to your name.Assembly Bill 2654, introduced by Assemblyman Vince Fong, R-Bakersfield, would have updated the state’s Political Reform Act of 1974 by banning the use of non-disclosure agreements in crafting legislation for lobbyists, the governor’s staff, a member of the legislature or any public official. It was a direct response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “Panera-gate” debacle last month.In that case, secret negotiations on the legislation gifted some fast food outlets that produce bread an exemption from having to pay fast food workers $20 an hour. The groups involved in those negotiations signed non-disclosure agreements — NDA’s – that prevented the public from ever finding out who asked for the exemption, or why and how the exemption came to exist. The exemption appeared to benefit the Panera fast food bakery change, and with it, an owner of several franchises who happens to be a billionaire campaign contributor to the governor. The Newsom administration has unilaterally claimed that Panera does not qualify from the wage exemption because it does not make bread dough on site, a condition that isn’t in the legislation itself.We’re not so naive to think that all bill-making happens in public; after all, both deals and sausage must be made. But according to the California Business Roundtable, the California Business Properties Association and the National Federation of Independent Business — all of whom wrote in support of the bill — the previous four California gubernatorial administrations did not use NDAs to obfuscate the process of legislating from the people and the press.NDAs may have their role in the corporate world, but they have no place in the legislative process.

minnpost_2024_173,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.My family and I love going to the movies. We like many different genres. While my wife and I go to romcoms, dramas, and comedies, my son and I go to Sci Fi, superhero, and horror films with our nephews and nieces going for the animation and magical fantasy films.No matter the type of movie, we almost always find a hidden jewel or silver lining. It is rare indeed that we say after a film, “Well … we aren’t going to get those two hours back.” It’s even rarer that we feel like walking out of a film.Unfortunately, our optimistic approach to the cinema has changed as Hollywood has created a bizarre new film genre that celebrates pain, depravity and the lowest type of human condition. These new “cutting edge” films place the audience in the middle of the darkest stories through distorted production design, nerve wracking sound and music, and writing and acting that glamourize all sorts of relationship issues.The film makers are motivated by their desire to be avant-garde and artistic in the eyes of their peers.I believe there are four particularly nasty yet critically acclaimed films that belong to this new genre:1 “The Favourite” (2018 with 10 Academy Award nominations.2 “The Power of the Dog”(2021 with 12 Academy Award nominations.3 “The Banshees of Inisherin” (2022 with 9 Academy Award Nominations.4 “Poor Things” (2023 with 11 Academy Award nominations“The Favourite”is set in 1705 Great Britain with a morbid focus on a dark love-hate triangle between Queen Anne, Sarah Churchill and Abigail Hill. The intense depravity of their interactions is only surpassed by the irritating music that bombards the audience during the length of this film. The filmmaker appears to want to increase the pain that the movie goers feel as the pain of the characters increases.The rabbit abuse scene toward the end of this film punctuates our collective pain when Abigail, played by Emma Stone, steps on Anne’s bunny.Another grotesque film that has a rabbit abuse scene (involving dissection is “The Power of the Dog.” This film is set on a large ranch in 1925 Montana. Phil Burbank, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, is a vile character that continually bullies and humiliates his brother George’s wife, Rose, and her son Peter. With multiple scenes of sadism, alcoholism and spitefulness, this film is indeed cruel, brutish, nasty — yet not short.“The Banshees of Inisherin” is another film that showcases and elevates the bizarre. Set in the 1920s on an island off the west coast of Ireland, this movie stars Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell as two friends whose relationship ends in a mire of mental health issues. One of the friends decides to assure the end of their relationship by threatening to and then cutting off his fingers one-by-one when the other friend continues to interact with him.The characters in the film “Poor Things” are simply revolting and monstrous. Set in 1880s Victorian London, some have said that this movie is a feminist revision of Mary Shelly’s novel Frankenstein(1818 . I see it as just another of the new genre of brutally bizarre films that are made to be weird and disgusting and collect Academy Award nominations.Transplanting the brains of babies into adult bodies seems stupid, pointless and cruel. No matter how good the acting or production design, dressing up such a grotesque film with pretty lights does not make its basic savageness acceptable.It does, however, get you lots of award nominations.While critically acclaimed and artistic, these films degrade us and their characters as they callously grind our sensibilities into meaningless dust.Dave Berger of Maple Grove is a retired sociology professor, freelance writer and author."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_297,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°From the moment I learned about hillbillies as a child, I was entranced.Good ol’ boys and girls born high up in the mountains? That’s my parents. People who moved from rural towns to metro areas in search of a better life? Story of both sides of my family. Working class? My upbringing. Lovers of things — food, fashion, music, diction, parties — that polite society ridiculed? Yee-haw! Stubbornly clinging to their ancestral lands and ways? ¡Ajúa!I learned to love bourbon, bluegrass, “Hee Haw” reruns and Jeff Foxworthy’s “You Might Be a Redneck If …” series. As an adult, I drove through the small towns of central and eastern Kentucky and Tennessee, feeling at home in areas even my white friends warned wouldn’t take kindly to “my type.” I might not have outwardly resembled the ‘billies I met — I’m a cholo nerd, after all — but we got along just fine, because they were my brothers and sisters from another madre.That’s why I was intrigued when J.D. Vance’s memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” was released in 2016. From what I heard about it, the familial dysfunction, generational poverty and inherent fatalism that Vance overcame were similar to the pathologies of my own extended clan.The up-from-bootstraps message he preached in interviews was what my parents had always preached, and what I still subscribe to. Vance’s critique of conspicuous consumption among the poor is something everyone should consider. But the parallels between the clean-cut Vance and me only went so far. He was a Yale graduate and venture capitalist, while I’m a community college kid who chose a dying profession. He was far removed from his roots, while I experience mine nearly every other weekend at family parties.More importantly, Vance cast himself as an extraordinary exception to his fellow Appalachians, describing ‘billies’ as encased in a toxic amber that kept them from improving their lot and left them embittered with a country that has moved on without them. My Mexican hillbilly family never had time to whine and mope.My parents’ generation found blue-collar jobs, bought homes and are now retired and enjoying the fruits of their blood, sweat and tears. Most of my cousins got white-collar jobs or joined the public sector. Their children are going straight to four-year universities.We all made it in a society that never gave us a handout and wanted us to fail, embracing it as ours even as we hung on to our rancho traditions. Even Vance expressed admiration for our trajectory, writing in “Hillbilly Elegy” that white Appalachians wallow in pessimism, unlike Latino immigrants, “many of whom suffer unthinkable poverty.”I never got around to reading all of Vance’s memoir — it seemed like poverty porn for the elite he now belonged to. I did read his stream of essays for liberal publications explaining why working-class whites were so enthralled with Donald Trump, a man he would go on to call a “fraud,” “a moral disaster,” “cultural heroin,” “reprehensible” and a “cynical a—hole” who might turn into “America’s Hitler.” I appreciated that Vance didn’t blame immigration for America’s supposed decline as much as other right-leaning pundits did, and even called out Trump for his rank racism.What a difference running for office makes. In 2022, Vance sought a U.S. Senate seat as a Trump-worshiping xenophobe. What changed his mind? Mexicans.“Are you a racist?” a now-bearded Vance cheerily asked in a commercial released for his campaign. “Do you hate Mexicans?” “The media” maligned “us” with those charges, he said — “us” meaning those who supported Trump’s border wall — and went on to claim that unchecked migration under the Biden administration was “killing Ohioans” with “illegal drugs and Democratic voters pouring into this country.” Vance ended his 30-second spot by blaming the “poison coming across the border” for nearly killing his mother, whose struggles with drug addiction Vance documented in his book and a Netflix film.The commercial made California Gov. Pete Wilson’s infamous “They Keep Coming” 1994 reelection ad seem as pro-Mexican as a taco truck. Many Latinos immediately ridiculed Vance’s campaign gambit as the woe-is-me blamefest that it was. But it worked: Trump endorsed him, he won, and he has continued his anti-Mexican crusade ever since.Last year, the senator introduced a bill seeking to establish English as the official national language. He has endorsed the use of American military forces to go after drug cartels in Mexico while opposing amnesty for immigrants illegally in the U.S. and federally funded healthcare for DACA recipients. Last week, Vance supporters received a fundraising plea that called for the deportation of “every single person who invaded our country illegally.”Now, he is Trump’s choice for vice president.Trump has long made clear that he wants nothing but lickspittles surrounding him in a second administration. He also wants someone young enough to implement Trumpism in all branches of American life and government for decades to come. Who better than a 39-year-old white guy from Ohio? Trump is looking toward the future by choosing Vance — but through a lens reflecting the gringo past.Long considered a bellwether state essential for any successful presidential run, Ohio is also an anomaly. White people, who make up 58% of the U.S. population, are 77% of residents in the Buckeye State. Ohio under-indexes for African Americans and Asian Americans but especially Latinos — we’re nearly 20% of this country’s population but just 5% of Ohioans.Vance’s job for Trump is to campaign in Rust Belt swing states, arguing for a defense of whiteness against the browning of America. Neither will explicitly admit that’s what they’re doing — how can they be anti-immigrant when Trump is married to an immigrant and Vance’s wife was born to Indian immigrants?But the proof was visible Monday, on opening night of the GOP convention. Not a single Latino sat in Trump’s VIP section. All three Latinos who spoke propped themselves up, Vance-like, as exemplars of their community and thus worth paying attention to.Maybe Trump’s advisors think that Vance’s background and life story will appeal to Latinos in swing states like Nevada and Arizona.But part of the bootstrap mentality is not to blame others for your circumstances. And Vance has plenty of blame to go around. In “Hillbilly Elegy,” he faulted Appalachian culture for keeping his people down. He now insists that it’s actually his fellow elites who have destroyed the United States. Mexico, Vance now says, is the reason his mother and too many others became addicted to opioids. There is no concept of personal responsibility in Vance’s worldview.Vance is a classic example of a convenenciero — someone who goes through life with no principles other than getting ahead, and no loyalty to a community other than his own. Hillbillies of all backgrounds loathe such pendejos, which is why nearly all of my Southern friends ridiculed “Hillbilly Elegy” and warned the liberals enamored with it that they were propping up a false prophet. Now, Vance has a very good chance of becoming the second-most powerful person in the United States — courtesy of Trump, the undisputed king of false prophets. Heaven help us all.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_278,"Monday, Sept. 02, 2024|Today s Paper|79.151°The detention in France of Pavel Durov, founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram, has sparked a loud outcry about free speech. Elon Musk has portrayed the arrest on his X account as an ominous threat to free speech, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. referred to the app as an “encrypted, uncensored” platform and said “the need to protect free speech has never been more urgent.”It’s a curious case, and the French government hasn’t helped matters by releasing information in dribs and drabs. While it is possible that there are free speech issues entangled here, some early details suggest the issue may be one of criminal activity.On Monday, the French prosecutor said in a statement that Durov — who is a citizen of France, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis and the United Arab Emirates — was being held for questioning in connection with an investigation into criminal activities on the app, including the trading of child sexual abuse material as well as drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering. Notably, Telegram explicitly boasts that it has never disclosed user data to any government, ever.Questions have long swirled around Telegram. Contrary to widespread belief, Telegram is not encrypted in any meaningful sense. That would be “end to end” encryption, so that even the company couldn’t read users’ messages. Telegram — and anyone it chooses — can read all group chats, and there is no way to fully encrypt them. Those very large groups are the main attraction of the platform.Private chats on Telegram also lack end-to-end encryption by default. Here, though, users can undergo an onerous process to turn on end-to-end encryption, which then applies only to that conversation. Even the protection provided to private chats is murky: Cryptography experts have long questioned whether Telegram’s limited encryption actually meets security standards.Durov was born in Russia, where Telegram is used widely. The Kremlin has Durov’s back: It issued a statement that unless more evidence is provided, Durov’s detention may be “a direct attempt to limit freedom of communication.” Russian anti-war activists have long wondered how the Kremlin seems to know so much about their activities on Telegram. (Good question. Free speech is an important value, but protecting it does not mean absolving anyone of responsibility for all criminal activity. Ironically, Telegram’s shortage of end-to-end encryption means the company is likely to be more liable simply because itcansee the criminal activity happening on its platform. If, for example, Telegram did not cooperate with authorities at all after receiving legal warrants for information about criminal activities, that would mean trouble even in the United States, with its sweeping free speech protections.This article originally appeared inThe New York Times.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyNEW YORK — Coco Gauff’s U.S. Open title defence ended in a 6-3 4-6 6-3 loss to fellow American Emma Navarro in the fourth round on Sunday, the reigning women’s champion becoming the latest big name to make an early exit at Flushing Meadows this year."
minnpost_2024_108,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Can you still use a check to make purchases? In increasing numbers of stores across the U.S., the answer is “no.” Minneapolis-based retailer Targetstopped accepting checkson July 15, 2024. It follows decisions adecade earlier by supermarketchainsWhole FoodsandAldito no longer accept this form of payment.Target said it was phasing out checks becausenot many customers use them. It’s a fair point:Check usage has fallen dramaticallyaround the world in recent decades.However, as abusiness schoolprofessorwho studies how people pay for goods and services, I wonder if Target might have another, unspoken motivation. After all, customers started the switchaway from checks years ago. What’s new today is a rise incheck fraud.Checks have been arounda long time — centuries, in fact. Paper checks are simply directions telling banks how much money to move from one account to another. Today, these directionstake anywhere from a few daysto a few weeks to be carried out. That’s why stores prefer customers pay with debit cards, which act like checks butremove money from an account immediately.Checks were a huge part of the U.S. economy only a few decades ago. The Federal Reserve, the U.S.’s central bank,processed 17 billion checks a year back in 2000, compared with 3 billion today.While the Fed doesn’t process every check — for example,checks written between accounts at the same bankdon’t go through the Fed system — the numbers offer a sense of the overall decline. In 2000, the average American wrote roughly 60 checks cleared by the Fed each year, compared with about nine today.Until 20 years ago, all checks had to be physically returned to the person writing the check after they were processed so that the writer could make sure the amount they wrote the check for matched what was deducted from their account. Years ago, I paid all my bills by check, and each month, my bank would send a fat envelope — which I never opened — containing my canceled checks.To physically return all the checks, the government maintained a special fleet of planes that each night flew canceledchecks around the country. Then in2004, a new law allowed banks to send customers picturesof their checks, which eliminated the need to fly them.While the Fed may be processing 80% fewer checks than it was in the early 2000s, its data shows the average person is still writing at least nine checks a year. So who is writing all those checks? The answer includes many people who deny ever writing checks.Let me explain. Many people now use their bank’sonline bill payment service. While many of these payments are done electronically,payments to smaller businesses and individuals are doneby the bank writing a check on your behalf.Plus, there are still people who write outchecks to landlords, contractors, charities and government agencies. Manypeople still give checksat weddings, births and other special occasions. Last, manybusinesses still write checks to other businesseswhen paying their bills.Given that checks are still being used — albeit less often than before — why are businesses like Target, Whole Foods and Aldi refusing them? I think an important part of the story is thatcheck fraud is becoming rampantin the U.S.The U.S. Treasury has a dedicated department that fights monetary crimes, called theFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCen for short. FinCen gets “Suspicious Activity Reports” from banks about activities from money laundering to loan fraud. FinCen reports that the number of check fraud caseshas exploded since 2020, nearly doubling from 2021 to 2022.One of thebiggest places where this fraud occurs are checks writtenat the cash register. As the Atlanta Fed points out, “Anyone with graphics software and a high-quality printer can readily turn out counterfeit checks.”Merchants are hit with a double whammy when check fraud occurs. First, they lose the merchandise, which cannot be sold to a legitimate customer. Then, unlike shoplifting, the store is faced with more financial pain because most banks chargeboth the merchantand thecheck writerwhen a counterfeit check is presented. Both sides are charged because the Federal Reservecharges high fees for returninguncollectable checks.Target’s most recentannual report mentioneda problem with theft, saying, “We continue to experience higher inventory shrink, as a percentage of sales, relative to historical levels.” Translated into plain language, this means people are stealing more from Target than they have in the past.The increase in check fraud means Target’s recent announcement will likely be repeated soon by other chains. I expect in the futureonly stores like Costco, which photograph every member and has every customer’s address on file, will allow checks.Since retailers often raise prices when check fraud happens to cover the losses, curbing check fraud lowers prices and is in the interest of every honest consumer.And for those stores worried about increasing check,debitandcredit card fraud, there is a simple answer: Encourage your customers to use cash. Paper money is safe and secure, and once handed over, any retailer knows the transaction is paid. Going old-school withpaper moneyhas real benefits.Jay L.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_151,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°As an American doctor, I felt called to help Palestinians who have faced a collapsing health care system in Gaza. My first trip was in March and I returned for another mission earlier this month, before the Israeli military assault on Rafah, in southern Gaza, which has been catastrophic. Now we have no way out.Israel’s seizure of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt has complicated our medical team’s departure from Gaza, which was coordinated with the World Health Organization and scheduled for Monday.We have been at the European Hospital in Khan Yunis, near Rafah. If we leave, and no new mission can get in, the patients here will be abandoned and terrified. More than 1 million people had taken refuge in Rafah during the Israeli bombardment of northern Gaza, and hundreds of thousands have now been forced to flee the area amid Israel’s offensive here.Our patients ask me where they should go, to which hospital. They tell me that some facilities are still open and ask my opinion of them. What do I say? The patients know full well about the destruction of the Al Shifa and Nasser hospitals. They know patients have been killed with IV lines and catheters still inside, and they believe that will be their fate as well if they are left alone and vulnerable to the Israeli forces.Meanwhile, limited humanitarian aid is getting in. The medical supplies entering Gaza often come in with new volunteers. I brought eight pieces of checked luggage, full of wound-care supplies for this mission. We get patients with wounds over 60% to 80% of their bodies, but we don’t even have absorbent pads to keep their wounds dry, which is necessary to prevent hypothermia.The Rafah invasion is also worsening the displacement of both the patients’ and the medical staff’s families. Given the hospital’s staffing shortages, families are doing half the work of the nurses. They help turn patients. They help change their diapers. They transfer them to the clinic and back to the ward. They feed them. The patients would be nowhere without their families.If the hospital were abandoned or their families were forced to evacuate, I have no clue how these patients would survive, especially those with amputations restricting their movement. I imagine the patients saying a final goodbye to their loved ones.Some doctors and nurses have been volunteering here for a long time. Some of us have been to Gaza several times. Yet we continue to be shocked by the cruelty. We are not used to this degree of carnage. Even the local staff continues to be shocked.The local medical staff have avoided telling the patients that our team may have to evacuate before the next set of aid workers can arrive, for fear it would cause a massive panic. Nobody likes talking about evacuation. I can tell they don’t even like to use the word. Even if as doctors, we can’t save people given the limited resources, at least as foreigners, we can provide some protection, standing as a shield against a potential massacre of the patients.We are still working with the WHO to leave safely, despite the Rafah border closing. Though, it is disturbing that on our planned exit date, a United Nations-marked vehicle was shot at and a foreign aid worker killed.In the meantime, we will continue to see our patients and provide medical care for as long as we are here. Our organization’s next team is waiting in Cairo, hoping to start their mission.I remain inspired by the fortitude of the people I’ve met. When some of my patients are under conscious sedation for their dressing changes, their inner selves come out, and many of them call to God. One patient repeated the shahada — the Muslim testimony of faith. Another whose voice I hadn’t heard before raised his hands to the air as he woke, making dua, a prayer of supplication to God.I hope that the border crossing will reopen and that a new team with more resources will arrive. I hope for a cease-fire to end this man-made humanitarian disaster. For now, as long as I am able to testify to the strength of people in Gaza and share that with the world.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

leoweekly_2024_17,"The Olympics are a platform for some of the fastest, strongest, and most determined athletes in the world. Television coverage invites us into a small part of their worlds, briefly, and we are often moved by the experience. “Citius, Altius, Fortius”: “Faster, Higher, Stronger” was the Olympic motto until 2021.The Olympics are also a platform for the host nation. A national Chamber of Commerce fantasy. Paris took advantage of this and painted a bright and bold masterpiece soaked in everything the world expected from the French, and lots it did not but is better for it. There were missteps, of course. (Small poor nations shouldn’t have to ride in the Opening Ceremony like refugees in tiny boats in the actual wake of the large nations’ athletes in their luxurious barges. The unintended metaphor wasterrible(in a French accent . (And it was “In-Seine” to force triathletes to swim in the city river that, even according to Paris officials, straddled the too-much-fecal-matter line daily, or hourly .That aside the use of the iconic architecture of one of the world’s most beautiful cities for the Opening Ceremony and for sports venues and backdrops was inspired. As they say, Hang It In The Louvre. Hang itallin the Louvre. I’m surprised the Ping Pong finals weren‘t actually held . . . in the Louvre.The Olympics are a carefully curated bubble, though, and France is a mess, of course. The last 250 years or so have been tough on representative democracies and republics. But, just days before the Olympics began the French people voted to reject a majority Far Right government. God willing and the creeks don’t rise as some of my people say, we’ll do the same in November.The torch has literally been passed now to Los Angeles in the United States of America. “LA 2028” will be our time to shine and to paint our own masterpiece, to use the canvas of this quadrennial event to show the world Who We Are.But, Who Are We? Who we are now leads the world in two categories: Percentage of our population imprisoned and military spending. Should the LA Olympic artistic director choreograph dancers in orange jumpsuits dancing in shackles down Sunset Boulevard? Maybe the Parade of Nations rolls down Rodeo Drive in tanks and armored personnel carriers instead of barges on the Siene while Lee Greenwood sings “I’m Proud To Be An American.” Or, instead of hiding or jailing the unhoused who are bankrupted by unreimbursed medical expenses we assemble, hydrate, and train them to perform A Tribute To Capitalism, in the finale of which the world watches them Pull Themselves Up By Their Own Bootstraps. I’m getting chills.Pity the artistic director, though. Depending upon the results of the election this fall - and whether the results are accepted in the event MAGA loses — 2028 America could be quite a different place than it is now. The director might want to wait until January or so before planning the ceremonies in detail. They can take some small comfort in the knowledge that if Trump wins Fascists throw great parades! The lines are straight, there are lots of soldiers, and everyone does what they’re told, including cheering on demand.If, however, the Harris-Walz team prevails and other circumstances relegate just enough of the likes of Mitch McConnell to the sidelines — or home — where they belong, we have a chance to rekindle more than just the Olympic flame in the U.S. Can we, in the 4 years before LA 2028, at least begin to heal our most recent wounds and address honestly the wounds that have diminished us from our beginning, like slavery and its legacy? Can we cultivate a collective will to Make America Less Cruel and present to the world in those Opening Ceremonies a vibrant, humane, and enlightened America? It’s worth trying. To quote Olympic Gold Medalist and political commentator Kevin Durant: “A lot of bullshit happens in our country, but a lot of great things happen, too.”It’ll take a leap of faith far more difficult than Tom Cruise’s tethered rappel from the top of Stade de France, and a kind of individual courage rarely seen in sports and almost never in American politics. The world news is filled daily with patriots dying for their countries but almost never with an American politician willing simply to risk re-election by voting to justly tax billionaires or corporations. Or to fully fund public schools. Or, god forbid, build efficient and equitable public transportation. There are exceptions, of course, but American politics is the living embodiment of W..B. Yeats’ description: “The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity.”The “worst” here wear MAGA red or are politicians beholden to them feeding their voracious racism, greed, and hateful religious zealotry with cruel and unnecessary legislation that actually kills people and further divides us. Meanwhile, the “best” make and remake relentlessly embarrassing appeals to The Middle, impressing no one, changing no minds, engaging no new voters, and looking — ceaselessly — backwards.Yes, I know politics is the Art of the Possible. But generations of lowered expectations and gaslighting has shrunk our idea of possibility so much that we’re reduced now to hoping simply “preventing Fascism” is possible. We don’t dream as a country any more. We shrug and accept. We get teary-eyed watching an Olympic athlete overcome challenges and against all odds achieve her dreams then on the same TV screen later that night watch numbly as the city bulldozes a homeless camp, full of people who have dreams, too.Olympians dream big, and inspire us to wonder what that would be like. Along with the Olympic flame, can we light a second one? A flame we hold in our current darkness to see ahead rather than behind? One that gives us the courage to say out loud things that even the least successful of the democracies in Europe long ago took for granted. Especially because, despite what you’ve heard, we can afford it. That health care is a right. That women are equal. That the poor have the right to housing and to travel, especially in their own cities, and the right to educate well their children regardless of their economic status. It’s an uniquely American Tragedy that the nation that can most afford these basic human goods rejects them — patriotically — but still brags like a tired, uncurious old man about being the first to the moon — 55 years ago.The poor are never mentioned by even the Democrats any more, unless those poor are living on the streets (that we will surely “clean up” before the world arrives in LA in 2028 and then only because they’re bothersome and unsightly. The political battle for the Working Middle Class is a fine one, but also conveniently allows both parties to barely or never mention the growing hedge fund oligarchy that looms over everything (and finances both parties‘ political campaigns or the poor. It doesn’t have to be that way. The “best” from Yeats’ poem can begin by telling MAGA, with conviction, to take several seats while reclaiming from them the passionate intensity this important work will require. Bobby Kennedy said “Some men see things the way they are and ask ‘Why.’ I dream things that never were and ask ‘Why not.’” Some men today even understand he should have said “people” or “men and women.” That’s progress, too.I do hope 2028 America is different than it is now. But, not because the Rule of Law is in the dust bin of history. I think people would love to be as inspired by social and justice change leaders as much as they are every four years by sprinters and gymnasts. In 2021 the International Olympic Committee added to its slogan. Since then, it has been “Citius, Altius, Fortius” and “Communiter” — Together. If we decide now that our strength lies in recognizing that everyone is made stronger by improving the lives of the poorest and weakest among us, the pride we display during LA 2028’s Opening Ceremonies will be less about the past, and more about America’s future.*** ."

Daniel Akaka, who in part read: “These victories while important in themselves are more significant as a reflection of not only of Jimmy’s skills as a coach but of his dedication to his community and his ability to bring out the best in his chargers, who rose to the challenge, not only on the diamond, but on the playing field of life. There are many in Hawaii today who are better for having come in contact with Jimmy Correa.”Jerry ChangPresident, Big Island Sports Hall of FameHelp needed tofight noxious weedI am not a botanist, but a little bit of research has my alarm bells clanging about the dangers of the rampant spread of the Miconia calvescens shrub on the Big Island.Any resident with even average skills of observation should be noticing the increase of these ugly purple broad-leaf woody shrubs that are clogging gulches of the Hamakua Coast and sprouting up in the uplands of Puna.Each plant can produce up to 9 million seeds per year, and they quickly take over, creating dense stands. Their shallow root system causes increased erosion, which in turn increases sedimentation and runoff into near-shore reefs.In Tahiti, it is threatening up to two-thirds of indigenous flora.So, what is the county doing about this? Not much.I called the Big Island Invasive Species Council (you can, too: 808-933 3340 and was told that they have very limited funding, none of it federal and scant state funding.Please eradicate this plant if you see it on your property, and let’s all kokua to spread awareness of this noxious weed and stop it from spreading.Adriaina WoodsKurtistown."
eugeneweekly_2024_11,"We ve got issues. I was born in Afghanistan in 1995 — the same year as the Taliban. The radical Islamic group seized power rapidly. In cooperation with Al-Qaeda terrorists, it controlled 90 percent of the country by 1998. Opposition groups still controlled Takhar Province in northeast Afghanistan, however. This is where my family lived, in a rural community of mud houses. We were farmers, growing legumes and fruit, and raising animals. Still, the war came to us. I grew up under a rain of gunfire and rockets from both sides. Our legumes and fruit trees were trampled, our fertile land seeded instead with bullets. The withered flowers of our garden smelled of gunpowder and smoke. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. When a blind Taliban rocket hit our house and killed my aunt’s husband, we left our land and animals and fled to my grandfather’s village high on a rocky mountain. It was the first time I was displaced. We lived on dry bread and Kokcha River water, but my father would take me higher up the mountain to pick up the Persian BBC News on his old radio. I will never forget him explaining the news events to me; his deep, sad face covered in dust. He said years of war had caused the country to lose its foundation, that death, poverty and migration had become the daily concerns of the people. “Everything speaks of violence and misery,” he said. When the United States and other countries invaded Afghanistan in 2001, the Taliban retreated and freedoms were restored. I could pursue my own dreams, which included studying and becoming a journalist. I enrolled in school and got acquainted with pen, paper and books. Over time, I got acquainted with novels. Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez became one of my favorites. At 15, I began presenting children’s programming on a Takhar radio station. Eventually, I became a television news anchor in Kabul, where my wife, Suraya, was also a journalist. After studying law, I became a spokesman and media advisor for the vice president of Afghanistan. Then the U.S. coalition withdrew, and the country fell to the Taliban in August 2021. Again I was a refugee, this time as a husband and father of two boys. We fled to Iran and from there to Brazil. We were determined to get to the educational opportunities of the U.S. Reluctantly, I left my wife and small children in Brazil, an unknown country where the people spoke an unknown language. I thought I needed to undertake the dangerous journey north alone. As I rode on a bus through Colombia, I was surprised by a reminder of a better time in my life: Looking out the window, I recognized the banana trees described by Márquez inOne Hundred Years of Solitude. Later, I walked with hundreds of other migrants through the humid, muddy rainforest of the Darién Gap, which refugees call “The Road of Death” for its violence, floods, landslides, deadly snakes and insects. It was like the experience of seven lives and deaths as we walked for nine days and nights to reach Panama. I saw an old Venezuelan woman abandoned there by her companions because she was too weak to continue. All I could do was give her a little of my small food supply. We had to press on or risk death ourselves. But I can still see that woman stuck in the rainforest, crying for help. After passing through 10 countries in South and Central America, I presented myself at the U.S.-Mexican border and asked for asylum. Now my wife and sons have joined me in Eugene, where I am rebuilding my soul and my family’s fabric. I work as an administrative intern and also serve on the board of directors for Catholic Community Services, a nonprofit social service agency which administers the Lane County Refugee and Immigrant Services Program (RISP . My family and I also recently started a small business, the Manti Food Truck, preparing and selling Afghan and Uzbek food at 1591 West 6th Avenue in Eugene. This is my refugee story.

minnpost_2024_74,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.We recently completed anassessment of drinking water governancefor the state of Minnesota. This was commissioned by the Minnesota Department of Health as a contribution to the development of a 10-year strategic plan for drinking water policy that aims at ensuring a more resilient, safe and equitable drinking water supply.Here we want to draw attention to recent local problems that underline why it is needed.Last April, a group of Minnesotans petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to use its emergency powers to protect drinking water in southeast Minnesota. They argued there was a “substantial endangerment” of water consumers because state and local regulators failed to reduce the nitrate contamination of waters supplying drinking water wells. In a letter published in November, the EPAagreed and required state agencies to take actionthat included developing a coordinated and comprehensive work plan to address the problem.The petitioners were essentially challenging governance — who should be making decisions, and how, about drinking water management. Currently, drinking water decisions are led by the Department of Health, local utility managers, the Departments of Agricultural and Natural Resources, the Pollution Control Agency, the Public Facilities Authority and multiple state and local agencies that implement conservation programs to protect drinking water sources. Each of these agencies has broader missions beyond water.In our assessment of governance, we heard from the drinking water professionals who are responsible for delivering our drinking water. They told us about the strengths of the system, but they also identified gaps in governance that impact the effectiveness and efficiency of water management, and weaknesses in how diverse values and perspectives are incorporated into decision-making.Many of the gaps uncovered by our study are illustrated by the situation in southeast Minnesota that motivated the petition to the EPA regarding nitrate contamination.First, private well water is poorly protected. Whereas cities have professional water managers, homeowners with wells are essentially responsible for protecting their aquifer, monitoring water quality, and managing their treatment and delivery systems. As a society, we need to consider what support is fair to provide to homeowners with wells, and to acknowledge that source water can only be protected at the scale of aquifers, not individual wells.Second, better coordination is needed across the federal, state and local agencies responsible for protecting the sources of drinking water and delivering water efficiently and equitably at the tap. There needs to be streamlining of the many agencies involved.Third, the debate about trade-offs needs to be public. The petition in April was motivated by trade-offs between agricultural production and clean drinking water. For example, how do the costs and benefits of regulating nitrates at the source stack up against those of installing technology to remove them later? Recognizing that we all benefit from agricultural production and clean drinking water, who should pay? The delivery of safe drinking water involves many other tradeoffs between prevention and treatment, and who pays. These choices need to be based on science and citizens’ values, and that requires transparent public discussion.Finally, risks are not eliminated, but managed. Water will always have impurities from natural and human sources, but not all impurities need to be treated. The idea of pure water is compelling, but impractical. Science can define which contaminants at what levels should be targeted to protect human health, but targeting also depends on risk perceptions and value priorities. The Department of Health should facilitate more open discussions about risk management.We are fortunate in Minnesota that water infrastructure works so well that most of us don’t think a lot about it. But if we are to ensure it stays reliable, there needs to be more public interest.Right now, we have a unique opportunity to address the vulnerabilities of drinking water delivery, and to bring more voices into decision making. The Minnesota Department of Health is in the process of engaging hundreds of professionals and citizens across the state for its strategic plan. The department has long been making efforts to reach out to communities across the state. By more of us engaging in this conversation, we are telling MDH that we expect this transparency and coordination. Commenting on this plan helps ensure your values will guide how water decisions are made for the next ten years.Peter Calow is a professor in the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. A. Marcelle Lewandowski is a senior coordinator at the Water Resources Center at the University of Minnesota."
leoweekly_2024_4,"In my life, I’ve always known someone who is gay. Always. From the time I was a child when my father would say someone was “sweet,” or “queer” (back when that was a not-so-nice phrase , I was always adjacent to people in the LGBTQ+ community. They were in my family. They were my neighbors, and eventually they were some of the closest and most dear members of my friend group… my chosen family.With this being Pride month, and in all of the celebrations, I started thinking about some moments that made me realize that the joy of being yourself could at times come with great risk.When I was in high school, at Male, my best guy friend at the time was a gay man. I knew it but this wasn’t the era that you ever asked that question. In the years since we’ve reconnected and he asked if I realized it back then. I mean, sort of but I didn’t even really have the terminology for it. I was green but I knew that I was securely in the friend zone and my crushes were always other boys. Hell, at this point, I was such a weirdo, my actual crushes were probably members of Duran Duran and not even boys that I knew.When I changed high schools to Seneca, there was a young person, who I only recall being called “Corky.” I am positive this was a derogatory nickname because they were a completely out queer person. They often ran up against the uptight administration, and rude kids, as they would challenge gender norms on the regular. Whether it was makeup, or wearing a skirt, they were determined to be exactly who they were… even in the late ‘80s suburban high school. I hope some of you remember them and can tell me who they were. From a distance, I really admired them.I’ve always looked for the quiet heroes.There were others, some who I also have reconnected with and am happy to see them living as they are — in their truth. Free.As I grew, my friends who are gay have never had to hide themselves from me, or my family. Our house was a safe space for anyone, most especially folks who others might cast aside.Despite my dad’s silly comments in private, he welcomed all of our unique friends, and truly cared about them like they were his own children, or even befriended them with his entire heart. He didn’t make the connection, though, between his speech and his practice until much later. But his home was their home, all the time.By the time this note is published, one of my dearest friends will share their story about Pride events and, in that, raise a challenge to the Kentuckiana Pride Festival to find a way to keep the gates open. Even if that means, a paid concert becomes a separate thing. It isn’t a complaint but a tender plea to try as much as possible to avoid putting limits on one of the few places where the LGBTQ+ community can come together, meet, learn, and organize.In these safe places, change has been monumental. These quiet heroes have found ways to continue even if it means gathering the strength to wear their makeup or don a skirt in a classroom. Having a gathering place is a recharge. It’s integral.Black folks (and Black queer folks deeply understand this. Recharging with each other is equally as powerful.When you are with those who have lived and grown in a similar experience, you find compassion, care and a place to drop the pretenses of trying to fit into this broken place we call “America.”The cloak of righteousness is strong in the right wing parties of the world right now. Even as their own houses are crumbling, they are trying to attack everyone around them — most outwardly trans children — instead of fixing their own foundations.As those voices that oppose the LGBTQ+ community grow louder, it’s important for me to remember that, like my own rights as a Black person, the queer community has to continuously fight for safety and the right to simply exist in peace. As an ally, my job is to fight behind them, and to make space for them when they need it.In honor of all the quiet heroes I’ve known or observed in my life, if you are part of this community and have something to share, send it to me. If you aren’t but you want to spew hatred, keep your mouth shut, and computer closed, because I’m not accepting your inane rants right now. ( ."
philinquirer_2024_18,"It’s a huge downer, I know. But I m living proof that giving up alcohol isn t so bad — I sleep better, feel better, save money, and still find plenty of ways to have fun.Dry January is as good a time as any to face a sobering reality: No amount of alcohol is “safe.”This contradicts the story we’ve been told for years, which was that having small amounts of alcohol — say, a glass of red wine at dinner — is healthy, andbetter than not drinking anything at all.That belief was rooted in science — namely, studies that showed moderate drinkers were healthier than people who abstained. But much of that research was imperfect. When studying something as complicated as human beings, there are a lot of factors that can influence a finding. For instance, moderate drinkers may have been wealthier, exercised more, and followed other healthy habits that could explain their longevity, while many people who didn’t drink at all were former heavy drinkers who stopped because they developed health problems.In short, in these studies, the amount of alcohol people drank could have had little to do with how long they lived.Asweeping 2023 reportthat took a fresh look at more than 100 studies published over a span of 40 years concluded that even small amounts of alcohol — less than two drinks per day for women and three drinks for men — is bad for you.That same year, the World Health Organization went even further, declaring thatno amount of alcohol was safe, noting that its risks — at least seven types of cancer, as dangerous as asbestos and radiation — “start from the first drop.”» READ MORE:Even one drink a day may shrink your brain, Penn study suggestsThis is a huge downer, I know. But it’s time to face facts, and we’re not: Despite therecent trendy surge in sober “mocktails,”alcohol remains an integral part of our social infrastructure. According to government data,80% of Americans over the age of 12 have had a drink; according to what I see, even that number feels like an underestimate.Our public health agencies aren’t doing nearly enough to disseminate the fact that alcohol isn’t healthy, even in small amounts. And it’s taking a toll.I get it: Drinking can be great — it can play a key role in calming first date jitters, making it easier for shy coworkers to bond after hours, or surviving an Eagles season. Almost nothing soothes jangled nerves better than thepop-sighsound of opening a beer at the end of a hard day. All of this makes alcohol hard to break away from. I discovered this when I decided to stop drinking a few years ago.I’ll have a glass every few months, maybe, but I gave up my nightly wine with dinner as I rounded middle age, when even a few sips started derailing my sleep. It was an easy decision to make, as in my 40s, feeling well-rested became far more valuable than an extra laugh or two the night before. Plus, I watched alcohol take a toll on my family: three of my four grandparents were extreme alcoholics (evenlost a family business as a result , and my father hid his own habit from me for years.It wasn’t untilhe developed dementiaand I became hisfull-time caregiverthat the truth came out. On one of our many emergency room visits, a doctor who’d never seen my father before took one look at the pattern of blood vessels on his stomach and turned to me. “He’s a heavy drinker,” the doctor said, with a look of certainty that told me this was fact, not opinion.Watching your father’s body break down over the course of 10 years — to the point when hecouldn’t walk, talk, or understand anything happening around him— would be enough to turn anyone off of alcohol.But I found that choosing not to drink put me somewhat on the outs. As a mom, I’m surrounded by wine — or “mommy juice,” as many call it (that alone is telling . Drinking is a part of every parent social event; snow days and weekend meetups become excuses to break out the bubbly before 5 p.m. We’re even supposed todrink wine during art lessons.As a mom, I’m surrounded by wine.The wine culture among moms has created a dangerous trend. Over the last 20 years, alcohol-related health issues have increased among all groups — but the highest spike has been amongwhite, middle-aged women.And in Pennsylvania, where the opioid crisis hasdecimated neighborhoodsand deaths are rising, recent data show thatalcohol kills more people than overdoses.I’ve hesitated to write about this because, like I said, huge downer. But the evidence is irrefutable: Alcohol, even in small amounts, isn’t harmless, and we need to stop pretending that it is. Since I gave it up, I sleep better, feel better, andsave a lot of money. And there’s no shortage of fun in my life.So I encourage everyone (especially women to try Dry January — and Dry February, Dry March, and all the months that follow."

Pope Julius II founded the museums in 16th century Rome. (Joe Sohm/Dreamstime/TNS The melody of human progress up to the present has played on two grand instruments: science and the humanities. But for the last few hundred years, these instruments have been treated as separate entities, one concerned with the physical world and validated by objective empirical testing, the other, largely, with subjective selfhood and human meaning.To use chemist and author C.P. Snow’s famous words from his 1959 Rede lecture at Cambridge University, we are in a two-culture era: Science and the humanities can now barely hear each other across the chasm we have created between them.Make no mistake. The stakes are high. To lead our lives as if the humanities and the sciences are distinct will negatively affect our continued development, especially given the reliance on siloed departments and divisions in what counts as “higher education” in the modern American university.Astronomers never cross paths with anthropologists, lawyers with doctors, mathematicians with classicists. No one, then, emerges from the university with an understanding of how these fields ought to engage.Instead, we act as if complicated problems are solvable through a purely technical and scientific mindset, divorced from engagement with basic questions about ethical implications, politics and human impact. We teach people to be this way.These few centuries have been a flash in the pan: No ancient culture segregated science from the humanities. What humans knew was regarded as a holistic body of knowledge to help them live better lives, and the physical world and humanistic self-reflection could and did work in tandem.Figures such as Aristotle, Averroes and Francis Bacon had expertise that stretched across the body of knowledge. J. Robert Oppenheimer framed his nuclear work in terms of the “Bhagavad Gita,” understanding the implications of becoming a “destroyer of worlds”; in science fiction, Isaac Asimov’s “Three Laws of Robotics” shaped concerns about artificial intelligence long before AI in its current form existed; Dr. Edward Jenner’s work on the smallpox vaccine built on folk practices such as variolation. They listened to the conversation that science was having with the humanities and culture.This is an argument that the humanities and sciences are mutually interactive and help build each other. The humanities are not dead: What we need to do is see how they can play with the sciences. Until we see this, our advances in science and technology will proceed with blinders on.Why did it take us a century to understand that medicine based on the white male body would not work for everyone? Roman physician Galen already knew this two millennia ago. Well, it’s because of the S-word: silo.The huge challenges of the 21st century demand a multidimensional approach that brings together multiple perspectives on what matters to us. Given what we are facing now — global warming, nuclear war, the question of AI — our future should not be left to the technocrats alone. We need scientists and engineers who understand the unquantifiable cost of their technical advances and humanist thinkers who can critically analyze the data and narratives shaping our world.Where to start?In higher education, where the walls separating departments and divisions must be weakened. Building bridges requires a paradigm shift in education, one that allows students to be versed in what connects the disciplines, as well as what separates them, one in which a medical student and a philosopher might well be in the same class.Yes, fostering interdivisional exposure, in which students engage with both scientific and humanistic perspectives while maintaining their core practices, is difficult. But it is more critical than ever before.Shadi Bartsch-Zimmer was director of The Institute on the Foundation of Knowledge from 2015 to 2024 at the University of Chicago."

That’s why it is so hard to understand the City of Honolulu pursuing a lawsuit that aims to punish companies for “causing” climate change by using fossil fuels.Our politicians, elected officials and government are supposed to do what’s best for the people of Hawaii, not for a pet special interest group or their own ideology. That’s why it is so hard to understand the City of Honolulu pursuing a lawsuit that aims to punish companies for “causing” climate change by using fossil fuels.This politically motivated suit is wasting taxpayer funds and should be thrown out by the courts. Worse, it would be an unmitigated disaster for our economy.Remove fossil fuel energy from Hawaii? Hawaii residents rely on coal, oil and gas for nearly 70% of their power. Petroleum products account for 80% of our energy consumption, the highest share of any state in the union. And even with that we have the highest energy costs in the nation, three times the average. Imagine our energy costs without fossil fuels.Wind and sun are free, right? No. According to a National Renewable Energy Laboratory study, transitioning Hawaii to 100% renewable energy would require a substantial investment in new infrastructure, including solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage systems and power transmission lines. And you thought building the rail was expensive. These investments would increase consumer electricity costs dramatically while not even providing us with reliable, dependable power, no matter how costly.How come? Well, the sun doesn’t shine at night, the wind doesn’t always blow, and let’s not even talk about hurricane season and other extreme weather events. In a Hawaii dependent on green energy, we will face sky-high costs for unreliable energy, rolling blackouts, power rationing … and forget about running your air conditioner or plugging in your electric car.Fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, coal have been the power behind the greatest increase in worldwide prosperity in history. American energy companies have been the worldwide leader in developing ever increasingly efficient, clean power and have reduced emissions dramatically, unlike the rest of the world. That was and is their job, not warning us about climate change.In fact, the hysteria around carbon emissions is undergoing severe reexamination and reconsideration. For just one example, mining lithium for car batteries is far more environmentally damaging than American clean coal mining.Hawaii residents are reasonable people. And a reasonable approach to the possibility of climate change should not include attacking the people and industries that have provided us with the reliable, efficient energy that Hawaii depends on.As green energy develops more consistent, cost-effective energy solutions, they should be integrated into our Hawaii way of life. That doesn’t mean we want to see an ocean of wind turbines covering our beautiful coastlines. And while the home solar panel that provides hot water for our after surf shower is much prized, we don’t want solar farms replacing our lovely landscape. Particularly when they can’t be depended on to give us the consistent, affordable energy we need.And of course, the tourist industry — love ’em or hate ’em — is dependent on fossil fuels. They don’t get here by foot. And we’re dependent on them for our economy.The environmental activists’ dreams of a green energy Hawaii could get a dramatic boost from this Hawaii Supreme Court case … and the people of Hawaii could face a harsher hotter future, with limited power to run our cars, cool our houses, power our TVs, keep the lights on at our keiki’s football games, keep the lau lau fresh in the refrigerator … the list goes on and on … just so some environmental extremists and progressive politicians can feel good about themselves.Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono (the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness .

minnpost_2024_23,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Access to fast, reliable broadband and internet services is vital for every Minnesotan. From schoolwork to work from home, access to digital tools is an essential part of day-to-day life, not a luxury. Unfortunately, Minnesota lawmakers are proposing wrong-headed legislation that will give local governments authority to hike the price of essential internet and broadband services by as much as 8% – costing consumers more and threatening to halt the great progress made toward affordable, universal broadband access across the state.The legislation currently moving through the House, which we refer to as the “Internet Tax bill,” will authorize local governments to enact what are essentially new taxes – which they call franchise fees – on broadband service providers. Decisions to add these new taxes to consumer bills and how that revenue will be spent would be made with very little transparency to consumers. Minnesotans are tired of additional fees and taxes being added to their bills. Ironically, this proposal allowing local governments to tack on new “fees” to internet bills comes while legislators are promoting other bills to ban junk fees.So, what do these new taxes mean for Minnesotans? It means duplicative, burdensome taxes can be levied on consumers, making access to essential internet services inaccessible for many. Consumers won’t be getting a better or improved product — they’ll just be paying more for it.When inflation is hitting family budgets harder than ever, and as the Biden Administration is stepping up efforts with billions in investments to close the digital divide, it begs the question of why Minnesota lawmakers want to put these onerous new taxes on essential internet and broadband-enabled services and move our state backward?Moreover, this legislation comes at a time when more than 240,000 low-income Minnesota households are losing access to a federal $30/month broadband subsidy that is running out at the end of April. Why do state lawmakers want to compound this issue further and risk putting access to affordable internet, perhaps permanently out of reach for thousands of people, by adding layers of new fees to broadband bills? Low-income, BIPOC and underserved communities will be harmed the most by this legislation.Supporters of this legislation claim that this will provide accelerated broadband access to rural communities. They’ve even had the nerve to call it the Equal Access to Broadband Act. Don’t be taken by that title. In reality, this legislation will halt development in underserved parts of the state. If enacted, the bill would make it illegal for providers to provide broadband service in communities until they negotiate a franchise agreement with each and every city, town and township. Franchise negotiations can take months or even years, and many small communities and hometown providers don’t have the resources or capacity for those additional layers of new bureaucracy.Supporters also say that new fees are being proposed because local governments need hundreds of millions of dollars, which would be raised by these new taxes, to pay for maintaining public rights of way and providing local cable access channels. However, broadband and video service providers already pay communities for using the road rights of way and consumers already pay a 5% fee on their cable bill to fund local access channels. The truth is that this is an open-ended slush fund for local governments at the expense of consumers.Adding multiple layers of new taxes and regulations will hinder efforts to achieve universal broadband availability in Minnesota. The digital divide will be widened by devaluing the hundreds of millions of dollars of private and public investment taking place in local communities across our state. All of this means the cost of a child doing online school, a parent working from home, a rural patient utilizing telehealth services, or a grandma checking in on her family will all increase.Minnesotans can’t afford to widen the digital divide. If the proposed bill becomes law, it will cost consumers and our state more than we can afford, reversing years of hard work to close the digital divide.Melissa Wolf is the executive director of the Minnesota Cable Communications Association and Brent Christensen is the president and CEO of the Minnesota Telecom Alliance."

From the lowest elected positions to the highest presidential race, mud-slinging, exposing dirty laundry, and lies made toward candidates seem to be the norm during an election year. This often occurs during television and public townhall debates.However, the candidate that seems to do most of the name-calling historically always seems to lose an election.The name-calling mud-slingers seem to only focus only on their opponents’ weaknesses, rather than discuss and offer solutions for a community’s social and economic issues and what changes they would like to bring about for the people.When a candidate must resort to dirty tactics against their opponent during an election year, this shows that the debate and their character are very weak.Rick LaMontagneHiloHad a great timewatching OlympicsI must say, I have enjoyed watching this year’s Olympics more than ever.Credit needs to be given to the French.

And most of our state legislatures, too? Why do these so-called representative bodies keep stiffing middle-class and poor families, refusing to respond to the most urgent needs and goals of this vastmajorityof Americans?Take lawmakers’ indifference to the child care crisis crushing the finances, health and spirit of millions of working families. Plus, intentionally denying basic health care for low-income children in this spectacularly rich nation.These common incidents of child neglect are products of the creeping plutocratic ideology now dominating capitals across America. Most legislatures today push corporate profiteering, including re-legalizing robber baron exploitation of children. Bills to reinstate child labor are being advanced in 28 states, and 12 have already passed!Why is the workaday majority being ignored and corporate supremacy being imposed over the common good? In a word:class.Think about it: Who holds nearly all of the seats in Congress and in state legislatures? Not plumbers, mechanics, taxi drivers, trash haulers, hotel housekeepers, computer programmers, farm workers or child care providers. Instead, it’s bankers, lawyers, corporate executives, lobbyists, millionaires and ideological goofballs.Even though half of America’s jobs are working class, barely 1% of our nation’s 7,300 state legislative seats are held by the working class people who actually make America work.As the old saying goes: If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.

It is the fundamental building block for a child’s future success and development.On March 22, Hawaii News Now published an article about local families in Maui and Hawaii who protested in demand for higher-quality early childhood education.Hawaii’s high cost of living has made it challenging for parents to provide their children with a proper education. The cost of children’s education is another struggle that Hawaii families have to deal with.Many families have to rely on the state to provide for their basic needs, making them feel guilty for not being able to provide for their families using their wages.Parents are frequently confronted with a heart-wrenching choice: pay their bills or provide their children with a high-quality education.It is a stark reality that parents are compelled to delay their children’s education until they can afford it, a situation that is simply not acceptable.We must urgently call for more funding and investments from our government to alleviate the burden on families who are in dire need of high-quality early childhood education.By investing in quality preschool programs, we can ensure that every child, regardless of their family’s financial situation, has an equal opportunity to thrive. Early education not only enhances cognitive and social skills but also instills a love for learning.It is high time for us to prioritize the well-being and growth of our youngest learners.Lacey MagallanesPahoaGas-fired plantsaren’t a solutionGov. Josh Green was recently reported to be advocating for new gas-fired power plants to shore up Hawaiian Electric’s shortages. I feel this is counter-productive and excessively expensive.Hawaii already has the highest electricity rates in the country because all fuel has to be shipped in. This would also not only help keep the rates high, it might well make them higher. Beyond that, it also impedes the state’s intent to get to zero carbon emissions.Instead of new gas-fired power plants, what the state needs is grid-scale energy storage. Both Texas and California have implemented major storage systems for several years now, so this is beyond the prototype stage.We already have an excess of solar power generation. Energy storage will give us the added power you need for evenings and nighttimes from the excess we already have during the day.Grid-scale energy storage gets you directly on the path to zero carbon emissions using the development money you have now. It also has the potential to lower energy costs for everyone, unlike fossil fuels which can only increase costs.If you put that money into gas-fired power plants, then you’re investing in a backwards solution and committing to more decades of fuel importation when the energy you need is already here.My own favorite is the liquid metal battery system from Ambri. They cannot catch fire, have essentially no parts to wear out, and have a minimum 20-year lifespan.Forty years ago, I worked at Pacific Gas &Electric as a load management analyst. Even then, PG&E was using pumped hydro to augment their system capacity, shifting excess power to those hours when it was best needed.It is Gov. Green’s responsibility to lead Hawaii into the future, not into the past.Russ ButtonPahoaDuring the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI.Hawaii military veterans can apply for a free tour to Washington, D.C., in recognition of their service."

minnpost_2024_35,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Minnesota’s universities seem to have forgotten philosopher George Santayana’s maxim:“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”Twenty-two years ago, St. Cloud State University settled a federal class-action lawsuit (Zmora v. State of Minnesota that brought national attention to the campus and stained its reputation with antisemitism. SCSU was required to create a new position and hire a professor to develop Jewish studies and a communal awareness program about antisemitism; I was that professor.Six years later, the Jewish studies program produced the unique community and university collaboration of “To Be Certain of the Dawn,”aHolocaust memorial program of choral and symphonic music that had been commissioned by the Basilica of Saint Mary as a gift to the Jewish community in 2005.It was performed on both campuses by the SCSU Music Department with Saint John’s University and College of Saint Benedict faculty and students and the St. Cloud Cantabile children’s choir. Then 260 faculty, students and staff from the three universities went to Europe in the summer of 2008 and performed the piece in the Nazi concentration camp Natzweiler-Struthof in France. The SCSU archives has a 17-minute documentary, “Holocaust and Transcendence,” which illuminates what a university can do to repudiate antisemitism.And the course “Antisemitism in America” was developed and offered by a university challenged to prevent the past from being repeated. Students taking the course fulfilled a graduation requirement of Liberal Education-Goal 7-Human Diversity. The course explored history, sociology, literature, religious studies and contemporary events to illuminate the “oldest hatred” in Western culture.Then one year ago, SCSU announced that, due to debt and low enrollment, several programs would be canceled and that some tenured faculty positions would be terminated. Among the programs eliminated was Jewish studies.State legislators are having public meetings to develop the new State Holocaust Education program, but SCSU — which educates 45% of Minnesota’s teachers — has eliminated Jewish studies. When Minnesota mandates Holocaust education in its public schools, what university will teach “Antisemitism in America” to prepare the teachers?The University of Minnesota faces an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education of antisemitism on the Twin Cities campus following demonstrations after the Hamas massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, in Israel.Currently, there are also public hearings about the revocation of the name of the school’s Nicholson Hall. Arecent Op-Edin The Minnesota Daily argues that the name of the building, which houses the university’s Center for Jewish Studies, should be changed as it is named after a man “who aligned himself with notorious antisemites.” It added: “Edward E. Nicholson is a reminder of the University’s darkest chapters.” Ironically, there is currently no course at the Twin Cities campus that teaches about the antisemitism for which Nicholson’s name might be removed.Students are missing a vital intellectual challenge in civic responsibility. Three sample questions on antisemitism teach history as well as personal ethics: What is the connection between Henry Ford, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” and antisemitism in the U.S. before World War II? What is the origin of the slang term “to jewsomeone down” and why is it so offensive? Why were white supremacists in Charlottesville screaming “Jews will not replace us?”Maybe Santayana’s warning should be amended for our time:Those who cannot teach about our past are condemned to repeat it. A writer proclaimed in 1946 that “Minneapolis is the capitol (sic of anti-Semitism in the United States” — a phrase that should be part of every Minnesota citizen’s basic literacy about the hatred of Jews.Minnesota’s two public university systems must create and sustain courses on antisemitism in America.Elie Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz, taught the world during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, saying, “I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides.”The urgent need to teach “Antisemitism in America” in Minnesota’s universities requires that we take sides and end the silence about the absence of this course.Joseph A. Edelheit is an emeritus professor of religious and Jewish studies at St. Cloud State University and was the senior rabbi at Temple Israel from 1992-2001."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_281,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Democrats and a complicit media are already building a cult of personality around Kamala Harris, circling the wagons to protect her from expected Republican attacks.Whether it’s planting memes on the Internet or stories in the media, the Harris campaign is riding a wave of favorable publicity, painting the vice president as a hip and likable figure and preparing to label any attacks against Harris as racist or misogynist.Their first attempt, however, has already backfired. Liberals circulated on social media that conservative Fox host Brian Kilmeade said Harris planned to speak to a “colored” sorority when in fact Kilmeade said “college sorority.”The media and Democrats, including DNC chair Jaime Harrison, circulated the false claim anyway.It shows what the public is going to see for the next four months.Harris supporters have also been trying to make Harris seem hip by showing videos of her dancing and calling her “brat” – a term of endearment from a Charli XCX song.It’s an attempt to reintroduce and rebrand the unpopular Harris, but it’s a persona that Harris doesn’t possess. And to voters, it’s questionable whether it will work.Democrats tried the same thing with Hillary Clinton eight years ago – remember the “I’m with Her” t-shirts? – and Donald Trump clobbered her on Election Day anyway.The Boston Globe claimed in a story that Democrats are bracing for a “perfect storm” of the “Godzilla of racial and misogynistic campaigning” in the next few months.They based it on the fact that Trump made fun of Hillary Clinton’s appearance in 2016 and circulated the claim that Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.Trump has also made fun of Harris’s “cackling” laugh.“Hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type,” Harris said at a campaign event. “And in this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week.”Harris’s record is fair game in this election, despite what Democrats may say.She has an abysmal record on immigration, and can get defensive when criticized – like she did when Republicans blasted her for not going to the U.S.-Mexico border.“And I haven’t been to Europe,” Harris retorted snidely.On a trip to Mexico and Central America, Harris told migrants “do not come” to the U.S. – a clip that was widely panned by immigration advocates and liberals.Harris could ride the wave of feel-good stories to close on Trump in the polls in the coming weeks, especially after the Democratic convention coronates her.But so far there’s little evidence Democrats have gotten a big boost. Harris in fact has a much different image to moderate and young voters especially.A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in the last few days showed Trump actually crushing Harris among younger voters.In the 18-34 age group, Trump got 58% of voters while Harris trailed with just 39%.The poll was surprising because most pundits have assumed the younger Harris would fare much better than 81-year-old Joe Biden among voters in that age group.“The dramatic reset at the top of the Democratic ticket does little to move the race as Vice President Harris enters the fray with numbers similar to President Biden,” polling analyst Tim Malloy said."
philinquirer_2024_59,"As the owner of several rental properties in Philadelphia, I’ve learned that being a landlord is a way to build community.“Tell your tenant to move her car!” These were the first words I heard when I answered my phone 18 months ago.Because I have a “For Rent” sign with my contact information in the yard of the duplex I own not far from my own house, I get more than my share of irate calls from neighbors, complaining about some real or imagined infraction. This time, the woman on the other end was fuming mad because she thought my tenant’s car was blocking the common driveway — again. I was annoyed, but felt vindicated when I confirmed that it wasn’t my tenant’s car. Still, I sent out a reminder to keep the driveway clear.Recently, I rang that same neighbor’s doorbell. She invited me in and we stood together in her living room, preparing to hang “No Parking” signs for our upcoming block party. That irate phone call from a year and a half ago felt distant.She offered me water, we talked about how much fun everyone was going to have, and she showed me a picture of her son, who passed away a few years ago. She was no longer a faceless angry homeowner and I was no longer an anonymous landlord; we were neighbors, excited for our block party.Since 2017, I’ve bought several rental properties in Philadelphia, and in that time I’ve learned that being a landlord is not just a way to make money — it’s a way to build community and improve the city, block by block.Many Philadelphia residents are skeptical about landlords, as real estate investors are often seen as unwelcome outsiders, and I understand.As a young girl growing up in Mount Airy, I watched a battalion of construction workers and their pickup trucks lay siege to my block as they turned the old horse stables down the street into a dozen new rowhouses.Then they tore down the large single family house across the street, replacing it with six more rowhouses. It changed the landscape of my childhood dramatically, and made me feel unsettled.My rehab projects aren’t changing an entire street. I also look like the people who live next to my properties, which helps put neighbors at ease. But I’m still aware of the sense of uncertainty that my presence can bring. So, at the start of my projects, I try to show that I come in peace.I try to set a positive tone by doing what I can to improve and secure my property, while also enhancing the block. Street sweeping is my favorite way to start because it can be free — just me, my broom, and a contractor bag — and gives instant results that residents can see, even if the outcome is just temporarily less trash.I installed flood lights in a dark alley beside one property; it won’t totally deter drug use and other illegal activity, but it hopefully makes people feel a little safer. I’ve also installed security cameras, which don’t stop people from illegally dumping or breaking into the nearby cars or apartments, but residents have told me they appreciate knowing they can use the footage when they file a complaint with the police.These small decisions benefit my property and my best interests, but they also help each block as a whole. With every sweep and security camera, I’m slowly building trust and establishing a good working relationship with the community.If every landlord does a little bit beyond the front doors of our buildings, we could help transform the city. Not just how it looks, but also how it feels.Over the course of my renovation projects, my professional relationship with the neighbors on the block slowly evolves into a more personal one. I observe people in the most unfiltered moments of their lives — relaxing, arguing, loving, and simply existing. And they watch parts of my journey unfold, too, in the sweat, setbacks, and slow progress of repairs. Occasionally, small talk turns into longer, more meaningful conversations. These moments of connection are magical.This summer, I tried to make more of these moments by organizing block parties on a couple of streets where I own properties. I asked my angry neighbor to help, and the planning process gave us a reason to communicate without shouting.I learned she had lived on the block for 50 years, but she kept saying “the neighborhood isn’t like it used to be.” There was more crime and trash, and most of the older folks who made the street feel like a family were long gone. Like me, she mourned the loss of the place she knew — but, in her case, she was also grieving the tragic loss of her child.In the couple of months spent planning the block party, I learned more about her than I had in the couple of years I’d owned the duplex on her street. I no longer saw her simply as angry; she was hurt. And in understanding each other more, we’ve built a friendship. When she needed referrals for work on her house, I sent her my best recommendations. When I needed a home base for the block party, she made it clear that me and my guests were welcome to anything she had.On the day of the block parties, residents and I cleaned up together and shared food and funny stories. We walked up and down the streets, putting faces to the front doors and watched kids play carefree. I felt the optimism that comes from working together, and the vulnerability that comes from hoping together. The people on the block became people I have an obligation to and a responsibility for. They became neighbors.» READ MORE:Philly crime made me consider a move to the suburbs. Here’s why I stayed. | OpinionThere areroughly 50,000 landlords in Philadelphia, and around three-quarters are like me, owning a handful of properties. If every one of us does a little bit beyond the front doors of our buildings, we could help transform the city. Not just how it looks, but also how it feels. Whether it’s planning a block party, referring reliable contractors to residents, or introducing yourself to all of the residents, we have the opportunity to impact every block where we own property by not only being an investor, but by being a neighbor.Because neighbors are not just the people who live next to us, but the people we choose to see and connect with. And while our individual efforts might feel insignificant, if we gather enough small contributions and meaningful moments of connection, eventually we’ll find that we’ve discovered something precious — community.Jasmine Schley is a proud Philadelphian."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_66,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Joe Biden has landed the first blows in his debate with Donald Trump before it’s even begun.The CNN rules for the network’s Atlanta studio showdown on June 27 are so stringent that Trump may be hobbled in his attempts to engage the president in a real one-on-one debate and trip him up.It’s not surprising that Democratic toady CNN has tried to engineer a debate win for Biden, but more surprising that Trump’s campaign was meek enough to agree to the rules.The microphone of the candidate who isn’t speaking will be muted throughout the debate, meaning Trump will be muzzled for much of the time. Four years ago, Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden, prompting Biden to infamously say “Will you shut up, man!”The moderators for the debate – Democratic operatives Dana Bash and Jake Tapper – “will use all the tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,” according to CNN.Which is exactly what Biden wants. Trump wants chaos and unpredictability.But if Bash and Tapper appear to be silencing Trump unfairly, that could fire up the Republican troops and boost the former Republican president heading into the fall election season.There will be no debate audience for Trump to feed off – a provision that Biden’s campaign insisted on.Biden’s campaign also asked for podiums for both candidates, which will protect the 81-year-old Democratic president from shuffling off or losing his place on stage.The 90-minute debate on June 27 will include two commercial breaks, giving Biden a little time to take a respite if things get rough.The candidates will also be provided with a pen and a pad of paper to take notes, which should help Biden if he loses focus.And the timing of the debate – in the mid-summer doldrums months before election – will give Biden time to recover in case of a bad performance.Another concession by Trump is that the debate will not include third party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who polls show is hurting Biden’s campaign. Kennedy has filed an official complaint hoping to be put in the debate.By agreeing to CNN’s debate, Trump and Biden are shunning the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has traditionally put on televised encounters for decades.Trump ceded control of the debate by saying months ago that he would debate Biden at “any time, any place” – giving the Democrats the opening they needed to accept the invitation from CNN.This is the first of only two debates between the candidates, and there is no VP debate scheduled.Biden is taking a risk by agreeing to debate at all. A major gaffe or senior moment could send his campaign into a tailspin.But it’s a risk the Biden campaign is willing to take, given the fact that his low approval ratings remain a major problem for his re-election.Just a passing performance for Biden could re-energize his campaign and ease voters’ concerns about his age and mental acuity.The second debate between Biden and Trump is scheduled for Sept. 10 on ABC. CBS is trying desperately to get into the picture by holding a VP debate.A 71-year-old Hilo man pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree negligent homicide for the Oct. 3, 2023, traffic collision death of a 79-year-old Hilo woman.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_147,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Among the worst episodes in American history are those moments when the federal government deploys the full weight of its power against the most vulnerable people in the country: the Trail of Tears and the Fugitive Slave Act in the 19th century and Japanese internment in the middle of the 20th, to name three.If he is granted a second term in the White House, Donald Trump hopes to add his own entry to this ignominious book of national shame.Trump’s signature promise, during the 2016 presidential election, was that he would build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. His signature promise, this time around, is that he’ll use his power as president to deport as many as 20 million people from the United States.“Following the Eisenhower model,” he told a crowd in Iowa last September, “we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”It cannot be overstated how Trump’s deportation plan would surely rank as one of the worst crimes perpetrated by the federal government on the people of this country. Most of the millions of unauthorized and undocumented immigrants in the United States are essentially permanent residents. They raise families, own homes and businesses, pay taxes and contribute to their communities. For the most part, they are as embedded in the fabric of this nation as native-born and naturalized American citizens are.What Trump and his aide Stephen Miller hope to do is to tear those lives apart, rip those communities to shreds and fracture the entire country in the process.“The Trump immigration plan,” notes Radley Balko, a journalist who writes primarily on civil liberties, in his Substack newsletter, “would be the second-largest forced displacement of human beings in human history, on a par with Britain’s disastrous partition of India, and second only to total forced displacement during World War II.”What is the plan, exactly? It begins, as Miller explained in an interview with Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk last year, with creating a national deportation force consisting of agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Border Patrol and other federal agencies, as well as the National Guard and local law enforcement officials. The administration would empower this deportation force to scour the country for unauthorized and undocumented immigrants. It would move from state to state, city to city, neighborhood to neighborhood and, finally, house to house, looking for people who, according to Trump and Miller, do not belong. This deportation force would raid workplaces and stage public roundups to create a climate of fear and intimidation.Of course, in the heat of the moment, it isn’t actually all that easy to determine who may be an unauthorized or undocumented immigrant. But these won’t be selective apprehensions. How could they be? Instead, what we’ll see in practice is an indiscriminate roundup of anyone who might appear to be an immigrant — a mass campaign of racial and ethnic profiling.Because it would be beyond the capacity of the federal government to immediately return detainees to their “home” countries, the Trump team also plans to build “vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers” for immigrants on land near the Texas border. Internment camps, essentially.It is worth remembering here that in addition to its wanton cruelty, Trump’s policy of child separation was also noteworthy for the poor conditions suffered by separated families living in government facilities. Child detainees lacked adequate food, water and sanitation. There were also reports of mistreatment, as in the case of the Border Patrol agents who were accused of telling detained women to drink out of toilet bowls.Now imagine the conditions that might prevail for hundreds of thousands of people crammed into hastily constructed camps, the targets of a vicious campaign of demonization meant to build support for their detention and deportation. If undocumented immigrants really are, as Trump says, “poisoning the blood of our country,” then how do we respond? What do we do about poison? Well, we neutralize it.There are roughly 10.5 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, according to a recent estimate by the Pew Research Center. Trump’s number of “probably 15 million and maybe as many as 20 million” is pulled from nowhere — an assumption based on the inchoate sense that the official numbers are wrong and there must be more “illegals” to apprehend than anyone truly realizes.To reach this goal, Miller and Trump would almost certainly have to round up citizens as well. But that is also part of the plan. On the first day of his second term, the campaign has let it be known, Trump will sign an executive order “to withhold passports, Social Security numbers and other government benefits from children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States.”Neither Trump nor Miller appears to have made any distinction between the undocumented children of undocumented immigrants and the native-born children of undocumented immigrants, which fits their opposition to the Constitution’s guarantee of birthright citizenship through the 14th Amendment. Under the Trump deportation plan, citizenship will not save those who have the wrong background.The Trump campaign’s promise to detain and deport millions of immigrants, along with many American citizens, is a promise to plunge the country into an authoritarian nightmare. It is also a promise of strife and pervasive civil conflict.It wouldn’t be the first time that Americans responded to an effort of this sort with violence. With the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, which essentially deputized all authorities and private citizens in free states as slave catchers required to return all escaped slaves to their enslavers, came widespread, armed resistance to efforts to carry out the law. You did not have to be sympathetic to the plight of the enslaved to be outraged by the notion that you could be dragooned into acting as a bounty hunter for state-sanctioned human traffickers.The political consequence of the Fugitive Slave Act, to the dismay of Southern lawmakers, was to radicalize countless Northerners against the so-called Slave Power and raise sectional tensions to a point of almost no return. The law did not cause the Civil War, but it was the provocation that set the stage for a decade of conflict that led, inexorably, to war.Do we not think that a mass deportation program, with roving bands of armed agents, would result in similar upheaval? Do we not think that there would be violent resistance to agents storming homes, churches and businesses to seize and detain people? And do we not think that a Trump who wanted, during his first term, to shoot protesters would see this as an opportunity to do so — a hoped-for chance to invoke the Insurrection Act, mobilize the military and crush his political opponents?We talk often these days of illiberalism. It is has become a bit of a buzzword. Often, the focus is illiberalism in elite spaces, usually classrooms and common areas of selective colleges. Sometimes the focus is on particular politicians. But what we are seeing here from Trump isn’t simply a distaste for liberal values; it is a taste for genuine tyranny and bona fide despotism, one that complements his endless praise for dictators and strongmen.Rhetoric matters, and what candidates say is not simply for show. At every opportunity, Trump has placed the mass deportation of millions of people at the center of his campaign. It is a promise. And the promises a presidential candidate makes while on the trail are the promises a president tries to keep.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

To quickly recap, excessive privatization of Minnesota’s local audit function, in conjunction with an antiquated scope of authority for our duly elected Office of the State Auditor (OSA and a looming shortage of external auditors, is putting Minnesota’s 3,600 or so local governments in financial peril. As a gentle reminder, local governments in the North Star State spend over $64 billion annually – 15.3% more than what state agencies spend in aggregate.Despite the dire circumstances, the fiscal oversight challenges facing localities are neither so intractable nor the policy alternatives so untested that state leaders are incapable of enacting meaningful good government reforms. We’re talking about local audits, after all, not wicked problems like reducing the national debt, achieving lasting peace in the Holy Land or mitigating greenhouse gas emissions responsible for anthropogenic climate change. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Other states have already adopted innovative local audit practices that can be replicated right here in Minnesota to address the auditor shortage.For example, Utah’s elected state auditor isstatutorily designatedas “auditor of public accounts,” meaning his oversight authority transcends state and local jurisdictions. Despite this broad authority, financial audits of local governments in the Beehive State are largely carried out not by the state auditor but instead by private accounting firms. Nevertheless, theUtah Office of the State Auditorstill plays acritical role. Foremost, the state auditor is charged with prescribing uniform accounting, budgeting and financial reporting systems used by all Utahn local governments. Moreover, the state auditor’s Local Government Division receives and files financial audit reports.This regulatory environment just so happens to be identical to what we have here in Minnesota. The key difference, however, is that Utah’s state auditor is also theexternal auditor of last resort. Whenever a locality fails to engage an accountant, or the accountant quits mid-engagement, the state auditor’s office steps in to complete the annual financial audit. If this commonsense reform were enacted here in Minnesota, the days oflocal governmentsandcharter schoolsscrambling to find or replace an external auditor would be a thing of the past. This reform would also render moot the irresponsible idea oflooseningMinnesota’s CPA credentialing requirements.TheNew Mexico Office of the State Auditorprovides another example of how to responsibly and concisely address the auditor shortage. As is the case in Minnesota and Utah, New Mexicans elect their state auditor. And just like in Minnesota and Utah, financial audits of New Mexican localities are largely performed by private accounting firms and filed with the auditor’s office as a matter of public record. But unlike Minnesota’s or, indeed, Utah’s local audit arrangements, New Mexico’s state auditor actually regulatesaudit procurement— contracting with private accounting firms to audit local governments and reviewing their workpapers post-engagement for compliance with reporting requirements.In a similar vein, New Mexico’s state auditor administers a tiered reporting system applicable to all local governments that assigns the level of contracted assurance services based onprogressively graduated revenue thresholds. Under this statutory system, a large city such as Albuquerque must receive a full-blown financial audit every year — as would be expected for a municipality with a $1.37 billion annual budget. Conversely, this same tiered audit reporting framework provides flexibility for smaller localities. New Mexican villages, towns, special purpose districts, and other local governments with gross revenues less than $500,000 annually are only required to undergo annual agreed-upon procedures. For any curious readers, agreed-upon procedures are a type ofattestation engagementunder generally accepted auditing standards which, unlike an actual audit of financial statements, performs only limited testing of accounting records and internal controls. Agreed-upon procedures are, by their nature, cheaper and quicker to execute than conventional financial audits.New Mexico’s tiering is superior to Minnesota’s one-size-fits-allaudit revenue thresholdsbecause of this regulatory flexibility, whereby assurance services are proportionate to organizational cash flows and potential fraud risk. Unfortunately, the status quo does not provide any semblance of proportionality here in Minnesota. Indeed, a fourth-class city must undergo the same comprehensive audit of its financial statements as the first-class cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth and Rochester. A tiered audit reporting system tailored to Minnesota’s needs would ease the regulatory burden on rural communities facing the brunt of the auditor shortage and expand the pool of potential external auditors capable of providing assurance services throughout the state.In summary, I have described two simple but innovative reforms to strengthen Minnesota’s local audit function: (1 name the state auditor as the external auditor of last resort for all local governments, and (2 enact through legislation a tiered audit reporting system that incorporates a procurement oversight role for the state auditor. Taken together, these policy alternatives will actionably and pragmatically address the auditor shortage hitting our local governments especially hard in a post-pandemic world.The policy alternatives also recognize a tempered reality: OSA does not have the financial or human resources to singlehandedly audit the financial statements of every political subdivision in this state. Here in Minnesota, successful local government financial auditing requires continued cooperation between our duly elected state auditor, her100 or so professional staff, and the private accounting firms carrying out the bulk of assurance services provided to localities. Converting our state’s local financial audit activity into an exclusively public sector enterprise would otherwise require a state auditor’s office with at least 600 full time employees. OSA simply doesn’t have the institutional capacity or budgetary support from the Legislature to achieve such a feat. Hence the importance of bolstering the current public-private partnership.Maintaining said partnership necessitates making provision for the aforementioned best practices by way of legislation. Successful implementation, in turn, depends upon the adoption of a robust desk review process administered by OSA — one that will ultimately strengthen public accountability for privately contracted audits. What that process should entail will be the focus of a future essay.Noah McVay is a resident of St. Paul, a soon-to-be graduate of the Master of Public Policy and Administration program at Colorado State University, and a Master of Accountancy student at Rutgers University."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_89,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Rarely has a straightforward 9-0 decision at the Supreme Court felt as unsettling as it did on Thursday.The justices’ unanimous ruling, in FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, rejected a challenge to the most commonly used abortion pill, but it did so only on procedural grounds, without considering the merits of the lawsuit. That means another challenge to the drug, mifepristone, will probably reach the court before long. Based on the right-wing supermajority’s open hostility to reproductive rights, there’s good reason to worry.For now, at least, and purely as a matter of law, the justices got it right, which these days is saying something.The case decided on Thursday was brought by a group of associations and doctors who oppose abortion and argued that mifepristone is unsafe for the women who use it. They wanted the courts to overturn recently instituted Food and Drug Administration rules that made mifepristone easier to get and use, so they maneuvered their case in front of a sympathetic federal judge in Texas, Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has publicly opposed abortion and ruled in the doctors’ favor. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has somehow figured out how to out-radical this Supreme Court, upheld much of Kacsmaryk’s decision.The justices tossed the case for a simple reason: The plaintiffs could not show that they had personally suffered harm from the FDA’s approval of mifepristone. This showing is a fundamental requirement of standing, the judicial doctrine that outlines who is qualified to bring a lawsuit.The court quoted former Justice Antonin Scalia’s description of this requirement as “What’s it to you?” In this case, it’s nothing, as Justice Brett Kavanaugh pointed out in the court’s opinion. Because they oppose abortion, the doctors neither use nor prescribe mifepristone, and the FDA hasn’t required them to do or not do anything. The doctors could not even show a single instance in which they were forced to perform an abortion or even provide abortion-related services against their will.The plaintiffs’ moral opposition to abortion may be genuine, the court conceded, but they are already protected by federal and state laws that allow them to refuse to participate in any procedure that goes against their conscience. In that light, a “desire to make a drug less availablefor othersdoes not establish standing to sue,” Kavanaugh wrote.This is obviously correct. And yet even a plaintiff who could meet the standing requirement to challenge mifepristone on the grounds of safety should lose, because the science is not in dispute.The FDA’s approval of mifepristone, in 2000, was based on reams of research that found it to be effective and safe. It has since become the go-to abortion pill, used for a majority of abortions in America and boasting a complication rate lower than that of other widely prescribed drugs.The challengers sought to offset this mountain of evidence by presenting a few recent studies purporting to show that the use of mifepristone has led to more emergency-room visits and complications. In the trial court, Kacsmaryk based his decision in part on these studies. But the journal that published those studies retracted them this year after discovering that their authors had hidden their affiliations with anti-abortion groups. The research itself was also poorly designed, the journal said, and the conclusions were based on “unjustified or incorrect factual assumptions, material errors in the authors’ analysis of the data, and misleading presentations of the data.”Of course, this dispute isn’t about science or law; it’s about religion and politics. That’s why the court’s right-wing supermajority, which has proved to be as solicitous of religious claims as it is hostile to abortion rights and executive agencies, was willing to hear it.It’s also why Justice Clarence Thomas felt free to inject his personal politics into an otherwise mundane concurrence to Thursday’s ruling.“Just as abortionists lack standing to assert the rights of their clients, doctors who oppose abortion cannot vicariously assert the rights of their patients,” Thomas wrote. Note the discrepancy between “doctors who oppose abortion” on the one hand and “abortionists” on the other — perhaps the first time that epithet, so laced with sneering innuendo, has appeared in a Supreme Court opinion in a justice’s own voice. Doctors can do many things; abortionists can do only one. Also note the differing use of the terms “patients” and “clients” — Thomas is saying, in essence, that the provision of basic health-care services that he objects to is not medicine but business.These are the sorts of smoke signals that energize abortion opponents, who were emboldened by the court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade two years ago, and who are on the warpath to end all legal abortion in America. From the Comstock Act, a 19th-century anti-vice law that activists are trying to resurrect; to “heartbeat bills” that ban abortion after six weeks; to fetal personhood laws and efforts to restrict access to in vitro fertilization; to attacks on birth control pills, Republican lawmakers in Congress and the states are working to impose certain people’s religious values over most people’s fundamental rights.And that’s why, if you care about a woman’s right to control what happens in her own body, you should be very concerned about the next mifepristone case that reaches the Supreme Court. It may well come from any of three states, Idaho, Kansas and Missouri, that attempted but failed to join the current lawsuit. Immediately after Thursday’s ruling was announced, the attorneys general in Kansas and Missouri promised to continue the fight.A majority of Americans has for decades supported abortion rights, sometimes by overwhelming margins. It’s no surprise that one result of overturning Roe v. Wade has been a remarkable string of electoral victories for candidates who support abortion rights and for related ballot measures, in red and blue states alike. The people have been speaking clearly for two years, and yet anti-abortion lawmakers, who are increasingly also anti-democratic lawmakers, have been finding sneaky ways to subvert that voice.In Ohio, for example, legislators have sought to make it harder for voters to put abortion-rights measures on the ballot. Other states have tried to prosecute women who travel to other states to get an abortion.For the time being, access to the abortion pill is preserved. But make no mistake: This was a narrow, procedural win for reproductive rights. In the bigger picture, the anti-abortion forces feel the wind is at their backs. It is up to the majority of Americans who support abortion rights to turn out at the polls this fall, and every year, to demonstrate what protecting equality and bodily autonomy really means.© 2024 The New York Times Company"

With the nation still dealing with the aftereffects of crushing inflation, crises at the southern border and abroad, hateful protests on college campuses and a conviction by 68% of voters that we’re on the wrong track, what they’re being offered is fear and division.The presidential election is playing out like a Grumpy Old Men sequel. Neither President Joe Biden nor Former President Donald Trump is talking about the future and how they’ll make it better should either be returned to the White House this fall. Perhaps that’s because, at age 81 and 78 respectively, their own futures are so limited.Instead of trying to inspire us with big ideas and long-term plans for getting out of the mess we’re in, the worst two presidential candidates to ever appear across from each other on a ballot are non-stop fear mongering.Every message from the mouths of Biden and Trump starts with, “If my opponent is elected …” and ends with dire warnings of the disasters that will occur should that happen.I suspect I’m like most voters in that I don’t need to be further frightened about four more years of Trump or Biden. I’m already plenty scared.What I need is something hopeful to cling to. I’d like to know how they plan to bring peace and prosperity to America and bring its people together.We have started the process at The News of interviewing candidates for endorsements. This year, we’ve put in place a firm rule: Talk about yourself and what you will do if elected, and not about your opponent. We won’t endorse anyone whose only case to the voters is that they aren’t as bad as the person they’re running against.What we’re looking for are candidates who can articulate positive ideas for moving the country forward, and I believe most voters are looking for the same. So why aren’t we getting it?Because the brimstone messaging “resonates with their bases,” says pollster Richard Czuba of the Glengariff Group. “Both presidential candidates have problems with their bases, and they’re trying to motivate them.“Who it doesn’t resonate with is independents and centrist voters. Elections aren’t about the past, they’re about the future. Centrist voters want to know what’s the plan for the next four years.”Count me in that group. I’m most of all looking for something I haven’t heard much about this cycle: optimism.“Most successful presidents have optimism at their core,” Czuba says. “Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama were all optimistic leaders.”Some of those presidents Czuba mentioned I voted for, some I didn’t. But I’d take any one of them over the two gloomy doomsday purveyors we have to choose from in November.Optimism, hope, inspiration — call it what you will. But it’s what voters are looking for. And right now, as Czuba says, “they don’t see the future in either of these candidates.”Not a single hat hit the ice to celebrate Jason Robertson’s first career playoff hat trick that paced the Dallas Stars to a 5-3 road win over the Edmonton Oilers on Monday night in Game 3 of the Western Conference final.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_146,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°CHICAGO — Barack and Michelle Obama resurfaced, with a vengeance.Doug Emhoff, the nation’s second gentleman, turned on the goofy charm.A number of rhetorical torches were passed.With Joe Biden thanked and sent packing, the second night of the Democratic National Convention swung its full attention to Kamala Harris, with a symbolic roll-call vote and fusillade of attacks on Donald Trump.Leading the assault were the former president and his wife, who seemed to release years of pent-up passion in a single volcanic speech.Columnists Mark Z. Barabak and Anita Chabria, wearing flammable suits, took it all in and had these observations from Chicago.Barabak:Eight years ago, when Democrats gathered to nominate Hillary Clinton, then-First Lady Michelle Obama famously urged them to rise above the ugliness of the race against the vitriolic Trump.Forget all that. There was not a speck of “they-go-low-we-go-high” restraint when Obama took the stage Tuesday night in her hometown.“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to make people fear us,” she said of herself and her husband. “His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hard-working, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black.”She spoke with the force of a spring uncoiled and the determination of a balled-up fist.“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those ‘Black jobs?’” Obama said, using Trump’s clueless locution. “It’s his same old con: doubling down on ugly, misogynistic, racist lies as a substitute for real ideas and solutions that will actually make people’s lives better.”The roar inside the convention hall would have blown the roof off had it not been so firmly fastened.Chabria:What we saw with Michelle and Barack’s speeches was the difference between 2020 and 2024 — not so much an evolution of the Obamas but an evolution of America.As Barack Obama pointed out, it has been 16 years since he stood in front of the Democratic National Convention to accept the nomination.In many ways that are ugly and retrograde, the rise of the MAGA wing of the Republican Party was a response to his presidency, the bubbling up of a semi-latent but potent racism that lurked just beneath our surface.That shocked some of us, and was old news to many others. But it’s worth noting that even as recently as a few months ago, there was backroom chatter that a Black/Asian American woman had no chance of being elected president.But here we are, deep inside the moment that is the ultimate reckoning for the rise of MAGA. I’ve said it before: This election is as much about our ideals and values as it is the candidates.As Barack Obama said, “Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them; between the real Americans who support him and the outsiders who don’t. And he wants you to think that you’ll be richer and safer if you just give him the power to put those ‘other’ people back in their place.”Your thoughts?Barabak:When his turn came, the former president was more emotionally restrained, in keeping with his character, but no less fierce.He mocked Trump as “a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.”He depicted Trump as a has-been, his shtick grown old, and the annoying neighbor who constantly keeps his leaf blower running.“From a neighbor, that’s exhausting,” Obama said. “From a president, it’s just dangerous.”Michelle Obama confronted Trump with molten anger. The former president filleted him with cool disdain.He even made a Freudian reference to Trump’s “weird obsession with crowd sizes,” holding his hands just a few inches apart and leaving the audience to infer the rest.Chabria:I’m not sure how much was left to infer. That off-color joke to me was in tune with the Harris campaign, putting joy and laughter into something serious.As much as the Obamas brought the fire, they also brought hope. Michelle Obama said Harris was “a tribute to her mother, to my mother, and to your mother too.”Michelle, in particular, focused a lot of her time on reminding us that the Trumps of the world are the exception, not the rule, and that most of us “don’t get to change the rules so we always win.”She also cautioned against railing against good because it’s not perfect — something Democrats have long been prone to — and to avoid a “Goldilocks complex about whether everything is just right.”You saw that same duality in Barack Obama’s speech.Barabak:It was almost as though the former president delivered two speeches.There was the part where he excoriated Trump. Then there were long sections that recalled that transcendent speech at the 2004 Democratic convention, which launched his meteoric rise as he appealed to voters’ better nature.Our politics have grown so rancorous and corrosive, Obama said, with each side trying to outshout the other, that many Americans have tuned out, leaving the extremes to drive a deeper wedge through the country.Obama called for more kindness and grace, saying “as much as any policy or program” what many yearn for is a country where people and politicians “work together and help each other.”It was, to use an old Obama word, audacious to follow his scathing attacks on Trump with such a plea. But, the former president suggested, that turn away from the politics of anger, division and hate is what the choice in November is all about.And then there was the second gentleman, as he is formally known, Doug Emhoff.Chabria:Emhoff is a weapon of cuteness and light. Don’t underestimate this guy as goofy. He knows exactly what he’s doing.He’s been charged with making Harris likable and understandable, and he delivered last night with a speech that went all the way through from their first blind date to Harris’ dedication and love as a stepmom.“Her empathy is her strength,” he told the crowd.Doug makes me understand Harris’ choice of Tim Walz as her running mate. Both share a complete comfort with powerful women, and both are comfortable in their own skin.Emhoff is the molecular opposite of JD Vance, the GOP vice presidential nominee. I fear if you ever put them in the same room it would be like a particle and its antiparticle colliding.Barabak:There was something endearing about Emhoff’s breezy delivery and the way he seemed to treat his big speech almost as a lark. He was earnest and relatable in a way few political figures are.“You know that laugh,” he said of his wife’s great, gusting guffaw, which critics have sought to weaponize. He seemed genuinely puzzled. “I love that laugh!”Emhoff may be in an unconventional role, as the nation’s first second gentleman. But he performed Tuesday night’s assigned task — humanizing his more famous and powerful spouse — like an old pro.Nestled between lush community gardens and the sandy coastline of the Old Airport Beach Park, the Makaeo Walk Path offers a scenic trail for community members to enjoy year-round.OTTAWA — Canada’s two main freight rail companies are set to lock out around 10,000 of their Canadian unionized workers on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. ET (0401 GMT , starting an unprecedented simultaneous work stoppage that would grind almost all railway freight movement in the country to a halt.WASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."
minnpost_2024_63,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.As a pediatrician who’s practiced medicine in the Twin Cities area for almost 30 years, I’ve cared for generations of local kids. During that time I’ve been encouraged to see significant progress in pediatric care — new therapies, more inclusive research. Over the past decade as a pediatrician, I’ve been alarmed to see a trend starting to threaten that progress.Kids are being sucked into a digital vortex that’s driving declining school performance and a rise in mental health issues unlike anything I’ve seen in my career. Social media is consumed by nearly every kid, even the littlest ones. Young patients blithely show me usage statistics on their phones that reveal a mind-boggling number of hours spent on digital platforms like YouTube and TikTok. What my patients don’t realize is the enormous impact all this screen time can have on their developing minds, their self-esteem — even their sleep patterns.Parents may not fully realize the dangers, either. Many parents lack the tech savvy to help their children meaningfully navigate the online world. Many of my families speak Spanish as the primary language in the home. As a result, their families face additional challenges in this digital era where platforms are often geared toward English-speaking users. And with all the addictive features baked into the technology and platforms kids are using, the reality is that just saying “put down the phone” is no longer enough.As pediatricians, it’s part of our job to educate kids and parents about healthier screen use and avoiding danger and exploitation online — but given the scope of these problems, the responsibility can’t fall solely on this side of the technology. We need education andlegislation to safeguard kids online.That’s why our state’s pediatric community is proud to support theMinnesota Kids Code, legislation that would improve young people’s experiences online by requiring tech companies to implement privacy-by-default and safety-by-design protections. This legislation takes a smart approach by addressing these problems at their root and making youth privacy and child development a central consideration in developing any technology (and addressing design flaws in existing ones that kids will interact with.We know that platforms like YouTube and TikTok can comply because other countries, including the U.K. and Ireland,already havepassed laws implementing an Age Appropriate Design Code. In practice, these provisions are helping make technology look more like what the American Academy of Pediatricsofficially recommendsfor kids: “interfaces that areappropriate to child developmental abilities, that are not distracting, and that promote shared parent-child media use and application of skills to the real world” (ideas that AAP’sFamily Media Plancan helps parents and kids put into action .The Kids Code’s safety-by-design framework is paired with solid privacy rules that protect young people and their data from exploitation. Enhancing privacy is critical given the dangers we now know children are being exposed to on the most popular social media platforms.New revelationsfrom an ongoing lawsuit by more than 40 state attorneys general against the parent company of Instagram and Facebook show that Meta knows adult predators use features like “People You May Know” to target kids — but refuses to stop them.Malicious contact like this can wreak devastation in a child’s life. I’ve even had a patient attempt self-harm after sharing inappropriate personal photos.That’s just one example of the harm social media facilitates. Other patients struggle with body image, a crisis fueled by design features that glorify or normalize extreme weight loss techniques and ever-shrinking physiques. During adolescence, it’s common for teens of all genders to have increased concerns about body image and appearance. My own clinical experience reflects the national statistic that health visits related to eating disordersmore than doubledamong kids 16 and younger between 2018 and 2022. These days, youth are reporting profoundly distorted views of themselves — wanting to look like they do through beauty filters, comparing themselves to AI-generated influencers.It’s no coincidence that the number of kids with mental health issues is at the highest I’ve ever seen. We are seeing skyrocketing levels of mental and behavioral problems linked to social media in pediatric clinics all across Minnesota. This has prompted a tremendous change in how pediatricians practice medicine, as we’ve had to step into the roles of psychologists and psychiatric prescribers.We must tackle this public health threat head-on and safeguard Minnesota’s kids. That’s why, as pediatricians, we call on legislators to take action and pass the Minnesota Kids Code into law.Eileen Crespo, MD, FAAP, is the president of the Minnesota Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_88,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Bring your parent to school, bring your child to work, bring your mother to a job interview.That last one may stick out as odd, but it is apparently a growing phenomenon in the workforce. A recent study indicates that as much as 25% of Generation Z job applicants have brought a parent with them to a job interview in the past year.The image may seem ridiculous. But there’s a clear path that led us here.Let’s start with employers saying younger applicants are unprepared. That should not be altogether surprising given the havoc the pandemic played on the world’s education system and the lives of young people during formative years. The ramifications stemming from years of interruption in learning and social development are beginning to show up in the workforce.Last fall, when I started teaching a college class, it took weeks for me to get my students to make eye contact and speak in class to one another — and some of them want a career in communication. I’ve spoken to friends who are also educators, and they have seen the same.Which is why some young people would opt to bring a familiar face into an unfamiliar setting. And in some cases, they’ll choose the only adults they interacted with in person while we were sheltered in place: their parents. The image doesn’t seem so ridiculous when you think about it like that. Because of the applicant’s understandable social awkwardness — anxiety, avoiding eye contact — the presence of a parent can bring reassurance. That doesn’t mean the young person can’t do the job without Mom or Dad. It means that job interviews are stressful. It means the pandemic’s full toll is still becoming apparent.What we have been experiencing in this post-pandemic world is a cultural shift in labor that is redefining what it means to work. Now society is welcoming into this uncertain world of work young people who didn’t get a chance to decipher human interaction like everyone else because they spent so much time isolated and worse: on social media.Sure, bringing your dad to a job interview is unusual. But what exactly about the past four years screams “usual”? We just went through a once-in-a-century pandemic during which children couldn’t see their friends and parents couldn’t find work or toilet paper.The weirdness isn’t all distant memory. About a month ago, there was a strip of the country that experienced 100 tornadoes in a week. No wonder Gen Z’s No. 1 issue is climate change. The weather can’t capture much attention though because even 100 tornadoes isn’t the strangest news. We’re all pretty distracted by the felon running for president.So again, what has been normal about the times in which today’s young adults have come of age?Perhaps instead of ridicule — which I’ve seen a lot of in response to the reports about parents being brought to interviews — why don’t we try some compassion?Between 2018 and 2022 the math and reading scores of 15-year-olds fell by 15% and 10%, respectively. That most likely means many of today’s high school seniors are still playing catch-up. Not because they are entitled or have poor work habits but because at the age when they were supposed to be learning to adult, they were watching the world go to hell.The narrative that Gen Z is immature is unfair for singling out this bloc, but not entirely wrong about young people in general, throughout history."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_280,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Among the attacks the Donald Trump camp is lobbing at presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is the notion that the vice president failed at her one crucial job in the White House, that of “border czar.” In truth, this was never her role; among other things in her portfolio was helping address the “root causes” of migration from other countries, a hazy task.This involves a lot of circumstances in which the U.S. doesn’t have (and probably shouldn’t have direct say. U.S. meddling in South and Central America has often helped produce rather than ameliorate the conditions for migration away. Instability and unrest often end up driving people north, eventually leading to the creation of the transnational gangs that today feed the violence producing new Central American migrants.There are good reasons for even a president to have a light touch when it comes to influencing conditions and policies abroad, a vice president doubly so. Even so, Harris was very clear during her official visit abroad as VP, when she stood in Guatemala and somewhat infamously told migrants “do not come.” It didn’t work.Beyond these diplomatic missions and behind-the-scenes coordinating with foreign heads of state and other officials about the best ways to improve local economies and stem outflows, Harris has had no direct operational control of the border.The Biden administration ultimately maintained a lot of the Trump-era approach to the border, including the over-broad and questionably legal Title 42 expulsion scheme. The deport-them-all crowd assiduously fails to note that border crossings began to rise towards the end of Trump’s presidency and have continued on an upward trend for most of Biden’s; there is no sharp break before and after. We have reasons to criticize this approach, but throwing the border open is not one of them.One policy that the White House did roll out to directly target the incentives towards taking a risky overland journey to the border was to implement an orderly humanitarian parole system for Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans, allowing them to secure sponsorship and advance permission instead of just chaotically arriving. Republicans absolutely hated it, proving that the problem wasn’t a lack of order.The truth is that while domestic policy can certainly affect international migration flows, it can only move the needle a bit without getting to outright cruelty. Something as horrible as family separation wasn’t enough to fundamentally deter people, so they’ve migrated to fantasizing over use of the military to round people up and even shoot migrants on sight, as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott idly mused about doing earlier this year.Harris did not succeed at somehow stopping all U.S.-bound humanitarian migration because this is not possible, and certainly not so in four years. The bipartisan immigration bill in the Senate, while not perfect, could have helped. But remember who killed that deal: Donald Trump.Where Biden failed, and where Harris should commit to a better policy is when folks actually do arrive, such as by providing federal funding and logistical support for cities like NYC to help assimilate migrants and turn them into an economic and cultural boon. Now that would be smart.— New York Daily News"

In the meat section, I introduced my infant son and invited him to visit my classroom. (I left the interaction chagrined when I realizedthe brand nameof the three tubs of almond dip on clearance in my cart was laced with profanity. In late January, my mind instantly returned to this chance meeting with the new superintendent of the Philadelphia School District when I received an email requesting input on the “Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Priority Survey,” stating, “Our responsible use of the federal funding received during the pandemic and post-pandemic years helped lead to lower levels of student learning loss than other large urban districts, balanced budgets and our highest bond ratings in decades.”Recently, a Commonwealth Court judge ruled that Pennsylvania’s school funding system is unconstitutional because it doesn’t provide enough resources to students in Philadelphia and other underserved districts, thus depriving them ofan adequate education.As the impact of this seismic ruling begins to settle and more funding begins to reach struggling districts, I implore Watlington and the School District of Philadelphia to take a few basic steps to make better use of its new — and existing — resources. That starts with compensating teachers properly.Except for an occasional pick-me-up or Amazon return, I don’t go to Whole Foods much. As a teacher, I can’t afford it. My most recent teaching contract increase did not even match the rate of inflation.» READ MORE:Philly educators are leaving at alarming rates. Here are 3 teachers’ stories.Like countless other teachers in the female-dominated industry, the majority of my paycheck goes toward day care ($2,100 per month ; I am still recovering financially from not having a viable maternity leave. Other young teachers send their checks directly to local universities for their required continuing education credits (while continuing to pay off undergraduate loans .To make ends meet, many teachers are balancing multiple jobs or seeking extra employment in the summer months. And, no surprise, research found thatPhilly teachers are leaving the profession at very high rates— higher than the rest of the state, and faster than they can be replaced by new members of the profession.Teachers should be compensated fairly so they can pay for their basic livelihoods.(Yes, teachers get great insurance benefits working in the district. But it only makes logical sense that people working in environmentally unfit conditions — such ascrumbling buildings full of asbestos— should have good medical care. I am good at stretching a buck — my son and I get all of our picture books at a thrift store for 50 cents. My classroom is filled with these findings, as well. We teachers have been doing this for years. Meanwhile, we watch as the district seems to struggle to manage its own internal resources in a smart way.In collaboration with Scholastic, the district is spending half a million dollars toprovide elementary schools with picture books. Bundles of shrink-wrapped new young adult readers lay in my classroom from a summer program that was held at my school but were never used. Watlington’s predecessor, William R. Hite Jr.,spent $600,000 renovating his office, and I can’t help but notice administrators toting costly briefcases and other fancy gear.I have seen portable Smart boards thrown away en masse. I have seen learners go through five Chromebooks in a year due to user damage. There are heavy building operational costs forhalf-empty schools. Some schools lack basic resources, while other buildings are overflowing with unused curricula.The district must get better at managing its internal assets. This is frustrating to watch as a teacher — although we have historically had inequitable funding, as the recent funding lawsuit points out, at times it doesn’t seem like we make responsible investments with the money we have.The district must get better at managing its internal assets.What’s more, we have historically failed to place money closest to the students. The district hasbuilt new headquarters, invested in a myriad of consulting firms for instruction, and appointed costly new administrativepositions. Meanwhile, classrooms continue to be overcrowded and buildingscontinue to be environmentally hazardous.Buying more curricula materials and technology for teachers will not fix many of the district’s systemic issues. We must invest in more teachers in classrooms. We must invest more in safe school buildings. This is what will have the most impact on students.Let me be clear: Even with a fair salary increase, I don’t expect to be making regular trips to Whole Foods anytime soon with a growing toddler and insane milk prices. I don’t expect the district to procure books from the thrift store. But I hope the district will begin financially investing in teachers. I hope the district will start being more judicious with its resources, just as its educators who are on a budget. And as more money comes in, I hope the district starts sending it where it has the most impact on the people who matter most: the students.Lydia Kulina-Washburn is a high school English language arts teacher in the School District of Philadelphia.@LydiaKulina"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_111,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°In the past several months, I have visited two student encampments in Chicago and, in both cases, I sensed the power of people in a liberated zone. The evacuation of these encampments brought to mind consecutive attempts by the Egyptian military to evacuate Tahrir.Beginning at Columbia University on April 17, more than 100 campus encampments were erected across the United States. They raised critical demands about ending war and genocide in Gaza, calling for universities to divest from military and weapons manufacturing companies, financial transparency and free expression. They also demand amnesty for detained students, of which there are currently more than 2,800 across the country.Most critics of the encampments ignore the larger set of demands and focus, instead, on the supposed antisemitism of the protests because they criticize Israel’s war on Gaza, despite protesters’ own statements denouncing antisemitism. These critics also overlook that some of the key organizers in the movement are Jewish and belong to organizations such as Jewish Voice for Peace.Israel’s war is still ongoing, but the movement has succeeded in forcing some institutions to divest from companies profiting from the destruction of Gaza, or at least to start the process of voting on divestment. The protests have already had a significant impact, not unlike the student movements against the Vietnam War and apartheid South Africa.First, they instigated public conversations about university budgets and endowments. Most universities in the United States, including public universities, survive on tuition and private donations. But in recent decades, many top universities have reoriented their endowments toward aggressive investment strategies. By calling for universities to separate themselves from companies involved in Israel’s war, the movement has highlighted the increasing corporatization of higher education.The protesters also prompted a much-needed discussion about campus policing. The American Association of University Professors has highlighted how campus policing has racist historical roots and continues to target racial minorities. The encampments exposed this problem when university administrators ordered campus and city police to forcibly evacuate the encampments.Additionally, the encampments raised awareness about the Israel-Palestine conflict. According to a report by the Center for Constitutional Rights and Palestine Legal, the United States has a long-standing exception for free speech when it comes to Palestine. As a result, many faculty and students have been afraid to speak up. But for the first time on many U.S. campuses, students and faculty have defied this ban.Finally, the protesters contribute to restoring our humanity. They tell us that we should not overlook the atrocities sponsored by our government in Gaza. They pressure us to care about the lives of people beyond our borders. Images and messages from Gazans giving thanks to these students remind us that we can truly advocate for human solidarity, democracy and equality.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_30,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°On Friday, a bit over a week after his poor debate performance against Donald Trump, President Joe Biden sat down with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos for a conversation widely seen as meant to reassure allies and the American electorate that he’s up to the job.The president did not dispel questions over his acuity and fitness, largely because he can’t at this stage. No matter what he does, he will still be an 81-year-old man with a tendency towards gaffes and verbal tics that, while not exclusively related to his age, feed the perception that he’s not as with it as he once was. Democrats in Congress and even the White House are fretting, tumbling between the idea of pressuring Biden to step aside and defending him.But it is true that the man who appeared in that brief interview seemed comfortable, sharp — if somewhat practiced and guarded, as was typical of presidents before Trump’s off-the-cuff ravings — and determined. It’s impossible to draw too sweeping of a conclusion from a 22-minute sit-down, which is of course the problem; those who want to find evidence that Biden has one foot in the grave can find plenty of fodder, as well as those arguing for his ability to stay in the job.Biden sprung to the interview from an energetic rally in Wisconsin, where he performed well despite some verbal slip-ups of the type anyone could make — saying 2020 instead of 2024 and immediately correcting himself, for example. At both the rally and in the interview, the president was sure to raise what really matters in this contest: what he’s done and plans to do, especially in contrast to his opponent.As we’ve said before, the decision to continue or not is solely up to Biden.This week, NATO leaders will meet in Washington to honor an alliance that will be closing its 75th year in a far stronger position than it was even just a few years ago, shepherded in large part by Biden. Trump, meanwhile, seems ready to kill the alliance, a move that will instantly make the world a far more dangerous place, and whose gravity Trump himself probably doesn’t even grasp. Trump’s own frequent verbal flubs and ramblings verging on outright incoherence have been so common as to become background noise, paradoxically making them less of a story than Biden’s missteps.With the Supreme Court having now explicitly declared the president immune from all manner of “official acts” — up to the determination of judges, of course — Trump could enter office empowered to carry out the many authoritarian policies he’s explicitly promised to undertake. These range from deploying the military in city streets to sending federal agents after his political opponents, not for having committed any crimes, but for daring to oppose him, and his allies have spent the past few years developing detailed plans to put this awful project in motion immediately. Unless, he doesn’t mean it.So no, neither we nor anyone can say that Biden is in perfect shape. Those who contend that he’s far gone and can no longer focus or hold attention are clearly also wrong, as evidenced by the readily available public appearances from before and after his bad debate night. As Americans debate the fitness of both men to serve a second term, Biden and Trump remain, for now, the only two choices.—New York Daily News"
minnpost_2024_34,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.It seems like every day, news stories of tragedy dominate headlines, but our communities need to know that incredible work is happening to build a brighter future for the next generation. Early childhood care is a critical educational space to create opportunity for children, and champions of early learning are committed to creating greater access to trauma-informed services in the Twin Cities every day.Think of a child’s brain like a garden. When you plant seeds — knowledge and experiences — and care for it through nurturing, learning and exploring, beautiful blooms are the result. Just like a garden, the conditions in which that nurturing takes place matter. Trauma in the form of adverse childhood experience can stunt the growth of the beautiful blooms we hope will come from the garden.Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs caused by something negative or traumatic can create lasting impacts and affect children from all walks of life. Violence in the household, substance or physical abuse, mental health challenges, divorce or separation of parents, food or housing insecurity, and more all constitute ACEs that create long-term mental, physical and social impacts on the children who experience them. The latest studies show that 64% of U.S. adults have experienced at least one type of ACE, and the accumulation of ACEs increases the likelihood of adverse health outcomes.How can our communities mitigate the impact of ACEs, especially when the children dealing with them are powerless to change their situations? We care for the children in a way that emphasizes their inherent resilience, teaches them coping mechanisms and guides them on a path to face these ACEs with the confidence and social-emotional skills children can develop at a young age. This practice is called trauma-sensitive care, and it is at the core of Greater Twin Cities United Way’s 80×3 initiative.The 80×3 initiative takes the latest science of early learning and applies those teaching methods to children dealing with ACEs — in particular those in marginalized or poverty-stricken communities that are most often impacted by trauma that constitutes ACEs. When educators and caregivers place an emphasis on trauma-sensitive caregiving, children develop resilience at a young age and carry those benefits to adulthood, all while minimizing the impact of ACEs on the child’s well-being.Working alongside parents, practitioners, educators, advocates and allies, 80×3 provides professional development opportunities — as well as resources, strategies and a network of support — to create systemic change in the early childhood space. By growing the 80×3 network, we are creating an opportunity to fundamentally change the way the Twin Cities and the state of Minnesota approach early childhood education. As 80×3 grows, we’re seeing tremendous opportunities to further develop the network potential and build a broad base of knowledge to draw on for educators and parents working directly with children facing ACEs.Now, nearly two years into building this program in the Twin Cities, we’ve developed many partnerships across the state. Our program leaders work with over a hundred teachers, hundreds of families and a growing list of organizational partners to bring this trauma-sensitive care to children in the greater Twin Cities area. But we need to reach every corner of our state.Now, Minnesota’s legislative session is underway, and the opportunity to intercede on behalf of children facing traumatic childhood experiences is here in front of us. Greater Twin Cities United Way is proud to stand in coalition with child care organizations Center for Inclusive Child Care and Think Small across the state who are speaking up for expanding trauma-sensitive early childhood care in Minnesota. At Greater Twin Cities United Way’s upcoming Advocacy for Children Day on April 15 at the Capitol, we hope lawmakers will recognize the potential of the 80×3 initiative to not only change lives but also change our entire approach to educating young children. Together, we can grow this network exponentially to touch the lives of thousands of children and their families.Despite the doom and gloom we see every night on the news or in our local paper, there are quiet heroes doing the work to build a better future for Minnesota every day. As educators, we must take advantage of the opportunities we have available to us right now. 80×3 is the start of a greater movement to make positive strides in the way we approach the education of our youngest and most vulnerable learners. We at United Way hope that you will join us in our commitment to creating the change we need for the future.Jamie Bonczyk is the 80×3 program officer at Greater Twin Cities United Way."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_238,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°On Thursday, Donald Trump gave a classic Donald Trump press conference — by which we mean another nasty, self-indulgent, divisive and lie-filled show that was fine as entertainment but a disaster for anyone with aspirations to lead the most powerful nation on earth.“Nobody’s spoken to crowds bigger than me,” said the fibber. “Nobody was killed on Jan. 6,” he said, erasing and insulting the memories of five people who died on the day of the Capitol incursion and its aftermath. “The New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice,” he falsely said of criminal and civil charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney and state attorney general. We’ve come to expect all this and worse, but that doesn’t make it any more acceptable.Remember the three seconds after the assassination attempt when it seemed Trump might have a second life as a more mature uniter?The fact that the man can’t seem to open his mouth without deceiving and inflaming, though, doesn’t mean Democrats should ever stoop to his level. Generally Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are far more careful with their words. But there are a couple of habits at their rallies that they and their supporters should ditch.One, stop it with the couch jokes. In his debut rally as Harris’ wingman, Walz challenged Sen. JD Vance to “get off the couch” and agree to debate, a sly reference to a viral lie. The lie started as a joke on the platform formerly known as Twitter and then spread, and spread, and spread. It’s utterly untrue.Some who understandably revile Trump say they’ll stop spouting the lie when the other side stops saying that they won the 2020 election, a far more pernicious falsehood. But that’s not the way things work: Untruths poison public debate, and the fact that one person or party engages in them irresponsibly doesn’t give their rival license to do the same.The second tendency we’re not especially fond of is the “Lock him up” chant that’s now a feature of some Harris-Walz rallies, a purposeful echo of the awful and anti-democratic “Lock her up” chants aimed at Hillary Clinton in 2016. These are funnier and not altogether horrible, since Trump — unlike Clinton, who was never even charged with a crime — has actually been convicted by a jury of his peers of crimes (34 felony counts that could carry jail time.But in the American system, Trump gets to appeal, a right of which he’s availing himself. And even if he didn’t, it’s more than a little gross for people who are supposed to believe in impartial law and order, not to mention criminal justice reform, to salivate about putting a first time offender behind bars for nonviolent crimes. It’s especially unwelcome when this happens in the context of a political rally and the someone is the other candidate on the ballot.Let us be very clear again: No matter what Kamala Harris, Tim Walz and Democrats do in this election, there’s no chance they’ll ever stoop to the level of Trump, who revels in falsehoods and poisons politics practically with just about every sentence he utters. But that’s not the standard — that’s the whole point. Decency is."

The Supreme Court of the United States has granted immunity to a president to commit crimes as long as the crime is committed in an “official capacity.”So what is keeping Joe Biden from barging into the Supreme Court in session and threatening six of their lives if they don’t allow him to have his opponent arrested for high crimes and felonies?Jeffrey FendentzMountain ViewThe fight againstdrug traffickingI am a Boy Scout from Troop 1023 in Hilo. There is a requirement to email an editor for a newspaper to express our opinion about a topic we chose.I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the recent news of a Kapolei man charged with moving more than $950,000 worth of drugs. This alarming incident underscores the urgent need for our community to address the growing problem of drug trafficking and its devastating impact on our society.Drug trafficking is not only a criminal activity, but also a significant public health issue that affects families, neighborhoods and the overall well-being of our community. The sheer volume of drugs involved in this case highlights the scale of the problem and the resources and coordination required to combat it effectively.It is imperative that we support our law enforcement agencies in their efforts to tackle drug trafficking. This includes providing them with the necessary tools, training and funding to conduct thorough investigations and bring perpetrators to justice.Additionally, we must advocate for stronger penalties for those involved in drug trafficking to serve as a deterrent to others. Moreover, addressing the root causes of drug abuse is crucial. We need to invest in comprehensive drug education and prevention programs, particularly targeting our youth, to reduce the demand for illegal substances. Access to quality rehabilitation and support service for those struggling with addiction is also vital to help them recover and reintegrate into society.Community involvement is essential in this fight. Residents must remain vigilant and report suspicious activities to authorities. Collaboration between community organizations, schools and local government can create a united front against drug trafficking and support affected individuals and families.In light of this incident, I urge all community members to come together and prioritize the fight against drug trafficking. By taking a proactive and collaborative approach, we can make our neighborhoods safer and healthier for everyone.Matthew OharaHilo"
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_107,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°This week, Breitbart interviewed former Trump official Peter Navarro, one of many criminals in the ex-president’s orbit, from the Miami prison where he is serving four months for contempt of Congress. While life behind bars is difficult, Navarro boasted that his stint has been smoothed by his ties to Donald Trump, which make him something of a made man. The former president, said Navarro, is beloved not just by the guards, but by the “vast majority” of inmates as well. “If I were a Bidenite, things would be a lot tougher here — and yes, they know exactly who I am and respect the fact that I stood up for a principle and didn’t bow to the government,” he said.One of the more unsettling things about our politics right now is the Republican Party’s increasingly open embrace of lawlessness. Even as they proclaim Trump’s innocence, Trump and his allies revel in the frisson of criminality. At his rally in the Bronx last month, for example, Trump invited onto the stage two rappers, Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow, who are currently facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder and weapons possession. (They’ve pleaded not guilty. During Trump’s recent criminal trial, his courtroom entourage included Chuck Zito, who helped found the New York chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang and spent six years in prison on drug conspiracy charges. (The Justice Department has linked his Hells Angels chapter to the Gambino crime family. Trump, who has his own history of mafia ties, has repeatedly compared himself to Al Capone. MAGA merchants sell T-shirts — and, weirdly, hot sauce — showing Trump as either Vito or Michael Corleone from “The Godfather” movies, with the caption “The Donfather.”Both liberals and anti-Trump conservatives have sometimes had trouble getting their heads around this phenomenon. Often the go-to move is to point out hypocrisy: so much for law and order! But the disturbing thing about the MAGA movement’s outlaw turn isn’t that it’s failing to live up to its own conservative values. It’s that it’s adopting a sinister set of new, or newly resurrected, ones.A fascinating new book by John Ganz, “When the Clock Broke: Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s,” offers a useful way to think about the value system undergirding MAGA’s romance with the mob. Ganz’s book excavates a prehistory of Trumpism in the angry, cynical period between the end of the Cold War and the full flush of the Clinton boom. You can see, in the rise of figures like David Duke, Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan, Trumpism in embryo. (The chapter on Duke, and the cultish loyalty he inspired, is particularly illuminating. But the most revelatory section — some of which Ganz has adapted in a post for his Unpopular Front newsletter — involves the mystique around mobster John Gotti and the Buchanan-style paleoconservatives who saw, in the mafia, an admirable patriarchal alternative to the technocratic liberalism they despised.Both Murray Rothbard, a co-founder of the libertarian Cato Institute, and Sam Francis, a white nationalist who has become posthumously influential among MAGA elites, found in “The Godfather” novel and films a vision of a self-governing social order more admirable than our own.Francis used the German termsGemeinschaftandGesellschaftto contrast the values of the Godfather with those of liberal modernity.Gemeinschaft, he wrote, describes a culture based on “kinship, blood relationship, feudal ties, social hierarchy, deference, honor and friendship,” whereasGesellschaftrefers to a social world that is atomized, calculating and legalistic. “It is a principal thesis of ‘The Godfather’ that American society is aGesellschaftat war with theGemeinschaftinherent in the extended families of organized crime, and it is the claim of the novel and even more intensely of the films that the truly natural, legitimate, normal and healthy type of society is that of the gangs,” wrote Francis in 1992.There’s a similar dichotomy between Trump and his enemies: He represents charismatic personal authority as opposed to the bureaucratic dictates of the law. Under his rule, the Republican Party, long uneasy with modernity, has given itself over toGemeinschaft. The Trump Organization was always run as a family business, and now that Trump has made his dilettante daughter-in-law vice chair of the Republican National Committee, the Republican Party is becoming one as well. To impose a similar regime of personal rule on the country at large, Trump has to destroy the already rickety legitimacy of the existing system. “As in Machiavelli’s thought, the Prince is not only above the law but the source of law and all social and political order, so in the Corleone universe, the Don is ‘responsible’ for his family, a responsibility that authorizes him to do virtually anything except violate the obligations of the family bond,” Francis wrote. That also seems to be how Trump sees himself, minus, of course, the family obligations. What’s frightening is how many Republicans see him the same way.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

minnpost_2024_22,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Minnesota’s “warm winter” is a reminder that our climate is changing in ways that are negative for the environment we revere, enjoy and responsibly use.To address this risk, Minnesota now has an ambitious goal of 100% of its energy coming from clean sources by 2040. Now comes the hard part.How?The practicalities of building clean energy systems like wind, solar, hydrogen, geothermal, transmission and battery storage are confounding for some: all these clean energy systems require minerals like nickel, copper and platinum to create or deliver the electrons produced without emissions.A single wind turbine requires up to 4.7 tons of copper, and an electric vehicle battery can contain up to 80 kilograms of nickel. A hydrogen electrolyzer, the equipment that converts water to hydrogen, requires platinum group metals. The International Energy Agency estimates that the global supply of minerals like copper and nickel needs to increase by a staggering 40% by 2040 to meet the requirements of clean energy systems.As the demand for clean energy technologies surges, so does the need for these minerals. It’s just math.Some more math: the clean energy transition requires mining for these materials. There is no way around it. Recycling old phones and computers from the “drawer of doom” won’t cut it. The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA has concurred that there are not enough minerals in circulation to build the clean energy systems required for a complete transition.However, recycling is crucial if we want a responsible and secure supply chain for clean energy. We need every means possible to supply the minerals required to meet our clean energy ambitions today and create a future system that is circular. Future generations, perhaps in 2060 or 2070, may enjoy a circular system that completely relies on recycling of minerals and metals to build new clean energy systems. What we are able to responsibly mine today is in fact a contribution to future generations ability to rely less on mining. Building up recycling infrastructure and creating strong policies is also a contribution to future generations’ ability to enjoy a circular system.Minnesota is uniquely positioned to both supply minerals and metals from the earth, for their first use in clean energy systems, and also create the infrastructure and systems to recover these minerals and metals for their second, third and fourth use. That’s the big difference between extracting minerals from the earth and extracting fossil fuels. The minerals we mine today are infinitely recyclable.Minnesota has abundant mineral resources that hold significant reserves of nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals. Our ability to responsibly mine Minnesota’s rich supply of minerals is bolstered by the fact we have the strongest environmental laws in the country, so that we can mine critical minerals while protecting the environment and cultural resources.Support for a new system to encourage recycling electronics and batteries is currently being considered by the Legislature. Refinements are still being considered, but ultimately the Legislature should pass legislation that supports building an electronic and battery recycling industry and establishes a new Critical Minerals Recovery Task Force. The state should also implement policies that require that minerals in the clean energy systems it purchases or are deployed in the state use tracking and tracing technology to validate the minerals used were produced at high standards. What’s the sense buying batteries that contain nickel that was produced by razing and entire rainforest in Indonesia?The mineral intensity of clean energy systems is unsettling for some. But we need to find agreement on how and where we can support mining these minerals for their first useful life, while we also build up recycling systems to ensure we use them again and again. It’s just math. We need both mining and recycling if we are going to meet goals like 100% Clean Energy by 2040.Todd Malan is Chief External Affairs Officer and Head of Climate Strategy at Talon Metals."
leoweekly_2024_5,"My first Gay Pride Parade was viewed through a greasy window of a Burger King in Toronto, 1991. My family stumbled upon it as we were visiting our family in Canada. The spectacle was something that my twelve year old brain did not think was possible. Colorful balloons, confetti, glitter, an occasional topless person here or there, and SO MUCH SPARKLE….it was amazing.There were men holding hands with men, women kissing women, drag queens in beautiful sequined gowns with tiaras and sashes, leather vested women with tattoos, signs that said “Hate, prejudice and bigotry are not family values.” I knew it was possible, but never saw it with my own eyes.Even at twelve, I knew I was attracted to other girls but coming out in a first generation immigrant catholic family was scary in the 90s. This event was real and it was open to the public to see, visible representation of what I NEEDED to feel included and seen and not feel so different and alone. Of course this opened me up to search out other events when I was old enough to venture on my own and find people like me.In 1997, I even had the opportunity to hold the lead parade banner in my hometown of Louisville, KY. It was called “The March for Justice and Pride Parade” back then. There was no Kentuckiana Pride Festival until 2001.Every year, in June, I have attended a Pride festival or more, traveling to near by festivals, such as one of my favorite spots, Columbus, OH. I always looked forward to public and fairly-safe space that was provided for me to hold my girlfriend’s hand or kiss the one I love. And the year that same-sex marriage became legal, I found my special person. And ever since then, my family and I have made it a tradition to attend Pride Festivals in the area, such as the very family-friendly Southern Indiana Pride and of course my own Kentuckiana Pride Festival.Fast forward to 2024, my wife and I take our twelve year old son to the Kentuckiana Pride Parade. We normally watch the parade from the side lines and cheer for all the fun floats that scream “Love is Love” “Protect Trans Kids” “God Loves Gays.”We love seeing Louisville Youth Group and Fairness with their rainbow balloon wings. We feel safe to accept “Free Mom Hugs” from strangers who are allies marching along side the floats. There is so much excitement to see SO many people like me and where the LGBTIA+ community is visible to everyone. My family and I usually purchase inexpensive tickets at the gate after following behind the parade.This year, the tickets to the festival were capped and sold out days before the festival. So, many of the queer families, like mine, were unable to enter the festival. Outside of the chain-linked fencing, I spoke with several friends, including one of my trans friends who said , “It feels like we are being thrown back into the closet.” (Referring to being denied entry to our very own gay pride. I even spoke to a group of young queer young adults, dressed in their best rainbow and glitter gear, toting rainbow balloon wings given to them. This was their first Pride event without their parents and they were so disappointed they couldn’t get into the festival they were so looking forward to.I think this year’s Kentuckiana Pride Festival shows that the true purpose of Pride was lost in the hype.Any Pride event is an opportunity to connect with other LGBTIA+ in the community, see drag performances, peruse the booths that educate you on community resources, booths that tell you where the next queer-friendly theater performance is located, a safe space for those that feel excluded for who they are and who they love.I was sad I wasn’t able to experience My Pride Festival like I have in the past. Even sadder that these young queers and my gay son had no opportunity to connect with others within the festival.I’m grateful that Louisville gets big ticket concerts that are gay/queer friendly. I just wish the high ticket concert had their own separate space from the rest of the festival.Pride festivals are sometimes the only outlet that is safe for some of my LGBTIA+ folks and Kentuckiana Pride Festival failed those who were unable to attend this year. PRIDE STARTED WITH A RIOT, and the purpose of pride was to give the LGBTIA+ community a voice and visibility to the world. LGBTIA+ very existence being attacked everyday by legislation passed by lawmakers across our country, so let’s not forget why our community needs Pride festivals to be open to everyone. Hopefully next year Kentuckiana Pride Festival Committee will leave the profitable concert to a separate event area and keep the festival open to those who need it, OUR COMMUNITY. ( ."
philinquirer_2024_19,"In recent years, families across the Philadelphia suburbs have faced a barrage of racist incidents. Their experience echoes that of families across the country.The details in the recentdiscrimination complaintfiled against the Pennridge School District in Bucks County are appalling.Some students reportedly derided the “slanty” eyes of their Asian classmates. Others wielded the N-word as a weapon in school hallways and on school buses, in Snapchat conversations, and during school art projects. Still others responded to a lesson about Frederick Douglass by calling a Black classmate a slave.Even more troubling is the district’s alleged response. According to thecomplaint— filed bylocal group the Pair UP Society, the NAACP of Bucks County, theEducation Law Center, and the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School’s Advocacy for Racial and Civic Justice Clinic — Pennridge teachers ignored requests for meetings sent by parents of color worried about their children’s safety.Pennridge administrators, meanwhile, allegedly handed out some short suspensions to students who used racial slurs — but harshly punished the children of color who fought back, not just with lengthy suspensions, but with criminal charges and 45-day bans from extracurricular activities. Not to be outdone, then-school board members, five of whom were reportedlyaffiliated with the right-wing group Moms for Liberty, disbanded the district’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, sparking a bitter fight for control of the board.The elimination of DEI initiatives was a particularly bitter blow; the complaint against Pennridge’s 7,000-student school district describes an institution that suspends Black students at three times the rate of their white peers, even as white children are nearly five times as likely as their Black classmates to be enrolled in Advanced Placement courses.“A lot of families think that’s just what we have to deal with if we want to live in the suburbs. But it takes a toll,” Adrienne King, an African American mother of two and the founder of thePair UP Society, told me recently. “We’re taxpayers, too. We should be able to send our children to the public schools we’re paying for without fear of them being continually subjected to race-related bullying, harassment, and discrimination.”Perhaps most alarming, however, is how pervasive such problems have become.In recent years, families across the Philly suburbs have faced a barrage of racist incidents, from white children in Tredyffrin-Easttownrecording themselves using the N-wordto Quakertown studentshurling rocks and slursat football players and cheerleaders of rival Cheltenham. Such abuse — and the anger, frustration, and disillusionment that follow — all echo the stories of families living outside of Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh whom I spent the past four years following for anew bookon the challenges facing suburbia, and the families who’ve pinned their hopes to its public schools.The repetition suggests a deeper malady.The roots of the tensions now tearing at suburban schools can be traced to the post-World War II suburbanization of America. The residential development boom was supposed to spread opportunity across the country. And it succeeded — at least for those first few generations of mostly white families like mine, who received guaranteed mortgage loans, massive tax breaks, and sparkling new infrastructure, including the public schools we spent decades molding in our own image.Americans embraced the myth that endless, outward expansion could deliver the “suburban lifestyle dream” in perpetuity. When an older suburb’s infrastructure began to crumble, its tax base dwindled, and its test scores slipped, we refused to face facts and start the hard work of repair and renewal. Instead, millions of mostly white families like mine fled inner suburbs to newer suburbs one ring farther out, restarting the same cycle somewhere new, blithely confident we could outrun the debt, disinvestment, and disrepair we left in our wake.There’s a term for trading quick bursts of short-term wealth for massive long-term liabilities that are pushed off onto future generations. It’s called aPonzi scheme.It’s called a Ponzi scheme.In suburbia, this scheme has been fundamentally racialized, with Black, brown, and immigrant families all too often fighting to get into suburban communities, only to be met with racial hostility and fresh rounds of white flight, followed by an even more horrible realization: They’ve been stuck with the bill for all the opportunity whiter and wealthier families already extracted.As tends to happen with Ponzi schemes, however, this cycle is starting to unravel.One big reason is accelerating demographic changes. Bucks County, for example, was 91% white at the turn of the century, but has since seen itswhite population dropby more than 18,000 people as its Hispanic population grew by more than 26,000 people. Such change underpins the racial tensions inside Pennridge schools, which in the past decade alone lost roughly 20% of their white students, nearly 1,400 children in all.Once, a critical mass of families would likely have fled such change for a newer suburb somewhere else. Now, though, many of those families feel stuck in place.Hypothetically, the resulting racial tensions in suburban school districts like Pennridge could present an opportunity to acknowledge the corner we’ve painted ourselves into, learn from our mistakes, and proactively minimize the harm done to our children as we search for a way out.Instead, we’re seeing concerted efforts toban books by Black authorsand scrub the curriculum of references to racial oppression.From the content school systems teach to the budgets they enact, the discipline policies they impose to the enrichment opportunities they extend, there are countless facets of suburban schools that desperately need to be critiqued and improved.But for the disillusioned suburban parents of color forced to have adult conversations with their young children, the core issue is at once more simple and far deeper than that.“It feels like we’re taking our kids’ innocence away, and it just gets normalized,” King told me. “That’s why I try to impress upon people that what’s happening and how it’s being responded to are not OK.”Benjamin Herold is a Philadelphia-based journalist and the author of “Disillusioned: Five Families and the Unraveling of America’s Suburbs.” Learn more atbenjaminherold.com."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_150,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°When more than 100 Iranians were murdered and hundreds of others were injured by suicide terrorists in January, President Ebrahim Raisi said: “We tell the criminal America and Zionist regime that you will pay a very high price for the crimes you have committed and will regret it.” But neither the U.S. nor Israel (the aforementioned Zionist regime had anything to do with the atrocity of killing pilgrims mourning the death of terror master Qasem Soleimani, a general of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC , who the Pentagon justly dispatched in 2020.The actual perpetrator of the terror attack in Kerman, the worst since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979, was ISIS, specially ISIS-K, the Afghanistan offshoot of the bloodthirsty gang. But it didn’t matter to Raisi, a fanatic close to the IRGC. Well, now Raisi is close to God, having died in a helicopter crash, along with Iran’s foreign minister, a regional governor and the local representative of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader.And the culprit here wasn’t Washington or Jerusalem or some internal faction or even ISIS, but a very old copter flying in bad weather over dangerous terrain.Raisi will now have to account for his crimes that earned him the title of “Butcher of Tehran,” a nickname he got not because he was selling halal meat, but for his part in the wanton murder of thousands of political prisoners in 1988. We dare not call the deaths “executions” because that implies the carrying out of a sentence for a capital offense following a fair and just trial.Raisi’s long career of ruthlessness had him being eyed as the 85-year-old Khamenei’s successor as the next supreme leader, the holder of the ultimate power.Iran and the world is at least spared that, but Khamenei and the other mullahs remain, oppressing women, crushing dissent and speech, fomenting terror across the Mideast, and most dangerous of all, still pursuing nukes. Iran was blessed by nature to be sitting on one of the world’s biggest pools of oil and natural gas. They don’t need atomic technology to generate electric power (the phony claim for their reactors and their uranium and their plutonium and the hostile and belligerent regime shouldn’t have nuclear weapons.Funding and arming IRGC proxies Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and Shia terror militias in Iraq and Syria, allows Tehran to extend its power to and attack Israel and moderate Arab states. But what does that power do for the Iranian people? Are they more secure or more prosperous? No. They are less secure or less prosperous.Iran’s fusillade of rockets, missiles and drones at Israel a month ago, despite being a colossal failure, was a shocking act of war that was successfully defeated by an alliance of Israel, Western powers and Arab states. That should be the future of the region, of trade and cooperation, not terror and war. Iran should join with its neighbors instead of trying to undermine and destroy them. However, we fear that Iran’s next president and next supreme leader will continue to pursue aggressive policies that have isolated and impoverished the country.That Iran remains a threat to the Mideast is a decision made by the bad men who lead that nation.— New York Daily News/TNS"
leoweekly_2024_16,"In any meaningful architectural design a fundamental element is relating the building to the site. This can range from wide open, such as Fallingwater, to quite restricted, such as One World Trade Center. Wright allowed the building site of Fallingwater, a creek descending a rugged hillside within a hardwood forest, to inform his design completely. In contrast, One World Trade Center replaced the destroyed World Trade Center twin towers. It was built next to the twin tower footprints, which are now part of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Despite the site restrictions of One World Trade Center the building blends successfully with the skyline of lower Manhattan and the Hudson beyond.Most buildings, of course, are designed with little to no thought given to the site itself and to surrounding areas. The new VA hospital on Brownsboro Rd. falls squarely into this category.David Schulkin, the Secretary of Veterans affairs at the time of the final decision about the hospital’s location, did reduce the size of the project by eliminating a regional VA office building, and by downsizing the parking garage. Despite these changes, however, the complex is completely out of setting within the surrounding suburban landscape. The renderings show a disjointed façade that is far more industrial looking than suburban. Although a thirty-four acre site sounds large, in this case it is not large enough to set the complex apart visually from surrounding residential and commercial buildings, and from I-264. The main building dominates in both its overall footprint and its height.However, this site, known as the Midlands, was in fact chosen. The site sits between the west side of the Crossgate neighborhood and I-264. So, could the design of the main building and the layout of the overall complex have worked better, resulting in less impact on surrounding areas? Yes.The six-story parking garage, even downsized, could hardly be less attractive. Worse, it is placed in the front of the property. Had it been placed at the rear of the property it would have been less visible – an ancillary structure in an ancillary position.The tract has enough acreage to have allowed the main building to be somewhat wider and longer, which could have reduced the height by two stories. As the structure stands now it looms across all of Crossgate. Such a reduction would have made little difference to Crossgate residents, or to the southern end of the Northfield neighborhood across U.S. 42. However, a shorter building would have made a very significant difference to the neighborhoods a little farther out, those along Rudy Lane, along Herr Lane, and across KY 22 from Ballard High School. Citing just one example, at the intersection of Ambridge Dr. and Rudy Ln., about half a mile distant, the building is now a significant part of the prospect. For these more distant neighborhoods the roof of a shorter building would have been kept below the tree line. Remember, this is a hospital, and so sections of all six floors will be lit twenty-four hours each day. These interior lights will, of course, be far more visible in winter. At its present constructed height the building is visible within a radius of about three quarters of a mile.In explanation for the height are two possibilities only. Number one, this height evaluation was never imagined, and so never considered. Number two, it was realized and understood, but no one on the design team, or in the federal government/VA system, or in Louisville Metro Government, specifically Jefferson County Planning and Zoning, cared.Also, was a dystopian guard tower, straight out ofFahrenheit 451,really necessary at the entrance? This oddly angular, three-story structure is what will greet visitors, that greeting being dominating and intimidating. This tower also looms, and is inescapable in the field of view of all passing nearby, or even somewhat nearby. Might a two-story building have sufficed, especially one faced with brick or faux-stone slabs? And again, was a shorter, more appealing building even considered? Did anyone in Metro government question the design of the tower that now exists?True, regarding height there are two existing towers about one mile northeast of the new hospital. One is eleven stories, the other twelve. However, these are residential towers, both of which were designed, to some degree, with regard to setting. In particular, the easternmost, newer tower is extensively and creatively landscaped, which helps the building blend with the overall setting. It is covered largely with brick veneer, which is a significant part of the blending. The tower to the west, built in the early 1970s, has a brutalist look, and so blends less successfully in appearance, although the setback does regard the setting to some degree.Both buildings have minimal exterior lighting, and interior lighting that diminishes increasingly as late nighttime hours progress into the early morning hours. Traffic flow is limited to residents, their guests, building employees, and service people. Hospitals, although not engaged in commerce as such, are de facto commercial facilities which, by the very nature of their purpose, are open twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. As mentioned, certain portions of the new VA hospital, on all floors, will be lit at all times, as will the parking garage decks.Highlighting just a few curiosities about the site, the hospital overlooks I-264 directly, and is in proximity to the constant noise and pollution coming from that road. Only one entrance/exit point exists, at a congested intersection of Brownsboro Road (KY 22 and an eastbound exit ramp off I-264. From about 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. every weekday this road, as well as U.S. 42 (which is also known as Brownsboro Road until the KY 22 intersection are highly congested.Why was this site chosen? I’m guessing the public will never know the ins-and-outs of just how the federal government came to decide on and then purchase this particular site. The proposed downtown site, near the existing medical complex, scored highest on accessibility and access to surrounding medical facilities. In 2013 the Kentucky Medical Association passed a resolution supporting the downtown site. In a report the VA’s own inspector general indicated the price paid for the site was $3,000,000 over actual value. In addition, of the five sites considered, this site carried the highest expenses in establishing infrastructure services.Perhaps someday this project will be included in urban design curricula under what not to do.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_71,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°This Supreme Court term promises to be important for the First Amendment. Major decisions are expected soon on the rights of social media platforms and their users. But the free-speech fun has already begun.In an otherwise unremarkable trademark case, a major debate about how to decide First Amendment issues broke out. On one side was Justice Clarence Thomas, joined fully by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, pushing the hard-line conservatives’ new “history and tradition” approach to interpreting laws.On the other was Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined fully by Justice Elena Kagan and partly by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, calling for a simple rule drawn from analogous free-speech precedent.There are a number of important takeaways, but the most relevant right now is that neither originalism nor the more malleable “history and tradition” can help solve new problems in free-speech law.The trademark case, Vidal v. Elster, was initiated by one Steve Elster, who tried to trademark the phrase “Trump too small.” The Patent and Trademark Office rejected the trademark because the Lanham Act says you can’t trademark the name of a living individual without his or her consent. In court, Elster argued that the living person rule should be held unconstitutional because applying it requires reading the trademark to ascertain if it contains the name of a living person. According to a formalistic rule first formulated by Thomas in a 2015 case, if a law requires you to look at the content of an utterance to apply the law, it presumptively violates free speech.Applying Thomas’s absolutist free-speech rule to the living persons law would produce the absurd result that the living persons rule should be struck down: The only way you can tell if a trademark includes the name of a living person is by reading what the trademark says.So Thomas broke out the conservatives’ favorite new constitutional toy, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted according to “history and tradition.”This approach has been used by the conservative court in the last couple of years to reverse Roe v. Wade, vastly expand gun rights, and overturn 50-plus years of existing doctrine on the separation of church and state.Thomas based his majority opinion on the idea that trademark law has been around for a long time and no one has ever seriously thought the living persons rule violated the First Amendment.On the surface this may sound like a reasonable approach.The problem is that, if you really take history and tradition back to 1791 and earlier in the free-speech context, you would have to trash nearly the entirety of free-speech doctrine, which was created by judges in the 20th and 21st centuries.The First Amendment as ratified and understood in 1791 didn’t receive any meaningful doctrinal development by the Supreme Court until 1919, when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes initiated modern free-speech doctrine. At the time, Holmes himself acknowledged that it wasn’t clear if the framers had intended the First Amendment to do anything more than prohibit pre-emptive censorship. In other words, when it comes to free speech, originalism is useless. History and tradition is little better.Barrett understands all this very clearly. She wrote a concurrence explaining that Thomas’s historical analysis was unconvincing and that history and tradition would be a bad way to decide free-speech cases. Instead, she proposed a simple, clear rule: There is nothing wrong with content-based trademark rules as long as they are reasonably related to the two purposes of trademark law, protecting the trademark owner and enabling consumers to tell products from each other.To be sure, Barrett’s opinion isn’t some foray into liberalism. It’s just a demonstration of doctrinal intelligence and honesty in the face of the mumbo-jumbo of history and tradition. Indeed, as is frequently the case for Barrett, the guiding spirit behind her position is that of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked. Barrett explained neatly that Thomas had failed to “adopt a generally applicable principle” in his opinion — the cardinal sin for Scalia, who believed that, as he once put it, the rule of law should be a law of rules.The upshot is that Barrett is registering skepticism about history and tradition in general — and offering a particularly appropriate and devastating riposte to its use in free-speech cases.Whatever the court decides about social media, it would do better to apply First Amendment doctrine in the light of the purposes of free expression, not based on vague history and tradition that long preceded social media’s invention.Noah Feldman is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

eugeneweekly_2024_10,"We ve got issues. The state of Louisiana would like us to believe that posting the Ten Commandments in school classrooms will cure the ills of society. Even though progressives like myself believe such would be an enormous violation of the separation of church and state to the detriment of both, we might pause to consider a few actual benefits that a fresh look at the ancient code could bring before we entirely dismiss it. For starters, if we do consider this ancient law to be “Ten Commandments” and not “Ten Suggestions,” shouldn’t we expect our leaders to pay them more than lip service? How is it that the party promoting the Big Ten in public schools is represented at the top by the person most accused of being a serial violator of its provisions? Would it also not be good to apply the prohibition on coveting a neighbor’s wife, manservant or maidservant (to use the language of the Louisiana law to elected officials? (To covet, you just have to think it, right? Kind of like the way presidents declassify secret documents. Webster defines “covet” as “to wrongly desire.” Boasting about grabbing body parts of women to a Hollywood reporter is about as wrongful as it gets. So when did breaking the Ten Commandments become no more than “locker room talk”? Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. And that leads us to the commandment against adultery. Shall we count the ways? In contrast to the commandment on bearing false witness, at least it might be possible when discussing a certain candidate to quantify the adulterous violations — perhaps. The governor of Louisiana thinks the Ten Commandments would provide a good lesson for the state’s students. So let’s start with math. On each Louisiana classroom wall will be a poster no less than 11” x 14” stating “The Ten Commandments.” Below 12 statements will be listed as stipulated by the state law. So maybe the first lesson for Louisiana teachers should be to explain how 12 equals 10. Therein lies the biggest lie of the Louisiana law. They want us to accept that these 12 statements are the one and the same Big Ten etched into stone and handed down by Moses. They are etched into stone all right, not in the Holy Land but in Texas (sorry, not the same thing , and not from Moses but from the Fraternal Order of Eagles (FOE . Here is the irony. The version that Louisiana law adopts comes not from any ancient text, but from a monument displayed near the Texas state house that was part of promotion of a Cecil B. de Mille movie organized by the FOE of which de Mille was one of its biggest members. This is a problem for any number of reasons beyond numerical, not the least of which is that it grossly cheapens the sacred tradition and leaves out some of its more important lessons. One example. The scriptural version of the Ten Commandments found in the book of Exodus tells us the reason for honoring our parents as this: “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the LORD your God is giving you.” Understanding that text, what it does and does not mean, gets us to the heart of the heart-breaking war occurring there today. That explanation, however, is missing from the FOE version put into Louisianan law. The lesson for us in this country, where we live on the lands of Native people, would be to examine how that belief of a God-given land morphed into the Doctrine of Discovery to give European explorers absolute rights over the lands of Native peoples as a divine directive. I’d like to be in that room where Louisiana students sit down with the elders of the Chitimacha Tribe, the last Native people of Louisiana to still live in a portion of their original homeland, to discuss what that commandment means to them. And perhaps even more appalling is that in justifying the need for this law condemning false witness, it falsely gives witness to James Madison, citing a quote that has been widely disproven to be his and which runs counter to his well-established support for the separation of church and state. To wit, in 1785 Madison published a strong opposition to a proposed Virginia law that would have provided public support for the teachers of “Christian religion.” In it, he wrote that rulers who violate the separation of powers necessary to protect the rights of the people “exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.” Indeed, it is to avoid tyranny that separation of church and state is essential. The Louisiana law is not.

minnpost_2024_75,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.“We are SPPS” is the slogan that Saint Paul Public Schools has used to describe the solidarity between its 34,000-plus students and its 5,000-plus educators and staff.For 20 years, I have called SPPS, particularly Harding High School, home. For 20 years, I have taught mathematics in the same classroom where I have welcomed thousands of diverse learners. During my two decades as a teacher and as a coach, I have devoted my life to serving the students of East St. Paul. Throughout my career, I have embodied my district’s mantra, believing that “We are SPPS.”Over the past six years or so, it seems that our once unifying rally has moved towards a quieter and disingenuous“we are spps.” It’s frustrating because we are employees of a district whose common goal includes developing our scholars to be the next global leaders. However, there really isn’t any solidarity or trust between the district and many of its employees. A large number of educators and staff in St. Paul do not feel valued by the leaders in our district, and this has been the case for some time.The feeling of not being valued as educators and staff is a glaring reality across many school districts in our state. Although there has been some progress with contract negotiations, about one-third of the districts across the state are working with an expired or unsettled contract. Nearly 50 districts — including St. Paul — are receiving mediation help from the state. This is the slowest settlement pace on record in the last 20 years.As a member of the Saint Paul Federation of Educators — SPFE — of the last three bargaining cycles, two have been settled one day prior to going on strike, and one resulted in a week-long strike just before the COVID pandemic. Through each negotiation cycle, the contentiousness between the district and union has intensified over the most reasonable of requests to support our students, educators and staff, leaving teachers and staff in our district to share a much different rallying slogan: “We are unappreciated.”In August, our SPPS district leaders negotiated and settled on a pretty lucrative contract. The highest paid employees received a 6% wage increase. This also includes generous health care contributions, a cell phone allowance and a car allowance for some.With a $1 billion district budget and unprecedented funding increases from the state, it is apparent that investing in the educators and staff who show up daily for our students is not a priority. Though an initial 1% offer has increased to a measly 2% wage increase, it is not enough to keep our valuable employees and not enough to bring in the staffing our students need, especially when the average wage increase for recently settled school districts has been a little over 5%. Additionally, with the increase in health care premiums projected at 9%, teachers and staff would essentially be taking a pay cut. Six percent versus 2% screams “We are undervalued.”The teaching profession has become increasingly tough over recent years. Teachers and staff alike are still helping students overcome reverberations from the pandemic, including learning loss and trauma. In certain areas, teachers are being vilified politically for what they teach. There is also a small contingent that believes that teaching is an easy gig, citing our work year. Our profession used to be much more highly regarded.Amid all of the noise, educators and staff work tirelessly to build community and student agency within our classrooms. We strive to welcome our students’ families to be a part of our school communities. We engage in continuous professional growth through many of the professional development opportunities provided by our district and union. As educators, we believe in our students; we believe in our colleagues; and we believe in our schools.For 20 years, I have shown up for my students and colleagues. For 20 years, I have shown up for Harding High School and Saint Paul Public Schools. It would be nice if Saint Paul Public Schools showed up for us. Until then, “We are SPFE.”That is why I am voting “yes” Feb. 15 to authorize a strike.Michael Houston was named 2023 Minnesota Teacher of the Year by Education Minnesota."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_296,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°A couple of decades ago, universities entered a new kind of competition.

Water parks, giant spa pools, aquatic basketball, etc. popped up at several large campuses. Predictably, there was also backlash from faculty and citizens, especially concerning these projects at public universities (see the NY Times opinion piece “No College Kid Needs a Water Park to Study” .

We are seeing increased interest in E-sports, for example, but the really interesting and challenging issue is what the role of AI (artificial intelligence will be on our campuses. With the expansion of AI, we are all scrambling to figure out how it is relevant, how it is dangerous, and how it can be of benefit. ChatGPT has been around for only two years, but it and its competitors are here to stay. We’ve all the read the horror stories about how sophisticated artificial intelligence makes it harder to determine what is real when it comes to political statements, celebrity endorsements, and all manner of things. Science fiction includes tales of AI overlords taking over control from their human inventors. Just think of HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey (“I’m sorry, Dave, I can’t do that.” . Regardless of whether they think that AI is cool or scary, however, students need to learn to use these tools in order to have the stable and successful future they look for in life and career.I am grateful for the UH Hilo faculty and staff that have taken on investigating and, in some cases, using AI. Some choose just to forbid its use in classes, which I certainly understand, given how hard it can be already to determine whether a student has written their own paper or had some kind of assistance. These faculty are trying to ensure that our students are actually learning what they need to. Others are figuring out how to use it as a tool, encouraging students to use AI for note-taking. Much like the calculator forever changed math classes 50 years ago, AI provides shortcuts that may be useful in freeing up students’ time to delve more deeply into what they are studying. UH Hilo is already using AI in the form of a chatbot that can answer questions from prospective students.

Like many kupuna, I have my good days and bad days.Last Monday, my kupuna wife and I went to Longs Pahoa to pick up prescriptions. On the way across the parking lot, I stopped to retie a shoelace. I lost my balance.When a body hits the asphalt, the asphalt always wins. No matter how hard my wife and I tried, I was helpless on the ground — scraped and bruised and bleeding.A few moments later, a man who had come from one direction and another man from the other direction were by my sides. I’m average in weight, but these two men lifted me as if I were a feather.Other people came from other directions to show their concern.A shopping cart was procured, and I was soon firmly back on my feet and using the cart for balance. The good Samaritans went back to what they were doing. My wife and I continued our errand.I realized I hadn’t got names of these wonderful Samaritans. But I am so grateful to those who stopped to assist an old man with their strength and compassion.Mahalo nui loa to all those who look out for us kupuna.Russell JobstHawaiian Paradise ParkDon’t leave kids,pets in the carPlease do not leave your animals or kids in your vehicles when you shop.I see this bizarre and criminal behavior too much on the Big Island.

For my justice-impacted community, the toll of tobacco addiction is particularly devastating. Despite decades of valiant efforts to combat this scourge, smoking remains a leading cause of preventable death globally, with a disproportionate impact on marginalized populations like ours.In the United States, where the stark reality of tobacco’s deadly consequences is well-documented, it’s imperative that we adopt innovative solutions to reverse this trend. One such solution is nicotine e-cigarettes, a polarizing yet potentially game-changing tool in harm reduction and smoking cessation. By embracing this technology, we can harness its potential to transform the lives of millions of smokers, particularly in our justice-impacted community.The evidence is clear: e-cigarettes can help smokers quit or significantly reduce their tobacco use, thereby reducing the staggering burden of tobacco-related diseases. Healthcare providers and advocates must reassess their stance on e-cigarettes, acknowledging their role as a harm reduction strategy. E-cigarettes deliver nicotine without the harmful tar and combustion products of traditional cigarettes, offering a less harmful alternative for those unable to quit nicotine entirely. However, entrenched misconceptions among physicians and health professionals often lead to inconsistent patient counseling that contradicts existing evidence.It’s time to shatter the myth that nicotine, without tobacco combustion, poses significant health risks. This pervasive misconception disproportionately affects justice-impacted communities of color, low-income households, and those with lower education levels. By perpetuating this falsehood, we’re hindering the transition from combustible tobacco to e-cigarettes and exacerbating existing health disparities.The data is clear: misinformation about e-cigarettes versus traditional tobacco products is scaring smokers away from making the switch. Many mistakenly equate nicotine with tobacco smoke, fearing a similar risk profile. This is particularly devastating in justice-impacted communities already ravaged by tobacco-related health inequities.It’s imperative that healthcare providers acknowledge the progress made in harm reduction strategies and incorporate e-cigarettes into smoking cessation toolkits. We can’t afford to stick to an all-or-nothing approach that disregards potential benefits. Instead, U.S. public health agencies and medical societies must reassess their cautious stance on e-cigarettes. The staggering toll of tobacco-related diseases demands a nuanced approach that harnesses harm reduction strategies to reach all populations effectively.By embracing evidence-based solutions and debunking harmful myths, we can empower justice-impacted communities to break free from the grip of tobacco addiction and reclaim their health. It’s time for a pragmatic approach that prioritizes progress over dogma, ensuring equal access to life-saving alternatives for all.To address disparities in smoking cessation outcomes, targeted education and awareness campaigns are essential. Healthcare providers must receive comprehensive training on the relative risks of e-cigarettes versus traditional tobacco products, enabling them to provide evidence-based guidance. Culturally sensitive outreach efforts are equally crucial to dispel myths and empower at-risk communities to make informed choices about their health.The integration of nicotine e-cigarettes into smoking cessation strategies represents a pivotal step toward reducing the burden of tobacco-related diseases. By challenging misconceptions and expanding access to harm reduction tools, healthcare providers and advocates can empower individuals to take control of their health. U.S. public health agencies and medical societies must evolve their policies to reflect current evidence, ensuring that all smokers have access to the tools needed to achieve a smoke-free future.Maurice “Moe” Ward is founder and executive director for JIIVE, which worked to restore the voting rights of formerly incarcerated individuals in Minnesota."
philinquirer_2024_35,"People picture Philly kids riding out the heat by squealing with delight in front of hoses and open fire hydrants. That doesn t happen in Kensington.The summer is one of the worst times to live in Kensington. At least in my parents’ opinion. This isthe time when crime goes up, and the neighborhood becomes the most dangerous.So while many people picture Philly kids riding out the heat bysquealing with delight in front of hoses and open fire hydrants, most of the time during the summer, my siblings and I weren’t allowed to go outside.When we were allowed out, our parents had strict rules: Stay right in front of the house, don’t talk to strangers; if someone tries to talk to you, come back inside; if you fall, make sure you don’t land on a needle.However, as a kid, I noticed that when we left Kensington, the rules often changed. For example, when we would visit my grandmother in Queens, we were allowed to ride our scooters outside, as long as we stayed on her block. It felt amazing — the fresh air, the exercise, meeting other kids who lived nearby. Most of the time in Kensington, our scooters stayed locked up inside with us.Obeying these rules seemed unfair to me as a child, especially when I saw other kids in Kensington being able to go outside and play. Now, at 15, I understand my parents and why they set up the rules that they did. They didn’t want us to get hurt.When I was younger, I would have liked to just play rather thanworry about stepping on needles. I would’ve liked to use chalk on the sidewalk and make friends in the neighborhood. I’m sure my 7-year-old brother and 11-year-old sister would have liked the same.I would’ve liked to use chalk on the sidewalk and make friends in the neighborhood.We also would have liked to be able to ride our bikes outside our house. Don’t get me wrong — we do ride them, and quite often. We just don’t do so in our area. Sometimes we go to a park that’s about a five-minute drive away. My parents like us to experience different things, so sometimes we go all the way to New Jersey, just for ice cream.Having siblings made staying inside during the long summer months a bit easier. Unlike outside, when we’re inside, there aren’t many rules (except no horseplay . We would watch movies, play Roblox together, and sometimes bake recipes we found on TikTok. But when you can only hang out with one or two people, you get tired of one another.Now that I am older, my parents have trusted me to go outside a bit more often. When I first started to go outside when I was 13, I held my key between my knuckles like a weapon, in case someone followed me. Even though I’ve now figured out the safest route to get home, when I see someone acting creepy, I still hold my key between my knuckles. But the freedom is worth it; it’s nice to be able to go out into Center City and to different corner stores as I please.» READ MORE:A shooting sent my school into lockdown. Minutes later, I walked home through broken glass and the memory of bullets.Getting older has given my younger siblings more freedom, too. After a year of going outside by myself, my parents said they believed I was capable of keeping them safe, so they can now go outside even if my parents aren’t with them, as long as I am with them, to monitor. But even then, they can only go up and down the block, like we do in New York.In recent weeks, the city has tried to crack down on Kensington,clearing encampmentsandtripling the police force. But I don’t feel like the neighborhood is any safer. I still see drug dealers selling on the corners of my block, and see (and smell trash in piles on the street. When my family puts our trash out for garbage collection, there are still people digging through it in front of our house.If there was less trash in Kensington, I think my family and I, and many others, would feel safer letting our kids go outside. I realize trash isn’t the first thing most people think about when they talk about safe streets, but it’s impossible to feel optimistic about my community, that good things happen here, when we’re surrounded by garbage. You can arrest people all you want, offer as many summer programs as you want, but if families see piles of stinky trash on the sidewalks, they’re not going to feel safe.So I’m glad to hear thatour mayor is committed to cleaning up the city. I know improvements take time. But to be honest, I am tired of waiting.Brooke Fulton is a rising junior atParkway Center City Middle Collegeand a student inMighty Writers.

I was four days overdue with our fourth child, and the contractions were only a few minutes apart.Now on a good day with no traffic, you can make it to Hilo from Hawaiian Paradise Park in roughly 30 minutes. If you hit those pockets of traffic just making it to Keaau takes twice as long. At around six o’clock on a Friday night, I knew that I needed to hold it together until we made it to the hospital.While I can’t tell you if there was any Hilo-bound traffic on Panaewa stretch, I closed my eyes on the Keaau bypass from the pain.I can tell you that we did not make it to the hospital before my baby was born. My son was born in the car on Palai. We were transported to the Hilo Medical Center in an ambulance and were thankfully OK.But I could have avoided giving birth in the car if I didn’t have to travel so far to the hospital. What the district of Puna needs is a hospital. Not just for the expecting moms, but for our kupuna who have to travel so far to get treatment.In 2020, the population of Puna district was 51,704. By 2030, Puna’s population is expected to reach 75,000 residents. That means more babies, more kupuna seeking care. So, let’s reach out to our government officials and ask for their kokua to make a hospital in Puna a reality.Precious WinchesterKeaauThoughts aboutbus service in PahoaFor those without their own vehicle, Pahoa is no longer the place for you.There was a big push to get more people to ride public transit several years ago, but the county doesn’t seem that concerned anymore.Whenever my little truck is in the shop — and the shop has gotten to know my truck very well — I ride the bus. It used to be one could go shopping in town at the health food store, but that stop no longer exists, as someone complained.When bus riders have a problem, “suck it up, buttercup,” but when a business complains about bus riders, action must be taken to punish the bus ridership.The only stops in Pahoa are at Puna Kai/Woodland Center at one end, and the elementary school/church.For every complaint, there should be a suggestion. Can the bus get into the county recreation parking lot? If so, why can’t a county facility be utilized for another county function? Who would complain there?A courtesy light at Kauhale would be advisable to handle all of the new traffic for a left-hand turn.Dave KisorPahoaA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.The National Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the Island of Hawaii.Not a single hat hit the ice to celebrate Jason Robertson’s first career playoff hat trick that paced the Dallas Stars to a 5-3 road win over the Edmonton Oilers on Monday night in Game 3 of the Western Conference final."
suffolknewsherald_2024_77,"Published 6:07 pm Tuesday, February 13, 2024ByStaff ReportsHappy Valentine’s Day. Happy Ash Wednesday, too. What a coincidence that Feb. 14, Valentine’s Day, is also Ash Wednesday, which ushers in the season of Lent for Catholics and other Christian denominations worldwide.It’s interesting to note and know that there are two purported Valentines on the list of Roman Martyrology for February 14. They both became saints for being martyred because of their faith and healing miracles. One is St. Valentine, a Roman priest and martyr, around AD 270, during emperor Claudius Gothicus Caesar’s rule. He died by decapitation at Via Flaminia in Rome for refusing to follow the emperor’s wishes for conversion to worshipping other gods. Seventy years later, another Valentine, a bishop of Terni (a city of Umbria in Italy, outside of Rome , was imprisoned and martyred (dragged and beheaded and later on became a saint for his strong faith in God.(During the Middle Ages, the Benedictine Order maintained the church of St. Valentine in Terni. Eventually, the Benedictines spread the cult of Valentine’s Day in their monasteries in France and England.According to Vatican News, the tradition of Saint Valentine being the patron saint of lovers finds its origin in an English text by English poet, author (The Canterbury Tales , and civil servant Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1340-1400 .The annual feast of St. Valentine’s Day by the Catholic Church became known traditionally and commercially now as Valentine’s Day, in honor of Saint Valentine, the so-called patron saint of lovers, engaged couples and happy marriages.We believe love exists when two people (decide to get married in church or court. There’s love when two people (decide to get into a legal and binding relationship. Likewise, Love exists when one commits themselves to love, serve, and live for God in various capacities.When and where there is love in partnerships and relationships, there’s also commitment, There’s also trust and sacrifice, cooperation and compromise, negotiation and mediation. There is hope. There is charity and fraternity, civility and harmony, solidarity and unity. There is peace and order.God is Love. And Love is God. He loves us for what and who we are—sinners capable of becoming saints—irrespective of our designation and status in life.God’s love for us is indicated in John 3:16 of the Holy Bible: “For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”Because He loves us, Jesus suffered and died on the cross to atone for our sins, only to rise from the dead (his resurrection on the third day.Lent is a 40-day liturgical and penitential preparation for Christians to celebrate the Lord’s Resurrection at Easter.

The item, a rope used to hang Wicanhpi Wastedapi (Good Little Stars, or Chaske in Mankato on Dec. 26, 1862, has been in MNHS’s collections since the 19th century. Today, various Dakota communities are asking for repatriation to complete a sacred healing ceremony. Despite MNHS’s deliberations, Dakota people believe the rope should be turned over immediately under the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act.The MNHS holds a variety of objects, artifacts and sources from the era of the U.S.-Dakota War. In addition to discussing the rights and access to physical materials, these conversations should include the digital materials on the MNHS website.We live in a digital age, where people expect public access to things at the snap of their fingers. Archives worldwide have embraced digitization to scan, reproduce and copy sources from the past and make them readily available online. Digitized items also require a set of information, called metadata, that details necessary details on where to find specific information about a source. This method has helped countless researchers who may not be able to travel far distances for historical research. However, despite the ability to transform analog sources into the digital realm, we should still consider the implications of using such materials — especially items that hold value as “cultural heritage” that connect the past with the present.As researchers, we have a responsibility to adapt our own filters to consider whether we should be engaging with historical and cultural heritage objects, something very close to the present debates about archives like the MNHS holding sacred Dakota items for preservation.I use the MNHS’s newly developed website as one example that sheds light on this situation.The MNHS offers researchers access to a large body of primary sources created in the past that curate information about the U.S.-Dakota War, among other topics. Within this collection stands a large body of images captured by photographers during the 19th century. Many of these photographs depict Dakota incarceration, confinement and voyeurism.White photographers, like Joel Emmons Whitney, rushed to Fort Snelling in 1863 (and later in 1864-65 to capture images of the Dakota people incarcerated there. They then profited off selling these images printed on cheap cardstock calledcartes-des-visits, which were popular during the Civil War era. To the average researcher, these photographs detail a visual record of a period when white Minnesotans sought vengeance on any Dakota person after 1862. However, the continued digitization of these images represents the cyclical nature of colonialism in Minnesota.These images are curated for research and to support MNHS’s endeavors. Users can access these photos as low-quality thumbnails, but they would need to purchase a copy of the file if they wanted to use the image even in non-commercial works. With this purchasing option, the MNHS perhaps unknowingly profits from selling reproduction copies of imagery depicting Dakota incarceration. These images were taken under duress and confinement. White photographers profited from white audiences who collected these photos like baseball cards. Digitization, thus, has created another method for non-Native groups’ voyeurism over the Dakota past, a past predicated in violence, dispossession and exile.In her blog post “Digitization: Just because you can, does not mean you should,” diversity consultant Tara Robertson sheds light on the ethical concerns surrounding digitization and emphasizes that not all materials may need to be digitized. As we increasingly live in an age of instant search results curated to our needs, we must have new conversations about the ethics involved with our engagement in digital cultural heritage recast as “historical” collections.We cannot rely on colonial institutions to “do the right thing.” We must understand the filter needed by institutions and the public when engaging with such cultural heritage to understand what’s right and wrong. With this filter, understanding of the past through physical objects and digitized scans can help us move toward a more unified conversation about Indigenous representation and sovereignty over items.John R. Legg received his Ph.D. from George Mason University and is currently writing a book about Dakota migration after the U.S.-Dakota War. He will be teaching at Minnesota State, Mankato, this fall."

Here, we enjoy substantial investments in healthcare research, robust hospital networks and a thriving medical device industry.These investments have yielded life-saving breakthroughs, pioneering research endeavors aimed at curing diseases, and opportunities to explore alternative medical treatments. While we have undoubtedly reaped the rewards of these investments, it’s essential to acknowledge and address the often overlooked or misunderstood realities pertaining to healthcare costs.Last year, state lawmakers across the country and here in Minnesota have been implementing various versions of a Prescription Drug Affordability Board. The idea is that the appointed members of the PDAB would oversee prescription drug pricing within the state and work to negotiate costs with manufacturers. Since this law was enacted in Minnesota, many patients have expressed valid concerns about the future accessibility of their medications.While I commend lawmakers for their efforts to lower prescription drug costs, there are blind spots within this law and the board’s established duties. The board must consider the current affordability and accessibility of medications for patients while simultaneously providing an expedited path for exemptions. This is necessary to prevent supply limitations, particularly for specialized medicine. We have recently witnessed the impact of supply shortages and inflationary effects in various sectors of the economy, including prescription drugs. Above all, we must prioritize preserving access to life-saving medications.Furthermore, with states operating under different PDAB authorities or without an established board, negotiated prices will vary from state to state and could further affect the regional supply of medications. This could have potentially fatal consequences for individuals with rare diseases who rely on specialty medications that already have limited production. Without exemptions, we may see people losing access to the medications they depend on to live.There are many cases where specialized medications are affordable when considering insurance, assistance programs and vouchers, with minimal barriers to accessibility for those in need of treatment. Patients cannot risk losing access to their medications while waiting for negotiated pricing or experiencing supply shortages due to price disparities between states. Exemptions are essential when considering these potential circumstances.Bridget Klosterman is an advocate and professional for nonprofit organizations that offer services related to child development, healthy lifestyle and well being."

The electorate, however, is at least interesting.Until recently, presidential politics was significantly shaped by regional differences that were Civil War residues. In 1968, the Republicans’ “Southern strategy” (following 25 years of steady gains in the South facilitated victory in four of the next five, and five of the next seven, presidential elections. But in 2008, Barack Obama received a larger percentage of the nation’s White vote than Democratic nominees Michael S. Dukakis, Al Gore and John F. Kerry won in 1988, 2000 and 2004, respectively. In 2020, Donald Trump won at least 56 percent in 18 states but not in Florida (51.2 , Texas (52.1 or South Carolina (55.1 .Today, the nation has newer class-based and culture-fueled divisions, but is not happier for having somewhat transcended regionalism: There are battleground states (Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada in the North, South, East and West.When George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, Ohio was the only large state he carried outside the South. (His next most populous non-Southern victory was in Indiana. Regional differences have not lost their salience, but Obama won Florida and Virginia twice, North Carolina once, and in 2012 received 44 percent of both Mississippi’s and South Carolina’s votes.In 2016, Hillary Clinton became a harbinger – and casualty – of today’s ongoing class-based realignment. If her White working-class turnout and percentages of support had matched those of Obama in 2012, she would have won Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Florida and the presidency. She would have won Wisconsin and Michigan if she had matched Obama’s 2012 turnout in Milwaukee and Detroit.Because so many Democratic voters are in California (13.7 percent of the party’s national popular vote total in 2020 and a few other noncompetitive states (e.g., Illinois, New York , the party probably must win the national popular vote by more than 3 percentage points to win 270 electoral votes. Oddities abound. Gerald Ford came closer to defeating Jimmy Carter in the 1976 popular vote than Mitt Romney came to defeating Obama in 2012. Clinton, losing to Trump in 2016, won the popular vote by a larger margin (2.1 points than John F. Kennedy did defeating Richard M. Nixon in 1960.In 56 of the 70 years prior to tumultuous 1968 (marked by assassinations, urban riots and a polarizing ground war of attrition on the Asian mainland with a conscript army , the federal government was united: One party or the other held the presidency and both houses of Congress. In the subsequent 56 years, there has been unified government for only 17 years.In the 62 years from 1932 to 1994, there were Democratic House majorities for all but four years (and Senate majorities for 10 years . After Democrats controlled the House of Representatives for 40 years (1954-1994 , control changed three times in 24 years. Now, for the first time, control has changed under five consecutive presidents (under Bill Clinton in 1994, Bush in 2006, Obama in 2010, Trump in 2018, Joe Biden in 2022 . Before ticket-splitting became unusual, Nixon trounced George McGovern in 1972 by 23.2 points, and Ronald Reagan defeated Walter Mondale in 1984 by 18.2 points, yet in both cases Democrats retained control of the House.It is asserted that independents will decide the 2024 election. Romney might be skeptical. In 2012, he won independents by 5 points but lost the popular vote by 4 points. Stasis is, however, notable: 36 states and the District of Columbia have voted for the same party in this century’s six presidential elections.If Biden loses, he will be the fifth incumbent defeated in the past 100 years (Herbert Hoover, Ford, Carter, George H.W. Bush . If Biden wins, he might be the first incumbent since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 to win reelection while losing control of both houses of Congress.

minnpost_2024_125,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.When you have as much rain in a short period of time as southern Minnesota has had in recent days, flooding is almost inevitable.Austin dealt with the most impactful flooding it’s seen since 2004 when the Cedar River in Austin reached 25 feet and Turtle Creek reached 14.8 feet. Levels came close to that this time around at 20.70 feet and 12.64, respectively.The difference, however, was flood mitigation. After 2004’s flood, the city and Mower County agencies took aggressive action over successive years in order to stem any further events in the future. Property buy-outs and the construction of berms and flood walls played a role in stemming the damage and effects of this latest event, and it was clear enough that flood mitigation efforts on both the city and county levels played a big part.City and county officials voiced confidence in how well the mitigation efforts worked and spoke to how things might have looked different if those measures were not in place.We can’t take lightly that there were still people directly affected by this weekend’s rising water. Austin businesses like Stuttgart’s Travel & Tan, the Hardy Geranium and more will be looking at lengthy clean-ups in the near future, which will have an expanded impact.Several homes found water in basements and those people will have plenty of clean-up ahead of them, but considering where we are now and where we’ve been before, those of us living in this community long term can see the differences and benefits flood mitigation has meant for the area.Austin and many of our surrounding communities will always have to cope with the idea of flooding. And there’s not much you can do when you get so much rain, but the fact that the city has taken measures to limit the effects these natural disasters have means that we now have an area that is much more adept at coping with whatever Mother Nature has in store for us."

philinquirer_2024_62,"Republican lawmakers are up to their “tricks of the trade” again, finding ways to maintain the racial school funding status quo.Recently, the 2023 Basic Education Funding Commission published its report and made recommendations for changing Pennsylvania’s school finance system. As someone who follows issues of Pennsylvania school funding, the obstructionist and delay tactics of Republican lawmakers are giving me an ominous sense of déjà vu.As a professor at Swarthmore College, I often tell my students that we study the history of education policies and the actions of policymakers so we’re not doomed to repeat the same inequitable decisions of the past. Understanding this history helps us respond in the current moment.Racial disparities in Pennsylvania school funding first came to light during the2014 Basic Education Funding Commission hearings. David Mosenkis, a data scientist and member ofPOWER Interfaith, a racial justice organizing group, testified to his finding that whiter school districts received more state funding than majority-minority districts, when controlling for poverty and other factors. The finding that Pennsylvania distributes school funding in ways that privilege whiter school districts has been confirmed byother studies.After Mosenkis’ testimony, Republican State Sen. Pat Browne, cochair of the first Basic Education Funding Commission in 2014, responded the way a politician in a public setting would be expected to: surprise and a promise to do better. Browne stated that he didn’t want funding formulas “to have any unintended consequences, because at a minimum level, it sends a bad public policy message.” He added that “there’s no reason in regards to what we do in the future that should continue to allow that.”And yet, shortly after the first commission issued its report, Pennsylvania’s Republican-led General Assembly enacted a law that preserved racial inequities in school funding. Although the2016 law, based on the commission’s recommendations, adopted a “fair” funding formula, the fine print dictated that the formula would only be applied to new money (i.e., increases to the state education budget . In 2017–2018, this meant that only 8% of the total education budget wasdistributed “fairly”— that is, in a racially equitable manner.Tactics to evade the implementation of racially equitable school funding policies are part of Harrisburg culture and are common enough outside of Pennsylvania that education scholars refer to these as the “tricks of the trade” of state legislators.Another “trick of the trade” included the use of not-nearly-enough “earmarked funding” to specific underfunded districts. The practice, according to state legislators, has been around for decades but onlydrew scrutiny in 2013. Earmarked funding was a poorly constructed stopgap effort that diverted attention away from the systemic problem of educational underfunding. It pacified constituents by giving the appearance that legislators were fighting for school funding when, in reality, it was a sloppily adhered Band-Aid. Browne was able to secure multiple years of earmarked funding for his underfunded school district in Allentown. So much state legislative activity produced so little change.To be sure, therecent Basic Education Funding Commission reporthas more to recommend than its previous counterpart. For one, it acknowledges that there is a significant gap between what Pennsylvania currently provides and what is needed for an adequate education. And it attached a figure — $5.4 billion — to plug the adequacy gap, though this is still less than the$6.2 billioncalculated by Matthew Kelly, a Pennsylvania State University professor.But today’s Republican lawmakers are up to their “tricks of the trade” again, finding ways to maintain the racial school funding status quo, despite the Commonwealth Court’s 2023 ruling that Pennsylvania’s school funding system isunconstitutional and in need of reform.In a move to delay and undermine racial equity in Pennsylvania school funding, Republican commission members voted against the final report, issuing their ownbootleg version. The Republican report rehashes the same tired narrative of the “potential consequences of a formula that does not allocate to each district at least the same level of proportion of state basic education funding as the district received in the prior school year.”In other words, Republican commission members are calling to preserve the policy of “hold harmless” that maintains the school funding privileges of predominantly white districts.Racial inequity in school funding is not, primarily, a problem rooted in poor policymaking; it is a problem rooted in the differential valuing of children’s lives.Those who reject the premise that certain children are worthy of greater educational investment because of the color of their skin should also reject the delay tactics of Republican lawmakers. We should communicate our urgency to Gov. Josh Shapiro and our state legislators as they decide whether to continue to delay justice or to act now to transform Pennsylvania’s racially inequitable school funding system.Roseann Liu is the author of “Designed to Fail: Why Racial Equity in School Funding Is So Hard to Achieve.” She is a visiting assistant professor of Asian American studies and educational studies at Swarthmore College and an assistant professor of education studies at Wesleyan University."
eugeneweekly_2024_6,"We ve got issues. I come home from a walk and there is a man with his bike loaded with all his possessions, sleeping on the sidewalk. Earlier after my yoga class, having forgotten to check my cell phone messages, I discovered a person I know has suddenly died. Scanning the headlines on theNew York Timesdigital page doesn’t lift my spirit. If we don’t wake up, we Americans might lose our democracy! How do we keep our heads above water? In November 2023,during the ongoing Russia/Ukraine War, the Israel/Gaza War and after another mass shooting in Maine, I wrote a Local and Vocal columnabout finding hope amidst all this turmoil. Now what? How about finding inspiration from the aging, our dear elder citizens. I am in my 70s, but I know several women in their 80s who are meeting their age challenges. A neighbor around the corner has discovered she has Crohn’s disease. She doesn’t go on long walks any more. Her small studio home has become her center. A commercial artist in her youth, she now sets up her painting space and paints almost daily. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. What really surprised me, though, is the garden she has created around her apartment building. In front is a strawberry patch, by the side she has made a trellis out of branches for her beans and, in the back, she helps her daughter with her small garden. I visit this neighbor often because she inspires me. She is doing what she can with the life she has been given. Another nearly 90-year-old friend can’t drive anymore, and her body is bent over a walker whenever she goes anywhere. She just finished rereadingLes Misérablesand shows me her brain is not handicapped. Though it is difficult for her, she still bakes brilliant cakes as she used to own a bakery. And she tackles airports and makes it on and off airplanes when she travels. Perhaps one of the most inspiring elders I have met is a neighbor who has been homeless and now lives in a ShelterCare Conestoga hut. Even though her body can be riddled with arthritic pain, she bikes, helps out bi-monthly with free food distribution through the Unitarian Church and, with others, started her own nonprofit for creating and distributing health kits to the homeless. This election season my elder friends are once again writing hundreds of postcards to encourage people tovotein this most pivotal election.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_185,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.332°There will be a vote to remove Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson this week and it will fail thanks to Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. It’s not that Jeffries doesn’t want to become speaker himself, but that will be decided by the American people six months from today, on Election Day, when all 435 seats are being contested.Control of the gavel should not be decided by wacko Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is pushing to topple Johnson because he actually did the correct and responsible thing. What the speaker did right was bringing to the floor an aid package for besieged Ukraine against the wishes of the isolationist wing of his own Republican conference.Shamefully, the majority of his party colleagues voted no. The $60.8 billion for Ukraine passed two weeks ago relying on Democratic votes. Among Republicans, 53% of them voted no, while 100% of the Democrats voted yes. Putin hasn’t conquered Kyiv, but he has captured the House Republicans.Greene, who is more MAGA-crazed than Donald Trump himself and sees hero Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the villain, wants Johnson out because of that.On March 22, incensed as Johnson edged closer to allowing the Ukraine bill to come to the floor after the Democrats began collecting signatures for a discharge petition to force the Ukraine measure to the floor (as we had urged , she filed her own short motion, H.Res.1103, saying “Resolved, That the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant.” It is the same 17 words that were used to topple the previous Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy.Winding back to last fall, McCarthy’s downfall started when he reasonably cut a deal with President Biden and Senate Democrats to keep the government funded on Sept. 30. It passed the House with 58% of the GOP on the bill, but still had to have Democratic votes to get the necessary two-thirds. So even though he had the backing of most of his conference, needing the Democrats was an anathema to the hardest core radicals.McCarthy foe Matt Gaetz, who insisted when McCarthy first squeaked into power on the 15th vote that a single member be allowed to make a motion to vacate the chair, pushed the button on Oct. 3.McCarthy’s allies tried to table the matter, but 11 in his own party sided with the Democrats to let it advance. Then on the motion to vacate, Gaetz was joined by seven others. It only needed six defectors, so eight was plenty and McCarthy was ousted.Greene supported McCarthy throughout, so she wasn’t in on the fun. But this it’s all her doing. Johnson correctly ignored Greene’s threats and moved ahead on Ukraine. She added isolationist Thomas Massie on April 16 and kook Paul Gosar on April 19. But Johnson stood firm and the House voted the next day, April 20, to aid Ukraine. It was Hitler’s birthday, an earlier invader of Ukraine.There are 217 Republicans and 212 Democrats (soon to be 213 when Tim Kennedy from Buffalo is seated . Having Greene and her two allies would be enough to overthrow Johnson if all the Democrats joined. But that won’t happen. Tom Suozzi was the first to say no and now so has Jeffries and his leadership team. They are not supporting Johnson, but opposing Greene.

philinquirer_2024_74,"Never before in our nation’s history have South Asian American women played such prominent roles in presidential politics. To me, that s powerful.By any measure, it’s been an extraordinary summer in presidential politics. Between theshooting of Donald Trump,Joe Biden’s exitfrom the campaign,Kamala Harris’ rise, and the selections ofJD VanceandTim Walzas their parties’ vice presidential nominees, it has been an unforgettable few months.Yet for me, a marker of this period, will remain an observation that grew to a full realization through the crescendo of a reverberating drumbeat in my mind: Indian American women have arrived.Never before in our nation’s history have two South Asian American women played such a prominent role in presidential politics — one, Harris, as the Democrat’s pick for commander in chief, and the other, Usha Vance, as the wife of Trump’s Republican running mate and a crucial partner in her husband’s rapid rise.As a South Asian American of Indian descent and a daughter of immigrants, seeing women who share my background playing such pivotal roles in the presidential election is powerful. Whereas others have focused on fraught discussions of“DEI hires”and when someone started“becoming Black,”I see first-generation Americans taking the opportunities their parents struggled to give them and advancing to the national stage in the span of a few decades through determination, excellence, and accomplishment.As daughters of immigrants, Kamala Harris and Usha Vance were handed the batons their families carried as they came to the United States and bravely stepped into the unknown. And, in their own ways, both of those women took their batons, ran — and then flew. They embody the spirit of the American dream.In actuality, South Asian Americans have been a part of this entire presidential campaign period as both Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, earlier Republican candidates, are also first generation Americans of Indian descent.The three of them (Harris, Vance, and Ramaswamy have South Indian origins, a nuance that is notable perhaps only to other Indians, as the more commonly known foods, clothes, traits, and celebrations in the U.S. are often from North Indian culture.In fact, I was surprised to learn that Ramaswamy was from Kerala, the same Indian state as my family, and immediately texted my father to ask if he knew this. His comically curt response, “No. He brings no honor to the diaspora,” perfectly illustrates our shared belief that no matter how one looks or where one comes from, it’s the actions, values, integrity and track record that we scrutinize, especially in those for whom we might cast a vote.Like mine, the stories of Kamala Harris, Usha Vance, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy are neither rags to riches nor completely self-made.Each comes from middle-class families in India, the largest democracy in the world; each are the product of highly educated parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents, whose careers included new discoveries and creating new knowledge as researchers and scholars, caring for and healing countless patients and families as physicians, and educating and empowering generations of children and young adults as teachers and educators, among others.Their trajectories began from the privilege brought by education, knowledge, awareness, and belief in unending possibilities — that which beckons with the notion that nothing is impossible if you work for it, but nothing is entitled.A look across many major industries shows people of South Asian descent in key leadership positions in the U.S. and around the world.A review done in 2024 showed thelargest cohort of nonwhite CEOs in the U.S. were Asian/Indian. In the last decade or so, leaders of Indian descent broke into lists such as CEOs of Fortune 500, Forbes richest people in the world, New York Times bestsellers, and theGroup of Seven (G7 in greater numbers than ever before.A review done in 2024 showed the largest cohort of non-white CEOs in the U.S. were Asian/Indian.Whether business, engineering, journalism and media, computer science, law, medicine, education, entrepreneurship, literature, film, and a variety of STEM fields, people of South Asian descent have made their indelible mark, their presence known and their voices heard. A visible cohort has been promoted through broad recognition of their expertise and leadership acumen, setting the precedent to normalize South Asians in those echelons — although women still lag.A look closer to home, in the academic medical arenas of Philadelphia, doesn’t paint the same picture. Consistent with my own experiences as a physician, others have written before about thelack of diversity among the high tiers of Philadelphia’s medical colleges and hospitals.South Asians, or people of South Asian descent, are not a minority in the world of medicine; in fact,Indian ethnicity makes up the largest subgroupof Asian applicants to medical school, which is in itself the second most represented race/ethnicity group, behind white people, of all medical school applicants andactive physicians in the U.S.Yet studies have shown that despite making up a significant proportion of academic physicians and faculty, Asianswere far less likely to be promoted to leadership positions, less likely to receiveequitable grant funding, including the prestigiousNational Institute of Health R01 grants, or be recognized by national academies and medical speciality associations.It has been postulated that the characteristics that lend to the “model minority” trope — hardworking, quiet, assimilating, goal-oriented — are the same reason they are overlooked for leadership roles or have“the everyday experience of exclusion and invisibility.”The attributes that lend to the “model minority” trope — hardworking, quiet, assimilating, goal-oriented — may be the same reason some Indian Americans are overlooked for leadership roles.In Philadelphia, chairs across academic medicine are a largely homogenous group in place for decades. The birthplace of American medicine has not reflected the changing demographics of its brethren in its leaders, and instead train their gaze to physicians who are “more academic” or who are perceived as having “gravitas” — code words commonly used that effectively exclude applicants who are not white.The existing medical power structures are apparently comfortable with the anchored perspective of Eurocentric patriarchal leadership they perpetuate rather than widening their views to the qualities, skill sets, and competencies that would propel toward future and sustained success. Ironically, for me and many Asian American women like me, we seem to have been penalized for not complying with the “quiet and meek” Asian stereotype, instead beingwilling to use our voiceswhen we get to the table.Ileft that worldbecause I felt its limitations for my missions and goals — reflected in the words of Amanda Gorman: “And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us.” I chose to look and explore beyond and saw representation reflected in the problem solvers of our time — the ones who dare step into the arena, ask probing questions, poke the status quo, willing to speak truth to power, and work for benefit beyond their own.More and more, when I look up, I see others of South Asian descent — particularly Indian American women — who advocate for themselves and others, who lean in with curiosity to listen and learn, who use their knowledge and expertise to influence, build partnerships, develop collaborations and bring others along, and who have the courage to always push for better, in themselves and the systems around them.Kamala Harris, Usha Vance, and Nikki Haley and have made it possible for me, and generations of South Asian American women and girls,including my incredible nieces, coming behind me, to realize and boldly declare: I look like a leader.Priya E.

suffolknewsherald_2024_36,"Published 4:40 pm Tuesday, May 28, 2024ByStaff ReportsBy Charles QuallsThe birds in the air, the temperatures, and the plants and trees on the ground all herald the turn of a corner we call Spring as it now moves over into Summer. Pick a sign, and you can tell where we are on the calendar.Oh, and speaking of signs, the silly political season is upon us, too. Yards and roadsides are replete with candidate signs as the Fall elections grow near. They litter the landscape as the latest crop of ambitious leaders jockey for our attention.Today, I am writing an open letter to all running for office. This will be candid and quite direct. I’m sure those wiser than me would counsel me to save my breath. Yet, here I go in my optimism that one politician will heed something I say.On its surface, this might look like a precarious task. You see, by nature of my job, I have been instructed to remain politically neutral. No matter the level of politics, as a pastor I am supposed to stay out of it all. The very search committee that represented the church and brought me here from Atlanta told me as much.Still, I think there are some things that are fair to ask of candidates. All of ‘em, no matter their political persuasion or party. This will include all those who already occupy office and may seek reelection again soon.The first thing I could ask of you is that you run a fair campaign. I know, I know. Everyone says that’s the way things should be. But somewhere, there must be data that proves slinging dirt actually works. Because people sure do enough of that.Why don’t you be the one who rises above telling untruths. Why don’t you be the one who tells us more about yourself rather than half-truths or lies about your opponent? Does your opponent have weaknesses? Be sure you tell us more about your own strengths, then trust us to work it all out for ourselves.Second, and this is a big one, please don’t magically show up at our church (or anyone else’s just before voting day. Let me be clear. You are welcome at our church on any of fifty-two Sundays every year. Our doors are open.But candidates who run around hopping from church to church right at election time must think that voters are dumb enough to fall for that. I once had a campaign manager here call me and ask if his client could come to worship at our church that Sunday. My reply was this. “Of course they can. Any Sunday. But my advice would be to not do that. Because that tactic is so transparent, it only makes your candidate look bad.”Of course, the candidate and manager showed up anyway. I still don’t understand what the payoff is. Everyone knows they’re just campaigning, and using a church’s sacred gathering on the Lord’s Day demonstrates either an integrity problem or a judgment problem.Next, please be sure you represent yourself in a way that you can deliver once the election is over. If you tell us something, please keep it relevant and realistic. We’re all hoping that great idea you pitched comes to fruition. Don’t make promises that you know you can’t truly have any impact on. Keep it real.Want to know what truly entertains me? Candidates who campaign on being “outsiders.” By definition, the moment you file and begin campaigning for votes, you are a politician. Please accept that, and we will do so, too.By the way, this has to do with who you are as well. We’re all hoping that the nice, kind person who begged us for our vote will still take our phone calls or answer our emails after the election has been won. Show us who you are as you campaign.Finally, please don’t be a single-issue servant. Because whether or not I live in your ward or district, once elected you are representing all of us. We’re all hoping that you’ll have the greatest good at heart.We understand the moments when your home constituents need for you to deliver. But if they are all you are concerned with, then I would argue you don’t understand the job. Rise to the moment, please. Rise to the level of service that benefits the larger area you serve, and on balance your own voters should recognize that.This is all I can ask of you. I wish you the very best.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B. Ballard Stadium, the Old Dominion Monarchs will host…The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_243,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Even those of us who Google every day — and that’s the vast majority of us — can and should applaud this week’s federal court ruling holding that the company is maintaining its dominance in internet search through an illegal monopoly. Google search can simultaneously be a very, very useful product (indeed, the judge said it is “widely recognized as the best” general search engine “available in the United States” and one that might not stay in the digital catbird seat if it weren’t strong-arming competitors.D.C. Federal Judge Amit Mehta’s ruling is rooted in the fact that Google spends billions of dollars to have its search engine installed as the default on new smartphones and other devices. In just one recent year alone, those agreements cost the company $26 billion — far more than most competitors can possibly afford.While users certainly have a choice to go into their settings and change the default search engine to Bing (7% market share in the U.S. or DuckDuckGo (2% market share , Google — with 90% market share overall and even higher than that on mobile devices — knows it’s a big deal to be the automatic option for millions. If it weren’t, they wouldn’t pay anything near that sum.When users reflexively rely on Google, every click that follows further cements Google’s dominance in advertising — which in this case the judge said enabled monopolistic pricing — and a wide range of other realms. It’s the key that unlocks the door to making money online.The judicial-ordered remedy is still to be determined; the legal process to arrive at that will begin next month. This could include penalties or structural changes that weaken the company’s ability or outright prevent it from setting Google as the default.Also to be determined is whether the ruling and remedies will stand once the logic of the decision is subjected to the scrutiny of higher courts. There will be appeals — Google has a very well-funded legal department, as does the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general who brought the case. They’re both hunkering down for the long haul.This was already looking like an unsettled moment for internet search engines. A new generation of AI-enabled tools including Perplexity AI, OpenAI’s SearchGPT and Bing are jockeying with Google’s new AI-enabled search to do more than just deliver a list of hits to queries.These programs take an increasingly massive and confusing internet and distill it so that users can increasingly get everything they need without leaving the page where they entered their query. That’s going to wind up giving Google, or whatever relative upstart makes inroads against it, even more power and moneymaking ability than before.We hope the ruling withstands the scrutiny of higher courts.

This idea is popular due to the issues that commercial real estate is having post-Covid, and has especially pertained to the downtown areas of our cities.The downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul have the highest concentrations of office buildings in the area, and many of these buildings are no longer being rented, or are being rented at low capacity, with some landlords trying to sell them. Many building owners have struggled to even sell their properties, or have sold them for far less than they paid.This has led to the general realization that having our downtowns built exclusively around office workers doesn’t work so well when those office workers no longer have to come downtown — at least not on a regular basis. Many of these workers are hybrid employees who are only in their offices 1-3 days a week.Neighborhoods function better when they are built around mixed uses that serve residential, commercial and office functions, all in a reasonably similar area. The parts of downtown that are able to do this, namely North Loop and Downtown East in Minneapolis, are doing quite well. This contrasts to areas such as Nicollet or the core of downtown St. Paul, which were built entirely around office workers.This is where calls to convert these office buildings to residential ones have come in. A seemingly great solution on the surface, we swap out unwanted offices for much needed housing. However, only about 15% of the office buildings in the nation’s largest cities are viable for office-to-housing conversions,according to the federal government. This means we need to find another solution.One solution, instead, is to focus first on in-fill development, redeveloping surface parking lots into residential buildings, while continuing to perform conversions as we can. We dedicate a massive amount of downtown areas to parking — specifically to surface parking lots, the lowest value land usage being placed in the highest-value area. In Minneapolis’s downtown,according to the Parking Reform Network, roughly 19% of the land area is dedicated to surface parking while St. Paul dedicates roughly 18%.For those worried about finding parking if we re-develop surface parking lots: this does not necessarily mean we will lose all of the parking. Apartment developments almost always include a plethora of parking. It would still exist, just underneath the building. There are also several large parking ramps in both downtowns, just blocks from every big destination — many of them seldom, if ever, full.Simply by redeveloping surface parking lots, we can induce a frenzy of development that will revitalize our downtowns. Downtown Minneapolis currently has about 56,000 residents while St. Paul has 10,000; they both stand to gain greatly from an increase in the housing stock. An influx of new residents would help to boost the businesses currently downtown and would likely be enough to spur several new businesses into existence.Take a stroll down nearly any street in either downtown and you will see several of these surface lots. Many of these lots are in central locations of the city, becoming an eyesore along the street. These empty lots often break up the continuous stretch of buildings, making a walk along the street much more unappealing.Building apartments on top of these parking lots not only would add housing, it would offer a chance to make our places much better looking. They can add continuity to a street, as well as beautify it. People are much more likely to walk and live along a street filled with buildings rather than paved with an ugly parking lot.With this new development, downtown would convert from simply being a place to go for big events to a place to live. Bringing in more people creates a stronger neighborhood that can support itself without having to rely so much on sporting events, concerts, etc.This has several other benefits, too. More apartment buildings means more residents, which will bring in more tax dollars to the city. This can ease the tax burden that the fall of commercial real estate valuations is predicted to have, and with residents also paying sales taxes, it likely will increase the amount of tax revenue.Additionally, young professionals are looking to live in dense urban environments; just look at the North Loop. Having a liveable downtown with lots of apartment buildings makes this lifestyle more affordable for the young people who want to live there, and being able to attract young graduates to a city can greatly increase its attractiveness for businesses to headquarter and operate there. This could help the office buildings that can’t be converted by attracting more businesses to use up the remaining office space.There is a reason that a recent !by Seth Bose, MinnPostJune 21, 2024"
minnpost_2024_18,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.History can teach us once again. The question is which of its lessons will we learn.That is assuming that in this Instagram and 24/7 cable news cycle and barely-take-time-to-read -a-book age that we can still learn the lessons of the last century — or even the last two decades.But after the Iranian drone and missile strike on Israel, the failure of the world’s leaders to speak with clarity and vision about co-existence in the volatile Middle East region and the nearly defunct capability of the United Nations as a peacekeeping entity, it seems evident to anyone who paid attention in high school that we may well be on the brink of a world war.Part of the problem is that we are a world which is filled with great powers who have for the most part chosen to abandon even the pretense of seeking peace as a status quo for their continued existence and success as nation-states.And this is largely a function of the misplaced belief that the ending of the rivalries which made up the daily grist we called the “Cold War” have been replaced by vaguer, but perhaps more dangerous, great power rivalries and competition.These rivalries are not the stuff of the old competing ideologies which proclaimed their own superiority if ever they achieved their worldly utopia goals; they are instead the remnants of those same great powers which are now plagued with their own internal failures and nation-state breakdowns and corruption.The decline and breakup of the Soviet Union and its old communist empire has now reanimated itself as a dictator-led “gangster-ocracy” — a nation which has as its model of achievement and success the power of the criminal over its public life — exemplified by Putinesque warlords we call “oligarchs.”And in its inevitable foreign policy outgrowth, Russia has exhibited a cancerous disregard of the rules of international law and the concomitant need to trample domestic human dignity and rights.China has, in its rush to assimilate the machinery of capital production, wholly disregarded all of capitalism’s underlying principles of economic and human liberty — using authoritarianism as the iron glove inside the economic pretext for global trade.Thus, its own human rights record prevents China from setting an example for moving forward toward democratic ideals and the norms which might allow it to play a constructive role in bringing about stability in its own region.The United States, while still a world leader and superpower, is preoccupied with an internal struggle about the future of democracy as a working political economy — including whether it is still strong enough and resilient enough to withstand assaults upon its fundamental institutions such as voting and the rule of law.The United States is plagued by such issues as gerrymandering, the filibuster, efforts to politicize the courts and an increasing widening of inequality in economic opportunity that have inevitably led to large numbers of Americans questioning the validity or legitimacy of the very idea of democracy and the legitimacy of the rule of law.History teaches that these kinds of continued inequalities — in economics and political privilege — are the breeding ground for political demagogues to exploit disaffection and to drive social divisions even deeper.Now, without clear evidence of the needed leadership on the world stage to assuage these efforts to impose a politics by “the rule of the strongest,” the globe may stand at the brink of collapse in even a pretense of international law and of a course toward peaceful resolution of conflict — and of peaceful coexistence.What history shows us is that each of two previous so-called world wars was hatched during a period of unprecedented global change — periods of change which lacked the institutional tools or know-how to bring the instability to heel before war could overtake the world.The global change wrought by our recent social and economic upheaval commonly called the “World Wide Web” and the ability of 21st century militaries to fight remote-control wars, combined with the subsidence of state-based governing ideologies, is leading us toward global conflict unchecked by ideological restraints.Just as the West failed to see that its treatment of World War I’s defeated enemies would lay the groundwork for more resentments and global conflict, the globalization of new technology and the exacerbation of wealth inequality is paving the way for demagoguery to emerge and democracy to diminish.And if history can teach us any one simple lesson, it is that demagogues are likely never content.After World War II, this nation and the rest of the world made an effort to establish a regime of international law and a forum for seeking peace. But, it took years of effort and commitment.Now, in a world of remote-control conflict lacking a new paradigm for peace and the resolution of conflict, one can easily imagine that there will be demagogues who are readily tempted to cry “havoc.”Once again, the real danger will be in pretending we cannot hear them barking at our doors.Goins lives in White Bear Lake."

Bismarck allegedly made this remark in 1898 after theBattle of Santiago de Cubawhere the American fleet came under heavy fire from the Spanish and still managed to pull off a victory with a miraculously low casualty count (one sailor killed, another one injured .I wonder where America’s guardian angel is these days. Called up to the top floor for reporting? Redeployed? If yes, you can’t blame the heavenly boss for stripping America of its most favored nation status. What would you do in His place if someone strutted around on Earth as a messiah impersonator and stole the limelight from your only son? I am of course talking about Donald Trump who claims that his trial for financial fraud makes him amartyr of Christ-like proportions.I am actually pretty sure that God is sick and tired of the extreme right(eous and uber pious. I don’t even think he is keen on surrounding himself with religious people right now. Why do you think he lets Jimmy Carter break the record for time spent in Earthly hospice care? My guess is that He has plenty of saints to talk to up there and no urgent need to add another one. Honestly, how much daily praise does one need? Even the Holy One must get tired of all that public flattery today.Back in the more secular sixties, John F. Kennedy never paraded his Catholic faith so visibly. And yet, people were very much afraid that he would get his orders straight from the Vatican as if he were a parish priest. Ironically, the only priestly thing about Kennedy was his appetite for secret sexual adventures. And they remained secret because journalists were busy covering the Cuban Missile Crisis instead, which back then, for reasons hard to understand in the #MeToo era, was seen as the bigger existential threat.Today’s political discourse is far from secular and God’s inbox full with requests from legislators at both the federal and state level. Some requests are stranger than others. I can’t imagine that the Almighty enjoys being spoken to in tongues — particularly not by ecstatic lawmakers who are losing iton Arizona’s Senate floorand need professional help from their exorcist.I bet he prefers calls from plain-speaking folk likeGeorge Baileywho each Christmas in Bedford Falls and on TV kicks off the conversation with his creator by letting Him know that he is “not a praying man.” This must be music in His ears since the number of prayers He has to deal with has skyrocketed in recent years. I doubt He is comfortable with the fact that people no longer just send thoughts but routinely attach more or less empty prayers. It must be particularly annoying when they come from today’s emotionalized TV anchors who sound and behave like graduates from the empathy academy rather than journalism school.I am not even sure if He appreciates flashy proclamations of religiosity like “In God We Trust.” Divided as we are, He’d rather see us actively work on making “E Pluribus Unum” a reality. Besides, the only other country on the planet that uses “In God We Trust” as a state motto is Nicaragua — and yes, if this wasn’t such a serious essay, now would be the time for jokes that include the terms “republic” and “banana.”George Bailey got his guardian angel right on time to prevent him from committing suicide.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_214,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Did the American Revolution actually happen? If it did, was it a good thing?This is more or less what Justice Elena Kagan seemed to be wondering during the oral arguments in Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 immunity case at the Supreme Court on Thursday morning.“Wasn’t the whole point that the president was not a monarch and the president was not supposed to be above the law?” she asked.Like her, I had assumed those questions were answered decisively in the affirmative more than 200 years ago. But now, after almost three hours of circuitous debate and bizarre hypotheticals at the Supreme Court, I’m not so sure.The right-wing justices seemed thoroughly uninterested in the case before them, which involves a violent insurrection that was led by a sitting president who is seeking to return to office in a matter of months. Instead, they spent the morning and early afternoon appearing to be more worried that prosecuting Trump could risk future malicious prosecutions of former presidents by their political rivals. And they tried to draw a distinction between official acts, for which a president might have immunity from prosecution, and private acts, for which no immunity would apply.The upshot was that a majority of justices appeared prepared to send the case back down to the lower courts for further unnecessary litigation, which would almost certainly eliminate any chance of a trial being held before Election Day.So let’s remember how we got here. The case began last year with special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment of the former president on charges of obstruction, fraud and conspiracy relating to his central role in the effort to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election, which resulted in the deadly attack at the U.S. Capitol. This scheme was, by a long shot, the most egregious abuse of authority by any president in history. It has resulted in multiple federal and state indictments of Trump and his associates, some of whom have already pleaded guilty to elements of the broader plot.In short, the justice system is doing its job by trying to hold to account a former president for subverting the last election before he runs in the next one. That is a very important job! And yet the right-wing justices are saying, essentially, not so fast — and maybe not at all.The federal Jan. 6 trial should have been underway for almost two months by this point. Instead, Trump managed to derail the prosecution with an off-the-wall appeal that he is absolutely immune from prosecution for his actions up to and on Jan. 6, which he claims were taken in the course of his official duties — even though the president has no role in overseeing how states run their elections. The lower courts, in opinions by judges appointed by both Republicans and Democrats, dispatched this appeal with ease. But the Supreme Court decided to take the case anyway, scheduling it for the final argument day of the term.The arguments Thursday tracked with this oddly leisurely pace, laced with hypothetical arguments.For instance, Justice Samuel Alito asked, what if an incumbent president “loses a very close, hotly contested election?” Without immunity, there is a risk he won’t be able to “go off into a peaceful retirement” because of the fear that he will be criminally prosecuted by his political opponent. “Will that not lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy?”It was the literal inverse of the case before them. Michael Dreeben, the lawyer arguing the case for Smith, responded by pointing out that the justice system has a built-in mechanism for ensuring that prosecutions are fair: It’s called a lawsuit.“There is an appropriate way to challenge things through the courts with evidence,” Dreeben said. “If you lose, you accept the results.” Trump, of course, did not accept his losses in more than 60 lawsuits, which is why we are all in this spot today.Still, the right-wing justices seemed impervious to the urgency of the matter before them.“I’m not focused on the here and now of this case,” Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. “I’m very concerned about the future.”But the here and now of this case is vital, and the outcome should not be a close vote. The former president violated his constitutional obligation to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. He is now running to be elected again. The threat is not what some hypothetical future commander in chief might do but what the defendant in this lawsuit has already done and has openly promised to do again.In fact, Trump’s lawyers argued in this case that he would be immune from prosecution for ordering SEAL Team Six to assassinate one of his political rivals.This is, as the nation’s founders would certainly agree, completely bonkers. Several of them had personally taken up arms to fight for independence from a king who existed above the law. As a group of the nation’s preeminent historians argued in a brief to the court, there is no evidence that any of the founders, including those who supported a powerful executive, imagined creating one who could abuse his authority without consequence.James Wilson, a central figure in drafting the Constitution, asked then whether the president enjoyed “a single privilege or security that does not extend to every person throughout the United States. Is there a single distinction attached to him in this system more than there is to the lowest officer in the republic?” The answer is obviously no.If a majority of the court sends the case back down to the lower courts with orders to reexamine the distinction between official and private acts, which seems likely, the resulting delay and lack of urgency in this case could well prevent a trial from being held before November. If Trump wins the election, he will shut down the prosecution and implement his extreme version of executive impunity. And the Supreme Court will have effectively blessed it, all while maintaining plausible deniability.It’s tempting to wonder whether it really matters, whether anyone who isn’t already fully aware of Trump’s threat to the republic would be convinced by a guilty verdict.But here’s the thing: Trials and due process do matter. Juries matter. Our criminal justice system, despite its numerous flaws, is the best method yet established to settle on the truth and do justice in a way that is widely seen as legitimate and fair. That is as it should be, because the courts hold your liberty, and sometimes even your life, in their hands.The Jan. 6 immunity case has always been constitutionally offensive, and the Supreme Court could dispense with it easily. As Rick Pildes, a constitutional scholar, pointed out online while following the oral arguments, the justices have all the facts they need in order to decide, at the very least, which of the acts Trump is charged with are indisputably nonofficial, and thus not immune from prosecution.The trial could continue based on those acts alone. If the court declines that route and prolongs this case, the “future” that the right-wingers profess to be so concerned about looks very bleak. The future looks like a president who really can shoot someone in broad daylight and get away with it.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.During the week of Aug. 19-25, Hawaii Island police arrested 22 motorists for DUI."
suffolknewsherald_2024_61,"Published 5:31 pm Tuesday, March 19, 2024ByLetters to the EditorDear Editor,As a 23-year resident of Suffolk, I have experienced considerable disruptions to the quiet enjoyment of my property. I’ve spoken at city council meetings, gone to “listening sessions,” attended civic league meetings, and written letters. I could address how two former mayors dressed me down at Council meetings for my comments about the cost of development. I could talk about the 2025 or 2035 plans, which are constantly ignored by our planning department and council. I could even point out how the city “saved Suffolk water customers” by joining HRUBS (bills skyrocketed .No, I won’t discuss that. Rather, I will address the blindness/deafness of current and former city leadership/representation. The 2045 plan is in ‘final draft’ form, and the city staff is hosting three ‘listening sessions.’ The main reason I will NOT be attending: these sessions are just lip service to make the voters/taxpayers whom the city is supposed to be working for feel that we have a say in what will happen in 2045. After a Spring listening session for the 2045 plan, I was speaking with a council member when the mayor walked up and said to the council member that the issues the people are bringing up don’t matter and that the city will do whatever it’s planning to do!My main problem with the proposed 2045 plan is what is missing: there is absolutely NO mention of the two Route 17 bridges, Mills Godwin Bridge and Thomas Hazelwood Bridge. Both are two-lane bridges. The development, both residential and commercial, on both sides of this peninsula in Suffolk and Isle of Wight are not mutually exclusive. This is a regional issue, with both municipalities adding to an already over-burdened roadway, yet Suffolk 2045 adds even more development — with no transportation solution — to this corridor. We have experienced traffic jams for years, and the number and duration of those continue to increase. When are our representatives going to step out of the vacuum they are operating in and address this?It’s a safety and quality of life issue that is the elephant in the room that I have been addressing for many years and the city literally has laughed at me.

philinquirer_2024_23,"The most effective solution is not a new tax; it’s a realignment of the city’s 10-year property tax abatement policy.What’s the best way to overcome Philadelphia’s long-standing affordable housing crisis? Many people who are aware of this problem, from policymakers to housing consumers, understand that any solution must involve a sustained commitment of public capital. But no one seems to have a good idea about how to raise the money.As we look for solutions, it might be helpful to answer a few questions.The scope and impact of this critical problem have been well-documented. A recent Inquirerarticle cited the long waiting lists for city-sponsored repair programs that provide funding to address unsafe andunhealthy conditions in occupied homes.Ahousing market analysispublished in the city’s most recent housing plan emphasizes “the need to bolster the production and preservation of affordable housing stock, as rents and home prices continue to rise.” Meanwhile, allocations of federal funding from the American Rescue Plan, which had provided$21 million to Philadelphiathrough the Whole-Homes Repair Program, arescheduled to end this year.The city’s most noteworthy response to this crisis is the $400 millionNeighborhood Preservation Initiative, launched in 2021. Through this program, City Council and the Kenney administration have provided substantial new funding for a variety of well-executed housing production and preservation strategies. About half that amount has already been spent or committed, according to theNeighborhood Preservation Initiative dashboard.In November 2021, voters approved an amendment to the city’s Home Rule Charter mandating that 0.5% of the city’s annual general fund appropriations be allocated to the city’sHousing Trust Fund, which provides financing for new affordable housing construction, the preservation of existing occupied housing, homelessness prevention programs, and related activities.The “New Earnings” line item in the city’s fiscal 2023 Annual Action Planincludes $27.9 million in funding from this source. While a major infusion of new funding is welcome, budgeting by charter amendment, which limits the ability of municipal administrators to make responsible fiscal management decisions on a year-to-year basis, is bad public policy and a bad precedent for the future.Tax-the-rich plans, such as the “wealth tax” on stocks and bonds thatCouncilmember Kendra Brooks proposedlast year, are not going to be effective ways of addressing the challenge of funding affordable housing. Based on the Pennsylvania Constitution’s“uniformity clause,”the obligation to pay a tax of this kind would fall on middle-income households, as well as on the wealthy.The most effective solution to this problem is not a new tax; it’s a realignment of the city’s 10-year property tax abatement policy.As in the past, properties that are currently receiving the abatement will be generating new tax revenue for the city after the abatement period ends, starting in the 11th year. So for that initial year and for nine years afterward, the city’s share of the new tax proceeds should be allocated to the Housing Trust Fund.The city has already reallocated tax revenue in this way, on a more limited basis. A 2018 Council ordinance mandated that, for properties that had reached the end of the 10-year abatement period, the new revenue received in the 11th year — but only the 11th year, and only in fiscal years 2019 through 2023 — should be assigned to the Department of Planning and Development to support affordable housing activities.As an example of the effect of this legislative mandate, the department received$6.87 millionin fiscal 2022 tax revenue generated by properties with abatement periods that had ended in the previous year, to be added to the Housing Trust Fund budget. Because the 10-year period for this group of properties began during the Great Recession, whenhousing development activity was at an exceptionally low level, revenue generated during subsequent years would be much higher.The 2018 approach should be extended and expanded. This time, however, the allocation of new funds should extend for 10 years following the end of the abatement period and should involve the city’s portion of property tax revenues only, so that the School District could receive its full share of these revenues(55 cents of each dollar .Property owners’ tax bills would not be affected; taxes on formerly abated properties would just be allocated differently.With this reallocation of the city’s share of post-abatement revenue during the coming years, the amount of money allocated to the trust fund would vary annually, based on changes in real estate development activity. But the level of funding would be substantial.This administrative change could also be implemented quickly. A refreshed tax abatement policy would serve as powerful evidence of the incoming Parker administration’s commitment to the principle of equitable development.John Kromer, former city housing director, is the author of “Fixing Broken Cities: New Investment Policies for a Changed World.”"
philinquirer_2024_54,"A divided America needs more eclipses. Unfortunately, the next one on the continental U.S. isn’t until 2044.LAKE WAPPAPELLO, MO. — Before I was shaken awake by darkness, I was just one of a swarm, a crowd of humans walking down a hill from the parking lot to the lake’s edge. We had driven for hours through the rural wilderness to get here, past fields growing crops I cannot name and through roads so remote they don’t have names, just letters of the alphabet. The traffic thickened near the state park’s gate.The procession to the path of totality felt like the tailgate before a big game. People had wagons full of drinks and barbecue supplies. Folding chairs and picnic blankets abounded. Some had brought colanders from their kitchens to see the sun with chunks taken out of it by the moon. Others had elaborate camera lenses and tripods. I brought an orange, two bottles of water, a Frisbee, my notebook, eclipse glasses, and a desire to experience whatever show the sun and moon and planets would provide.At first, the crowd was tentative. We kept our distance, pods of families and friends strewed on blankets and towels. But then, in line for the porta potty, I started talking with a dad from Washington state who had driven to Missouri for the eclipse, stopping to visit his daughter in Denver on the way. This wasn’t his first time; the copious supplies in his backpack showed that he knew what he was doing.We settled beside the lake and started to throw the Frisbee for the dog, waiting. A family next to us played volleyball. It was delicious to be gathered with strangers for nothing other than the simple reason of being in awe of the sky. That kind of unity is hard to replicate.In the hours of waiting, I started talking to others assembled in the crowd. Kendra and Peter from Iowa had an elaborate folding rocking chair and looked so completely at ease next to each other, not tearing their gaze from the sky. A whole family from Wisconsin, three generations, including an infant, were replicating the colander trick with a piece of paper that had been hole-punched and cast shadows on their blanket. A grandmother from Alabama had driven her grandkids here just to see an eclipse together in her lifetime.Everything was beginning to feel so normal that the hurtling plunge of totality was akin to a slap. And for those four weightless minutes, we were transported into a different world.It was so dark, darker than I could believe.A sudden coldness in the air on my skin made me stand up straighter. The wind kicked up and blew my hair back. The shadow of the moon was over us as colors faded to gold and gray. We could see the biggest corona, a ring of light, irregular, strong, tendriled, dancing outward from the black hole where the sun used to be. And the sun felt larger than it ever has; I could almost reach out and touch the flares.I started to holler, unable to control the noises coming from my mouth. Time turned on its head. I cried and I danced barefoot in the grass. I shouted and whooped and spun.Annie Dillard, in heressay about the 1979 eclipsein Washington state, perhaps says it best: “Seeing a partial eclipse bears the same relation to seeing a total eclipse as kissing a man does to marrying him, or as flying in an airplane does to falling out of an airplane. Although the one experience precedes the other, it in no way prepares you for it.”I wasn’t ready. There was no way to be. Seeing a total eclipse is not some flight of astrological fancy, but instead a life-changing experience, one that emphasizeshow united we are on the surface of this planet we call home.In a time of disunity, after perilous elections and a global pandemic, it’s a message of togetherness our country needs now more than ever.Yes, there were Trump signs in the Missouri farming towns I had driven through, but out by the lake, politics didn’t matter. We were gathered to participate in an intricately choreographed togetherness, one contingent on a precise alignment of our hurtling through outer space. What would it take, I wonder, to replicate that feeling without the confluence of the sun and moon?It’s abnormal to feel one’s smallness in this world — combined with a deep well of interconnectedness with another and the entire cosmos. I am merely human. I get caught up in my own heartbreaks, my own pains, failure, the mundane stuff of living. The sun rises and the sun sets. I am used to the predictable rhythm of living.Yet in those minutes of totality, darkness in the bright afternoon, I hugged a stranger. I hugged my dog. I felt completely outside of myself, as if I was seeing my body from above, whirling, luminous — and how wonderful does that feel? I was one with the sun and the moon and the lake and the hundreds of people around me, all of us focused on one point of massive black in the middle of a ring of light. And I could see other planets laid out in the sky, too: a three-dimensional model of what it looks like to peer into the solar system. Someone next to me shouted that it was Venus. And was that Saturn, too?When the lights turned back on, totality over, I felt deflated, like when the overhead brights turn on at the end of a dance party that I never wanted to end. Last call. The planets were gone. I kept the eclipse glasses on my eyes, hoping to recapture some of that feeling, the improbability of all of it. But like all joys, it ended.Nothing gold can stay. The sun returned to its normal brightness and we drove away, part of a procession back to our respective states, wondering: Did this all really happen? And how could we ever be the same?That circle of darkness is seared in my memory now. I want more. I understand why a crazed group of explorers travels the world chasing eclipses. Totality is a rush that my body is still making sense of, and that I won’t soon forget.But what will stand out from those precious moments at Lake Wappapello State Park in Missouri is not the corona of the sun — magnificent as it was — nor the small bites of light that the moon took out of our nearest star for the hours before and after, ravenous. Instead, it’s the community that formed around a shared experience.Liv from Colorado, adjacent to us, offered the biggest hug in the darkness and said: “Isn’t it beautiful?”In her embrace and in her question, I realized that I needed to have that beauty magnified back at me. We needed to reassure each other that the eclipse was real. As if to say: Did you see that? Did you know that the wild miracle of being alive in this moment together is just, for lack of a better word, divine?In this moment — a fraught election year, wars raging abroad, democracy at stake — fear is more accessible than love. It’s easy to be afraid of one another. Cultivating trust with strangers is another challenge entirely. It’s much, much easier to turn away from the hard work of seeing one another.Yet as I continue to make sense of the minutes I felt outside of myself under a darkened sky, I have to ask: What will it take to keep this feeling alive? To know, truly, that our neighbors are just like ourselves?America needs more eclipses. Unfortunately, thenext one on the continental U.S. isn’t until 2044.An alignment of the earth and the sun and the moon can jolt us into a shared reality. But we can get there another way — by learning a different way of seeing: one that prioritizes shared experiences over sterile pandemic bubbles, the great expanse of the sky over the smallness of screens, and generosity over all else.That kind of beloved community is always available, just behind the curtain of light."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_263,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Ilistened with profound sadness to the recent Supreme Court decision Grants Pass v. Johnson, which opens the door for people to be arrested simply for lacking shelter. This decision makes it legal for local governments to target, fine and even incarcerate people who fall asleep in public areas, regardless of whether there’s safe, accessible shelter available.Where’s the compassion? Where’s the justice?I know what it’s like to be without a place to call home. In the years before the pandemic, my husband and I were working hard to buy a house for our children and the animals we rescued. I’d overcome an opioid addiction. We had a small business and were starting to achieve our dreams.But when the pandemic hit, we lost our business and our debts quickly mounted. We’d nearly completed the purchase of the house we’d been renting, but we lacked the money to transfer the deed. The owner of the deed decided to evict us.We live in a small, rural West Virginia town where only two shelters are available — and none that would take our pets. So we lived in a tent with our children and animals for three months.Losing your home is incredibly destabilizing. Without a fixed address, you can lose benefit payments, official mail, jobs and other critical opportunities. When I was evicted, I didn’t have time to switch over my license plate to my new vehicle, which caused me to lose my license. I still haven’t been able to regain my driving privileges.We had to walk long distances for food and water, and we had no way to shower. My children had to change schools, and the emotional strain on them caused behavioral and mental health challenges that no child should have to experience.We survived with help from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps. We got a tiny amount of cash assistance from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program and health care through Medicaid.We were eligible for housing assistance, but the wait was impossibly long due to the lack of available affordable housing. That’s not just a problem in West Virginia — the United States has a shortage of more than 7 million affordable housing units for people with very low incomes.Let me tell you this: No one wakes up one morning and chooses to be homeless. No one says to themselves, “How fun would it be for my kids and my family to live in a tent without food, water, school or transportation?”The owner of the deed to our house finally relented and reduced the deed fee so we could take possession of our house and move back home.But so much damage had been done to the kids already — and we lost most of our rescued animals.Things need to change for families like mine. The Supreme Court’s cruel decision to penalize people who are suffering is a big step in the wrong direction. How is fining and arresting people who are too poor to pay going to help?Here’s a better idea. We need to invest in affordable housing, ensure people are paid living wages and support struggling families with a robust safety net.I’m deeply saddened that our leaders would criminalize people suffering poverty, as if we were living in a Charles Dickens novel. Our laws must be better, and we must hold our officials accountable. We work hard at doing the right thing — they should, too."

minnpost_2024_113,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Strange as it may seem, early germ theorists could tell us a lot about today’s attitudes toward climate change.While researching for a new book about thehistory of emerging infections, I found many similarities between early debates over the existence of microbes and current debates over the existence of global warming.Both controversies reveal the struggles of perceiving an unseen threat. Both reveal the influence of economic interests that benefit from the status quo. But most importantly, both reveal how people with different beliefs and interests can still agree on key policies and practices for tackling a global problem.Seeing is believing, and until the mid-19th century, it was very difficult to see the tiny organisms responsible for our so-called “fever” diseases.Although the indirect evidence was compelling, many people remained skeptical of “animalcules” – as microorganisms were once called – untilthe microscope was sufficiently developed. Even then,acceptance was gradual. The once-dominant ideas about disease-causing gases, called miasmsas, persisted for several decades before most people acknowledged that the fevers had a living cause.Climate change presents similar challenges of visibility. Although everyone can see and feel the weather, it is often difficult to observe itslarger patterns and longer trendswithout the aid of technical charts.Even when people acknowledge the bigger picture, the case for human responsibility is complicated by the fact that thecarbon emissionsfrom our engines, like the germ infections within our bodies, are unseen by the naked eye. It is hard to achieve human solutions when the evidence of human cause is invisible.Adding to these challenges, economic interests often confound scientific recommendations.In the case of germ theory, early recommendations to prevent the spread of infection includedreinstating quarantinesat shipping ports and border crossings, thus impeding the international flow of trade.In the case of climate theory, recommendations to slow global warming includereducing the consumption of carbon-based fuels, thus reducing the flow of oil. These strategies can threaten livelihoods as well as profits, so it is not surprising to findlabor unions divided over green initiativesand energy executives spreadingmisinformation about climate science.But people’s beliefs and interests need not align if everyone finds some benefit in the recommendations.This was the case in the latter decades of the 19th century, when germ-denying surgeons nevertheless adoptedthe antiseptic techniques of Joseph Lister.They did so mainly for the practical reason that their patients fared better under the new methods. But if an explanation was needed, many of these die-hard skeptics claimed Lister’s methods prevented thetransmission of miasmasrather than living organisms.Responding to these claims, Lister stated:“If anyone chooses to assume that the septic material is not of the nature of the living organisms, but a so-called chemical ferment destitute of vitality … such a notion, unwarranted though I believe it to be by any scientific evidence, will in a practical point of view be equivalent to a germ theory, since it will inculcate precisely the same methods of antiseptic management.”Lister was more concerned with saving lives than winning arguments. As long as the surgeons adopted his methods, Lister cared little about their justifications. When it came to preventing infection, it was the behaviors rather than the beliefs that counted.The same could be said for global warming: Changing behaviors is more important than changing beliefs.Case in point, there is a large and growingenvironmentalist movement among evangelical Christians. Organizations such asGreen Faith and the Creation Care Task Forcecite Biblical scripture to promote environmental stewardship as a sacred duty.While many of these groups acknowledge human-based climate change,some of their core beliefs contradict the evolutionary theoriesthat my colleagues and I employ as scientists. But we need not agree about fossils to wean the world off fossil fuels.The same goes for priorities and economic interests.A recentnational Pew surveyfound that a large majority of Americans support the development and use of renewable energy. This includes a slight majority of Republicans, thoughtheir motives tend to differfrom those of Democrats.Republicans are more likely toprioritize the economic benefitsof renewable energy than Democrats, who tend to list global warming as their driving concern.The economic benefits could explain whyred states produce the largest share of America’s wind energyand why three of these states are among the nation’s top five producers of solar energy. Their adoption correlates with the geography of the wind and sun belts, where farmers see favorable returns for producing power and a stable source of income to buffer the price fluctuations of weather-sensitive crops. Livelihood is a powerful motivator.None of these examples address climate change on all its fronts. And among Democrats as well as Republicans, there are different opinions about how fast and how far thetransition to renewable energyshould go.But we can take another hopeful lesson from the 19th century: Although people did not agree on all disease-preventing actions, they nevertheless found enough common ground to achievethe greatest mortality decline in recorded history.Ron Barrettis a professor of anthropology atMacalester College.This article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

The benefits of having a new health facility in a neighborhood that desperately needs one outweigh concerns over the facility s location.If you’re lower-income, live inNortheast Philadelphia, and have a health concern, you’re often out of luck.That’s because, for years, the neighborhood has had only one city-run health center forroughly 300,000 residents. And since it’s become home to an influx of lower-income residents and those fromrefugeeandimmigrant communities, many of whom lack private insurance, the situation has become more dire.The Philadelphia Department of Public Health hasbeen planning for years for two new health centersin the Northeast. And I think it’s a very good thing.The health department found the sites after years of searching for the right locations. One will be at the Frankford Transportation Center, and the other on the grounds of Friends Hospital on Roosevelt Boulevard.The new health centers will be large enough to accommodate over 40,000 patients. Currently, the Northeast hasonly one city health center, located on Cottman Avenue, near Bustleton Avenue. There — at Health Center 10 — it takes roughly10 months to get a new appointment for an adult. There aredozens of city and federal health centerslocated throughout Philadelphia, but only three in the entire Northeast (one city-run, two federal , even though it is one of the most populous neighborhoods in the city.Outside of the Northeast, most of the public health clinics have enough capacity to offer treatment in a reasonable amount of time.During the last 40 years, Philadelphia’s demographics have changed.Center City, University City, and surrounding neighborhoods have seen an influx of wealthier families. The Northeast has become home to one of the highest concentrations of people who immigrate to Philadelphia. What’s more, poverty levels have grown significantly: Since 1990, the number of people living in poverty in Mayfair, for instance, hasgrown by more than 400%.A2018 review of access to primary careby the Department of Public Health found that the Lower Northeast section of the city, in particular, lacks providers, making it a “health-care desert.”Of course, as with any major project, there are people who oppose it.» READ MORE:Debate continues over a new health center proposal in Northeast PhiladelphiaSome residents have raised concerns overdemolishing the historic buildingon the Friends Hospital campus, which is nearly 170 years old. Nobody wants to see our city’s history erased, but in this instance, I feel the benefits of having a new health facility serving tens of thousands of people per year in a neighborhood that desperately needs one outweigh the downsides of tearing down the existing structure.While the Friends site (the largest of the two proposed health centers will provide abundant parking, some critics have expressed concern that anyone taking public transit will have to cross the busy Roosevelt Boulevard. However, as part of its “Route for a Change” program, the city has committed to making the crossing at Langdon Street (near Friends Hospital safer for pedestrians. What’s more, red-light cameras on the Boulevard have been credited forreducing crashes involving pedestrians by 50%.If patients still don’t feel safe, they can choose the other location at the Frankford Transportation Center, which is easily accessible by bus.The greater danger, to me, would be going back to the drawing board to find a new location. Even if the current plan proceeds, the new facility won’t be open until next year at the earliest. If the city has to spend more time scouting a new location, that could take years — at which point, there may no longer be money in the budget to build it. Meanwhile, residents suffer from the lack of health centers the city could be building right now.The demand for new Northeast health centers has never been greater. The sooner we build the new centers, the sooner people will be able to access the lifesaving health care they need.John Dodds is director of thePhiladelphia Unemployment Project, which works with laid-off Philadelphians, many of whom lose their insurance upon layoff and need the low-cost health care offered at city health centers."

Maybe at some point it will. But based on my students’ comments, ChatGPT/AI is less than a revolution.At the beginning of 2023, ChatGPT/AI took higher education by storm. It was heralded as the next big thing to change teaching and learning. It was going to be the savior or demise of higher education as we know it. Yet as we know, the road to educational reform is littered witheducational technology failures and overhypes.In the fall 2023, I incorporated ChatGPT into my three undergraduate classes. For all three classes ChatGPT was used in a variety of ways. For each class, a ChatGPT question was listed in the syllabus for each day, serving as a prompt for discussion. I used ChatGPT to encourage student discussion. If I asked a question and no one was willing to answer I told the class to look it up in ChatGPT and tell me what it said.I encouraged students in all three classes to use ChatGPT to help them generate preliminary answers for their take-home essay tests or papers. They could use it for research, to generate outlines, or for summaries of lectures. They could use it any way they wanted.Finally, I generated several lesson plans on topics to be covered in class. I did this after already preparing my own so that I could compare them.What did we learn?My students were underwhelmed or generally unimpressed with ChatGPT as a teaching and learning tool. I chose not to use any of the ChatGPT generated lesson plans. They were simply not well organized, superficial, or got critical facts or issues wrong.Several students remarked how they had been using it even before my classes. They found it mildly useful to generate some preliminary ideas for research or a paper, such as perhaps producing a preliminary outline that identified key issues or points. They were extremely critical that ChatGPT did not provide sources or references to books or articles. They all told me that they did not think ChatGPT did not do anything that Google did not already do, or the latter did better. Several said that using Google or another search engine along with ChatGPT helped them.My students were highly aware and critical of the biases and inaccuracies in ChatGPT and how it makes up facts. They all knew the now near legendary story of a New York attorney using it to write a brief and how it made up cases. As several students stated, ChatGPT operated on the principle of “garbage in, garbage out.”We ended the classes unimpressed for now with the ChatGPT revolution, but we did come up with ten rules that may be useful to teachers and students as they experiment with AI in the classroom:David Schultz is a distinguished professor at Hamline University.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_84,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.854°Should you be so lucky as to have a publisher for your memoir, you’ll likely be pushed to make it as revealing as possible. Personal confessions — of, say, past drug use — can help a book become a bestseller, especially if your narrative is a redemptive one of healing and recovery.But beware of being hung on your own petard.That’s one lesson from the speedy conviction Tuesday of Hunter Biden, the 54-year-old son of President Joe Biden, on all three felony charges related to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 after he had said on a mandatory gun-purchase form that he was neither using nor addicted to illegal drugs. Despite the political furor surrounding the case, coming hard upon the felony conviction of Donald Trump, the former president of the United States and presumptive Republican nominee for a second term, this really was an open-and-shut case.(So, for that matter, was Trump’s, which explains all the focus on whether the novel charges should have been brought as distinct from, say, whether or not Trump actually did that which he was accused of doing. The jury did not have a difficult job when it came to the actual evidence .Biden admitted to an addiction to crack cocaine in his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things,” contemporaneous to the era when he filled out the form and bought the gun. Thus, the jury in this case had Biden’s own words to use in its process toward finding him guilty, especially since he had also helpfully recorded his own audiobook, adding to the vividness of those declarations. All the prosecution had to do was play the tape and hear the defendant’s voice.This same issue may yet come back to bite Prince Harry, who also confessed to copious amounts of drug use in his own memoir, “Spare,” a lucrative bestseller. The problem there is that most U.S. immigration forms ask applicants about their drug use, which can make them ineligible for entry or residency in some circumstances. The Heritage Foundation sued to find out whether Harry lied on any form, and a federal judge got involved some weeks ago. In the unlikely event that any of this would go to trial, the British prince might well be put in the unenviable position of having to deny something he wrote himself. That’s a heavy lift in front of a jury, as Hunter Biden discovered.Prosecutorial discretion is a fact of legal life, past mistakes should not always be determinative of a person’s future, and a case can be made that both Biden and Harry are being subject to the kind of politicized pursuit that would not befall a regular Joe or Jane. No question. On the other hand, an argument could be made that such scrutiny comes with privilege, even if that privilege is only of birth. And let’s not forget, both of these men have sought an ongoing place in the public discourse. Nobody forced them to open up their past lives for scrutiny.The moral of these cautionary tales for the rest of us? Either use personal discretion or tell the truth across all platforms and be prepared to face the consequences.—Chicago Tribune/TNSWASHINGTON — The gunman who tried to kill Donald Trump mounted a “sustained, detailed effort” to attack a major gathering of some sort before deciding to target the Republican presidential candidate at a Pennsylvania rally in July, FBI officials said on Wednesday."

We met them all.A yard sale is a lot of work. A first requirement is to decide what stuff, things and personal junk you want to get rid of — I mean sell. No one really wants your junk — those things you’re fed up with or that conjure bad vibes or remind you of your awful or evil past. Nor do they want the long explanations that go with them.Your stuff and your things, however, can be displayed anywhere, anytime because they just might sell. A few nice dresses near the side-walk, LP records for hipsters, an electric mower front and center. Just kidding. Get customers inside the perimeter. “Hi, haven’t seen you for a while.” Sales just might happen.But care is needed; you can’t betooforthcoming. You watch. More than a glance at an item can be promising. It happened more than once with the electric mower and led to openings for talk about lawn care, the environmental advantages of electric power, etc. I talked.But a lawn mower that doesn’t run is just a pile of junk. I had convinced myself that all that was needed was an inexpensive repair; someone who knew electricity would come along and give it a thought. No go. I mentioned the pricey batteries I was throwing in that worked. Not lure enough. “It ran like a charm last fall,” I said. “I have the service records.” But it didn’t run now, and all attempts to sell went zippo. The lawnmower sits in the garage. I’ll call DeWalt to find out about salvage.But there were successes, too. An old bike sold, some heavy tools, two worn out radios, a partial chemistry set separated from the University of Minnesota chemistry department, and my dad’s duck-hunting waders.People kept coming. The bike sold to a young guy who, it turns out, is our new mailman. Lives close buy, so I met a new neighbor and even dropped the price a bit for him. A soft heart can sell stuff, but it doesn’t negotiate well.Some CDs sold. More than one visitor wanted them, and if we had put out our old vinyl sets, we could have cleaned up. “Do you have records for sale?” Maybe next time, because while we do have long-playing records, we didn’t have time to sort through them for those we’d let go. Letting go is a big part of any successful lawn sale.Pushing 80 years old, I should be less attached to stuff and things. My junk’s another story. I fretted about selling some of my dad’s belongings, though. One item in particular — his ancient duck hunting waders — gave me pause. Heavy as hell, perhaps just another item in the electric lawn mower category, they came up to a tall man’s armpits and who knew how functional they were. But still, I believed they’d be a fit for someone, maybe in another realm, and lo and behold.One more new neighbor showed up. A recent retiree, public-school art teacher and outdoorsy sort, he lifted the waders and appeared downright joyful. He marveled at the condition they were in after 80 years. They don’t make rubber waders like that anymore.He had a use for them, too. I smelled sale. His family goes to the Maine woods every summer to work building a cabin. The cabin sits on land with a small pond, he told me, which for whatever reason needed to be cleaned. He tried on the waders. My new friend was concerned the waders wouldn’t fit his size 12+ feet. But my father was a big man. Voila! Perfecto!I imagined the retiree wader clad, pulling cattails and noxious weeds, throwing them left and right. Here comes an old bedspring, a car muffler out of that pond, and he’s wearing my dad’s waders. Immersed in the muck, loving it.Robin Wall Kimmerer in “Braiding Sweetgrass” tells a story of how she and her students mucked in a pond to clean and restore it to vitality and to help plant and animal life flourish. I imagined my new friend doing the same in dad’s waders, giving them a new lease on life by connecting them again to nature, and serving another man’s dreams of balance and contentment.Yard sales are not only work, for there is joy in becoming more acquainted with people you might not have known lived close by. Good memories, too, in the stuff and things you put out. But be careful with the junk. Not at a yard sale.Tom Beer, of Minneapolis, is a retired union official, the former president of the Minneapolis Regional Retiree Council AFL-CIO, treasurer of the Farmer-Labor Education Committee, a writer and a contributor to Ramsey History’s podcast “March of the Governors.”"

Frog! ….Frogger!….Froggy!As a young boy I would often hear that greeting offered to me as I’d come out of the patch of woods near my hometown Little League field in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, especially from the members and close associates of the Culbert Family. They’re good folks who, to this day, would cast aside any other name or title I have to call me some form of “Frogman.”You see, while I was in those woods, I was often at a very small creek trying to catch frogs. I was supposed to be serving as the bat boy for the Red Lion Café baseball team my dad coached. Now, to paint a better picture, this was back in the days when you wore sneakers and jeans to play at that level. Your uniform consisted of a decaled t-shirt, and what is now called a “trucker cap.” Sports drinks weren’t available to us. We were fueled on Swedish fish, Big League Chew, hot dogs and Mountain Dew. At that age, when someone said, “do you have your cup?” We’d make a fist and knock on our groin area to prove we did.So, I’d come out of those woods, just in time for the game, maybe. I’d probably be a little dirty, and there’s a good chance there were wet pants legs. It was a glorious time! I never really felt like I was in trouble for being over there in those woods. Though, my priorities were noted before me by my dad and his fellow coaches, all in good fun. These were men who understood that a boy needed to play in the woods and creeks (though for us, they were “cricks” from time to time. Catching frogs, skipping rocks, learning the hard way about poison ivy, and all manner of other seemingly small skills for encountering and experiencing nature were really lessons that would travel into other areas of life.As I grew older, I found other such places in my life, and they grew larger, from the freedom my parents gave me to explore what was “up on the hill” or “down in the swamp” until dinner time to spending a few summers section-hiking several states of the Appalachian Trail.While Sunday morning worship in the community is essential to me, and time in nature is not the same, my adventures, no matter how brief, into nature are a spiritual gulp of the most intimate and raw encounters with God’s creation and will.For me, as my spiritual director can tell you, deep down, I’m still “Frogman.” I’m still the little boy who needs to find the wellspring that nature gives me. The play, the imagination, adventure and solitude. Alone or with a group. For reading a book, or for catching a fish. For emptying the closets of emotional and mental overload on a multi-day hike or a quick walk about a park. For staring into a campfire and considering nothing else in the world but still feeling entirely grounded in it. This liturgy of it all goes on.I’ve always been happy to enter that world. Returning from it to the Little League field, to do my homework, or to get back into the office helps me enter those areas of life in peace. It’s the kind of place that I love to stay longer in but know that leaving will be done in peace, and returning will bring me joy again.Friends, I hope you give yourself whatever version of those patches of wood in life you can still find. If you have children in your life, I encourage you to give them this life-long gift that will return benefits to them in mental, spiritual and physical well-being.I assure you that upon your entering those places, and especially taking young ones, nature is waiting to burst into song and clap its hands at your intention to gather and be within it.On Saturday, September 7, 2024 at Kornblau Field at S.B.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_234,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Texas Federal Judge J. Campbell Barker, appointed by Donald Trump in 2019, has frozen a Biden administration policy that could have helped some half-million undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens get legal status. Hopefully, Barker’s stay will not be staying.Basically, these folks would already be eligible to receive permanent residency, if it weren’t for the Catch-22 of having to leave the country to get it, triggering a re-entry ban. The policy would use a power called parole-in-place to give those without a criminal record who’ve been in the country for 10 years at least the ability to seek status without leaving. Naturally, 16 states led by the ever-zealous Texas sued, and got Barker to agree to stop it.Why is anyone against this? And how does it harm those 16 states? The idea of keeping families together should not be controversial and it appeals to the sentiments expressed by vice presidential candidate JD Vance. Children need both of their parents and so efforts should be made to keep parents married and in a family unit. Yet, clearly, that does not extend to these families, where one of the spouses is an immigrant.What these states want is to stop people who have long been living in and contributing to their own state economies, who have gotten married to citizens and often had citizen children, and who have a full-fledged legal pathway to status, to be permanently blocked from that path on a technicality.They want those people to lose out on a chance to retroactively comply with the law — something they’re also supposedly very keen on, though perhaps only when it’s some giant polluter or a white collar criminal who got caught tax cheating — and face the extreme consequence of exile.This doesn’t only hurt these people and families themselves, but the consequences spread out to the entire community. These individuals are working across crucial industries or creating jobs themselves as small business owners.If they were to suddenly be removed, that would cost jobs and expertise and put those families in precarious situations of just the type that these state officials love to grumble about; are they going to provide benefits and assistance to the families left practically destitute by their efforts?That’s a good reason for Texas and other states to be in court fighting to support the Biden policy, not shut it down.Is their point that parole-in-place isn’t the right way to achieve this goal, that it should have been done with legislation? Well, it was Trump who killed the bipartisan Senate immigration package.Or are immigrants just best to be used as political pawns in an election year?All this just puts the absurdity to the legal argument that the states will suffer some harm from this policy, particularly given that this argument is anchored on the premise that it will spur illegal immigration. We can’t say we’ve spoken to any migrants with the nefarious plan of falling in love, getting married and, maybe, a decade later getting a permanent status out of it.This is a fiction to justify the opposition to the policy, opposition which is much more likely to cause actual harm to their state fabric.— New York Daily NewsIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big."

They’re also encouraged to review their current policies and adopt age-appropriate policies and procedures aligned with the guidance ahead of this date or policies that are more comprehensive than the final guidance.Linked to cell phone use, research shows there are rising issues with mental health, increasing lack of social skills and being unable to communicate in person, the inability to concentrate and focus for any period of time, and the growing retreat into the virtual world.Research also indicates teens self-report that they spend an average of seven (7 hours per day on their phones-nearly 50 hours each week, more than a full-time job. That’s only possible because our children carry their cell phones in their pockets all day long. Recent studies show spending more than three hours a day on social media doubles the risk of poor mental health for adolescents. The rate of suicide has increased 167% since 2010 for girls and 91% since 2010 for boys. From 2019 to 2021, boys and girls experienced a spike in depression of 161% and 145%, respectively.VDOE states it’s not just the research and statistics that show the overwhelming need to take action to reverse these trends. “It’s the real-life experience that parents, teachers, family members, and even the children themselves recognize in young people’s behaviors. Cell phones and social media are changing their children’s development for the worse, and our communities are ready to support our children to help put the phones away.”Addressing medical needs and emergency situations, the Virginia Department of Education draft guidance recognizes students with medical needs may have an exemption. It also recognizes the importance of emergency communication to parents. Thus, it requires school divisions to build plans to communicate directly with parents and to treat family emergencies with urgency, ensuring students have the information and support needed. Each school should share their family-based emergency school plan procedures with parents and students, as well as post them on their website.The MLB schedule today is not one to miss.

minnpost_2024_38,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The recent rise of generative AI has greatly elevated human anxiety of being displaced by emerging technologies. The imminent threat makes it worthwhile to reflect upon our uniqueness as humans, for while AI is a powerful tool that can augment human abilities, it’s not without its limitations.As an associate professor at the Carlson School of Management, I ask students in my Artificial Intelligence class two questions: 1 What are the key differences between humans and machines? 2 If one day machines could do most things we humans can do, what makes us uniquely human?I, too, shall try to answer these questions. Compared to machines, humans have conscience, emotions, self-awareness, empathy for others, and the ability to build relationships.Perhaps the most notable difference is humanity’s imperfections — and sometimes irrationality. To err is human. Consistency or predictability is both a strength and a weakness of machines. Once machines learn to behave in certain ways, they do it quite consistently, unless the algorithm changes. Even generative AI has bounded creativity. In contrast, we humans are less consistent or predictable, or more divergent and spontaneous in our thinking. We can be careless, forgetful, or lazy. We are easily swayed by trivial things like the weather, what we eat for lunch, or social encounters.Humanity’s imperfections or spontaneity are not always a weakness. Sometimes, this “flaw” leads to amazing discoveries or creations. Fleming might not have discovered penicillin if he had not left a pile of dirty Petri dishes on his workstation before his vacation in 1928. Greatbatch might not have invented the implantable pacemaker if he hadn’t accidentally installed the wrong resistor onto an oscilloscope in 1956. Van Gogh might not have painted “The Starry Night” or had as much emotional depth in his paintings if it was not because of his unique personality.Another key differentiator, at least for now, is understanding. As humans, we do not just recognize; we understand what we hear, see, or say. When AI labels a dog in an image, it does not understand the concept of a dog. Instead, it is simply recognizing cues associated with a dog image. As a result, subtle manipulations of an image, completely unnoticeable to human eyes, can cause AI to “see” and label, for example, a school bus image as an ostrich. For today’s AI algorithms, no matter how powerful they appear, their decisions or actions are based on pattern recognition, not true understanding. They are like the horse named “Clever Hans” from 1907 that solved arithmetic problems by reading his trainer’s cues without actually knowing the math.You might wonder, “Why bother asking or thinking about the differences between humans and machines.” One of my favorite quotes about AI is from researcher Pedro Domingos: “People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and they’ve already taken over the world.” Not yet, but they will if we let them.As the whole world rushes to jump on the AI bandwagon, it’s important to contemplate the long-term impact of AI adoption on our culture and society, and on human creativity and agency, especially those of our children. Otherwise, it will be another large-scale social experiment with many unintended consequences, similar to what happened when we rushed to hand our children smart devices with little parental control a decade ago.We live in an era in which machines are becoming more and more like humans while humans are becoming more and more like machines. As machines continue getting smarter, our last resort as humans may be our agency or conscience. Machines take actions not because they “want to” but because they are programmed to. We humans have the ability to choose what we want to do or what we believe is right or wrong to do. I hope these valuable traits that make us uniquely human will continue to prevail in the age of AI."
philinquirer_2024_15,"The iconic 76ers point guard and cultural icon says he wants to come back to Philly. He deserves a position in the organization, given everything he s meant to the city. So what’s the holdup?When the 76ers chose Allen Iverson astheir first-round draft pick in 1996— and when he, as a rookie,crossed over on Michael Jordan— I was only a glimmer in my parents’ eyes. When Iverson wasrunning Philadelphia (and the NBA , I was in diapers. When he first left Philly in 2006, I was still in elementary school, barely a baller myself.And yet, to me, Iverson is the definition of modern basketball, a Philadelphia miracle, a cultural icon that forever changed the game, and someone I always want around.Over the past few years, A.I. has kept saying he wants to come back to Philly towork for the 76ers, and I gotta wonder: What’s the holdup?Don’t the Sixers know that whenthe Answercalls, you … answer?To anyone willing to listen, A.I. has said he wants to be part of the team — saying as much to interviewers fromBleacher Reportand, most recently,Headliners. Not at point guard, please; he’s 48. But as an adviser, or if not an official coach, then a personal coach.“I get emotional talking about it, because I thought I should have been doing this, you know what I mean?” he told Headliners last year. “I look at other teams and I see former players, they’re just around. Anything that I have as a basketball savant, just use me.”I get it: He wants more than to just be a team alum who comes back for on-court waves and events. He wants a title. Validation that he meant something to this organization, and still means something. Let the 1997 Rookie of the Year talk to players who are having a hard time adjusting and share his on-court knowledge. Let us, his fans, bask in his presence and give him his props.He deserves that from us, and from the Sixers.Iverson is a national treasure, a trailblazer, and an innovator — come on, that crossover still makes highlight reels; my dad literally has thepicture of Iverson stepping over Ty Lueframed in our basement. He’s also a point of total Philly pride. Chicago had Jordan. Cleveland had LeBron James. Los Angelesclaimed Kobe Bryant. Iverson? He was all ours. In his heart, he says, he still is.So why won’t they hire him? To that question, a Sixers rep gave me a big, fat, “No comment.”The only reason I can think of for why Iverson is not already set up at the Wells Fargo Center is that we are talking about Allen Iverson. And the people in charge still don’t get him, still undervalue him, or, at least, undervalue what he means to most people in this city.Could it be that they are still afraid that Iverson is still too hip-hop, too “street,” too … Black?Yes, the Sixers have hadthree Black head coachessince Iverson left in 2006, but Iverson doesn’t like to play by the rules. And many people didn’t like that.Remember 2005, when former NBA Commissioner David Stern said players had to dress “business casual” — meaning, none of the aspects of Iverson’s trademark look: starter jerseys, hats (including durags over his signature cornrows , chains, pendants, medallions, sunglasses, headphones. Playersdecried the new rule as racist, and many felt it was targeted to Iverson. Remember when no one understood or respected the grief he was enduring, during hisinfamous 2002 speech about practice?That said, A.I. was not perfect by any means. Most people wouldn’t be, given how he wasborn to his rock star mom, Ann, when she was only 15. He was wrongfully convicted and did time after a bunch of teenagers got into a fight in a bowling alley. (Years later,he was pardoned, citing insufficient evidence of guilt. He partied. He drank. He hung out with Eve and publicly argued with his family and friends and coaches. He did not follow the script at press conferences. But even with that, he defied a blueprint; instead of stoically towing the company line, he shared his feelings, got emotional.» READ MORE:Allen Iverson wants to rejoin the Sixers organizationMany of us saw ourselves in him. We forgave him his sins because they were the sins a lot have been accused of, and that a lot of us would make in his position. We celebrated how he celebrated himself because he was also celebrating us. Hip-hopand Philly iconReuben “Big Rube” Harleyremains a friend. He talks to Ann Iverson a couple of times a month, and considers No. 3 “a man of the people,” he said. “When I first met him, he came down to Sharswood, 56th and Catharine, pulled up in his Bentley, got out, started playing hoops, rolling some dice.”Iverson identified with those of us who lived in the parts of the city others of us are afraid to drive through. He embraced us, fully, personally, and professionally.In doing this, he revolutionized basketball culture; he made a game dominated by Black players look and feel proudly Black. When theAthletic rated him No. 40out of the 75 most influential NBA players of all time, they wrote in 2021:Iverson is hip-hop. Not in the sense of the music genre so prevalent in modern society, but hip-hop in the sense of the culture and the people in it. The demographic that birthed the music as an expression of their largely oppressive experience. Iverson was an ambassador, is an ambassador, for this iteration of the ‘hood, a segment of the population systematically disregarded and disenfranchised that yet proved mighty enough to change the globe.“Mighty enough to change the globe.” And yet, the Sixers won’t give Iverson an office with his name on it.Iverson wants and deserves validation, reparations for how he was treated then, and acknowledgment that the people in charge didn’t respect him then, but we respect him and his culture — which comprises the most popular and imitated musical genre on the planet — now.“How many guys you know who drive around in a Rolls Royce in any neighborhood, beloved by everybody?” said Harley. “That was A.I. He put a smile on everybody’s face. He knows what city life is like.”The question is: Do the Sixers?Abigail Changis a writer and Southwest Philly native."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_222,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°Students are taught in civics class that, under the American justice system, a defendant may be convicted of a crime only if a jury finds him or her guilty of the charged offense “beyond a reasonable doubt.” What’s rarely mentioned, however, is that federal law allows judges to ignore a not guilty verdict and sentence men and women to prison for illegal activity of which they were acquitted.On Wednesday, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which establishes policies and practices for the federal courts, took a giant step toward ending this noxious practice — and the move is long overdue.Known as “acquitted conduct sentencing,” it has been federal policy for four decades. The concept gives federal judges the go-ahead to consider behavior for which the accused was found not guilty when sentencing that same defendant for crimes of which he was convicted.For instance, one high-profile case involved a teenager who was convicted of robbing an Indiana pharmacy but also found not guilty by a jury of killing one of his partners in crime. He received an enhanced sentence of nearly 20 years in prison because the judge determined, despite the jury verdict, that the teen was more likely than not to have been responsible for the death of his confederate.The issue now goes to Congress, which has never taken up the matter despite the introduction of several bipartisan legislative proposals that would have ended the practice.The use of acquitted conduct in criminal sentencing is antithetical to the Bill of Rights and incompatible with the cherished concept of a trial by jury. Congress should allow the commission’s reforms to become federal policy.—Las Vegas Review-Journal/TNS"
minnpost_2024_152,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.I once appeared (and tried a case before a judge who used a catchphrase as we lawyers attempted to impress the jury through the process of voir dire (jury selection .As we all got to know the prospective jurors — the 12 ordinary Americans who would sit as judges in a criminal case — he would recite this phrase: “Our system of justice (in America is the envy of the world.”As I listened, I thought his words verged upon being “corny” or overdone as American congratulatory rhetoric — for I, in my time as a trial lawyer and litigator, had seen too much injustice.I had seen judges sit looking down at plaintiffs in police brutality cases and at defendants in criminal trials as if they were from a segment of American society where this sense of “envy” was nonexistent.I had also seen these same defendants languish in pretrial custody — unable to make bail or conditional release. These same defendants were the ones who, if they had violated their bail conditions, would go back to custody to sit and await a trial.For them, our system did not seem to be the “envy” of the world or even of another era in history.These were the clients who used to proclaim with a kind of tragic naïveté that they also expected a “jury of their peers” at trial — only to soon learn that oftentimes the venire panel might have only a single minority race member — or none at all.For them — poor and Black and Native American and Brown defendants — our system of justice was unenviable. Indeed, it seemed bereft of basic fairness and any indicators of the possibility of real justice.But, Donald Trump never had to face any of these obstacles to obtaining justice when he was indicted and later faced trial and conviction before 12 ordinary Americans in a New York courtroom.Trump, who remained free throughout his period of conditional release — this despite proven violations of those conditions — faced a jury which undoubtedly looked like him — had a background like him — and constituted a veritable “jury of peers.”Perhaps that is why Defendant Donald J. Trump is so deeply angry today: he was found guilty 34 separate times by an actual jury of his peers — made up of 12 ordinary citizens who proved that young judge’s catchphrase: “Our American legal system is the envy of the world.”Goins lives in White Bear Lake."
leoweekly_2024_9,"When an employee is relieved of their duties, often the employer spins a narrative around that dismissal that makes it seem like it was the employee’s fault. Sometimes, it is the employee’s fault. Sometimes, the system of protecting the status quo, regardless of how wrong and toxic that environment is, takes precedence over the employee who was sacrificed to maintain it. This happens more if you are a person of color.Right now,Keisha Dorsey, the former deputy chief of staff for Mayor Craig Greenberg, is fighting this fight. She was fired from her job while on an approved medical leave. The city claims Dorsey was missing work, falsifying records, and other misconduct including what they called “dishonesty” — a very loaded phrase for Black women at work. Dorsey says there are systemic issues that have affected not only her but other female and minority employees throughout the city. Particularly, under the Greenberg administration.I think there is something to be said about that, as Greenberg seems to have had a rocky run as Louisville’s mayor so far. Greenberg has seen a fair share of ethics complaints about him, his wife and charges of nepotism and favoritism for his wealthy friends and their children. He’s received criticism from Metro Council and the public for his reneging on promises and working on bad policies with Republicans.Dorsey is being supported by local organizations who see a similar pattern to the treatment of Black and other women in positions of leadership.On Sunday night, in a panel held by the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Oppression, Kathleen Parks, the president of the National Action Network in Louisville had this to say,“It seemed to be just from my perspective, that there is a pattern here of women, especially Black women, that have been terminated from key positions, high profile positions.Parks also said that there was a similar pattern in terms of treatment and personnel practices in Dorsey s situation.The organization has put its support behind Dorsey.Like most of these firing cases, it is a matter of fingers pointing in either direction and folks lining up in alliance on either side.Who is right? That is something that may never be answered because what we have is one woman against a system built to protect itself. Even if it is found liable, it will still find a narrative to protect itself.What I do know is that as a Black woman in a white workplace, you are so often up against the whims, forces and perceptions of people who don’t know or understand who you are.Some years back when I began writing for LEO Weekly, I shared my own story of being let go from a job after a white woman, named Karen (y’all don’t know the giggles I’ve had since , turned on the faucet of phony tears to claim that I’d been harassing her when… I wasn’t. The idea of it is so antithetical to who I am and funny. White women in the workplace are often far more concerned about you than you would ever be about them. This woman had a definite pattern of harassment of me and other employees.Similar to Dorsey’s complaint, there had been a pattern of Black women and men being removed from their positions due to a random series of made-up offenses including dishonesty.If you’re a Black woman in the workplace, what you can’t do is just be regular and do your job. You may not be late. You may not be unhappy, sick or sad. You can’t dislike a coworker and avoid them. Basically, if you are a Black woman, you may not have any human emotion or response nor expect grace and compassion if you do.The force of the events that followed my own run-in with workplace Karen were at first nightmarish — being made to work in a room that was a supply/copy room, being called almost everything short of a welfare queen by a gaggle of snow chickens in a meeting where I had little chance to speak, and being asked to sign a document that was a complete fiction made up by the HR director. When I refused to sign, the abuse ramped up.Had I done anything different in my job before this? I finished my graduate degree, applied for a position of leadership that I was uniquely qualified for. In short, I stepped outside of their perceptions and became a “threat.”For me, this situation now looks so ridiculous, and the people involved so very pathetic that I laugh and thank them from afar for freeing me from that trainwreck to a much better, happier, and healthier life. Sometimes we don’t know that we’re being freed.In Dorsey’s complaints, she’s asked for an investigation of 33 other firings of female employees including that of former Police chief Erika Shields and interim acting police chief, Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel. Gender and racial discrimination in the workplace is still very much a concern and active.When I read this, I was reminded of my own when I cited several other Black people who were fired ahead of me. Like Dorsey, I filed complaints with little to no avail. Many of these committees hearing the complaints do little unless you’ve been called the “N” word on tape more than once.For Dorsey’s sake, I’d love to see her complaints result in a change. I’m not hopeful because I’ve seen it too many times before and when we talk about allyship and showing up for racial justice, there likely won’t be any change until those folks do this in the workplace and not just within the convenience and space of rallies or demonstrations.What I know is that for Black women the fight up the ladder of success is marred by barbs along the way. It is time for new rules, new organizations and new fights to make system-wide shifts. It is time for us to create these mechanisms because we can’t rely on ones that have been shaped by the very people holding the wheel of these businesses who continue to put white and male interests ahead of all others.

minnpost_2024_105,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Entry-level employers are still seeking employees. The good news is that there is a solution. The bad news is that employers aren’t using it.I am a job-seeker who is neurodivergent — meaning my brain doesn’t work in a typical way and processes information differently than most people. Some studies estimate that 15-20% of the population is the same way. Despite this, employers aren’t seeking us out.In my experience, job listings don’t commonly use the word ‘neurodiverse’ or ‘neurodivergent.’ Neurodiverse and neurodivergent seem to only appear in listings for professionals who would work with people who are neurodivergent. An example is a special education teacher.A United Kingdom study found that 40% of self-made millionaires are dyslexic. The founder of Kinkos, the founder of IKEA, various members of Shark Tank and Olympic champion swimmer Michael Phelps are all neurodiverse. People who are neurodiverse also make good employees.My fellow neurodiverse job candidates and I have had to do things differently throughout our lives. Some people solve problems by saying there has to be a better way. We have never had a choice. It’s who we are as human beings. This skill set is applicable in a workplace environment.Another benefit of being neurodiverse is the ability to leverage autonomy. In my experience, leadership benefits from employees who need less help. Traditional explanations and instructions haven’t always made sense to me. However, being allowed to adapt has been beneficial. Time to adapt equals autonomy. Autonomy equates to a better managerial experience. It’s a win for everyone.With that said, autonomy requires patience. It may take someone who is neurodiverse longer to complete tasks. They may complete them in a non-typical way. While beneficial, it can come across as rebellious. Being patient with this alternative approach can be understandably difficult. Humans don’t always respond calmly when outside their comfort zone. This is especially true when they are already dealing with the stress of managing employees.Employees who aren’t neurotypical can confuse others. My understanding is that being neurotypical means that your brain works in a more typical manner. People who are neurodivergent may speak or behave differently. Understanding how to interact with them can be confusing. For example, I have read that job interviews can be difficult for people who are uncomfortable making eye contact. Job training is another possible obstacle. The ultimate obstacle is finding something you can apply for.Looking for work isn’t normally fun or easy. People from all walks of life have trouble. Entry-level jobs aren’t what they used to be. For better or worse, things have shifted. The upside is that the economy has shifted from knowledge-based to skills-based. This can benefit some people who are neurodivergent. The downside for everyone who is neurodiverse is that getting your foot in the door is half the battle.Based on the job listings I have seen, many entry-level employers seem focused on filtering employees through training programs. The ones that don’t still seem focused on grouping employees under labels, such as a team member. I agree with the latter approach. The problem is that if you are neurodivergent, you likely have two options: apply with the hope that your managers understand your neurodiversity, or keep looking. Another option could be to do everything in your power to hide your neurodiversity.I physically look “normal” and when I talk, my voice sounds “normal.” However, there are things that I struggle with because of my neurodiversity. The upside for people who can hide their challenges is that they get to blend in. The downside is that when they struggle, it can confuse leadership.Not being able to be yourself is also another possible issue. The curse of being neurodivergent is that you struggle a lot with stuff. The gift is that there are things you are gifted at.In high school, I never got past middle school-level math and science. However, at the same time, I was able to take college-level English. If you are an employer seeking employees, you should list the words neurodivergent and/or neurodiverse in your listing. Being an inclusive workplace is part of it. The other part is that it could lead to you hiring someone with a unique perspective who is possibly gifted at something.Samuel Goldman lives in rural Minnesota. Like many people who are neurodiverse, he is searching for his next opportunity."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_275,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Months if not years in the making, a bipartisan bill in Washington seeks to speed up permitting for new energy infrastructure, which far too often today gets bogged down if not killed by exhausting regulatory processes and lawsuits. Here’s hoping the imperfect but worthy legislation isn’t bogged down or killed by the forces protecting the status quo, which far too often today carry the day in Congress.Anyone who claims to care about giving Americans plentiful access to affordable energy, including the renewable sources of power that will are absolutely essential to slowing the rapid rise in temperatures that’s threatening people and ecosystems across the planet, should be upset about the fact that, according to the federal energy department, 70% of the nation’s transmission lines are more than 25 years old. Old transmission lines squander energy. They make power outages and cyberattacks more likely. And perhaps most importantly, they drive up costs to consumers.It’s not just the wires that deliver the electricity; it’s the sources that produce it in the first place. To wean the country off carbon-emitting sources by 2035, the United States has to quadruple its annual deployment pace for solar and wind generation.Yet under rules that have only gotten more complex and cumbersome over the decades, America continues to move at a snail’s pace in rolling out energy infrastructure. As a late 2023 report by the World Economic Forum put it, “At the end of 2021 in the U.S., 79% of the wind pipeline was stuck in the permitting process versus the construction phase…There are also over 2,000 gigawatts of projects in the U.S. seeking connection to the grid, of which more than 95% is clean power technology.”As author Philip K. Howard has pointed out in these pages and elsewhere, infrastructure approvals can easily take decades — with costs rising and rising with each passing year of delay.The Trump administration took a crack at fixing the problem. The Biden administration, under which both oil and renewable production are at all-time highs, has also pushed for smoother and speedier permitting of clean energy projects— an agenda Republicans and some Democrats have resisted as an unfair thumb on the scale.The sweeping legislation co-authored by Republican John Barrasso and Democrat Joe Manchin, who’s made millions in the coal business, aims to speed up energy and infrastructure projects whether or not they emit fossil fuels. It would enable much faster modernization of the electric grid so that new sources, which are overwhelmingly renewable ones, can more easily deliver power to homes and businesses.Oil, gas and other fossil-fuel emitting industries won’t be on the outside looking in. The legislation would set a deadline for the Energy Department to decide whether to give gas export projects a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and would streamline the process for generating energy on public lands. It would expand both offshore oil drilling and offshore wind, and make it harder to tie up projects in endless lawsuits.The bill could use refinement — given what a huge threat climate change, we’d strongly prefer renewable sources to be prioritized — but it should nevertheless serve as the foundation for major reform that unsticks the permitting process and lets energy and economic progress accelerate.— New York Daily News"
philinquirer_2024_42,"Never before in our nation’s history have South Asian American women played such prominent roles in presidential politics. To me, that s powerful.By any measure, it’s been an extraordinary summer in presidential politics. Between theshooting of Donald Trump,Joe Biden’s exitfrom the campaign,Kamala Harris’ rise, and the selections ofJD VanceandTim Walzas their parties’ vice presidential nominees, it has been an unforgettable few months.Yet for me, a marker of this period, will remain an observation that grew to a full realization through the crescendo of a reverberating drumbeat in my mind: Indian American women have arrived.Never before in our nation’s history have two South Asian American women played such a prominent role in presidential politics — one, Harris, as the Democrat’s pick for commander in chief, and the other, Usha Vance, as the wife of Trump’s Republican running mate and a crucial partner in her husband’s rapid rise.As a South Asian American of Indian descent and a daughter of immigrants, seeing women who share my background playing such pivotal roles in the presidential election is powerful. Whereas others have focused on fraught discussions of“DEI hires”and when someone started“becoming Black,”I see first-generation Americans taking the opportunities their parents struggled to give them and advancing to the national stage in the span of a few decades through determination, excellence, and accomplishment.As daughters of immigrants, Kamala Harris and Usha Vance were handed the batons their families carried as they came to the United States and bravely stepped into the unknown. And, in their own ways, both of those women took their batons, ran — and then flew. They embody the spirit of the American dream.In actuality, South Asian Americans have been a part of this entire presidential campaign period as both Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, earlier Republican candidates, are also first generation Americans of Indian descent.The three of them (Harris, Vance, and Ramaswamy have South Indian origins, a nuance that is notable perhaps only to other Indians, as the more commonly known foods, clothes, traits, and celebrations in the U.S. are often from North Indian culture.In fact, I was surprised to learn that Ramaswamy was from Kerala, the same Indian state as my family, and immediately texted my father to ask if he knew this. His comically curt response, “No. He brings no honor to the diaspora,” perfectly illustrates our shared belief that no matter how one looks or where one comes from, it’s the actions, values, integrity and track record that we scrutinize, especially in those for whom we might cast a vote.Like mine, the stories of Kamala Harris, Usha Vance, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy are neither rags to riches nor completely self-made.Each comes from middle-class families in India, the largest democracy in the world; each are the product of highly educated parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents, whose careers included new discoveries and creating new knowledge as researchers and scholars, caring for and healing countless patients and families as physicians, and educating and empowering generations of children and young adults as teachers and educators, among others.Their trajectories began from the privilege brought by education, knowledge, awareness, and belief in unending possibilities — that which beckons with the notion that nothing is impossible if you work for it, but nothing is entitled.A look across many major industries shows people of South Asian descent in key leadership positions in the U.S. and around the world.A review done in 2024 showed thelargest cohort of nonwhite CEOs in the U.S. were Asian/Indian. In the last decade or so, leaders of Indian descent broke into lists such as CEOs of Fortune 500, Forbes richest people in the world, New York Times bestsellers, and theGroup of Seven (G7 in greater numbers than ever before.A review done in 2024 showed the largest cohort of non-white CEOs in the U.S. were Asian/Indian.Whether business, engineering, journalism and media, computer science, law, medicine, education, entrepreneurship, literature, film, and a variety of STEM fields, people of South Asian descent have made their indelible mark, their presence known and their voices heard. A visible cohort has been promoted through broad recognition of their expertise and leadership acumen, setting the precedent to normalize South Asians in those echelons — although women still lag.A look closer to home, in the academic medical arenas of Philadelphia, doesn’t paint the same picture. Consistent with my own experiences as a physician, others have written before about thelack of diversity among the high tiers of Philadelphia’s medical colleges and hospitals.South Asians, or people of South Asian descent, are not a minority in the world of medicine; in fact,Indian ethnicity makes up the largest subgroupof Asian applicants to medical school, which is in itself the second most represented race/ethnicity group, behind white people, of all medical school applicants andactive physicians in the U.S.Yet studies have shown that despite making up a significant proportion of academic physicians and faculty, Asianswere far less likely to be promoted to leadership positions, less likely to receiveequitable grant funding, including the prestigiousNational Institute of Health R01 grants, or be recognized by national academies and medical speciality associations.It has been postulated that the characteristics that lend to the “model minority” trope — hardworking, quiet, assimilating, goal-oriented — are the same reason they are overlooked for leadership roles or have“the everyday experience of exclusion and invisibility.”The attributes that lend to the “model minority” trope — hardworking, quiet, assimilating, goal-oriented — may be the same reason some Indian Americans are overlooked for leadership roles.In Philadelphia, chairs across academic medicine are a largely homogenous group in place for decades. The birthplace of American medicine has not reflected the changing demographics of its brethren in its leaders, and instead train their gaze to physicians who are “more academic” or who are perceived as having “gravitas” — code words commonly used that effectively exclude applicants who are not white.The existing medical power structures are apparently comfortable with the anchored perspective of Eurocentric patriarchal leadership they perpetuate rather than widening their views to the qualities, skill sets, and competencies that would propel toward future and sustained success. Ironically, for me and many Asian American women like me, we seem to have been penalized for not complying with the “quiet and meek” Asian stereotype, instead beingwilling to use our voiceswhen we get to the table.Ileft that worldbecause I felt its limitations for my missions and goals — reflected in the words of Amanda Gorman: “And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us.” I chose to look and explore beyond and saw representation reflected in the problem solvers of our time — the ones who dare step into the arena, ask probing questions, poke the status quo, willing to speak truth to power, and work for benefit beyond their own.More and more, when I look up, I see others of South Asian descent — particularly Indian American women — who advocate for themselves and others, who lean in with curiosity to listen and learn, who use their knowledge and expertise to influence, build partnerships, develop collaborations and bring others along, and who have the courage to always push for better, in themselves and the systems around them.Kamala Harris, Usha Vance, and Nikki Haley and have made it possible for me, and generations of South Asian American women and girls,including my incredible nieces, coming behind me, to realize and boldly declare: I look like a leader.Priya E.

The fact is Minnesota landfills are running out of space, and we are missing easy opportunities to conserve resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.But this doesn’t have to be the case. There is significant work underway to keep more valuable resources in use by optimizing recycling systems.Eureka Recycling, a leading nonprofit recycling organization, is a longstanding player in driving Minneapolis toward material circularity. Every day, its materials recovery facility captures an average of 400 to 450 tons of recyclable materials from the Twin Cities and surrounding areas. Those materials are sold to producers so they can be remade into new products — creating a circular economy for recyclables. The more efficient the recycling system is, the more resources we conserve, the less new material we use, and fewer emissions enter the atmosphere.But continued efficiency and convenience require investment and collaboration. That’s where the private sector can make a difference.To support Eureka in advancing its industry-leading work to reduce waste, American Beverage partnered with Closed Loop Partners, a firm at the forefront of building the circular economy, to lend millions of dollars to support state-of-the-art upgrades to modernize Eureka’s facility. The more than $10 million loan from Closed Loop Partners’ catalytic capital group includes $3 million from American Beverage and the Minnesota Beverage Association. Alongside the loan, the Recycling Partnership provided a grant to support this project. The financing will fund new, highly efficient optical sorters to separate materials and increase what’s being remade into new products.This type of collaboration is what’s needed to ensure all materials that can be remade are remade. That’s why America’s leading beverage companies, with Closed Loop Partners and The Recycling Partnership, have marshaled the equivalent of $400 million throughthe Every Bottle Back initiativeto improve recycling systems. Every Bottle Back advances public and private projects in communities across the country that modernize infrastructure, improve technology and educate consumers.For the non-alcoholic beverage industry, supporting Eureka means more of our fully recyclable plastic bottles and aluminum cans can be remade — as intended. Every year, the facility upgrades will generate an estimated 222 more tons of recycled PET plastic for new bottles and an additional 248 tons of recycled aluminum for new cans. Making more of these containers out of recycled material reduces the use of new plastic and aluminum in bottles and cans and keeps them out of landfills — where they were never intended to be.The impact of these partnerships is even greater when supported by good recycling policy, like Minnesota’s recently enacted Packaging Waste and Cost Reduction Act. American Beverage, Closed Loop Partners, Eureka and other private and nonprofit groups supported this law because it establishes a true Extended Producer Responsibility program for packaging. Once up and running, Minnesota’s EPR system will increase access to recycling, create local jobs and save municipalities money.Reducing waste and improving recycling in this country is possible. It is happening right now in Minnesota with investments like ours and with well-designed material collection and processing systems. And we can get farther faster by working across sectors to drive solutions.Megan Daum is vice president for sustainability at the American Beverage Association.

minnpost_2024_79,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Waste across Hennepin County is collected and then burned at the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center (HERC in north Minneapolis. How much, you might ask? About 1,000 tons of trash per day for the past 35 years. What’s left? Metric tons of ash, toxic airborne chemicals, and sick citizens.The HERC is one of thelargest point source air polluters in the county, emitting an alarming amount of nitrogen oxides (first in county , mercury (first in county , sulfur dioxide (second in county , carbon dioxide (third in county , and lead (third in county . This air pollution causes adverse health outcomes like respiratory and cardiovascular issues, the cost of which is estimated to be roughly$16 million annuallywhen factoring for hospital admissions, asthma incidences, and lost work days. The lives lost cannot be priced. The HERC is situated next to the northside“green zone”in Minneapolis — a designation given to neighborhoods with high levels of environmental pollution and racial, political, and economic marginalization.The HERC, along with other facilities such as theRoof Depot site,Smith Foundry, andBituminous Roadways, all reflect a pattern of a corrupt and inequitable system that placesindustrial manufacturing and chemical plantsin the neighborhoods of low-income BIPOC communities. Shutting down the HERC represents a larger call for environmental justice, a fight that overburdened communities have been leading for decades.Hennepin County invokes environmental justice as the core of its mission, but has very little to show for it. TheHennepin County Zero Waste PlanandClimate Action Planprioritize the importance of environmental justice and identify how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities. The Climate Action Plan states,“If we do not act boldly, climate change will progressively worsen the disparities in health, housing, and income that communities of color are already experiencing,” and claims “the county looks forward to convening partners to further develop action plans for strategies, pursue collaborations for greater impact, and raise a collective voice for climate policy.” However, the County’s efforts to solicit community input for their HERC closure plan have been sorely lacking.Just last week, the county put forth a resolution toextend the HERC operator’s contract until 2033, which was slated to expire at the end of 2025. The county approved the extension on Tuesday, offering no real opportunity for public comment. On Oct. 24 of last year, Hennepin County Commissioners passed aresolutiondirecting the county administrator to develop a plan for the closure of the HERC facility between 2028 and 2040. Theplan, which was released to the public on Feb. 1, outlines the “highest impact zero waste actions” the county can take — closing the HERC is not among them. The county’s stance is clear: they want to achieve zero waste,thenshut down the HERC. And they continue to kick the can down the road, claiming there are “a significant number of legislative changes that need to take place before closure.”The county’s lack of urgency and failure to commit to a closure date has driven the creation ofThe People’s HERC Transition Plan, which was developed by Zero Waste USA with extensive input from community members and local experts. The People’s Plan demonstrates that “shutting down HERC is doable, and it can be replaced by a better Zero Waste system.” This 98-page plan details how the county can take advantage of federal funds and state programs, while creating over 1,000 new jobs and achieving 75% waste reduction by 2030. Continuing HERC operations, however, will add an estimated $65 million in repair and upgrade costs, and over $460 million in annual operating costs by 2040, to a facility that has already accrued over $37 million in debt since 2012.Operations and maintenance costs typically increase as plants age and their performance decreases. We should not continue to dump millions of dollars into a facility that is a hazard to public health, and that isfive to 10 years past its life expectancy. Incinerator plants are only meant to last25 to 30 years, and the county’s timeline assumes that the HERC is fit to operate for over half-a-century, if we are to wait until 2040 to shut it down. We should look to cities like Detroit,which shut down its trash burner in 2019. Since then, Michigan’s recycling rate has hit a record high,increasing seven percentage pointsfrom 2019 to 2022.We cannot allow our northside communities to continue breathing in trash for up to 16 more years. The county should take its own advice and act boldly. Shutting down the HERC isnecessaryto achieve zero waste, and should be the lynchpin on which a viable zero waste plan hinges. Anything less is lip service and empty rhetoric. Burning trash in our backyard is no way to live.Joshua Anderson studied climate science at the University of Washington, Seattle, and got his master’s degree in energy policy at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_92,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Tuesday, Hunter Biden was convicted by a Delaware federal jury on three felony counts related to his purchase of a firearm in 2018. This trial and conviction is how things are supposed to work.His guilt hinged on whether Biden was being honest when he answered on the federal gun purchase form that he was not addicted to or using illegal drugs. His lawyers had argued that Biden had completed a rehabilitation program and did not think of himself as an addict at the time he completed the form. The prosecution argued he was lying, and the jury thought this to be a more plausible explanation, which seems fair.You’ll notice who was not part of this sequence of events: Joe Biden, who at the 2018 time of this crime was not in government and not involved in his son’s very bad decision-making apart from giving him the support we should all want families to provide those in recovery. This certainly won’t matter to the political operatives who will try to paint this as all but the president’s direct responsibility, but the repetition doesn’t make it true.Congressional Republicans were unable to find any nexus between the then-vice president and his son’s business dealings in Ukraine and elsewhere, collapsing the incredibly flimsy impeachment inquiry they’d been pursuing, but there’s no chance they’ll let this go.President Joe Biden, predictably, says he “accepts the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.” He also ruled out any presidential pardon for his wayward son. It was the correct reaction for a president.This is a decidedly different response to a legitimate unanimous jury guilty verdict in a legitimate criminal prosecution than what happened with Donald Trump’s reaction to his own trial and verdict in Manhattan.The Department of Justice is following the rules, as did the judge and the jury of 12 Delawareans. It’s all very normal, but for the fact it’s the president’s son in the dock, which is why there was a special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to make sure that the prosecution proceeded independently, as it did.As things move to sentencing, Hunter must receive nothing more and nothing less than the average defendant in his position, which is to say a first-time offender convicted of a few nonviolent felonies.That may well mean that he receives some prison time or none at all. Both would be legitimate, even though no prison may be received in some quarters as the result of some politically-captured judge, ignoring of course that Judge Maryellen Noreika was appointed by Trump. Hunter faces another federal case in California in September as his legal woes mount.Meanwhile, the House GOP continues its push to hold Garland in contempt for not providing audio recordings that the other special counsel, Robert Hur, made with his interviews with President Biden, despite already having the transcripts of this inquiry that notably did not lead to Hur recommending charges in the mishandled classified documents probe. In that investigation, the process also worked, without fear or favor. That’s the American way, to show respect for our principles of law and due process.— New York Daily News/TNS"
philinquirer_2024_39,"I came to the U.S. as an undocumented child. Dreamers like me have gone to school, started families, paid taxes, and built businesses. Now, as DACA turns 12, all that could be taken away.As someone whogrew up undocumentedin the U.S., I understand all too well the pain of living in the shadows and the stress caused by that kind of endlessuncertainty. I havespoken outmany timesover the yearsabout theurgent needto protect “Dreamers,” people who were brought to the United States as children and have lived here for nearly all their lives.I was so thrilled on June 15, 2012, whenPresident Barack Obama establishedthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA program, which let Dreamers work and avoid deportation. These are the kinds of protections I dreamed of as a child, which give a new generation of Dreamers the ability to build lives for themselves in the only country they have ever known.The program has been a tremendous success. Today, there are more than 500,000 DACA recipientsliving and thrivingin the U.S., and more than a million U.S. citizens share a household with a DACA recipient. These are people who have gone to school, started families, paid taxes, and built businesses. They’re people who have deep roots in their local communities.But all that could be ripped away.All that could be ripped away.Two years ago, on the10th anniversary of DACA, I urged Congress to protect Dreamers by passing theDream and Promise Act, which offers a path to permanent resident status. But the bill remains stalled in Congress. Now, as I write on the 12th anniversary, I fear this may be the last one.The Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals iscurrently considering a challengeto the legality of the DACA program, and no matter how it rules, the question is likely to be ultimately resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.If the program is overturned, it will have a devastating effect on millions of families who will once again find themselves in the kind of limbo I grew up with. I would never wish thaton anyone.Upending the lives of so many families who simply want to live in the country they have always considered home would not only be a moral stain on our country but would weaken the communities we all call home.» READ MORE:As child of the ‘American experiment,’ I believe we can do better for Dreamers | OpinionThe average DACA recipient haslived in this countryfor 25 years. There aremore than 300,000 DACA recipients who are working, many in critical, understaffed fields like education and medicine, and they are the parents of more than 300,000 U.S. citizen children. To deny them a pathway to citizenship is not just needlessly cruel, it’s cutting off our own nose to spite our face.Protecting these families is clearly a moral imperative, but it’s also incredibly popular. Polls haveconsistently shownthat voters arestrongly in favorof providing paths to legal status for DACA recipients, with approval numbers above 70%. It is also popular with a clear majority of Republican voters. There is simply no good reason, political or otherwise, why we shouldn’t allow Dreamers to formally call this country home.When President Obama introduced DACA, he said: “These are young people who study in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they’re friends with our kids, they pledge allegiance to our flag. They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.”If Congress won’t act, then President Joe Biden has the opportunity to cement his own legacy as a president who looks out for the most vulnerable among us. Using his executive powers, he could provide protections for millions of other undocumented Americans, such as themore than 800,000undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens.For instance, he can offer a form of parole or legal protection that allows undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens to legally remain and work in the country while their cases are processed.The president can also update existing programs that would allow immigrant parents of U.S. citizen children with disabilities to get on a path to citizenship. These are all husbands, wives, mothers, and fathers of American citizens who fear losing their loved ones because of outdated laws and senseless bureaucracy. President Biden can change that and keep American families together.President Biden has rightlycriticized former President Donald Trumpfor his cruel policies of separating families at the border, but family separations don’t just happen at our borders. It’s also important not to overlook the families with deep roots here who have to live in constant fear that they will be taken away from the ones they love most.We need to live up to the promise of America by protecting those who, like I once was, are forced tolive invisible lives.America is at its best when it is compassionate and welcoming. These qualities are what make us worthy of being a “city upon a hill” that can serve as a shining example to the rest of the world.Gisele Barreto Fettermanis a firefighter, the founder of multiple nonprofits, the former second lady of Pennsylvania, and thewife of U.S. Sen.

Agree or disagree? Let’s see or find out.Parents play a significant role in the success (or failure of their children. If parents are responsible members of society, there’s no doubt their children will become responsible citizens, too.Parenting is related to the issue of love and marriage or loving relationships between (consenting adults. It doesn’t only deal with rearing and caring for children and providing them with their basic needs but also involves love, commitment to and protection, education and responsibility of children—moral, financial, emotional—such that they become lawful, useful and productive members of society.Good parenting contributes to well-being, personal growth and development, and overall community/nation-building. It involves and employs useful knowledge, skills, and education.Question to all, especially parents and grandparents: When does parenting stop? Or is it endless? Does it start the moment you married the (future mother of your child/ren to the moment your faculties falter you?Why did I bring this topic up, you ask? Well, it’s paradoxical that, at times, we love or like to interfere with the lives, and even the affairs, of our (close family members and others’ lives to the point that we get involved and eventually become influential to them. Nothing wrong with that, huh?We, parents, do our best to love and care for our children. The fact is, we’re so protective of them. We want the best for them and their future. That’s why we give them or provide them with their basic necessities in life like food, clothing, safe, decent shelter, including a good, decent education (public or best private education we can possibly afford financially. In short, we want them to be better in the future (if not the best than we were. We want them to be happy and successful in life.Now, you ask, what is your definition of success? Do you equate it with material wealth? What does success have to do with parenting? Is there a connection or correlation between the two? Of course, there is. Ask those experts and they’ll tell you.When does parenting stop? Honestly, as I see it, and based on my experience and observation of other parents, I tend to believe that parenting doesn’t end, especially if the relationships (between parents and grandparents and their (grand children are mutually exclusive. It will only end when you’re breathless, I guess.Good, responsible parenting is needed and important if we want to have a society that’s just, fair and orderly, peaceful and progressive.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_127,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°Donald Trump has made history in many ways over the last several years, most of it very bad. He was the first president in U.S. history to have entered the office without any prior public office or military experience. He is the first president to have ever been impeached twice, and certainly the first to have openly and explicitly attempted to subvert the peaceful transfer of power to his successor. For all his transgressions, at least Richard Nixon resigned.Now, Trump crosses another threshold, as the first president in history to have been criminally convicted of a felony, and one related to his presidential campaign to boot. After two days of deliberation, a jury of 12 Manhattanites has delivered a guilty verdict on all 34 counts brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, involving Trump’s falsification of business records to conceal his hush money payment to Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election.Next, the ex-president will be sentenced, and could well become the first former president to serve time behind bars, another first for this disreputable man.We can’t say that the conviction lands with the satisfaction of one that centered on his effort to overturn the election, or even his willful retention of classified records. Those processes, at the federal level and in Georgia, have been stalled by a mixture of judicial deference or outright obsequiousness — as is the case with Florida Federal Judge Aileen Cannon’s numerous delay tactics — and some prosecutorial timidity and incompetence, as with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ misguided decision to have a relationship with her appointed special prosecutor.Those cases are easier to explain, flashier and involve issues that are much more fundamental to Trump’s danger to democracy. We hope to see them advance, even if it seems very unlikely at this stage that any of them will progress substantially before the November election. Yet the conviction that Bragg has secured is no less a real crime, exhaustively documented and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It happened, and Trump is being held to account, something that has all too rarely happened in his life.This might seem like small potatoes to some people, but the truth is, had Trump been made to respond to every one of his transgressions short of taking aim at American democracy itself, throughout his decades as a con man, swindler, sexual predator and overall reprobate, we probably wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with. Accountability would have neutralized him much earlier on, and now who knows if it will stop him.We can’t promise that this will change things, that it will expose Trump or finally derail his efforts to get back in the White House. Some observers think it will help, and indeed Trump has used every opportunity to use this trial as a campaign venue, painting himself as a victim of political persecution.It was not the job of the courts or the jury to game out the electoral consequences, which could go either way. But at the end of the day, if we don’t have a system that can force someone, even a former president, to answer for clearly breaking the law, we don’t have a system at all.—New York Daily News/TNSIn presidential fundraising these days, the donors who matter most are the very small and the very, very big.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.GLENDALE, Ariz. — One of the most attention-grabbing days of Robert F.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_259,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°After harrowing ordeals wrongly detained in Russian prisons, 16 people were freed in exchange for eight Russian prisoners held in the United States, Slovenia, Poland, Norway and Germany.The multinational deal includes the release of Americans Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter convicted last month of spurious espionage charges after a year already imprisoned; Paul Whelan, a Marine veteran jailed in 2018 after traveling to a friend’s wedding; Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, arrested in 2023; and U.S. resident Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post columnist and opposition politician.We must also commend the U.S. government for working to secure the release not only of American citizens and an American resident, but nationals of other countries also improperly held, including three who were Russian themselves and had formed part of opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s team.Navalny himself should have been among them, but unfortunately he died early this year at an Arctic prison while serving his own sentence on trumped-up charges. Or rather, it’d be more accurate to say he was killed by the Kremlin, either through some sort of direct means or indirect but equally deadly intentional medical neglect.Let all that be a reminder that even though prisoners were swapped in both directions, what Russia was punishing were not crimes but acts of civil society, including the performance of journalism, political organization and free expression, particularly in opposition to Vladimir Putin’s horrific war in Ukraine.Those released from Western prisons at Putin’s insistence included an assassin convicted of murdering a Chechen separatist in Germany, an intelligence officer suspected of funneling U.S. military technology to Russia and a hacker convicted of breaking into more than 500 businesses. This follows the release of the “Merchant of Death,” arms trafficker Viktor Bout, in a December 2022 prisoner exchange for WNBA player Brittney Griner.We should all be glad that Russia has released these political prisoners, but we must acknowledge that these swaps do carry the consequence of showing the Putin and his cronies that they can get back Russian nationals serving prison sentences in the U.S. and elsewhere if they nab random Americans or Europeans on falsified or heavily inflated charges.In an earlier era, Putin would have perhaps thought twice about deploying this strategy. But now that he’s entirely torched any remaining credibility with his unwarranted invasion and the war crimes committed therein, he’s got little left to lose from these tactics.The solution here can’t be to just accept that and let him succeed at shutting down dissent or the ability of foreigners to operate in Russian territory, though it probably means that Americans and Europeans in particular should take greater care about the prospect of traveling to the despot’s land. He must be isolated on the world stage, hit with economic, legal and political consequences.The U.S. and allies should continue to support the aspects of Russian civil society that haven’t been swamped by Putin’s machine. He remains popular in Russia in part due to relentless propaganda and the lack of any alternative visions or political projects. But he can’t keep this up forever.— New York Daily NewsSomething incredible happened four years ago. People suddenly realized that my grocery store co-workers and I are essential.

minnpost_2024_129,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.The two leading presidential candidates are set to debate on live television on Thursday, June 27. Neither will yet be the official nominee of his party, which is expected to happen at the parties’ conventions in the coming weeks.The timing of the debate — on the Thursday leading into the week of the Fourth of July, far earlier than the usual fall debates — virtually guarantees a muchsmaller audiencethan wouldusually watch a presidential debate.The event itself will be unlike most previous debates between presidential candidates, though it will be broadcast live on several TV channels and online, as is the norm.It is sponsored and hosted by CNN, not by the nonpartisanCommission on Presidential Debates, which has sponsored every presidential debate since 1988. Thedebate rulessay there will be no audience — the candidates will be in a television studio with just the moderators and production personnel. During the two commercial breaks, the candidates will not be allowed to interact with their campaign staff. CNN will mute the microphone of each candidate when it is not his turn to speak.As a former political communications consultant who now teachespolitical communication at Auburn University, I believe there are key ways this new type of debate, at a different place and time than usual, could affect the presidential election.Historically, debates tend to have greater effects on the outcome of elections when one of the candidates says or does something stupid.For instance, in 1976 GOP candidate and then-President Gerald Ford insisted, wrongly, thatPoland wasn’t under Communist rule. In 1988, Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis answered a question about his wife’s safety with adispassionate speech on drug policy. In 1992, PresidentGeorge H.W. Bush repeatedly looked at his watchwhile debating Bill Clinton.All three men lost their races for the White House.Both candidates in the June 27 debate have weaknesses that could lead to similar problems — or worse.If Biden appears lost or confused at any point in the debate, it could raisequestions about his competenceand seriously hurt his chances for reelection. If Trump launches intoone of his tirades about any number of subjects, he could frighten moderates into voting for Biden or not voting at all.Because neither political party has held its nominating conventions, it is not out of the question that a very poor showing by either candidate could lead to serious discussions aboutreplacing that candidate as the party’s nominee.The rules for the debate create some challenges and opportunities for each candidate.The fact that microphones will be muted for the candidate who isn’t being asked a question should make it easier for Biden to stay focused and on message without being constantly interrupted by Trump, as he was when they debated in 2020. It should also make it easier for Trump to appear more like a statesman and less like a bully, since television audiences will be less likely to hear any interruptions or outbursts.CNN’s moderators face the challenge of managing the speaking times and microphones in a way that does not appear to favor one candidate over the other.Ideally, with no live audience to react to the candidates, viewers’ attention should be more easily focused on the substance of the candidates’ words.Whether that happens will depend on the moderators. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash need to be careful not to appear to interrupt or challenge one candidate more than another. Many conservatives are alreadysuspicious that CNN will show favor to Bidenby asking him fewer follow-up questions or doing more on-the-spot fact-checking of Trump’s responses.With fewer viewers in real time, there will be more opportunities for partisans to put their post-debate spin on what happened, both in traditional media and online.Spin doctors are not new to presidential debates, but with fewer people having seen the full event in context, there will be more opportunity forselectively editing clipsby the right to make Biden appear dazed and confused or by the left to show Trump as a bigot and a bully.Even if the intent of a debate is for the candidates’ words to matter most, what carries a debate in the public’s eye is not the wise policy discussion or the nuanced diplomacy: It’s the sound bite.Examples include Ronald Reagan’s quip about not making an issue ofWalter Mondale’s youth and inexperiencein 1984 and Lloyd Bentsen’s “Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy” reply to Dan Quayle’s 1988 assertion that he had as much experience in the Senate as John F. Kennedy had before becoming president.The single advantage of the June 27 debate is that it gives both campaigns the chance to test their candidates and messages while very few voters are paying attention. This could allow the campaigns to adjust their messages or — if things go terribly, horribly wrong — even letting the partychoose another candidate.Susan Fillippeliis a senior lecturer in communication at Auburn University.This article is republished from The Conversation."
philinquirer_2024_81,"While politics may be a headache for platforms to deal with, social media sites have an ethical obligation to protect civil discourse.In late March, I awoke to the news that Instagram, perhaps the biggest social media platform for young people in the United States, wouldautomatically limit recommending political content to usersunless they proactively opt in.As someone who has spent most of my career focused on engaging young people in the political process, this decision was deeply troubling. But perhaps what was more troubling was the shocking lack of coverage and outrage on this wildly consequential decision. While many were preoccupied with theproposed forced sale of TikTok, Instagram’s policy went quietly under the radar. Yet this ill-timed decision will likely have disastrous consequences for speech online, and the future of our democratic process.I am an organizer in Pennsylvania in my early 20s, and Instagram has been the single most useful tool for engaging with young people in politics. Compared to platforms like TikTok, users on Instagram largely decide what they see in their feed. This has led to the rise of local networks in which information can be distributed to members of a community, rather than to everyone on the platform. Using this, organizers can share information, highlight upcoming gatherings, and give important updates to just those following them.But to organizers, the primary benefit that Instagram offers is that it is themost popular social media platform of its kind for young adults. It is where most young people my age interact, discuss issues, and most importantly,get their news. Politicians need young people to vote, and cutting out social media threatens the youth vote.Politics is a messy business, and platforms have historically struggled with regulating political speech on their websites. While users can ostensibly post whatever they want, nearly all online platforms have guidelines on what constitutes acceptable speech on their sites. Meta — the parent company of Instagram — has content moderation guidelines that have been well-documented as particularly labyrinthian,taking context into account in some regards, and not others. This leads to seemingly disjointed and convoluted outcomesthat have made them no friends on Capitol Hill.Over the years, Meta has been at the center of numerous political scandals,from Cambridge Analyticato theremoval of Donald Trumpfrom the platform. In the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel,Meta has been accused of censorshipand promoting misinformation from both sides of the political spectrum on posts relating to the ongoing war in Gaza.Hosting a functioning public forum necessitates a commitment toward moderation, limiting the spread of misinformation, and ensuring that bad actors stay off the platform, all of which requires a whole lot of effort — something that tech companies seem increasingly disinclined to do.Thus, in recent years, platforms have begun to disincentivize news and political content. In 2016, YouTubewas widely criticized for demonetizing contentthat was primarily focused on the news or political discourse. This led to many creators whose content was based in these subjects to find alternative revenue streams or pivot the type of content they made.After launching Threads in 2023, Meta also revealed thattheir site would avoid political and news-related content, much to the disappointment of many Twitter users eager to leave the platformafter the Elon Musk buyout. This change in Instagram’s policy toward political content suggests a continued reluctance of companies like Meta to continue to allow and promote political content on their platform.I do not envy Meta’s position here. Maintaining political speech on a platform is difficult and thankless work. But the idea that we can easily return to a prelapsarian world where these platforms are exclusively for cute animal photos and targeted ads is a fantasy we cannot tolerate.While politics may be a headache for platforms to deal with, I argue that as proprietors of the largest channels of public discourse, social media sites do in fact have an ethical obligation to protect civil discourse, and a failure to do so is a dereliction of this duty.Imagine if bars and cafés forbade discussing current events, or if news outlets no longer felt it was worth the money and hassle to cover politics. What use would our freedom of speech be in a world where we had no venue to discuss the issues that matter most?Our democracy was conceived and founded in bars and meetinghouses,“third places”outside of home and work in which people could meet on neutral ground and discuss the issues of their time. In the last few decades,these places have gradually begun to disappear. Without them, future generations have fewer and fewer places to meet and discuss politics, with social media partly filling the gap left behind.While social media is certainly not the only solution to this issue,in a world where people are gradually becoming more isolated, the role it plays in maintaining our political life has only grown, and thus the responsibility of platforms has grown as well.Pennsylvania is a key swing state in November’s presidential election, and I am concerned that this trend will work to diminish youth engagement in the political process. At a time whenless than half of young Americans plan on voting in the general election, we cannot sit by and allow this attempt by platforms like Meta to skirt their responsibilities by depoliticizing the internet.Jacob Fuller is an activist, policy writer and organizer based in Philadelphia.

eugeneweekly_2024_30,"We ve got issues. I wonder, in the history of Oregon state government, has there ever been a bigger mismatch than the Oregon Liquor Control Commission overseeing the newly legalized cannabis industry? Has there ever been another state agency less prepared to carry out its role? There was a lot of news last year about one Oregon cannabis company, La Mota, and its owners, Rosa Cazares and Aaron Mitchell. They donated money to Democrats in Oregon, including Gov.Tina Kotek and then Labor Commissioner (now Congresswoman Val Hoyle. They hired Secretary of State Shemia Fagan as a consultant for $10,000 per month. Fagan lost her job, and her political career, as a result. While they were courting political favors in Salem with cash, La Mota had over $7 million in state and federal tax liens, lawsuits by employees for unpaid wages and from vendors for unpaid bills. Apparently, their licenses to sell pot in Oregon were never in jeopardy regardless of the failure to pay taxes or employees. OLCC either didn’t know, or just didn’t care, or was powerless to do anything. I seem to recall one of the arguments for legalizing pot was that it would generate tax revenue and jobs. But that only happens if the pot industry actually pays taxes and wages. In 2018, an OLCC inspector stumbled onto50 pounds of unlabeled, untracked La Mota cannabis in a warehousein White City, 40 miles from the California border. Even OLCC could deduce the pot was destined to be “diverted and shipped to an illicit market” by La Mota. La Mota got a ticket from OLCC and fought it for two years. They eventually paid a $16,000 fine. La Mota’s licenses to sell pot were never in jeopardy, and its taxes still went largely unpaid. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. It’s obvious that the OLCC is not capable of managing the cannabis industry. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry, mostly cash. It’s totally out of OLCC’s league. What a huge mistake it was to put pot under the guidance of the whiskey-drinking good ‘ol boys at the OLCC. They should go back to doing what they do best —diverting expensive whiskey to friends and colleagues of the director— and get out of the pot business altogether. In the early 1980s, Oregon actor Dick Curtis starred in a wonderfulBlitz-Weinhard beer commercialas an Oregon state trooper intercepting beer from California. The commercial featured a Schludwiller Beer truck and the tagline “Where you boys going with all that beer?” The hapless drivers would respond “There is too much beer in California, so we are taking it to Oregon.” The final shot is of the truck heading back to California. I offer the following with apologies to Mr. Curtis, who passed away in 2023: The big 18-wheeler, loaded with pot, is rolling down the Oregon highway towards the California border. With little to fear from the OLCC, the truck is decorated with brightly painted cannabis leaves. Why hide it when no one seems to care? From the rear, a siren, then multi-colored flashing lights and rotating gumball lights. An “AH-OO GAH” horn blares. One of the drivers asks the other, “What’s up”? The other replies “It’s just the clowns from OLCC, no need to worry.” As they park, a clown car pulls up, right out of the circus, with OLCC emblazoned on the hood. A dozen clowns pour out of the little car. Empty bottles of Pappy Van Winkle bourbon fall out on the ground. The clowns do handstands, back flips, somersaults, card tricks and sight gags as they approach the truck. “Where you boys going with all that pot?” They sing out, laughing and honking horns. The driver, smiling, says “We’re going to California. Thanks to the lack of oversight by the OLCC, there’s too much pot in Oregon, so we’re going to sell it down there.” The clowns gather in a huddle. After a long minute or two they look up at the driver and with big smiley faces they all sing out “It’s OK, not a problem, have a nice day.” The final shot is the semi, loaded with cannabis, crossing into California."
minnpost_2024_3,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.If pride in honor mattered, Donald Trump would not be a candidate for president of the United States. In Minnesota, Sen. Nicole Mitchell would resign from office. If pride and honor mattered, both of the supporters of Trump and Mitchell would demand the same of both of them.Character matters, or at least it should. We should expect at least the same standard of conduct among public officials as we would expect among the rest of us. But we should expect more. There is, or should be, a higher standard of conduct that we should expect of them than simply saying they have not been convicted of a crime.For more than 25 years, I have taught ethics and done ethics training for a variety of professions. They range from government officials, lawyers, accountants, fraud investigators and people in Fortune 500 corporations. One of the things we all agree on is that merely following the bare minimum of the codes of conduct for those professions does not make one ethical or a leader. Those who are the bottom feeders, who merely aspire not to be disbarred or have their professional licenses taken away. That is not enough to be considered ethical.It is also about pride and honor.According to Merriam Webster,prideis about self-respect and dignity. For Merriam Webster,honoris about a good name. It is about public esteem, reputation, merit and privilege to serve in office. To serve in a professional capacity is about pride and honor.And the question is, where is that pride and honor for Donald Trump, Nicole Mitchell, and their supporters? Trump faces four criminal trials and 86 charges. Yes, his supporters may argue that some of this is political retribution or that he has not been convicted of any crime. Yet, look at the New York trial where one sees a pattern of behavior no one would find acceptable, evidenced by, according to testimony, he worked with the editor of the National Enquirer to suppress stories that both of them knew were less than flattering. Trump has already been found liable for defamation and for business fraud. He has already settled disputes with other government entities regarding shady business dealings surrounding Trump University. His personal conduct of marital infidelity renders him less than a Boy Scout.Look at what he did on Jan. 6, in terms of the speech that he gave encouraging the events that led to the storming of the Capitol. Look at his call to the Georgia Secretary of State to find votes or his refusal to turn over documents housed at the Mar-a-Lago. Trump may or may not be found legally guilty, but certainly no one can claim that his behavior is ethical or that it reflects pride and honor. He should not be a candidate for president and his supporters should not encourage him.Mitchell, meanwhile, may or may not be found guilty of the charges alleged against her. But certainly no one can say that her behavior, according to police, of dressing up in black, breaking into someone’s house in the middle of the night and then admitting “she did something bad” is an example of pride and honor. As a military officer, Mitchell should know what pride and honor is, too. Her supporters and her fellow senators should ask for her to step down.The hypocrisy here is not just with Donald Trump and Nicole Mitchell. The hypocrites include those Republicans calling for Mitchell to step down if they don’t ask the same of Trump. The same is true for Democrats who are supporters of Mitchell, insisting that she should remain in office while calling Trump unfit for office.David Schultz is a distinguished professor at Hamline University.

minnpost_2024_55,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.We Americans throw out the equivalent of $165 billion of food each year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The famous economist John Kenneth Galbraith said more people die in our country of too much than of too little. Ours is a consumerist and throw-away society. Unfettered consumerism abound!It used to be that worn-out clothes were shredded and used in pillows or for insulation. When I smoked I used one lighter and its fluid throughout my smoking days. Today, smokers have disposable lighters sold in packets of five or more to throw away after their short life cycle. Disposable diapers replaced cloth or reusable diapers. We are having to deal with over-packaging and its environmental implications and ramifications. Products are packaged with multiple layers of bubble, plastic, paper and Styrofoam wrap, making it frustrating to get to the product itself.Today, landfills are bursting at the seams and incineration is becoming commonplace in our throwaway society. Manufacturing entities spent an estimated $351 billion in advertising in 2023, according to statista.com, to promote consumer extravagance, profligacy, the assignment of expiration dates to products, and unrestrained depletion of nonrenewable resources of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.All earthlings, including human beings, have become disposable. As if that is not enough, there’s a stigma associated with used clothing items and products made with recycled materials, and many people shy away from thrift stores because of the erroneous claim that they sell only used clothing and other items. Many people feel it is beneath their dignity to be seen at Goodwill, Salvation Army or Savers. Corporate mindset runs roughshod on the natural environment and treats it like a business in liquidation. The environment, of course, is air, water and soil, which are the three abiotic spheres of atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere, respectively. Both terrestrial (biomes and aquatic ecosystems have become more accessible and are under unprecedented assault enabled by pervasive technology.What many companies don’t seem perturbed about is the finiteness of the environment and its relationship with the economy. It’s imperative to note that the economy is, believe it or not, a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment. The environment is the proverbial hand that feeds the economy that we must not bite. Metaphorically, the environment is the driver and the economy is the driven or the passenger in this relationship.This corporate lack of restraint and recklessness, vis-à-vis the environment, is a primary cause of environmental degradation. On the one hand, natural resource depletion and industrial production represent action emanating from the ecosystem to the economy, which builds up economic stocks. On the other hand, environmental pollution and asset depreciation emanate from the economy to the ecosystems, which reduce economic stocks. Even though the ecosystems and the economy provide useful services for society, the effects on the environment and consequences are unsustainable, knowing as we do now, that the environment is the proverbial hand that feeds the economy.The late renowned economist Herman Edward Daly likened environmental degradation to a disease induced by neoclassical economists who see growth as interchangeable with economic, social, and political development. It is not! Be that as it may, these economists attempt to treat this sickness with unlimited wants by prescribing unlimited production. This is akin to attempting to cure a disease from treatment by increasing the treatment dosage. This behavior does not reflect a good understanding of the relationship between the environment and the economy.Regardless of the level of a country’s development, both the economy and society are tied to the environment. Our ecological and carbon footprints are taking their toll and causing unprecedented change in the global climate. Some have argued that climate change is cyclical and no different now than it was in the past. However, the intensity and severity of natural disasters are sufficient evidence to show that what is happening now has gone beyond cyclical climate change to involve climate change intensified by our technology-enabled ecological and carbon footprints or anthropogenic (human-driven activities. According, NASA, January 2024 was the warmest month on record, breaking the record set in 2016.Stronger and more destructive natural disasters, rising carbon dioxide levels, warming oceans, thawing permafrost, lakes freezing up later, winter losing its bite, spring arriving earlier, habitat change, lingering droughts, declining snowpacks, eroding coastlines, bleaching coral reefs, invading exotic species, plants flowering sooner, rising sea levels, melting glaciers — these are the effects of climate change that National Geographic described long ago as signs from earth.Anthony Akubue is a resident of St. Cloud, Minnesota."

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_51,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Feb. 8, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images/TNS Perhaps, like many other Americans, you’re finding it harder and harder to deal with high food bills. Well, don’t look to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for any sympathy.Asked recently by a Yahoo Finance reporter if she gets sticker shock at the grocery store, she twice responded with an unequivocal “no.” Even though she says she does her own food shopping “every week,” she apparently finds it quite affordable.If one even believes the dubious claim that the multi-millionaire Yellen does her own grocery shopping, the fact that she doesn’t have sticker shock only illustrates her privileged position.For many Americans today, watching a cashier scan their groceries is an anxiety-ridden experience. One can imagine Yellen in the checkout line paging through the tabloids, blissfully unaware of how much she’ll pay for food.This kind of “let-them-eat-cake” mentality from Yellen adds insult to injury because she was a key player in causing today’s stratospheric food price inflation. And while average food prices are up over 21 percent since January 2021, many common consumer staples have seen significantly larger price hikes.Cereal, chicken, and vegetables: up over 25%. Flour, bread, and butter: up over 35%. Eggs and peanut butter: up over 40%.Unable to keep up with the breakneck pace of price hikes, millions of American families have been putting their grocery purchases on credit cards, contributing to today’s $1.1 trillion of credit-card debt.What was Yellen’s role in this disaster for the American middle class? She advocated for, and then oversaw, the Treasury’s spending and borrowing spree of the last three years.When the federal government spent trillions of dollars it didn’t have, and much more than it was able to borrow, the Treasury turned to the Federal Reserve. The latter simply created money for the former to borrow.The government spent and borrowed so much money that about one-third of all the dollars in existence were created by the Fed in just the last few years to finance it all. That was like taking a sledgehammer to the dollar’s purchasing power, which reduced the value of the currency.While the magnitude of today’s spending binge is unparalleled, the inflationary effect is nothing new. When Yellen was Chair of the Fed Board of Governors, she followed the same playbook then as well.Between her time as Fed Chair and now her tenure as Treasury Secretary, few people in modern times have done more to destroy the American middle class than Yellen.Since January 2021, the typical American family’s weekly paycheck has risen about $150. Unfortunately, prices have risen so much faster over the last three and a half years that those larger paychecks buy almost $50 less.Worse, Yellen’s runaway borrowing spree has caused not only inflation to rise, but interest rates too. That has pushed up borrowing costs for families on everything from mortgages to auto loans to credit cards.Between the lost purchasing power of families’ incomes and higher interest expenses, it’s as if the typical American family lost about $7,800 in annual income, compared to January 2021.It’s bad enough that Yellen played a key role in causing this disaster, but it’s rubbing salt in the wound when she gaslights Americans and tries to convince them that unaffordable food prices are all in their heads."
philinquirer_2024_78,"Current technologies, including artificial intelligence, make it possible to integrate the work of a child welfare worker, a mental health counselor, a housing specialist, and a health worker.Mayor Cherelle L. Parker has made an early commitment to shake up Philadelphia’s strategies forreducing crimein our toughest neighborhoods andcleaning up our dirtiest. I’ve heard it called the“crime and grime” agenda, and it is to be lauded. But addressing crime and grime alone will not be enough without also overhauling how the city delivers care to its most vulnerable populations.I have served in three mayoral administrations, and I’ve witnessed the value and impact of similar overarching commitments in the past. Mayor W. Wilson Goode Sr. prioritized“clean and green” neighborhoods, making a point of removing abandoned cars andgetting help for people experiencing homelessness. Mayor Ed Rendell revitalized Center City andeliminated a quarter-billion-dollar deficit. Mayor John Street sought to revitalize neighborhoods through theNeighborhood Transformation Initiativeand protect Philadelphia’s children through theChildren’s Investment Strategy.Parker’s agenda is perhaps the most ambitious of these initiatives. Reducing violent crime, especially among our youngest Philadelphians, is a tall order; Kensington’s drug culture has resisted many well-intentioned efforts to restore the neighborhood as a safe and healthy place to live. But most Philadelphians are holding their breath, hoping against hope that this time will be the charm.But to Philadelphia’s struggling children and families seeking help from the city’s beleaguered health and human services systems, fighting “crime and grime” will not be enough. Thousands of Philadelphia’s most vulnerable are stymied by convoluted and often insensitive city bureaucracies that, well-intentioned as they are, fail to provide efficient, effective help — not because they don’t try, but because of ancient technology and lack of coordination.Fixing how we “do” health and social services in city government can go a long way in reducing costly pain and suffering and, not incidentally, combating “crime and grime.”Call it the “care” agenda.Philadelphia’s major “care” systems — behavioral health, child welfare, homeless services, and public health — often get a pass when it comes to the great budget and policy debates in City Hall because they are overwhelmingly funded not by city tax dollars, but by state and federal governments. In my 40 years of interacting with city governments, mayors, managing directors, commissioners, and City Council members, all seem to believe that because those budgets are not paid for by city tax dollars, there’s little the city can do to mold and manage those dollars with the same aplomb as they do police, theDepartment of Licenses and Inspections, andcommerce.That’s a significant mistake. Why? Because the solutions to our most intractable health and social challenges can be found in that money. And, by my calculations, it comes toover $3 billion every year.Certainly, those billions come with strings attached, and there are lots of federal and state regulations and policies that must be honored in spending them. But time and time again, smaller initiatives being creative in how they use those billions have been proven to be more effective in helping people solve their problems.Parker is at the beginning of what many of us hope will be an eight-year mayoral tenure. That’s plenty of time to step back and take a look at the billion-dollar bureaucracies that today make it hard to get the help you need. She should make them more efficient and focused, less complex for regular people and for those trying to help them.For instance, at the Department of Human Services, those who used to be called “social workers” are now “human services program managers,” judging by a search of the city’spersonnel page. That’s because we’ve made access to health and social services so complex, involving several siloed bureaucracies, that we need a level of services just about making referrals. This means often passing a family back and forth in administrative limbo for hours or days or weeks because we have allowed each bureaucracy to create its own independent systems that rarely talk to each other. Millions of dollars support this referral bureaucracy — dollars that could otherwise be used to provide direct care to those who need it.A 20-year-old homeless Philadelphian should not need to interact with two or three or five bureaucratic entities making referrals to each other just to get a place to sleep. A family involved with the Department of Human Services should not have to wait for the DHS worker to refer to a community case manager who then has to make a referral to the behavioral health case manager to get a therapy appointment months away. We should not be spending millions on new levels of administration that only get in the way of what people need: an integrated system that connects them with the solutions that help now.Current technologies, including artificial intelligence, make it possible to integrate the work of a child welfare worker, a mental health counselor, a housing specialist, and a health worker. Such integration would make it so the individual or family in need can interact with a coordinated service response right away,rather than the client having to navigate multiple hidebound systems that usually rely on ancient technology.Such a revolutionary change would not be easy or cheap, or perhaps even fully achievable in an eight-year mayoralty. But if we really want to be as efficient as possible with that $3 billion of our tax money that we spend on human services every year, and if we really want to make progress on our great social challenges, we need to start now and take advantage of the astounding new technologies becoming available every day.“Crime and grime” has the advantage of being an easy rhyme to remember. “Crime, grime, and care” offers solutions that previous administrations could only dream of.David Fair was a program director in the city’s Departments of Health, Human Services, and Mental Health from 1996-2005."
minnpost_2024_43,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Americans’ views on free speech change directions every so often. One of those times was during the protests at U.S. universities about the Israel-Hamas war. As scholars offree speechandpublic opinion, we set out to find out what happened and why.The Supreme Court itself, as recently as 1989, has declared that the “bedrock principle” of the First Amendment is that “the government may not prohibit the expressionof an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.”For years, conservative politicians and commentators have warned thatcollege campuses are not strong enough protectorsof free speech. But as demonstrations erupted,these same people complainedthat the protests were filled withantisemitic hate speech. Leading conservatives declared the demonstrations should be banned and halted,by forceif necessary.Liberals executed a similar reversal. Many of them have supportedincreased regulationofhate speechagainst minority groups. But during the campus protests, liberalscautioned that crackdownsby university administrators, state officials and the policeviolated protestors’ free speechrights.As researchers at Vanderbilt University’sProject on Unity and American DemocracyandThe Future of Free Speech, respectively, we sought to determine where Americans stand. We drew inspiration from apoll done in November 1939in which 3,500 Americans answered questions about free speech. In June 2024, we asked 1,000 Americans the identical questions.We found that the vast majority of Americans — both then and now — agree that democracy requires freedom of speech. That’s in the abstract.When the questions get more concrete, though, their support wanes.Only about half of the respondents in both the 1939 and 2024 polls agreed that anybody in America should be allowed to speak on any subject at any time. The rest believed some speech — or certain subjects or speakers — should be prohibited.This pattern is not unique to Americans. A 2021 survey in 33 countries byThe Future of Free Speech, a nonpartisan think tank based at Vanderbilt, similarly foundhigh levels of support for free speech in the abstractacross all countries but lower support across the board for specific speech that was offensive to minority groups or religious beliefs.We dug deeper in surveys in March and June 2024, asking which subjects or speakers should be banned. We thought the public’s appetite for free speech might have weakened amid the campus turmoil. We found the opposite.When asked whether seven people with widely varied viewpoints should be allowed to speak, the share of people who said “Yes” rose for each one between March and June. Some of the differences were within the surveys’ margins of error, but it’s nevertheless noteworthy that all of them shifted in the same direction.While showing a slightly increased appetite for free speech, these polls still fit with the overall contradiction: Large majorities of Americans passionately uphold free speech as a cornerstone of democracy. But fewer of them are supportive of free speech when faced with specific controversial speakers or topics.Our surveys found that the public has a nuanced view of free speech. For instance, in our June 2024 survey we added some additional categories of potential speakers to the list we had asked about in March. More respondents werecomfortable with a pro-Palestinian speakerthan a leader of Hamas and with a scientist who believes that IQ varies by race rather than an outright white supremacist.This pattern suggests that the public distinguishes between extreme and more moderate positions and is less tolerant of the rights of those with more extreme views.This shift runs against the purpose of the First Amendment, which wasintended to protect unpopular speech. The amendment very specifically was not intended to apply only to certain speakers or viewpoints.Ours is not the only survey to find that many people don’t fully appreciate the logic and principles behind free speech.In 2020, a Knight Foundation poll found that members of both political partiesoppose speech that goes against their values or beliefs.Later polls, including those conducted by other organizations, found more specifics: For instance, Democrats weremore likely to support censorshipof racist hate speech or vaccine misinformation.And Republicans opposeddrag showsandkneeling during the playing of the national anthem.A February 2022 national poll commissioned by The New York Times and Siena College found that 30% of Americans believed that “sometimes you have to shut down speechthat is anti-democratic, bigoted, or simply untrue.”With the 2024 election looming andpolarization increasingamong Americans, some people may want only those who agree with them to be allowed to speak.But atrue commitment to the fundamental principles of free speechrequires people to allow space for controversial and even offensive viewpoints to be aired.History reveals thatcensorship of hateful ideasis oftena cure that is worse than the disease, deepening social divides. James Madison, a key drafter of both the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment, wrote in 1800:“Some degree of abuse is inseparablefrom the proper use of every thing … it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches, to their luxuriant growth, than by pruning them away, to injure the vigor of those yielding the proper fruits.”As the founders knew, a respect for diverse viewpoints and the ability to express those views — good, bad and harmful alike — in the public sphere are essential to a healthy democracy.John G.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_189,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|78.62°Acting Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan held Donald Trump in contempt for his violations of a gag order in his criminal hush money case. The penalty? A paltry $9,000. Nonetheless, the judge cautioned the former president that continued violations might result in “incarceratory punishment,” just as they might for any other defendant. We hope he’s not bluffing.The idea that slapping the cuffs on would somehow help Trump, electorally and with his efforts to delegitimize the process that is attempting to at long last hold him accountable, is bunk. Whatever happens, Trump will claim he’s being politically persecuted, that this trial is an infringement not only on his rights but on the country’s own free elections, interfering as it is with one of the major-party candidates.Setting aside the inanity of planting that flag in the ground while simultaneously under well-evidenced indictment for multiple efforts to reverse the 2020 election, let’s think through the implications that flow from that idea.If the existing mechanisms of accountability cannot constrain the former president, then we are saying, in effect, that he cannot be held accountable. We know exactly what Trump plans to do with this immunity; in a recent series of interviews with Time, Trump and his closest allies describe in detail schemes to finally vanquish American democracy, unconstrained by the institutional guardrails that barely held last time around.The president and his ready sycophants would deploy the military in American cities, jail political opponents (without basis, something that cannot in any reasonable way be said about Trump , bend subsequent elections to his will, disengage from international allies, crack down on speech and generally follow the authoritarian playbook. None of that rests on wild speculation or projection — these are plain as day plans, as readily laid out by Trump himself.When things get to that stage, the option of actually holding him accountable begins to disappear altogether. Let us repeat: consequences need to come now, because there might not be a later.Trump certainly hopes to use the powers of the presidency to shield himself from accountability, perhaps forever. Yet simply taking the opposite stance, showing that he’s not untouchable and that he can be brought to justice, might go a long way towards puncturing the Trump phenomenon, which has always been more artifice than anything.Trump has, for all the bluster, never held majority support in the United States. Some subset of his hard-core fans will never abandon him, but for many, it is the sense that he can stick it to the authorities, that despite the setbacks he’ll sidestep and eventually subjugate the system, that holds appeal. If Trump can tell judges and prosecutors to go to hell and laugh at their rules, he’s doing what I wish I could, the thinking goes.If the veneer starts cracking — if his flimsy attempt at a civil bond surety fails and his buildings start to be seized, if his goading of Merchan results in real, significant consequences — then the magic will quickly dissipate. The man will be left standing with all he has ever had: his narcissism, his entitlement and his steadfast conviction that people will give him what he wants.

eugeneweekly_2024_26,"We ve got issues. I am the teacher who filed the formal complaint of sexual harassment against Superintendent Andy Dey on Feb. 24 for kissing me on the cheek without my consent. While this may have played a role in persuading the Eugene District 4J School Board to part ways with him, I am in no way taking credit for the board’s decision. My complaint was just one of several allegations against Dey, and the board may well have reached the same decision without my complaint. But since I am in a position to speak out when others who have filed complaints may not be able to, I want to share my story. Word about my complaint has spread quickly, and I would much rather tell my full story openly than have it continue to be gossiped about. As an educator, I work hard to set a good example for my students. I love my job and I genuinely enjoy working with teenagers. I find them hilarious, creative and caring, and they fill me with hope for the future. However, one difficult thing about teaching teenagers is knowing the many dangers they will face as they make their way in the world. In this country, approximately 25 percent of women will be sexually assaulted. It kills me to think that one in four of the amazing young women I teach will have to go through that. Local journalism delivered directly via email each Thursday. It needs to change, and change starts with holding people accountable any time they violate boundaries. To be clear, I do not consider what Dey did to me to be sexual assault. But combating the pervasiveness of sexual assault doesn’t just involve prosecuting rapists. It involves changing the cultural expectation that men are entitled to touch women’s bodies. By filing this complaint, I am setting an example for my students that when someone touches you in an unwelcome way without your consent, you hold them accountable. It may be the most important thing I ever teach them. I teach science at South Eugene High School, where I have worked for the past 16 years. During the time Dey was principal of South, our relationship could best be described as adversarial. In my career, I have worked with five principals and a dozen vice principals and have gotten along fine with all of them, except for Dey. I found him to be extremely dismissive of my input as a professional. If I questioned any of his decisions, he reacted aggressively. Nearly every interaction I had with him was excruciatingly unpleasant for me. When Dey became the 4J director of secondary education, I decided to adopt a policy of minimal contact with him for my own mental health. I refused to make any contact with him, even by email, unless it was absolutely necessary for my job. I continued this policy once he became superintendent. I was content to keep this détente right until the moment he walked up and kissed me. It happened at the Celebrate South event, which is put on by the Friends of South organization as a fundraiser for the school. I was talking to a friend, when Dey walked up and greeted her by hugging her and kissing her on the cheek. She and Dey are friends outside of work, so I found this a bit surprising, but not inexplicable. However, Dey then turned to me and greeted me the same way. He did not ask for my consent. I tried to tell him to stop, but the words would not come out. I felt his arm reach around my back and his lips touch the side of my head, along with a loud “mwah” in my ear. I was so shocked that I froze completely and could not move or talk for several moments. Once I regained control of my body, I quickly walked away. I ran into another teacher I work with, and I explained what had just happened. He reassured me that Dey’s behavior was inappropriate and I was right to be upset. I decided I needed to say something to Dey, since I had been unable to speak during the incident. I found him in the reception hall and told him to never kiss me again. He apologized and said that kissing on the cheek was common in his family. Which is fine, but I am not a member of his family nor his friend. I am his employee, and kissing an employee is wildly inappropriate. I don’t believe that Dey necessarily had ill intent when he kissed me. But, as I have been taught at 4J professional development trainings, it is not intent, but impact that matters. And, for a number of reasons, this event was extremely impactful for me. First off, given our history I would not consent to even shaking Dey’s hand, much less being kissed by him. Secondly, I have a history of childhood abuse and the feeling of being frozen and unable to move my body was devastatingly familiar to me. Being forced to relive such a moment filled me with rage and panic. Finally, I have spent the past five years putting up firm boundaries with Dey and working to minimize contact. He demolished those boundaries and forced me into a position where I would have to talk about and think about him almost constantly during the investigation. While he may have had no ill intent, the negative impacts of his actions will continue to reverberate throughout my life for some time. I am grateful to the 4J school board for holding Dey accountable by not renewing his contract. I am even more grateful to the other women who had the courage to file complaints against Dey before I filed mine. Sadly, it often seems that women are not believed until there is a critical mass making similar allegations. I do wish that before Dey was hired the school board had believed the numerous people who sent letters describing Dey as a bully, as this whole situation could have been avoided. I hope that the board learns from this experience and uses it to make better hiring decisions in the future."

The county and state should blacklist the developer from engaging in more harmful businesses at the expense of innocent bystanders.At the minimum, it is the responsibility for a developer to engage a competent surveyor to figure out the correct lot before building.

leoweekly_2024_20,"Isn’t it funny that when Republicans can’t get their way through honest means, they resort to shenanigans in order finagle their agendas. You know, the agendas they accuse everyone else of having.With the recent passage of HB 388, a bill that would, in part, strip party affiliation from Louisville Metro government races, Republicans are looking for a way to get their grimy toes in the door on Louisville’s government because of course, they can’t win on their ideas.The idea that they can hide their party affiliation and gain control in Louisville is an idea that has fueled the histrionic, hairy-palmed, circle jerks of Republicans for years. It’s almost like they believe the public won’t see through their rhetoric to the red “R” emblazoned on their too-tight neckties.In the bill, that upon first read seems like an adjustment to taxation and emergency dispatch, there is text that alludes for the bill to “...create a new section of KRS Chapter 65 to provide that members of local boards, commission, committees, and other bodies created by or appointed by local governments have geographic and political party affiliation diversity…”I can’t even with their attempt to use the word diversity when they have been puking all over themselves about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI and how terrible it is for everyone but herein lies the golden nugget of their deceit. They don’t want diversity — not when it means Black and brown people might be elected or that citizens might like the fair person better. Nope, they want “diversity” that leans towards them and their cronies.It’s such a cheap and flimsy shot to move the goalposts to help them do better in a city that just doesn’t fucking want them.How much clearer can Louisvillians be that Republicans can take long walks off short piers?It isn’t that people just don’t want them, it is that their ideas are rehashed and rebranded versions of the same old discriminatory, sexist and racist shit. We’ve seen it and heard it so many times, but I have to give it to them, these bastards are persistent.Louisville… and Kentucky, I want y’all to take in a short Bible verse. I’m not religious but so many of you are that I’m just not understanding how you continue to allow these folks to “dwell” in the House and Senate, within the state and beyond.Psalms 101:7 reads, “No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes.”Yet, these people lie, deceive, discriminate and spread hatred, many times hiding under the guise of the book you rely on for faith and guidance. I think a mass eviction in your houses is due, Kentucky.LikeDaniel Cameron, I want to say hard pass to HB 388, and hard pass to any further interference in how people in the state of Kentucky and the city of Louisville get to choose their leaders.We don’t have to agree on politics but we should certainly agree on bullshit and know when we’re getting served a giant plate of it. HB 388 and all the other recent legislative tricks in the Republican-led legislature are big fat servings of shit. In no way do these bills — check our legislative update in our News section — improve any quality of life for Kentuckians. What they do is further an agenda by people who really want Kentucky to live in an Orwellian nightmare, controlled by men who can’t protect their hairlines much less the people they are elected to serve.Why?Because they only care about the lobbyists who write and send the bills to them along with perks and checks. Just to be sure, you didn’t think they really wrote all this shit themselves, did you? This mess is basically a copy and paste from all their special interests. Just check similar bills in other states. Same shit, different demons.HB 388 has yet to receive any action from Gov. Beshear as of this writing; but I can tell you the people of Louisville want Republicans to keep the name of our city out of their filthy mouths and their meat paws off our local government. Keep finagling around with Louisville, and you will find out why you don’t want to mess with this city.A post shared by Trouble Bar (@troublebarlou ( ."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_166,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°The central struggle in the world right now is between liberalism and authoritarianism. It’s between those of us who believe in democratic values and those who don’t — whether they are pseudo-authoritarian populists like Donald Trump, Viktor Orban, Narendra Modi or Recep Tayyip Erdogan or straight-up dictators like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping or theocratic fascists like the men who run Iran and Hamas.In this contest, we liberals should be wiping the floor with those guys! But we’re not. Trump is leading in the swing states. Modi seems to be on the verge of reelection. Russia and Iran are showing signs of strength.Over the last two centuries, liberalism has evolved into a system that respects human dignity and celebrates individual choice. Democratic liberalism says we don’t judge how you want to define the purpose of your life; we just hope to build fair systems of cooperation so you can freely pursue whatever goals you individually choose. Liberalism tends to be agnostic about the purposes of life and focused on processes and means: rule of law, the separation of powers, free speech, judicial review, free elections and the rules-based international order.In his stirring and clarifying new book, “Liberalism as a Way of Life,” Alexandre Lefebvre argues that liberalism isn’t merely a set of neutral rules that allow diverse people to live together; liberalism, he writes, has also become a moral ethos, a guiding philosophy of life. As other moral systems, like religion, have withered in many people’s lives, liberalism itself has expanded to fill the hole in people’s souls.Liberals honor individuals’ right to see themselves with self-respect; racial slurs have become our form of blasphemy because they assault this sense of self-respect. Liberal morality tends to be horizontal: Pure liberals don’t look upward to serve a living God; they look sideways and try to be kind and decent to their fellow humans.Pure liberals place a high value on individual consent; any kind of sex or family arrangement is OK so long as everybody agrees to it. At one point, Lefebvre has a nice little riff on all the traits that make us liberals pleasant to be around. We respect autonomy and personal space, dislike hypocrisy and snobbery, and strive to achieve a live-and-let-live tolerance.But I confess that I finished the book not only with a greater appreciation of liberalism’s strengths but also more aware of why so many people around the world reject liberalism, and why authoritarianism is on the march.Liberal societies can seem a little tepid and uninspiring. Liberalism tends to be nonmetaphysical; it avoids the big questions like: Why are we here? Who made the cosmos? It nurtures the gentle bourgeois virtues like kindness and decency but not, as Lefebvre allows, some of the loftier virtues, like bravery, loyalty, piety and self-sacrificial love.Liberal society can be a little lonely. By putting so much emphasis on individual choice, pure liberalism attenuates social bonds. In a purely liberal ethos, an invisible question lurks behind every relationship: Is this person good for me? Every social connection becomes temporary and contingent. Even your attitude toward yourself can be instrumentalized: I am a resource I invest in for desired outcomes.When societies become liberal all the way down, they neglect a core truth: For liberal societies to prosper, they need to rest on institutions that precede individual choice — families, faiths, attachments to a sacred place. People are not formed by institutions to which they are lightly attached. Their souls and personalities are formed within the primal bonds tothisspecific family,thatspecific ethnic culture,thispiece of land with its long history to my people, tothatspecific obedience to the God of my ancestors.These life-altering attachments are usually not individually chosen. They are usually woven, from birth, into the fabric of people’s being — into their traditions, cultures and sense of personhood.The great Rabbi Jonathan Sacks explained the difference between the sort of contracts that flourish in the world of individual choice and covenants that flourish best in those realms that are deeper than individual utility: “A contract is about interests. A covenant is about identity. It is about you and me coming together to form an ‘us.’ That is why contracts benefit, but covenants transform.”The great strength of the authoritarians who oppose liberal principles, from Trump to Xi to Hamas, is that they play straight into the primordial sources of meaning that are deeper than individual preference: faith, family, soil and flag. The authoritarians tell their audiences that the liberals want to take all that is solid — from your morality to your gender — and reduce it to the instability of a personal whim. They tell their throngs that the liberals are threatening their vestigial loyalties. They continue: We need to break the rules in order to defend these sacred bonds. We need a strongman to defend us from social and moral chaos.These have proved to be powerful arguments. One recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 52% of Republicans believe that America needs “a strong president who should be allowed to rule without too much interference from courts and Congress.”We could be living in a year in which authoritarians take or keep power in nations across Europe, Latin America and in the U.S. while Putin continues to make advances in Ukraine and Hamas survives the war in the Gaza Strip. In short, the authoritarians still have the momentum on their side.Worse, liberalism has prompted a counterreaction in our societies. Many people find themselves spiritually unfulfilled; they feel naked, embattled and alone. So they grasp at politics to fill that moral and spiritual void. They grasp at politics to give them the sense of belonging, moral meaning and existential purpose that faith, family, soil and flag provided to their ancestors. In so doing, they transform politics from a prosaic way to negotiate differences into a holy war in which my moral side is vindicated and your immoral side is destroyed. Politics begins to play a totalizing and brutalizing role in their personal lives and in our national life. They are asking more of politics than politics can deliver.If liberalism is to survive this contest, we have to celebrate liberalism while acknowledging its limits. It’s a great way to construct a fair society to help diverse people live together in peace. But liberalism cannot be the ultimate purpose in life. We need to be liberals in public but subscribe to transcendent loyalties in the depth of our being — to be Catholic, Jewish, stoic, environmentalist, Marxist or some other sacred and existential creed. People need to feel connected to a transcendent order; nice rules don’t satisfy that yearning.Liberal politicians need to find ways to defend liberal institutions while also honoring faith, family and flag and the other loyalties that define the purposes of most people’s lives. I feel that American presidents from, say, Theodore Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan knew how to speak in those terms. We need a 21st-century version of that.If liberals are merely nice and tolerant and can’t talk about the deepest and most sacred cares of the heart and soul, which seem so threatened to so many, then this is going to be an ugly election year.© 2024 The New York Times CompanyA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_218,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|76.748°On Saturday, the capitals of four democracies were strengthened when the U.S. House finally passed long-stalled foreign-aid bills. The three overseas capitals — Kyiv, Jerusalem and Taipei — were boosted by the $95 billion invested in security for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.But just as consequentially, the capital of our country, Washington, D.C., was strengthened by bipartisan legislation led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who risked his role to do the right thing. Accordingly, just as most Democratic House members had his back on the aid bills, members of both parties should reject Republican extremists who threaten to topple him for doing what the U.S. — and until recently, Republicans — have long done: be a beacon for democracies.Johnson wasn’t an early convert; he had to be convinced, particularly on the most immediate need: $60.8 billion to aid Ukraine’s fight against Russia. The speaker reportedly listened to seasoned, reasoned voices, like CIA Director William Burns, who used intelligence estimates to show Ukraine’s growing military disadvantage as well as the specter that Russian revanchism wouldn’t stop at Ukraine’s borders.“I really do believe the intel,” Johnson told reporters in Washington last week. “I think that Russian President Vladimir Putin would continue to march through Europe if he were allowed. I think he might go to the Baltics next. I think he might have a showdown with Poland or one of our NATO allies.”If so, that would draw this country into direct conflict with Russia. Which is why NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg was right to tell the “PBS NewsHour” after the vote that the aid “is not charity. Military support for Ukraine is an investment in our own security, and is an investment in U.S. security.”Fortunately, every Democrat who voted on Saturday agreed. Unfortunately, 112 of 214 Republican representatives voted “no”. All came of political age in an era of Republican reverence for Reagan-era resolve against Soviet expansionism. But when it came to Russia’s invasion against a sovereign nation, their votes aligned more with Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former QAnon conspiracy theorist and current Georgia Republican representative who’s leading the effort to force out Johnson.Many GOP opponents of aid to Ukraine may cite the failure to pass a major bill on border security. But the bipartisan landmark legislation to do just that, which was crafted by a Republican senator, Oklahoma’s James Lankford, was spiked by congressional GOPers at the behest of former President Donald Trump, who is more interested in a divisive campaign issue than uniting the country by addressing one of its key challenges.Tehran, Moscow and Beijing are three capitals of authoritarian nations that were weakened by Saturday’s vote. And while approving aid in no way guarantees victory or even protection for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, failure to pass these aid bills would have sent a signal far beyond any of these capitals. Including in Washington, where House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on Saturday “House Democrats have risen to the occasion, President Joe Biden has risen to the occasion, traditional conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson have risen to the occasion.”For his part, Johnson said, accurately, “I think we did our work here, and I think history will judge it well.”— Star Tribune/TNSA 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.NEW YORK — Lou Piniella was back in uniform Saturday, wearing pinstripes and the number 14 for Old-Timers’ Day at Yankee Stadium.

minnpost_2024_168,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Nearly everyone applauds the concept of diversity within the judiciary as a means of instilling different life experiences and viewpoints into the judicial decision-making process. In doing so, they usually reference diversification in gender and related characteristics as well as race and ethnicity.The two appointments to the state Supreme Court announced the other day by Gov. Tim Walz — appellate court judge Theodora Gaitas and Stearns County Chief District Court Judge Sarah Hennesy — check off the gender box. This summer, when they replace retiring jurists Margaret Chutich and G. Barry Anderson — the only remaining Republican appointee — the pair will create the first majority women composition of that seven-member tribunal in 30 years.That’s nothing new for the governor’s appointments to the various trial, specialty tax court and appellate tribunals, aided by Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. They have exceeded 60% women among the approximately 50 chosen in the past five-plus years of his administration. Although the two latest appointees are both white, overall his gubernatorial selections — for which he has unilateral authority — also have been characterized by noteworthy diversity in racial/ethnic characteristics and sexual orientation.But other often-overlooked forms of diversity are reflected in his appointments, as well.One of them is geography, a feature that has largely resulted in current or prospective state Supreme Court jurists coming from the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The governor made a deliberate and an explicit undertaking to address that shortcoming in his first appointment to the high court in choosing Gordon Moore, a lawyer and jurist from Worthington, to replace the highly-regarded David Lillehaug, who stepped down in 2020.The appointment of Judge Hennesy from the St. Cloud area gives additional voice to portions of the state outside of the I-694 Beltway.Additionally, many of the Walz appointees, including his latest pair, have come from different career paths than those that have traditionally characterized much of the state court judiciary, such as prosecutorial backgrounds. Both incoming justices, Gaitas and Hennesy, have worked as public defenders, the latter in a legal aid position, representing indigents in legal matters. These experiences give them a perspective different from many of those with a prosecutorial bent, one rarely present on the state’s highest court.This is not to say that those with experience as criminal prosecutors, as at least three of the current jurists have, are unwelcome on the bench, but simply a recognition that other voices warrant representation, too.Incidentally, the mosaic of Walz appointees parallels that of President Joe Biden, whose nearly 200 federal judicial appointments have brought greater gender and race/ethnic diversity to the courts and also consist of more people drawn from the ranks of lawyers with experience representing the financially needy or destitute people in criminal and civil proceedings.The Walz appointments, however, have not satisfied all of the diversity markers.While the faith affiliations of his appointments have not generally been disclosed — nor ought they be — earlier this year he elevated his own general counsel, Karl Procaccini, to the Supreme Court as the first Muslim on that bench. His appointment of Jewish judges, however, has been rare and perhaps overdue, as there has only been one on that court, David Stras, an appointee of former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty. He served for nearly eight years before elevation to the federal Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.The onset this week of the Jewish holiday of Passover might have been an opportune time for the governor to make a second such appointment.In addition to that dearth of Jewish judges, the governor, sadly, missed another opportunity at diversity by adding a Republican or conservative-leaning individual to replace the two leaving the state’s highest tribunal. His two appointees seem to be progressive-oriented — not a fault, but a solidification of that ideology among all of the other justices on that tribunal.While partisanship should not be a consideration in the appointment process, or in how judicial rulings are made, the reality is that it or its kin — ideology — is often taken into account in appointing jurists and, for that matter, how they approach issues and decide cases.With the upcoming retirement of Justice Anderson, the sole GOP appointee still on the bench, the seven-member tribunal will consist wholly of Democratic appointees — four by Walz and three by his DFL predecessor, former Gov. Mark Dayton.That makes for a very ideologically skewed bench that could benefit from at least one member looking at cases through a different ideological spectrum.There may be an occasion to do so two years hence. In January 2027, the current chief justice, Natalie Hudson, the only Black member of the tribunal — elevated to that spot as an associate jurist by the governor last year — will reach the mandatory retirement age of 70, although she might step down earlier.That will occur just after an election when the governor, if he stands for re-election, or another DFLer in his stead might want to reach across the aisle to appoint a Republican-orientated replacement to appeal to more conservatives eager to have one of their ilk adjudicating appeals.Marshall H.

suffolknewsherald_2024_82,"Published 4:29 pm Tuesday, February 6, 2024ByStaff ReportsLet’s enjoy every moment of our precious, borrowed life here on earth, for we have only one life to live. In our life, there’s no replay or turning back. Without reservation, let’s live our lives to the fullest, to the best we can now, this present moment.A question to ponder: How sure are we that when we go to bed tonight, we will wake up in the morning? We don’t know. Nobody knows. We can only hope and pray that we will wake up in the morning alive and well, like the rest of God’s creation.Another question: When was the last time you visited your folks or relatives, Mom, Dad, Aunt, Uncle, brother, or sister, especially when they’re far away, in another state or country? Did you feel anxious, excited, happy, nostalgic? Do you always look forward to seeing them again next time?Life is fragile. We all know that. It’s unpredictable, too.What’s my point? Let’s try to live our lives the best we can. Let’s enjoy life in the present moment now while we can. Let’s do what we can or are supposed to do now and not later on. As Benjamin Franklin once said, “Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.”In this connection, I’ve taken the initiative, risk, and opportunity while still alive and well to connect and reconnect with my relatives thousands of miles away. I was out of state for five days to see my relatives on the West Coast, specifically, my elderly Aunt, who has been over the hill or past her prime. I would have loved to visit her, my sisters, and their families during the holidays, but airfare was exorbitantly high due to the peak season for travelers. So I waited for a couple of weeks.After the holidays, my wife, a retired high school chemistry teacher, and I went out of state to visit my 98-year-old Aunt in a senior living facility where she pays about $9,000 a month. She has lived in the United States for more than seven decades. The only living person on my Dad’s side, she outlived her husband and her only adult son, my cousin.Aunt Miliang was alert, though in a wheelchair when we saw her in her assisted-living flat or apartment after selling her 3-story house (in San Francisco , where she had lived for the past 70-75 years. She appeared sane and didn’t seem to have Alzheimer’s disease yet. But she’s kind of weak and tired. After our lively conversation, she indicated to us she wanted to go to her bed. While in bed, we continued talking, although she seemed tired and felt like she needed to rest or nap.Before we left Aunt Miliang’s apartment to visit or pay respects to my grandpa (my Dad’s dad and cousin in a cemetery, which is about a 25-30 30-minute drive from her apartment, I encouraged Aunt to get better so she could visit us here in Virginia. I told her to take it easy and live her life to the fullest, and I promised her that when she turns a centenarian, we’ll visit her again. She smiled and nodded affirmatively. I prayed for her quietly, asking God’s grace and mercy.As we get older, there is that tendency for us, the elderly especially, to think of our inevitable mortality. Such a thought is a reality we all must face. But, in the meantime, let’s do our best to live and enjoy life the best we can amidst our health issues and concerns.Let’s find time to visit our dear loved ones, whether near or far, while we and they are still living, trying to enjoy life, struggling or surviving. If there’s a will, there’s a way to go see them, and money is not everything important on earth but our relationships with our family, folks, and friends.Ezequiel Tovar and the Colorado Rockies take the field on Sunday at Coors Field against Cole Irvin, who…Today’s MLB schedule should have plenty of excitement on the field.

minnpost_2024_14,"From local coverage to the presidential race, .Cityscape| Twin Cities urban geographer Bill Lindeke weighs in on city life, transportation, planning and more in his column delivered to your inbox weekly.Our state legislators didn’t waste any time when they got together for a brand-new session in January 2023. The Democratic Party’s majority in the House and in the Senate moved swiftly to pass bills that had been stalled during the previous four years while the Republicans had a majority in the Senate.We’re on a roll in Minnesota where the Democrats are celebrating their “trifecta” — controlling the House, the Senate and the Governor’s office. There have been more than 10,000 bills introduced by our legislators during the current biennium — more than 5,500 this year alone.The Republicans haven’t been sitting on their hands, either. Many of those bills come from their side of the aisle. The Revisor’s Office is swamped, weeks behind putting preliminary drafts into formal language that most likely will never have a hearing.Governing has become more complicated over the years, but our habits haven’t changed. Politics is a partisan business with decisions on almost every issue made in the majority party’s caucus — a private meeting of members, out of public sight. Should a bill get to the floor for a vote, there will be no surprises. Caucus discipline holds tight.“Keeping the team together,” always with an eye on the next election, is a political routine. At the end of each legislative session, the majority party will tell us that they’ve acted in the interest of the people and produced the results expected of them. The minority will be critical, point to an overreach of authority, decry new spending and object to policies that ignore tradition and accepted practice.We’re missing the point.Instead of rushing to introduce thousands of bills, legislators could better prepare for their work by spending time at the beginning of each session doing something more important: listening!It’s not a new idea.The old Chautauqua Movement could teach our legislators a lesson. The Chautauqua began in the 1870s and remained popular across the country into the 1930s. They were a kind of tent meeting that moved from place to place across the country, where ideas and entertainment were the attractions. The audience listened to authors, professors and preachers, performers, politicians and others, eager to learn and be entertained. Teddy Roosevelt called it “the most American thing in America.”State legislators could begin each session with a Legislative Chautauqua, a couple of weeks listening to scientists, business owners and union members, economists, scientists and humanists, educators and novelists and each other — away from their familiar seats in the chamber. No votes, just talking about how to serve their constituents, about working together to protect, enhance and sustain the well-being of their state — and how all of those things fit together.Put the discussion on TV, radio and online. Viewers and readers could talk about the ideas in classrooms, book clubs, barbershops, church study groups, break rooms, union halls, wherever. A little civic nourishment without the theater of overproduced presidential debates or the rehearsed sound bites on the evening news would be nothing but good for us.A Legislative Chautauqua could help legislators agree on an agenda — the compelling choices before them — anticipating problems, enhancing our lives, protecting the natural world and respecting the breadth of relationships that sustain our state and region. Where are our deepest differences and how might agreement be found?There will be some who object to the proposal as a waste of time, ridicule reference to the habit of listening to each other and call the suggestion naive. That’s fine if you accept there’s nothing more to learn than what you already know, that hearing ideas different from your own is of little value, or that you already know how you’re going to vote on every issue.But that’s not the best we can do.Let’s bring a Legislative Chautauqua to the Capitol and see where it might take us. The common experience of listening and talking together for a couple of weeks could blur the boundaries of Red and Blue, reveal the complexities of overriding issues — generational poverty, environmental stewardship, our economic relationships and our civic life — and the ways in which they fit together.A new politics of listening — challenging one’s own assumptions, hearing the reasons behind another’s convictions — can become a habit of legislation. Acknowledging that public problem solving is an opportunity to ask questions without intimidation; searching for answers as a team rather than besmirching another member’s intentions would lead to better law-making.The majority of a state House or Senate may slide from one side of the chamber to the other after any election. If our current habit of separating Our Side from Theirs continues, our constituents will be marginalized by the political interests of their elected representatives.Teddy Roosevelt’s “most American thing in America” — an honest, respectful and enlightening exchange among those who govern our states — is, these days, a politics less traveled. Those elected to public office could make it happen. The rest of us would benefit.Steve Sandell, of Woodbury, served in the Minnesota House from 2019-2023."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_131,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|77.855°I once heard Jimmy Carter say that in a war there are no human rights. With the fighting in Ukraine and in Gaza front and center, that observation seems more profound than ever. Human rights as an issue may be on life support.There are so few great examples of progress to look to. Maybe just one — Northern Ireland, finally.In addition to major war zones, human rights are being trampled in so many places that it requires an effort to keep up with the havoc. Old alliances are cracking if not broken. Displaced people clamor for shelter and safety. The number of deaths is enormous, the disruption epic.The Council on Foreign Relations maintains a conflict tracker— its orange markers dot the globe. Wikipedia maps an even broader set of armed conflicts. Hostile actions are killing folks in Sudan and western New Guinea, Haiti is near collapse, criminal violence pervades Mexico, thousands die in Syria year by year.Some of the violence is especially barbaric, as at the music festival in Israel on Oct. 7. Hostages are held for long periods of time in Russia, China, Egypt and now Gaza. Nearly a million Palestinians are fleeing any which way, seeking safety from the promised invasion of Rafah.The consequences are obvious but hard to fathom. The old and the very young die first. Famine follows war; disease follows famine, and young adults and the middle-aged die too. Women are especially vulnerable to sexual violence, with effects that can last for a lifetime. Scores are left homeless.Decency and sanity demand that we address these catastrophes, however massive and intransigent.We can start by reminding ourselves about the goal. Reread the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, written under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt. It remains a clear call for how the world should treat its people. Or look to Pope Francis’ “ Dignitas Infinita,” the Catholic Church’s call to, “without fanfare, in concrete daily life, fight and personally pay the price for defending the rights of those who do not count.”But how? Support those who run toward conflict and danger, who document events, who demand accountability: volunteers and U.N. workers, journalists on the ground and peace negotiators. Groups such as Doctors without Borders, the World Kitchen, the Red Cross/Red Crescent and Amnesty International, where I once worked. (Do your homework; not every group has staying power. Find a part of the world you want to help and don’t forget that it might be next door. Talk to people you disagree with. Seek things you can agree on.Simply put, the world is shaking from violence. It needs to shake from decency. We need to regain our hope and confidence for the future.Is this foolishness, an impossibility given the metastasizing violence? I think not. Wherever you are, whatever else your responsibilities and commitments, you can vote, meet, organize, listen, donate time and money.We must get human rights out of intensive care, resurrect our commitment to it. We need it home safe to protect us all.A 64-year-old Ocean View man accused of killing one of his dogs has been freed from custody on supervised release, a form of cashless bail.Hilo High School has installed a new artificial turf football field as part of an $11-million upgrade project, which will also include a cutting-edge rubberized track.

hawaiitribune_herald_2024_6,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°Project 2025 is the staffing and policy planning organization led by the Heritage Foundation. It published “Mandate for Leadership,” a 900-page document of policy recommendations, for the next Republican administration. Project 2025’s numerous unpopular conservative policy positions, such as its proposal to ban most abortion procedures nationwide, have come under fire.As a result, former President Donald Trump and his allies have attempted to distance themselves from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. “I know nothing about Project 2025,” Trump posted on his social media website. Others, such as U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance echoed the sentiment.Despite what Trump says, it is fair to use Project 2025 as a preview for Trump’s second term. The Heritage Foundation is closer to Trump than it has been to any presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan.The think tank, which was founded in 1973, formed in opposition to Richard Nixon’s and Gerald Ford’s administrations. It was filled with conservative insurgents, upset that their allies in the Republican Party got most of their policy advice from centrist experts.Heritage quickly formed an alliance with another conservative insurgent, Ronald Reagan. During his 1980 campaign, the think tank published the first edition of “Mandate for Leadership.” It was wildly successful.It also made staffing a core part of its strategy to influence Republicans in government. Heritage credits its co-founder and former president, Edwin J. Feulner, as the originator of the phrase, “People are policy.” It maintained a Rolodex of conservative policy experts. It claims to have placed more than 200 staffers in policy positions during the Reagan administration.Heritage’s strategy was successful because parties out of power have little time to do real policy planning. Campaigns release broad policy ideas for a few salient issues, but the federal government’s policy agenda is vast. Presidents, even those more interested in the details of policy than Trump, cannot supervise the vast majority of policy work that their thousands of appointees will spend their four years on.After Reagan left the White House, Heritage remained one of the most influential conservative organizations on Capitol Hill but was often at odds with the administrations of George H.W. Bush and his son George W.That all changed when Trump was elected president. Heritage had drifted even further toward the far right under Jim DeMint’s leadership, but Trump needed allies in Washington. As I describe in my book, he appointed more people from Heritage than any other organization other than his campaign.The new alliance worked. Heritage claims that the Trump administration appointed more than 60% of the policy recommendations in the 2016 “Mandate for Leadership” in his first year, more than even the Reagan administration.Project 2025 is just the latest incarnation of Heritage’s policy planning and staffing for Republican administrations. It published its longest and most detailed set of policy recommendations in years. By incorporating dozens of far-right organizations, it expanded Heritage’s efforts to furnish a second Trump administration with staff to implement them.However, it is closer to Trump than ever before. Heritage brought in numerous top Trump administration officials to coordinate its planning, including a former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, John McEntee; former U.S. Office of Personnel Management chief of staff Paul Dans; and former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought.It is patently absurd that Trump and his allies are now trying to distance themselves from Project 2025. We should expect a second Trump administration to fulfill even more of Heritage’s policy recommendations than he did in his first term.Given that the 2024 Republican Party platform is light on details, voters should read the 2024 “Mandate for Leadership” as the best guide for what they can expect if he is elected again."
hawaiitribune_herald_2024_10,"Tuesday, Sept. 03, 2024|Today s Paper|79.142°There’s little debate that school choice programs have been booming in popularity in recent years.Since 2021, state lawmakers have created a dozen educational choice programs available to all students and established a host of other, more targeted programs. And since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, nationwide participation in private school choice programs has roughly doubled, surpassing 1 million students enrolled this school year.With such a boom in school choice programs, which are nothing new at all, rightfully comes questions of the impact they will have. Fortunately for those wishing to do their due diligence, a substantial amount of research has examined the impact of private school choice programs on eight important outcomes for students, families and communities.Most of this body of research (84% indicates that choice programs are beneficial, on average, to students who participate in them, while about 10% of studies didn’t detect any effect at all. Just 6% of the studies estimate negative effects on students.Contrary to a common concern around these programs, that they could negatively impact public school students, are the findings of nearly 30 empirical studies that examine the competitive effects of choice. Nearly all find that these programs benefit students who remain in public schools, who experience modest gains in math and reading outcomes. One recent paper published in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy shows that expanding eligibility of the Florida Tax Credit Program not only improved public school student test scores, it also reduced absenteeism and suspension rates as competitive pressure intensified.Parents are also highly satisfied with these programs. They see value in these programs, perhaps because choice realigns incentives not only for parents to get more involved in their own child’s education, but also for school administrators and teachers to respond more favorably to the needs of the children they serve.For many parents, school safety is at the top of the list of factors that they care about. Research indicates that students in choice programs experience safer learning environments. Parents are empowered to find learning environments where students experience less bullying, physical conflicts, drug-related problems and discipline issues.Per-pupil funding for choice programs, on average, is just about one-third the total per-pupil funding for public school systems. Thus, it’s not surprising that these programs accrue net fiscal benefits for state and local taxpayers over time. This indicates that even if a choice program doesn’t move the needle on a particular outcome, it still provides families with educational opportunities comparable to those offered by public schools, but at a much lower cost to taxpayers.After decades of research on education choice, it’s evident that these programs offer significant benefits that extend beyond academic achievement. As we move forward in a new era of universal choice, states that embrace choice policies will play a pivotal role in expanding educational opportunities. These policies will foster an educational landscape where parents have increased chances of finding learning environments that best suit their children’s unique needs."
